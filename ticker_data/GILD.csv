882095,GILD,"GILEAD SCIENCES, INC.",2013,"ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS The following Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (MD&A) is intended to help the reader understand our results of operations and financial condition. MD&A is provided as a supplement to, and should be read in conjunction with, our audited Consolidated Financial Statements and the accompanying notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements and other disclosures included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K (including the disclosures under “Item 1A. Risk Factors”). Our Consolidated Financial Statements have been prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles and are presented in U.S. dollars. Management Overview Gilead Sciences, Inc. (Gilead, we or us), incorporated in Delaware on June 22, 1987, is a research-based biopharmaceutical company that discovers, develops and commercializes innovative medicines in areas of unmet medical need. With each new discovery and experimental drug candidate, we seek to improve the care of patients suffering from life-threatening diseases around the world. Gilead's primary areas of focus include human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), liver diseases such as hepatitis B virus (HBV) and hepatitis C virus (HCV), serious cardiovascular and respiratory conditions and oncology/inflammation. Headquartered in Foster City, California, we have operations in North America, Europe and Asia. We continue to add to our existing portfolio of products through our internal discovery and clinical development programs and through our product acquisition and in-licensing strategy. Our product portfolio is comprised of Stribild®, Complera®/Eviplera®, Atripla®, Truvada®, Viread®, Hepsera®, Emtriva®, Letairis®, Ranexa®, AmBisome®, Cayston® and Vistide®. We have U.S. and international commercial sales operations, with marketing subsidiaries in North America, Europe and Asia. In addition, we also sell and distribute certain products through our corporate partners under royalty-paying collaborative agreements. Business HighlightsWe continue to advance our pipeline across all therapeutic areas and believe the combination of our existing internal research programs and our recent acquisitions and partnerships will allow us to continue to bring innovative therapies to individuals who are living with unmet medical needs. Below is a summary of our key accomplishments during 2012: •completed the $11.05 billion acquisition of Pharmasset, Inc. (Pharmasset), acquired the lead compound now known as sofosbuvir, a nucleotide analog being evaluated for the treatment of HCV infection and accelerated our timeline to develop the first all-oral HCV regimen as a result of the acquisition;•expanded worldwide access to Complera/Eviplera, now available in 21 countries; •expanded our research and development (R&D) pipeline with over 50 active Phase 3 clinical studies at the end of 2012;•submitted marketing applications in the United States and European Union for elvitegravir, an integrase inhibitor for the treatment of HIV-1 infection in treatment-experienced adults, and cobicistat, a pharmacoenhancing or ""boosting"" agent that increases blood levels to allow once-daily dosing of certain HIV medicines. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has set target review dates of April 2013 under the Prescription Drug User Fee Act;•obtained FDA approval for and launched Stribild, our third single tablet regimen for the treatment of HIV in the United States;•announced the acquisition of YM Biosciences (YM), which closed in February 2013, and will expand our growing oncology/inflammation pipeline; and•obtained FDA approval for once-daily oral Truvada, in combination with safer sex practices, for pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) to reduce the risk of HIV-1 infection among uninfected adults. Outlook 2013Our operating objectives for 2013 include increasing the market share of our commercial products, continuing to strengthen our pipeline with internally developed and/or externally in-licensed or purchased opportunities and strengthening our key alliances.From an R&D perspective, we will continue advancing our growing product pipeline. Our focus will be on progressing our efforts towards filing marketing applications for sofosbuvir for the treatment of HCV, developing additional innovative HIV single tablet regimens and advancing new product candidates for the treatment of oncology and inflammation diseases. As a result, we expect to move forward on a number of important late-stage clinical studies related to HIV, HCV, oncology and inflammation.53From a commercial perspective, we have a number of initiatives to promote the continued growth of our franchises. In the HIV area, the scientific support for earlier diagnosis and treatment, along with the use of single tablet regimens remains compelling both medically and practically. In anticipation of receiving regulatory approval for sofosbuvir, we will begin to build our commercial organization to support the expected launch of this product in 2014.In 2012, we launched Stribild, a single tablet regimen for the treatment of HIV in the United States. In 2013, we expect continued strong uptake of Stribild in the United States. Our marketing application for Stribild is currently being reviewed by the European Medicines Agency, and if approved, we expect to make the product available in the second quarter of 2013. In the HBV area, we will continue to support educational and promotional activities focused on Asian communities in the United States, highlighting the need to screen, diagnose and link patients to care. In the cardiovascular area, we will continue our efforts to raise awareness of Gilead in the pulmonary arterial hypertension and cardiology communities.We are mindful that conditions in the current macroeconomic environment could affect our ability to achieve our goals. Some of the factors that could affect our business include: changes to legislation that may delay or impact funding for ADAPs in the United States, a continuation or worsening of economic conditions in certain key markets, particularly in Europe, patent expirations of competitive products and the launch of generic competitors, continued government pricing pressures internationally and the potential volatility in foreign currency exchange rates. We will continue to monitor these conditions and will adjust our business processes, as appropriate, to attempt to mitigate these risks to our business.We believe the successes we experienced in 2012 have enabled us to continue to build a financially sound business model that will allow us to continue to further expand our commercial and R&D activities and to maintain quality and compliance. As we continue to grow our business, we remain focused on profitable revenue growth and prudent expense management that we believe will enable solid execution of our operating objectives for 2013.Financial Highlights During 2012, total revenues grew 16% to $9.70 billion, driven by strong underlying demand for our products. Total product sales were $9.40 billion for 2012, an increase of 16% over 2011 due primarily to growth in our antiviral franchise, which increased 15% to $8.14 billion compared to the prior year. Sales of Letairis, Ranexa and AmBisome together surpassed the $1 billion mark, reaching $1.13 billion, an increase of 20% compared to the prior year. Royalty revenues from our collaborations with corporate partners were $290.5 million, an increase of 8% compared to the prior year.R&D expenses increased 43% to $1.76 billion for 2012 as we progressed and invested in the expansion of our product pipeline. We continued investing in our Phase 3 clinical studies, particularly in liver disease and oncology. Selling, general and administrative (SG&A) expenses were $1.46 billion for 2012, an increase of $219.1 million or 18% over 2011, reflective of the ongoing growth of our business and an increase in the pharmaceutical excise tax resulting from U.S. healthcare reform.Net income for 2012 was $2.59 billion or $1.64 per diluted share, a decrease from $2.80 billion or $1.77 per diluted share in 2011, primarily due to the continued progression and investment of our product pipeline, and an increase in our effective tax rate resulting from a shift in our geographic mix of earnings, expiration of the federal research tax credit and an increase in acquisition-related expenses for which we receive no tax benefit. At December 31, 2012, cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities totaled $2.58 billion, a decrease from $9.96 billion as of December 31, 2011. In January 2012, we completed the Pharmasset acquisition which we financed with approximately $5.20 billion in cash on hand, $3.70 billion in senior unsecured notes issued in December 2011 and $2.15 billion in bank debt issued in January 2012. We generated over $3.19 billion in operating cash flows during 2012, some of which we used to repay approximately $1.84 billion in debt financing and repurchase and retire shares of our common stock for $666.9 million. 54Results of Operations Total Revenues Total revenues include product sales, royalty revenues, and contract and other revenues. Total revenues were $9.70 billion in 2012, $8.39 billion in 2011 and $7.95 billion in 2010. Increases in total revenues were driven by growth in product sales. Product Sales Total product sales were $9.40 billion in 2012, an increase of 16% over total product sales of $8.10 billion in 2011, primarily driven by continued growth in sales of antiviral products, including Atripla, Truvada and Complera/Eviplera. The increase also reflected sales growth in other products, primarily Letairis, Ranexa and AmBisome, which reached $1.13 billion in 2012 compared to $943.6 million in 2011. Total product sales increased by 10% in 2011 compared to $7.39 billion in 2010, primarily driven by the growth of Atripla and Truvada. More than 40% of our product sales are generated outside the United States and as a result, we face exposure to adverse movements in foreign currency exchange rates, primarily in Euro. We used foreign currency exchange forward contracts to hedge a percentage of our foreign currency exposure. Foreign currency exchange, net of hedges, had an unfavorable impact of $57.1 million on our 2012 revenues compared to 2011 and a favorable impact of $21.4 million on our 2011 revenues compared to 2010. Product sales in the United States increased 22% for 2012 to $5.54 billion compared to $4.55 billion in 2011, primarily driven by higher underlying demand for our antiviral products and the launch of Stribild in August 2012. Product sales in other therapeutic areas also contributed to the growth. Letairis sales totaled $410.1 million in 2012, an increase of 40% compared to 2011. Ranexa sales totaled $372.9 million in 2012, an increase of 17% compared to 2011. AmBisome sales totaled $346.6 million in 2012, an increase of 5% compared to 2011.Product sales in Europe increased 6% for 2012 to $3.14 billion compared to $2.97 billion in 2011, primarily driven by higher underlying demand in our antiviral franchise. Antiviral product sales in Europe totaled $2.87 billion in 2012, an increase of 6% compared to $2.71 billion in 2011, primarily driven by the sales of Atripla and Truvada. Foreign currency exchange, net of hedges, had an unfavorable impact of $68.9 million on our European product sales in 2012 compared to 2011. Total product sales are expected to grow in 2013, as we realize the full year impact of sales of Stribild and continued growth of Complera/Eviplera and products in our cardiovascular franchise. We believe this growth could be tempered by uncertainty around the timing of approval of the U.S. federal budget, the possibility of an automatic reduction in federal spending, or ""sequestration"" in March 2013, the unavailability or delay in AIDS Drug Assistance Programs (ADAP) funding and the challenging economic environment in Europe. Our results are also subject to continued potential volatility in foreign currency exchange rates. The following table summarizes the period over period changes in our product sales (in thousands): 2012 Change 2011 Change 2010Antiviral products: Atripla $3,574,483 11 % $3,224,518 10 % $2,926,579Truvada 3,181,110 11 % 2,875,141 8 % 2,649,908Viread 848,697 15 % 737,867 1 % 732,240Complera/Eviplera 342,200 783 % 38,747 — % —Stribild 57,536 — % — — % —Hepsera 108,315 (25)% 144,679 (28)% 200,592Emtriva 29,449 2 % 28,764 4 % 27,679Total antiviral products 8,141,790 15 % 7,049,716 8 % 6,536,998Letairis 410,054 40 % 293,426 22 % 240,279Ranexa 372,949 17 % 320,004 33 % 239,832AmBisome 346,646 5 % 330,156 8 % 305,856Other 126,932 16 % 109,057 63 % 66,956Total product sales $9,398,371 16 % $8,102,359 10 % $7,389,92155Antiviral Products Antiviral product sales increased by 15% in 2012 compared to 2011 and 8% in 2011 compared to 2010. •Atripla In 2012, Atripla sales were driven primarily by sales volume growth in the United States. In 2011, Atripla sales were driven primarily by sales volume growth in Europe and the United States. Atripla sales accounted for 44%, 46% and 45% of our total antiviral product sales for 2012, 2011 and 2010, respectively. The efavirenz component of Atripla, which has a gross margin of zero, comprised $1.34 billion, $1.21 billion and $1.07 billion of our Atripla sales in 2012, 2011 and 2010, respectively. •Truvada In 2012, Truvada sales were driven primarily by sales volume growth in the United States. In 2011, Truvada sales were driven primarily by sales volume growth in Europe and the United States. Truvada sales accounted for 39%, 41% and 41% of our total antiviral product sales for 2012, 2011 and 2010, respectively. •Complera/EvipleraIn 2012, sales of Complera/Eviplera increased primarily due to sales volume growth in the United States. Complera was approved in the United States in August 2011, and Eviplera was approved in the European Union in November 2011.•StribildStribild was approved in the United States in August 2012.Other Product Sales Other products, which include Letairis, Ranexa and AmBisome increased due primarily to sales volume growth. Since the label update in March 2011, sales of Letairis have continued to grow as a result of higher enrollments, increasing by 40% in 2012 and 22% in 2011. AmBisome product sales in the United States and Canada relate solely to our sales of AmBisome to Astellas Pharma US, Inc. which are recorded at our manufacturing cost. Royalty Revenues The following table summarizes the period over period changes in our royalty revenues (in thousands): 2012 Change 2011 Change 2010Royalty revenues $290,523 8% $268,827 (51)% $545,970Royalty revenues increased 8% for 2012 compared to 2011, driven primarily by higher royalty revenues from GlaxoSmithKline, Japan Tobacco and Astellas partially offset by lower Tamiflu royalties from Roche. Since the second quarter of 2010, Tamiflu royalties have been decreasing due to the decline in flu planning initiatives worldwide. In 2011 and 2010, our most significant source of royalty revenues was sales of Tamiflu by Roche. Royalty revenues declined 51% for 2011 compared to 2010, due primarily to lower Tamiflu royalties from Roche. Tamiflu royalties from Roche contributed $43.7 million, $75.5 million and $386.5 million to total royalty revenues in 2012, 2011 and 2010 respectively. We recognize royalties on Tamiflu sales by Roche in the quarter following the quarter in which the corresponding sales occur.Cost of Goods Sold and Product Gross MarginThe following table summarizes the period over period changes in our product sales (in thousands), cost of goods sold (in thousands) and product gross margin: 2012 Change 2011 Change 2010Total product sales $9,398,371 16% $8,102,359 10% $7,389,921Cost of goods sold $2,471,363 16% $2,124,410 14% $1,869,876Product gross margin 74% 74% 75%Our product gross margin for 2012 was consistent with our product gross margin for 2011. Our product gross margin for 2011 was 74%, a decrease of 1% compared to 2010, due primarily to an annual selling price adjustment for the percentage share of Atripla that is paid to our partner on the efavirenz component. 56Research and Development Expenses 2012 Change 2011 Change 2010Research and development $1,759,945 43% $1,229,151 15% $1,072,930We manage our R&D expenses by identifying the R&D activities we anticipate will be performed during a given period and then prioritizing efforts based on scientific data, probability of successful development, market potential, available human and capital resources and other considerations. We continually review our R&D pipeline and the status of development and, as necessary, reallocate resources among the R&D portfolio that we believe will best support the future growth of our business. R&D expenses summarized above consist primarily of clinical studies performed by contract research organizations (CROs), materials and supplies, licenses and fees, milestone payments under collaboration arrangements, personnel costs, including salaries, benefits and stock-based compensation and overhead allocations consisting of various support and facilities-related costs. The following table provides a breakout of R&D expenses by major cost type (in thousands): 2012 2011 2010Clinical studies and outside services $828,278 $570,302 $375,228Personnel expenses 686,091 412,463 384,488Facilities, IT and other costs 245,576 219,756 177,214IPR&D impairment charges — 26,630 136,000Total $1,759,945 $1,229,151 $1,072,930Compared to 2011, in 2012, clinical studies and outside services increased $258.0 million due to progression and expansion of our Phase 3 studies, particularly in liver disease and oncology, and personnel expenses increased $273.6 million due to higher headcount to support our product pipeline and study progression.Compared to 2010, in 2011, clinical studies and outside services increased $195.1 million due to study progression in liver disease and HIV, new investments in oncology and inflammation and new in-license agreements, milestones and ongoing collaborations; personnel expenses increased $28.0 million due to higher headcount; and facilities, IT and other costs increased $42.5 million to support the ongoing growth of our business. This increase was partially offset by a $109.4 million decrease in IPR&D impairment charges. During 2011, we recorded $26.6 million of impairment charges related to certain IPR&D assets acquired from CGI Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (CGI). These impairment charges were a result of changes in the anticipated market share related to the Syk compound.During 2010, we recorded $136.0 million of impairment charges related to certain IPR&D assets acquired from CV Therapeutics, Inc. The majority of the impairment charge related to our GS-9667 program, a product candidate that was in Phase 1 clinical studies for the treatment of diabetes and hypertriglyceridemia, which was terminated in the fourth quarter of 2010 due to unfavorable results from pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics tests that demonstrated limited effectiveness of the compound in patients.In 2013, we expect R&D expenses to increase over 2012 levels due to continued investment in our internal and collaborative R&D efforts and advancement of our product pipeline, driven primarily by the progression of our Phase 3 clinical studies in the liver disease and oncology areas. Selling, General and Administrative Expenses 2012 Change 2011 Change 2010Selling, general and administrative $1,461,034 18% $1,241,983 19% $1,044,392SG&A expenses relate to sales and marketing, finance, human resources, legal and other administrative activities. Expenses are primarily comprised of facilities and overhead costs; outside marketing, advertising and legal expenses and other general and administrative costs. Compared to 2011, in 2012, SG&A expenses increased $219.1 million or 18%. The increase was due primarily to a $100.5 million increase in costs associated with the growth of our business which include personnel and headcount-related expenses, a $98.0 million increase in stock-based compensation expenses primarily resulting from the acquisition of 57Pharmasset and an increase of $38.2 million in the pharmaceutical excise tax resulting from U.S. healthcare reform. This increase was partially offset by a reduction in bad debt provisions of $34.3 million, which included a gain of $29.9 million related to the sale of our accounts receivables balances in Spain in the second quarter of 2012.Compared to 2010, in 2011, SG&A expenses increased $197.6 million or 19%, due primarily to increased contract, legal and other professional services of $86.8 million, pharmaceutical excise tax of $47.3 million, increased compensation and benefits expenses of $41.6 million as a result of higher headcount to support our expanding commercial activities, promotional costs of $20.1 million driven by our expanding sales and marketing activities and bad debt provisions of $14.7 million associated with slower collections in southern European countries. In 2013, we expect SG&A expenses to increase over 2012 to support the expansion of our business including the pre-launch activities in preparation for the anticipated NDA filing of sofosbuvir in the first half of 2013 and an increase in the pharmaceutical excise tax. We also expect bad debt provisions to return to historical levels as 2012 included significant collections of past due accounts receivable in Spain and Portugal, that we do not expect to occur in 2013. Interest ExpenseCompared to 2011, in 2012, interest expense increased to $360.9 million. The increase was due primarily to the additional debt we issued in connection with our acquisition of Pharmasset, which included $3.70 billion in senior unsecured notes issued in December 2011 and $2.15 billion in bank debt issued in January 2012. Compared to 2010, in 2011, interest expense increased to $205.4 million. The increase in interest expense was due primarily to the issuance of our convertible senior notes for $2.50 billion in July 2010, the issuance of our senior unsecured notes for $1.00 billion in March 2011, and the issuance of our senior unsecured notes for $3.70 billion in December 2011. This increase was partially offset by the maturity of our convertible senior notes due in May 2011, which had an aggregate principal balance of $650.0 million.Other Income (Expense), Net For 2012, other income (expense), net was a net expense of $(37.3) million compared to income of $66.6 million and $60.3 million in 2011 and 2010, respectively. The decrease in other income (expense), net, in 2012 compared to 2011 was due primarily to decreased interest income resulting from lower cash and marketable securities balances and yields and a $40.1 million loss on Greek bonds related to Greece's restructuring of its sovereign debt in the first quarter of 2012. The increase in other income (expense), net, in 2011 compared to 2010 was driven primarily by a favorable net foreign currency exchange impact and an increase in interest income, partially offset by an increase in costs related to our hedging activities.Provision for Income Taxes Our provision for income taxes was $1.04 billion, $861.9 million and $1.02 billion in 2012, 2011 and 2010, respectively. The 2012 effective tax rate of 28.7% differed from the U.S. federal statutory rate of 35% due primarily to tax credits and certain operating earnings from non-U.S. subsidiaries that are considered indefinitely reinvested, partially offset by state taxes, the stock-based compensation expense related to the Pharmasset acquisition and contingent consideration expense related to certain acquisitions for which we receive no tax benefit. We do not provide for U.S. income taxes on undistributed earnings of our foreign operations that are intended to be indefinitely reinvested in our foreign subsidiaries. The 2011 effective tax rate of 23.6% differed from the U.S. federal statutory rate of 35% due primarily to tax credits and certain operating earnings from non-U.S. subsidiaries that are considered indefinitely reinvested, partially offset by state taxes and the non-deductible pharmaceutical excise tax.The 2010 effective tax rate of 26.2% differed from the U.S. federal statutory rate of 35% due primarily to tax credits and certain operating earnings from non-U.S. subsidiaries that are considered indefinitely reinvested, partially offset by state taxes. In January 2013, the U.S. Congress passed the American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012 which retroactively reinstated the federal research tax credit for 2012 and 2013. As a result, our income tax provision for the first quarter of 2013 will include a discrete tax benefit related to the federal research tax credit for 2012 which will reduce our effective tax rate for the quarter and to a lesser extent, the annual effective tax rate.58Acquisition of Pharmasset In January 2012, we completed the acquisition of Pharmasset, a publicly-held clinical-stage pharmaceutical company committed to discovering, developing and commercializing novel drugs to treat viral infections. Pharmasset's primary focus was the development of oral therapeutics for the treatment of HCV infection. Pharmasset's lead compound, now known as sofosbuvir (formally known as GS-7977), is a nucleotide analog which, as of January 2012, was being evaluated in Phase 2 and Phase 3 clinical studies for the treatment of HCV infection across genotypes. We believe the acquisition of Pharmasset provides us with an opportunity to complement our existing HCV portfolio and helps advance our effort to develop all-oral regimens for the treatment of HCV. We acquired all of the outstanding shares of common stock of Pharmasset for $137 per share in cash through a tender offer and subsequent merger under the terms of an agreement and plan of merger entered into in November 2011. The aggregate cash payment to acquire all of the outstanding shares of common stock was $11.05 billion. We financed the transaction with approximately $5.20 billion in cash on hand, $3.70 billion in senior unsecured notes issued in December 2011 and $2.15 billion in bank debt issued in January 2012. The Pharmasset acquisition was accounted for as a business combination. The results of operations of Pharmasset have been included in our Consolidated Statement of Income since January 13, 2012, the date on which we acquired approximately 88% of the outstanding shares of common stock of Pharmasset, cash consideration was transferred, and as a result, we obtained effective control of Pharmasset. The acquisition was completed on January 17, 2012, at which time Pharmasset became a wholly-owned subsidiary of Gilead and was integrated into our operations. As we do not track earnings results by product candidate or therapeutic area, we do not maintain separate earnings results for the acquired Pharmasset business. The following table summarizes the components of the cash paid to acquire Pharmasset (in thousands):Total consideration transferred$10,858,372Stock-based compensation expense193,937Total cash paid$11,052,309The $11.05 billion cash payment consisted of a $10.38 billion cash payment to the outstanding common stockholders as well as a $668.3 million cash payment to option holders under the Pharmasset stock option plans. The $10.38 billion cash payment to the outstanding common stockholders and $474.3 million of the cash payment to vested option holders under the Pharmasset stock option plans were accounted for as consideration transferred. The remaining $193.9 million of cash payment was accounted for as stock-based compensation expense resulting from the accelerated vesting of Pharmasset employee options immediately prior to the acquisition.The following table summarizes the acquisition date fair values of assets acquired and liabilities assumed, and the consideration transferred (in thousands):Identifiable intangible assets$10,738,000Cash and cash equivalents106,737Other assets acquired (liabilities assumed), net(43,182)Total identifiable net assets10,801,555Goodwill56,817Total consideration transferred$10,858,37259Identifiable Intangible AssetsWe acquired intangible assets, primarily comprised of the sofosbuvir in-process research and development (IPR&D) compound, which had an estimated fair value of $10.72 billion as of the date of acquisition. The fair value was determined using a probability-weighted income approach that discounts expected future cash flows to present value. The estimated net cash flows were discounted using a discount rate of 12%, which is based on the estimated weighted-average cost of capital for companies with profiles similar to that of Pharmasset. This rate is comparable to the estimated internal rate of return for the acquisition and represents the rate that market participants would use to value the intangible asset. The projected cash flows were based on key assumptions such as: estimates of revenues and operating profits related to each project considering its stage of development on the acquisition date; the time and resources needed to complete the development and approval of the product candidate; the life of the potential commercialized product and associated risks, including the inherent difficulties and uncertainties in developing a product candidate such as obtaining marketing approval from the FDA and other regulatory agencies; and risks related to the viability of and potential alternative treatments in any future target markets. Intangible assets related to IPR&D projects are considered to be indefinite-lived assets and are not amortized until the completion or abandonment of the associated R&D efforts.Goodwill The $56.8 million of goodwill represents the excess of the consideration transferred over the fair values of assets acquired and liabilities assumed and is attributable to the synergies expected from combining our R&D operations with Pharmasset's. None of the goodwill is expected to be deductible for income tax purposes.Stock-Based Compensation ExpenseThe stock-based compensation expense recognized for the accelerated vesting of employee options immediately prior to the acquisition was reported in our Consolidated Statement of Income as follows (in thousands): Year Ended December 31, 2012Research and development expense $100,149Selling, general and administrative expense 93,788Total stock-based compensation expense $193,937Other CostsOther costs incurred in connection with the acquisition include (in thousands): Year Ended December 31, 2012 2011Transaction costs (e.g. investment advisory, legal and accounting fees) $10,635 $28,461Bridge financing costs 7,333 23,817Restructuring costs 15,125 —Total other costs $33,093 $52,278The following table summarizes these costs by the line item in the Consolidated Statement of Income in which these costs were recognized (in thousands): Year Ended December 31, 2012 2011Research and development expense $7,906 $—Selling, general and administrative expense 17,854 28,461Interest expense 7,333 23,817Total other costs $33,093 $52,27860Liquidity and Capital Resources We believe that our existing capital resources, supplemented by our cash flows generated from operating activities, as well as cash flow from financing activities will be adequate to satisfy our capital needs for the foreseeable future. Our cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities decreased significantly in 2012 as we completed our acquisition of Pharmasset in January 2012. The following table summarizes our cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities, our working capital and our cash flow activities as of the end of, and for each of, the periods presented (in thousands): 2012 2011 2010As of December 31: Cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities $2,582,086 $9,963,972 $5,318,071Working capital $1,886,327 $11,403,995 $3,243,132Year Ended December 31: Cash provided by (used in): Operating activities $3,194,716 $3,639,010 $2,833,913Investing activities $(11,846,054) $3,589,845 $(1,937,751)Financing activities $563,346 $1,763,569 $(1,338,710)Cash, Cash Equivalents and Marketable Securities Cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities totaled $2.58 billion at December 31, 2012, a decrease of $7.38 billion or 74% from December 31, 2011 primarily due to our acquisition of Pharmasset for $11.05 billion in January 2012. During 2012, we generated $3.19 billion in cash flows from operations.Cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities totaled $9.96 billion at December 31, 2011, an increase of $4.65 billion or 87% from December 31, 2010. This increase was primarily attributable to the issuance of our senior unsecured notes in 2011 for total net proceeds of $4.66 billion and cash provided by operations of $3.64 billion. This increase was partially offset by $2.38 billion used to repurchase our common stock under our stock repurchase programs, $650.0 million used to repay our convertible senior notes due in May 2011 and $588.6 million used in our acquisitions of Arresto Biosciences, Inc. and Calistoga Pharmaceuticals, Inc. The $3.70 billion in net proceeds related to our senior unsecured notes issued in December 2011 and $2.15 billion in additional bank debt issued in January 2012 were used to fund our $11.05 billion acquisition of Pharmasset. Of the total cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities at December 31, 2012, approximately $1.73 billion was generated from operations in foreign jurisdictions and is intended for use in our foreign operations. We do not rely on unrepatriated earnings as a source of funds for our domestic business as we expect to have sufficient cash flow and borrowing capacity in the United States to fund our domestic operational and strategic needs. Working Capital Working capital was $1.89 billion at December 31, 2012. The decrease of $9.52 billion from working capital as of December 31, 2011 was primarily attributable to $11.05 billion in cash used for the Pharmasset acquisition and an increase in short-term debt of $1.17 billion related to the current portion of the bank debt issued to finance the Pharmasset acquisition and the current portion of our convertible senior notes due in May 2013. Working capital was $11.40 billion at December 31, 2011, an increase of $8.16 billion from working capital as of December 31, 2010. This increase was primarily attributable to an increase of $7.80 billion in cash, cash equivalents and short-term marketable securities resulting from the $3.67 billion net issuance of senior unsecured notes in December 2011 and sales of long-term marketable securities in anticipation of the acquisition of Pharmasset.Cash Provided by Operating Activities Cash provided by operating activities of $3.19 billion in 2012 primarily related to net income of $2.57 billion, adjusted for non-cash items such as $278.2 million of depreciation and amortization expenses, $208.7 million of stock-based compensation expenses, $177.1 million of net cash inflow related to changes in operating assets and liabilities and $112.6 million of tax benefits from employee stock plans.Cash provided by operating activities of $3.64 billion in 2011 primarily related to net income of $2.79 billion, adjusted for non-cash items such as $302.2 million of depreciation and amortization expenses, $220.3 million of net cash inflow related to changes in operating assets and liabilities and $192.4 million of stock-based compensation expenses.61Cash provided by operating activities of $2.83 billion in 2010 primarily related to net income of $2.89 billion, adjusted for non-cash items such as $265.5 million of depreciation and amortization expenses, $200.0 million of stock-based compensation expenses, $136.0 million of IPR&D impairment expenses and $82.1 million of tax benefits from employee stock plans, partially offset by $680.4 million of net cash outflow related to changes in operating assets and liabilities. Cash Provided by (Used in) Investing Activities Cash used in investing activities in 2012 was $11.85 billion, consisting primarily of $10.75 billion used for our acquisition of Pharmasset, net of the stock-based compensation expense and cash acquired, $672.4 million of net purchases of marketable securities and $397.0 million of capital expenditures, related primarily to the purchase of an office building for $180.0 million and a $155.7 million increase in construction in progress associated with new facilities at our headquarters to support the ongoing growth of our business. Cash provided by investing activities in 2011 was $3.59 billion, consisting of $4.31 billion of net proceeds related to the sales of marketable securities in connection with our acquisition of Pharmasset, partially offset by $588.6 million used in our acquisitions of Arresto and Calistoga and $131.9 million of capital expenditures. Cash used in investing activities in 2010 was $1.94 billion, driven by $1.78 billion of net purchases of marketable securities, $91.0 million used in our acquisition of CGI and $61.9 million of capital expenditures. Cash Provided by (Used in) Financing Activities Cash provided by financing activities in 2012 was $563.3 million, driven primarily by net proceeds of $2.14 billion from the issuance of bank debt in conjunction with the Pharmasset acquisition, proceeds of $466.3 million from issuances of common stock under our employee stock plans and $213.9 million from proceeds received related to our convertible note hedges. The cash proceeds were partially offset by the $1.84 billion used to repay debt financing during the year and $667.0 million used to repurchase common stock under our stock repurchase programs, including commissions. With the upcoming maturity of the May 2013 convertible notes, we will be suspending our share repurchase activity during the first half of 2013.Cash provided by financing activities in 2011 was $1.76 billion, driven primarily by the issuance of $4.66 billion in senior unsecured notes, of which $3.67 billion was raised in December 2011 to partially fund the Pharmasset acquisition, net of issuance costs, and $211.7 million in proceeds from issuances of common stock under our employee stock plans. The cash proceeds were partially offset by $2.38 billion used to repurchase our common stock under our stock repurchase programs, including commissions and $650.0 million used to repay our convertible senior notes due in May 2011. Cash used in financing activities in 2010 was $1.34 billion, driven primarily by the $4.02 billion used to repurchase our common stock under our stock repurchase programs and $362.6 million used to purchase note hedges related to our convertible senior notes due in May 2014 and May 2016. The cash outflows were partially offset by $2.46 billion in net proceeds from the issuance of such notes, $221.2 million in proceeds from issuances of common stock under our employee stock plans and $155.4 million in proceeds from the sale of warrants related to such notes. Long-Term Obligations Bank DebtIn January 2012, in conjunction with our acquisition of Pharmasset, we entered into a five-year $1.25 billion revolving credit facility credit agreement (the Five-Year Revolving Credit Agreement), a $750.0 million short-term revolving credit facility credit agreement (the Short-Term Revolving Credit Agreement) and a $1.00 billion term loan facility (the Term Loan Credit Agreement). We borrowed an aggregate principal amount of $2.15 billion as follows: $750.0 million under the Five-Year Revolving Credit Agreement, $400.0 million under the Short-Term Revolving Credit Agreement and $1.00 billion under the Term Loan Credit Agreement, upon the close of the acquisition. In 2012, we fully repaid the $1.40 billion outstanding debt under the Term Loan Credit Agreement and the Short-Term Revolving Credit Agreement, at which time both agreements terminated.The Five-Year Revolving Credit Agreement contains customary representations, warranties, affirmative, negative and financial maintenance covenants and events of default. The loan bears interest at either (i) the Eurodollar Rate plus the Applicable Margin or (ii) the Base Rate plus the Applicable Margin, each as defined in the credit agreement. We may reduce the commitments and may prepay the loan in whole or in part at any time without premium or penalty.The Five-Year Revolving Credit Agreement was inclusive of a $30.0 million swing line loan sub-facility and a $25.0 million letter of credit sub-facility. As of December 31, 2012, we had $7.3 million in letters of credit outstanding under the 62Five-Year Revolving Credit Agreement. The Five-Year Revolving Credit Agreement will terminate and all amounts owed under the agreement shall be due and payable on January 12, 2017.Convertible Senior Notes and Senior Unsecured NotesIn 2012, a portion of our convertible notes due in May 2013 were converted and we repaid $223.3 million of the principal balance. We also paid $213.9 million in cash related to the conversion spread on these notes, which represents the conversion value in excess of the principal amount, and received $213.9 million in cash from our convertible note hedges related to these notes.In December 2011, we issued senior unsecured notes in a registered offering for an aggregate principal amount of $3.70 billion to partially fund our acquisition of Pharmasset. We pay interest on the notes at fixed annual rates ranging from 2.40% to 5.65%. Also, during 2011, our convertible senior notes due in May 2011 matured and we repaid the aggregate principal balance of $650.0 million. We also paid $36.1 million in cash related to the conversion spread of our matured notes, which represent the conversion value in excess of the principal amount, and received $36.1 million in cash from the related convertible note hedges. Warrants related to our convertible senior notes due in May 2011 expired in August 2011. In March 2011, we issued senior unsecured notes due in April 2021 in a registered offering for an aggregate principal amount of $1.00 billion. The notes pay interest at a fixed annual rate of 4.50%. As of December 31, 2012, our debt-to-EBITDA ratio was 1.9x. During 2012, we repaid $1.84 billion in debt financing and in 2013, we plan to continue to repay our debt to further decrease our debt-to-EBITDA ratio.The following is a summary of our borrowings under various financing arrangements (in thousands): Interest December 31,Type of Borrowing Description Issue Date Due Date Rate 2012 2011Convertible Senior May 2013 Notes April 2006 May 2013 0.625% $419,433 $607,036Convertible Senior May 2014 Notes July 2010 May 2014 1.00% 1,210,213 1,181,525Convertible Senior May 2016 Notes July 2010 May 2016 1.625% 1,157,692 1,132,293Senior Unsecured April 2021 Notes March 2011 April 2021 4.50% 992,923 992,066Senior Unsecured December 2014 Notes December 2011 December 2014 2.40% 749,394 749,078Senior Unsecured December 2016 Notes December 2011 December 2016 3.05% 699,095 698,864Senior Unsecured December 2021 Notes December 2011 December 2021 4.40% 1,247,428 1,247,138Senior Unsecured December 2041 Notes December 2011 December 2041 5.65% 997,810 997,734Credit Facility Five-Year Revolver January 2012 January 2017 Variable 750,000 —Total debt, net $8,223,988 $7,605,734Less current portion 1,169,433 —Total long-term debt, net $7,054,555 $7,605,734We believe our existing capital resources, supplemented by cash generated from our operations, will be adequate to satisfy our capital needs for the foreseeable future. Our future capital requirements will depend on many factors, including but not limited to the following: •the commercial performance of our current and future products; •the progress and scope of our R&D efforts, including preclinical studies and clinical trials; •the cost, timing and outcome of regulatory reviews; •the expansion of our sales and marketing capabilities; •administrative expenses; •the possibility of acquiring additional manufacturing capabilities or office facilities; •the possibility of acquiring other companies or new products; •costs associated with the settlement and conversion of our convertible senior notes and related warrants;•the establishment of additional collaborative relationships with other companies; and •costs associated with the defense, settlement and adverse results of litigation and government investigations. 63We may in the future require additional funding, which could be in the form of proceeds from equity or debt financings. If such funding is required, we cannot guarantee that it will be available to us on favorable terms, if at all. Critical Accounting Policies, Estimates and Judgments The discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based on our Consolidated Financial Statements, which have been prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses and related disclosures. On an ongoing basis, we evaluate our estimates, including those related to revenue recognition, allowance for doubtful accounts, valuation of intangible assets and contingent consideration liabilities resulting from a business combination and our tax provision. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other market specific and other relevant assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ significantly from these estimates. We believe the following critical accounting policies reflect the more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our Consolidated Financial Statements. Revenue Recognition Product Sales We recognize revenues from product sales when there is persuasive evidence that an arrangement exists, delivery to the customer has occurred, the price is fixed or determinable and collectability is reasonably assured. We record estimated reductions to revenues for government rebates such as Medicaid reimbursements, customer incentives such as cash discounts for prompt payment, distributor fees and expected returns of expired products. These estimates are deducted from gross product sales at the time such revenues are recognized. Of these reductions from gross product sales, government rebates significantly impact our reported net product sales and are based upon certain estimates that require complex and significant judgment by management. Government Rebates Allowances and Accrued Government Rebates We estimate reductions to our revenues for government-managed Medicaid programs as well as to certain other qualifying federal, state and foreign government programs for the reimbursement of portions of the retail price of prescriptions filled that are covered by these programs. These reductions are settled either by us being invoiced directly or through charge-backs from our wholesalers. Government rebates that are invoiced directly to us are recorded in accrued government rebates on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. For qualified programs that can purchase our products through wholesalers at a lower contractual government price, the wholesalers charge back to us the difference between their acquisition cost and the lower contractual government price, which we record as allowances against accounts receivable. Although we may pay rebates in countries outside of the United States, to date, payments made to foreign governments have not represented a significant portion of our total government rebates. For government programs in the United States, we estimate these sales allowances based on contractual terms, historical utilization rates, new information regarding changes in these programs' regulations and guidelines that would impact the amount of the actual rebates, our expectations regarding future utilization rates for these programs and channel inventory data obtained from our major U.S. wholesalers in accordance with our inventory management agreements. During 2012, 2011 and 2010, U.S government rebates and chargebacks of $2.59 billion, $1.86 billion and $1.38 billion, respectively, representing 21%, 17% and 15% of total gross product sales, respectively, were deducted from gross product sales. We believe that the methodology that we use to estimate our sales allowances for government price reductions is reasonable and appropriate given the current facts and circumstances. However, actual results may differ. Based on the current information available to us, actual government rebates claimed for these periods have varied by less than 3% from our estimates recorded in those periods. As of December 31, 2012 and 2011, we had accrued U.S. government rebates of $716.6 million and $525.6 million, respectively, in accrued government rebates and had an allowance for government chargebacks of $111.1 million and $72.1 million, respectively, recorded against accounts receivable. 64The following table summarizes the aggregate activity in our U.S. government rebates allowance and accrued government rebate accounts: Balance atBeginningof Year Charged toExpense DeductedfromAccruals Balance atEnd ofYearYear ended December 31, 2012: Government rebates allowances and accrued government rebates Activity related to 2012 sales $— $2,580,317 $1,836,199 $744,118Activity related to sales prior to 2012 597,693 10,511 524,631 83,573Total $597,693 $2,590,828 $2,360,830 $827,691Year ended December 31, 2011: Government rebates allowances and accrued government rebates Activity related to 2011 sales $— $1,840,657 $1,279,643 $561,014Activity related to sales prior to 2011 371,783 22,935 358,039 36,679Total $371,783 $1,863,592 $1,637,682 $597,693Allowance for Doubtful Accounts We maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments. This allowance is based on our analysis of several factors including, but not limited to, contractual payment terms, historical payment patterns of our customers and individual customer circumstances, an analysis of days sales outstanding by geographic region and a review of the local economic environment and its potential impact on government funding and reimbursement practices. If the financial condition of our customers or the economic environment in which they operate were to deteriorate, resulting in an inability to make payments, additional allowances may be required. We believe that the allowance for doubtful accounts is adequate; however, significant deterioration in any of the above factors could materially change these expectations and may result in an increase to our allowance for doubtful accounts. As of December 31, 2012 and 2011, our allowance for doubtful accounts was $50.9 million and $59.8 million, respectively.Valuation of Intangible Assets and Contingent Consideration Liabilities Resulting from a Business CombinationIn conjunction with our business combinations, we have recorded intangible assets primarily related to IPR&D projects, and we have recorded contingent consideration liabilities payable upon the achievement of specified development, regulatory approval or sales-based milestone events. Both the identifiable intangible assets and contingent consideration liabilities are measured at their respective fair values as of the acquisition date. The models used in valuing these intangible assets and contingent consideration liabilities require the use of significant estimates and assumptions including but not limited to: •estimates of revenues and operating profits related to the products or product candidates; •the probability of success for unapproved product candidates considering their stages of development; •the time and resources needed to complete the development and approval of product candidates; •the life of the potential commercialized products and associated risks, including the inherent difficulties and uncertainties in developing a product candidate such as obtaining FDA and other regulatory approvals; and •risks related to the viability of and potential alternative treatments in any future target markets. Intangible assets with indefinite useful lives are reviewed annually for impairment, or when facts or circumstances suggest that the carrying value of these assets may not be recoverable. We revalue contingent consideration obligations each quarter following the acquisition and record increases or decreases in their fair value in R&D expense within our Consolidated Statement of Income. Increases or decreases in the fair value of our indefinite-lived intangible assets and contingent consideration liabilities can result from updates to assumptions such as the expected timing or probability of achieving the specified milestones, changes in projected revenues or changes in discount rates. Significant judgment is employed in determining these assumptions as of the acquisition date and for each subsequent period. Updates to assumptions could have a significant impact on our results of operations in any given period. Actual results may differ from estimates.As of December 31, 2012 and 2011, we had total intangible assets of $11.74 billion and $1.06 billion, respectively, and contingent consideration liabilities of $205.1 million and $135.6 million, respectively.65Tax Provision We estimate our income tax provision, including deferred tax assets and liabilities, based on significant management judgment. We evaluate the realization of all or a portion of our deferred tax assets on a quarterly basis. We record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets to the amounts that are more likely than not to be realized. We consider future taxable income, ongoing tax planning strategies and our historical financial performance in assessing the need for a valuation allowance. If we expect to realize deferred tax assets for which we have previously recorded a valuation allowance, we will reduce the valuation allowance in the period in which such determination is first made. Various factors may have favorable or unfavorable effects on our income tax rate. These factors include, but are not limited to, interpretations of existing tax laws, changes in tax laws and rates, our portion of the non-deductible pharmaceutical excise tax, the accounting for stock options and other share-based payments, mergers and acquisitions, future levels of R&D spending, changes in accounting standards, changes in the mix of earnings in the various tax jurisdictions in which we operate, changes in overall levels of pre-tax earnings and resolution of federal, state and foreign income tax audits. The impact on our income tax provision resulting from the above mentioned factors may be significant and could have a negative impact on our net income. We record liabilities related to uncertain tax positions in accordance with the guidance that clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in an enterprise's financial statements by prescribing a minimum recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. We do not believe any such uncertain tax positions currently pending will have a material adverse effect on our Consolidated Financial Statements, although an adverse resolution of one or more of these uncertain tax positions in any period could have a material impact on the results of operations for that period. At December 31, 2012 and 2011, we had total federal, state and foreign unrecognized tax benefits of $157.0 million and $146.9 million, respectively. Of the total unrecognized tax benefits, $126.5 million and $120.6 million at December 31, 2012 and 2011, respectively, if recognized, would reduce our effective tax rate in the period of recognition. As of December 31, 2012, we believe that it is reasonably possible that our unrecognized tax benefits will not significantly change in the next 12 months as we do not expect to have clarification from the IRS and other tax authorities regarding any of our uncertain tax positions. We file federal, state and foreign income tax returns in many jurisdictions in the United States and abroad. For federal income tax purposes, the statute of limitations is open for 2008 and onwards. For certain acquired entities, the statute of limitations is open for all years from inception due to our utilization of their net operating losses and credits carried over from prior years. For California income tax purposes, the statute of limitations is open for 2008 and onwards. Our income tax returns are audited by federal, state and foreign tax authorities. We are currently under examination by the IRS for the 2008 and 2009 tax years and by various state and foreign jurisdictions. There are differing interpretations of tax laws and regulations, and as a result, significant disputes may arise with these tax authorities involving issues of the timing and amount of deductions and allocations of income among various tax jurisdictions. We periodically evaluate our exposures associated with our tax filing positions. Off Balance Sheet Arrangements We do not have any off balance sheet arrangements as defined in Item 303(a)(4)(ii) of Regulation S-K. 66Contractual Obligations Our contractual obligations consist of debt obligations, operating leases, capital commitments, purchase obligations for active pharmaceutical ingredients and inventory-related items and clinical trials contracts. The following table summarizes our significant enforceable and legally binding obligations, future commitments and obligations related to all contracts that we are likely to continue regardless of the fact that certain of these obligations may be cancelable as of December 31, 2012 (in thousands): Payments due by PeriodContractual Obligations Total Less than oneyear 1-3 years 3-5 years More than 5yearsLong-term debt (1) $10,355,158 $656,576 $2,420,576 $2,294,506 $4,983,500Operating lease obligations 213,645 47,009 80,513 45,859 40,264Capital commitments (2) 56,221 53,184 3,037 — —Purchase obligations (3)(4) 1,512,093 1,148,980 252,012 111,101 —Clinical trials (5) 511,243 333,562 136,921 24,902 15,858Total $12,648,360 $2,239,311 $2,893,059 $2,476,368 $5,039,622 (1) Long-term debt obligations include future interest payments based on fixed rates of 0.625%, 1.00% and 1.625% for our convertible senior notes due in May 2013, May 2014 and May 2016, respectively. Long-term debt obligations also include future interest payments based on fixed rates of 2.40%, 3.05%, 4.50%, 4.40% and 5.65% for our senior unsecured notes due in December 2014, December 2016, April 2021, December 2021 and December 2041, respectively. At December 31, 2012, the aggregate carrying values of our convertible notes and senior unsecured notes were $2.79 billion and $4.69 billion, respectively. (2) At December 31, 2012, we had firm capital project commitments of approximately $56.2 million primarily relating to facilities improvement projects. (3) At December 31, 2012, we had firm purchase commitments related to active pharmaceutical ingredients and certain inventory-related items. These amounts include minimum purchase requirements and actual purchases are expected to significantly exceed these amounts. (4) In addition to the above, we have committed to make potential future milestone payments to third parties as part of licensing, collaboration and development arrangements. Payments under these agreements generally become due and payable only upon achievement of certain developmental, regulatory and/or commercial milestones. Because the achievement of these milestones is neither probable nor reasonably estimable, such contingencies have not been recorded on our Consolidated Balance Sheets and have not been included in the table above. (5) At December 31, 2012, we had several clinical studies in various clinical trial phases. Our most significant clinical trial expenditures are to CROs. Although all of our material contracts with CROs are cancelable, we historically have not cancelled such contracts. These amounts reflect commitments based on existing contracts and do not reflect any future modifications to, or terminations of, existing contracts or anticipated or potential new contracts. We had total gross unrecognized tax benefit liabilities of $178.1 million as of December 31, 2012. We believe that it is reasonably possible that our unrecognized tax benefits will not significantly change in the next 12 months as we do not expect to have clarification from the IRS and other tax authorities regarding any of our uncertain tax positions. The unrecognized tax benefits were included in long-term income taxes payable and non-current deferred tax assets on our Consolidated Balance Sheet and have not been included in the table above. Recent Accounting PronouncementIn July 2012, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued new accounting guidance intended to simplify the testing of indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment. Entities will be allowed the option to first perform a qualitative assessment on impairment for indefinite-lived intangible assets to determine whether a quantitative assessment is necessary. This guidance is effective for impairment tests performed in interim and annual periods for fiscal years beginning after September 15, 2012. Early adoption is permitted. We elected to early adopt this guidance as of December 31, 2012 which did not have a material impact on our Consolidated Financial Statements.67ITEM 7A.QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK We are exposed to market risks that may result from changes in foreign currency exchange rates, interest rates and credit risks. To reduce certain of these risks, we enter into various types of foreign currency or interest rate derivative hedging transactions, follow investment guidelines and monitor outstanding receivables as part of our risk management program.Foreign Currency Exchange Risk Our operations include manufacturing and sales activities in the United States, Canada and Ireland as well as sales activities in countries outside the United States, including Europe and Asia. As a result, our financial results could be significantly affected by factors such as changes in foreign currency exchange rates or weak economic conditions in the foreign markets in which we distribute our products. Our operating results are exposed to changes in foreign currency exchange rates between the U.S. dollar and various foreign currencies, the most significant of which is the Euro. When the U.S. dollar strengthens against these currencies, the relative value of sales made in the respective foreign currency decreases. Conversely, when the U.S. dollar weakens against these currencies, the relative amounts of such sales increase. Overall, we are a net receiver of foreign currencies and, therefore, benefit from a weaker U.S. dollar and are adversely affected by a stronger U.S. dollar relative to those foreign currencies in which we transact significant amounts of business. More than 40% of our product sales were denominated in foreign currencies during 2012. To partially mitigate the impact of changes in currency exchange rates on net cash flows from our foreign currency denominated sales, we may enter into foreign currency exchange forward and option contracts. We also hedge certain monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies, which reduces but does not eliminate our exposure to currency fluctuations between the date a transaction is recorded and the date that cash is collected or paid. In general, the market risks of these contracts are offset by corresponding gains and losses on the transactions being hedged. As of December 31, 2012 and 2011, we had open foreign currency forward contracts with notional amounts of $3.39 billion and $4.03 billion, respectively. A hypothetical 10% adverse movement in foreign currency exchange rates compared with the U.S. dollar relative to exchange rates at December 31, 2012, would have resulted in a reduction in fair value of these contracts of approximately $350.0 million on this date and, if realized, would negatively affect earnings over the remaining life of the contracts. A hypothetical 10% adverse movement in foreign currency exchange rates compared with the U.S. dollar relative to exchange rates at December 31, 2011, would have resulted in a reduction in fair value of these contracts of approximately $325.0 million on this date and, if realized, would negatively affect earnings over the remaining life of the contracts. The analysis does not consider the impact that hypothetical changes in foreign currency exchange rates would have on anticipated transactions that these foreign currency sensitive instruments were designed to offset.Interest Rate Risk Our portfolio of available-for-sale marketable securities and our fixed and variable rate liabilities create an exposure to interest rate risk. With respect to our investment portfolio, we adhere to an investment policy that requires us to limit amounts invested in securities based on credit rating, maturity, industry group and investment type and issuer, except for securities issued by the U.S. government. The goals of our investment policy, in order of priority, are as follows: • safety and preservation of principal and diversification of risk; • liquidity of investments sufficient to meet cash flow requirements; and • competitive after-tax rate of return. 68The following table summarizes the expected maturities and average interest rates of our interest-generating assets and fixed interest-bearing liabilities at December 31, 2012 (dollars in thousands): Expected Maturity Total Fair Value at December 31, 2012 2013 2014 2015 2016 2017 Thereafter Total Assets Available-for-sale debt securities $58,556 $258,220 $413,150 $9,250 $5,330 $33,886 $778,392 $778,392Average interest rate 0.3% 0.4% 0.6% 0.6% 0.6% 2% Liabilities Long-term debt (1) $426,580 $2,000,000 $— $1,950,000 $— $3,250,000 $7,626,580 $10,307,954Average interest rate 0.6% 1.5% —% 2.1% —% 4.8% (1) In December 2011, we issued senior unsecured notes due in December 2014, 2016, 2021 and 2041 in a registered offering. The notes pay interest at fixed annual rates ranging from 2.40% to 5.65%. In March 2011, we issued senior unsecured notes due in April 2021 in a registered offering. The notes pay interest at a fixed annual rate of 4.50%. In July 2010, we issued convertible senior notes due in May 2014 and May 2016 in a private placement pursuant to Rule 144A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended. The notes due in May 2014 and May 2016 were issued at par and bear interest rates of 1.00% and 1.625%, respectively, and may be converted into shares of our common stock subject to certain circumstances. In April 2006, we issued convertible senior notes due in May 2013 in a private placement pursuant to Rule 144A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended. The notes were issued at par and bear interest rates of 0.625%, and may be converted into shares of our common stock subject to certain circumstances. During the first quarter of 2012, in connection with our acquisition of Pharmasset, we entered into credit agreements that are subject to variable interest rates. During 2012, the portion of interest expense related to variable interest totaled $20.5 million.Credit RiskWe are subject to credit risk from our portfolio of cash equivalents and marketable securities. Under our investment policy, we limit amounts invested in such securities by credit rating, maturity, industry group, investment type and issuer, except for securities issued by the U.S. government. We are not exposed to any significant concentrations of credit risk from these financial instruments. The goals of our investment policy, in order of priority, are as follows: safety and preservation of principal and diversification of risk; liquidity of investments sufficient to meet cash flow requirements; and a competitive after-tax rate of return. We are also subject to credit risk from our accounts receivable related to our product sales. The majority of our trade accounts receivable arises from product sales in the United States and Europe. During the second quarter of 2012, we received payment on $460.6 million in past due accounts receivable from customers based in Spain. Included in this amount were proceeds from a one-time factoring arrangement where we sold receivables with a carrying value of $319.8 million, net of the allowance for doubtful accounts. We received proceeds of $349.7 million and recorded a gain of $29.9 million, resulting primarily from the reversal of the related allowance for doubtful accounts. This gain was recorded as an offset to SG&A expenses in our Consolidated Statement of Income. Subsequent to this transaction, we have had no continuing involvement with the transferred receivables, which were derecognized at the time of the sale.As of December 31, 2012, our accounts receivable in Southern Europe, specifically Greece, Italy, Portugal and Spain, totaled approximately $822.4 million, of which $331.6 million were past due greater than 120 days and $106.3 million were past due greater than 365 days . As of December 31, 2011, our accounts receivable in Southern Europe, specifically Greece, Italy, Portugal and Spain totaled approximately $1.10 billion, of which $612.4 million were past due greater than 120 days and $250.7 million were past due greater than 365 days. To date, we have not experienced significant losses with respect to the collection of our accounts receivable. We believe that our allowance for doubtful accounts was adequate at December 31, 2012.69",2023-12-30 19:04:29.314832

MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS The following Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (MD&A) is intended to help the reader understand our results of operations and financial condition. MD&A is provided as a supplement to, and should be read in conjunction with, our audited Consolidated Financial Statements and the accompanying notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements and other disclosures included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K (including the disclosures under Item 1A, Risk Factors). Our Consolidated Financial Statements have been prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles and are presented in U.S. dollars. Management OverviewGilead Sciences, Inc. (Gilead, we or us), incorporated in Delaware on June 22, 1987, is a research-based biopharmaceutical company that discovers, develops and commercializes innovative medicines in areas of unmet medical need. With each new discovery and experimental drug candidate, we strive to transform and simplify care for people with life-threatening illnesses around the world. Gilead's primary areas of focus include human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), liver diseases such as hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection and hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection, oncology/inflammation and serious cardiovascular and respiratory conditions. Headquartered in Foster City, California, we have operations in North and South America, Europe and Asia-Pacific. We continue to add to our existing portfolio of products through our internal discovery and clinical development programs and through a product acquisition and in-licensing strategy. Our product portfolio is comprised of Stribild®, Complera®/Eviplera®, Atripla®, Truvada®, Viread®, Emtriva®, Tybost®, Sovaldi®, Hepsera®, Vitekta®, Letairis®, Ranexa®, Cayston®, AmBisome® and Vistide®.Business HighlightsDuring 2013, we continued to advance our product pipeline across all therapeutic areas. We made significant progress, particularly in our Phase 3 studies in oncology, liver diseases and HIV. The combination of our existing internal research programs, acquisitions and partnerships will allow us to continue bringing innovative therapies to individuals who are living with unmet medical needs. Below is a summary of our key accomplishments: •expanded our single tablet regimen (STR) products with the European launch of Stribild in 14 countries;•received U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and European Medicines Agency (EMA) approval of Complera/Eviplera for use among certain adult patients switching from another stable antiretroviral regimen;•received EMA approval for once-daily Tybost, a pharmacokinetic enhancer that boosts blood levels of certain HIV medicines;•received EMA approval for Vitekta, an integrase inhibitor for the treatment of HIV-1 infection in adults without known mutations associated with resistance to elvitegravir;•advanced the clinical development of tenofovir alafenamide (TAF) as a once-daily single tablet regimen for the treatment of HIV-1 infection to Phase 3 clinical trials;•received approval from the FDA and Health Canada in December 2013 for Sovaldi (sofosbuvir), a once daily oral regimen for the treatment of HCV as a component of a combination of antiviral treatment regimens; received approval from the EMA for Sovaldi in January 2014;•announced positive interim results from three Phase 3 clinical studies (ION-1, ION-2 and ION-3) evaluating the once-daily fixed-dose combination of ledipasvir/sofosbuvir (LDV/SOF), with and without ribavirin (RBV), for the treatment of genotype 1 HCV infection; filed a new drug application (NDA) for the fixed-dose combination of LDV/SOF in February 2014;•submitted an NDA to the FDA for approval of idelalisib for the treatment of patients with indolent non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (iNHL) and chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL). We also filed for approval of idelalisib for treatment of iNHL and CLL with the EMA on October 28, 2013. In January 2014, the FDA accepted our NDA for iNHL and set a target review date of September 11, 2014 under the Prescription Drug User Fee Act (PDUFA). In February 2014, the FDA, which previously granted Breakthrough Therapy designation for idelalisib in CLL, accepted our NDA and set a target review date of August 6, 2014 under the PDUFA; and•completed the acquisition of YM Biosciences Inc. (YM), through which we acquired momelotinib, an orally administered, once-daily candidate for hematologic cancers and advanced the clinical development of momelotinib to Phase 3 clinical trials.56Outlook 2014In 2014, we will continue to focus on our key operating objectives which include continued progression of our product pipeline and continued uptake of our commercial products. From a research and development (R&D) perspective, we will continue to invest in our various ongoing clinical studies, which support both our existing products and pipeline of new drug candidates. We expect to move forward on a number of late-stage clinical studies for new product candidates and plan to filemarketing applications for various therapeutic areas.From a commercial perspective, during 2013, we began to build-out our commercial organization to support the launch of Sovaldi in the United States and Canada in December 2013. In January 2014, we received approval from the EMA for Sovaldi in all 28 countries of the European Union. Sovaldi represents a significant shift in the treatment paradigm for certain HCV patients around the world. During 2014, we plan to further the build-out and expansion of our international commercial infrastructure particularly in Europe and Asia to support the Sovaldi launches and increase marketing and sales efforts related to the anticipated launch of our first oncology product, idelalisib.We continue to monitor conditions in the macroeconomic environment that could affect our ability to achieve our goals, such as changes in the reimbursement and payor landscape as well as legislation that may delay or impact funding for AIDS Drug Assistance Programs (ADAPs) in the United States, a worsening of economic conditions in certain key markets, particularly in Europe, patent expirations of competitive products and the launch of generic competitors, government pricing pressures internationally and the potential volatility in foreign currency exchange rates. We will adjust our business processes, as appropriate, to attempt to mitigate these risks to our business.We expect that our product pipeline investments and expanding commercial infrastructure will enable us to execute on our 2014 operating objectives.2013 Financial Highlights During 2013, we delivered strong financial performance and continued to invest in our product pipeline. Total revenues grew 15% to $11.20 billion and total product sales grew 15% to $10.80 billion, compared to 2012 driven primarily by an increase in antiviral product sales.R&D expenses increased 20% to $2.12 billion for 2013 compared to 2012 due to progression of our clinical studies, particularly Phase 3 studies in oncology, liver diseases and HIV. Selling, general and administrative (SG&A) expenses increased 16% to $1.70 billion for 2013 compared to 2012 due to the ongoing growth and expansion of our business, including commercial expansion related to the launch of Sovaldi.Net income attributable to Gilead for 2013 was $3.07 billion or $1.81 per diluted share, compared to $2.59 billion or $1.64 per diluted share in 2012, due to the increase in total revenues, partially offset by an increase in R&D and SG&A expenses.During 2013, we generated $3.10 billion in operating cash flows, paid $1.04 billion for the warrants related to our May 2013 Notes that settled in August 2013, repaid $1.67 billion in debt net of proceeds from convertible note hedges and utilized $378.6 million for the acquisition of YM, net of cash acquired.Results of Operations Total Revenues Total revenues include product sales, royalty revenues, and contract and other revenues. Total revenues increased 15% to $11.20 billion in 2013, compared to 2012 and increased 16% to $9.70 billion in 2012 compared to $8.39 billion in 2011. Product sales represented 96% of total revenues in 2013 and 97% of total revenues in 2012 and 2011. Royalty revenues represented 3% of total revenues during 2013, 2012 and 2011.Product Sales Total product sales were $10.80 billion in 2013, an increase of 15% over total product sales of $9.40 billion in 2012, driven primarily by the continued uptake of our STR products, primarily Stribild and Complera/Eviplera. Cardiovascular product sales consisting of Letairis and Ranexa, increased 24% to $968.6 million in 2013 compared to $783.0 million in 2012. Total product sales were $9.40 billion in 2012, an increase of 16% over total product sales of $8.10 billion in 2011, driven primarily by continued growth in sales of our antiviral products, including Atripla, Truvada and Complera/Eviplera. Product sales in the United States increased 20% for 2013 to $6.65 billion compared to $5.54 billion in 2012, driven by sales growth of our STR products, specifically Stribild and Complera as well as the launch of our newest product, Sovaldi. 57During the fourth quarters of 2013 and 2012, we noted strong wholesaler and sub-wholesaler purchases in anticipation of price increases effective January 1. We estimate that during the fourth quarter of 2013, sales exceeded demand by approximately $130 - $150 million and $80 - $100 million during the same period in 2012. Based on our observations during the first quarter of 2013, this may result in inventory draw-downs during the first quarter of 2014.Approximately 40% of our product sales are generated outside the United States and as a result, we face exposure to adverse movements in foreign currency exchange rates, primarily in the Euro. We used foreign currency exchange forward contracts to hedge a percentage of our foreign currency exposure. Foreign currency exchange, net of hedges, had an unfavorable impact of $64.8 million on our 2013 revenues compared to 2012 and an unfavorable impact of $57.1 million on our 2012 revenues compared to 2011. Product sales in Europe increased 6% in 2013 to $3.33 billion compared to $3.14 billion in 2012, driven primarily by higher underlying demand for our antiviral products, specifically Eviplera, partially offset by decreases in the average net selling price. Product sales in Europe increased 6% in 2012 to $3.14 billion compared to $2.96 billion in 2011, driven primarily by higher underlying demand in our antiviral franchise. Antiviral product sales in Europe totaled $2.87 billion in 2012, an increase of 6% compared to $2.71 billion in 2011, driven primarily by the sales of Atripla and Truvada. Foreign currency exchange, net of hedges, had an unfavorable impact of $55.3 million on our European product sales in 2013 compared to 2012 and an unfavorable impact of $68.9 million on our European product sales in 2012 compared to 2011.In light of the fiscal and debt crises experienced by several countries in the European Union, several governments have announced or implemented measures to manage healthcare expenditures. Although to date, we have paid rebates in countries outside the United States, payments made to foreign governments do not represent a significant portion of our government rebates and chargebacks or percentage of total product sales in foreign locations. However, we continue to experience pricing pressure, such as increases in the amount of discounts required on our products and delayed reimbursement which could negatively impact our future product sales and results of operations.We expect our total product sales to grow in 2014, as we realize the full year impact of sales of Sovaldi and continued uptake of our commercial products, primarily our single tablet regimens. We believe this growth could be tempered by pricing pressures in certain European territories, the impact of generic efavirenz, now available in Canada and Europe, potential volatility in foreign currency exchange rates and changes in the macroeconomic environment.Government Rebates and ChargebacksU.S. government rebates and chargebacks deducted from gross product sales increased 19% to $3.08 billion in 2013 from $2.59 billion in 2012 and increased 39% from $1.86 billion in 2011, representing 21% of total gross product sales in both 2013 and 2012 and 17% of total gross product sales in 2011. In March 2010, healthcare reform legislation was adopted in the United States that required further rebates or discounts on products reimbursed or paid for by various public payers, such as Medicaid and other entities eligible to purchase discounted products. As a result of this legislation and the impact of the economic downturn, our total rebates and chargebacks have increased as we have experienced changes in our payer mix. Specifically, we believe that certain patients previously covered by private insurance have moved to public reimbursement programs. As a result, we expect government rebates and chargebacks as a percentage of total gross product sales will continue to increase. 58The following table summarizes the period over period changes in our product sales:(In thousands, except percentages) 2013 Change 2012 Change 2011Antiviral products: Atripla $3,648,496 2 % $3,574,483 11 % $3,224,518Truvada 3,135,771 (1)% 3,181,110 11 % 2,875,141Viread 958,969 13 % 848,697 15 % 737,867Complera/Eviplera 809,452 137 % 342,200 783 % 38,747Stribild 539,256 837 % 57,536 — % —Sovaldi 139,435 — % — — % —Hepsera 81,095 (25)% 108,315 (25)% 144,679Emtriva 27,405 (7)% 29,449 2 % 28,764Total antiviral products 9,339,879 15 % 8,141,790 15 % 7,049,716Letairis 519,966 27 % 410,054 40 % 293,426Ranexa 448,624 20 % 372,949 17 % 320,004AmBisome 351,827 1 % 346,646 5 % 330,156Other products 143,399 13 % 126,932 16 % 109,057Total product sales $10,803,695 15 % $9,398,371 16 % $8,102,359Antiviral ProductsAntiviral product sales increased by 15% in 2013 compared to 2012 and 2012 compared to 2011. •Atripla In 2013, increases in Atripla sales were driven primarily by an increase in the average net selling price. In 2012, Atripla sales were driven primarily by sales volume growth in the United States. Atripla sales accounted for 39%, 44% and 46% of our total antiviral product sales for 2013, 2012 and 2011, respectively. The efavirenz component of Atripla, which has a gross margin of zero, comprised $1.40 billion, $1.34 billion and $1.21 billion of our Atripla sales in 2013, 2012 and 2011, respectively. A generic version of Bristol-Myers Squibb Company's Sustiva (efavirenz), a component of our Atripla, was made available in Canada and Europe in 2013 and will be made available in the United States in 2015. As a result, we expect increased competitive pricing pressure on our future Atripla sales.•Truvada In 2013, decreases in Truvada sales were due to a decrease in sales volume, partially offset by an increase in average net selling price. In 2012, Truvada sales were driven primarily by sales volume growth in the United States. Truvada sales accounted for 34%, 39% and 41% of our total antiviral product sales for 2013, 2012 and 2011, respectively. Future sales of Truvada could be impacted by patients switching to a different STR regimen. •Complera/EvipleraIn 2013, increases in Complera/Eviplera sales were driven primarily by sales volume growth in Europe and the United States. In 2012, Complera/Eviplera sales increased due primarily to sales volume growth in the United States. Complera was approved in the United States in August 2011, and Eviplera was approved in the European Union in November 2011. During 2013, we estimate that Complera became the number two most-prescribed regimen in treatment naïve HIV patients in the United States and the number one most-prescribed regimen in treatment naïve HIV patients in Europe's Big 5 markets, the United Kingdom, France, Germany, Italy and Spain.•StribildIn 2013 and 2012, increases in sales of Stribild were driven primarily by sales volume growth in the United States. Stribild was approved in the United States in August 2012 and in Europe in May 2013. During 2013, we estimate that Stribild became the number one most-prescribed regimen in treatment naïve HIV patients in the United States.•SovaldiIn December 2013, the FDA approved Sovaldi for the treatment of HCV. Sovaldi sales totaled $139.4 million in 2013, of which we estimate that approximately half related to initial inventory stocking by wholesalers and sub-wholesalers.59Cardiovascular ProductsOur cardiovascular products, which include Letairis and Ranexa increased due primarily to sales volume growth.Royalty Revenues The following table summarizes the period over period changes in our royalty revenues: (In thousands, except percentages) 2013 Change 2012 Change 2011Royalty revenues $383,849 32% $290,523 8% $268,827Royalty revenues increased 32% for 2013 compared to 2012, due to higher royalty revenues from F. Hoffmann-La Roche Ltd (Roche) as a result of an increase in the number of patients treated for influenza with Tamiflu. Royalty revenues increased 8% for 2012 compared to 2011, driven primarily by higher royalty revenues from GlaxoSmithKline, Inc., Japan Tobacco Inc. and Astellas US LLC partially offset by lower Tamiflu royalties from Roche. Tamiflu royalties from Roche contributed $134.7 million, $43.7 million and $75.5 million to total royalty revenues in 2013, 2012 and 2011 respectively. We recognize royalties on Tamiflu sales by Roche in the quarter following the quarter in which the corresponding sales occur.Cost of Goods Sold and Product Gross MarginThe following table summarizes the period over period changes in our product sales, cost of goods sold and product gross margin: (In thousands, except percentages) 2013 Change 2012 Change 2011Total product sales $10,803,695 15% $9,398,371 16% $8,102,359Cost of goods sold $2,858,502 16% $2,471,363 16% $2,124,410Product gross margin 74% 74% 74%Our product gross margin for 2013 was consistent with our product gross margin for 2012 and 2011. Our product gross margin for the fourth quarter of 2013 was 71.8% and included $58.3 million in amortization expense related to the transition of the in-process research and development (IPR&D) asset, from an indefinite-lived to finite-lived intangible asset upon the FDA approval and commercial launch of Sovaldi. In 2014, we expect to recognize the full year impact of amortization of approximately $700.0 million related to Sovaldi.Research and Development Expenses The following table summarizes the period over period changes in R&D expenses:(In thousands, except percentages) 2013 Change 2012 Change 2011Research and development $2,119,756 20% $1,759,945 43% $1,229,151 We do not track total R&D expenses by product candidate, therapeutic area or development phase. However, we manage our R&D expenses by identifying the R&D activities we anticipate will be performed during a given period and then prioritizing efforts based on scientific data, probability of successful development, market potential, available human and capital resources and other considerations. We continually review our R&D pipeline and the status of development and, as necessary, reallocate resources among the R&D product portfolio that we believe will best support the future growth of our business. R&D expenses summarized above consist primarily of clinical studies performed by contract research organizations (CROs), materials and supplies, licenses and fees, milestone payments under collaboration arrangements, personnel costs, including salaries, benefits and stock-based compensation and overhead allocations consisting of various support and facilities-related costs. The following table provides a breakout of R&D expenses by major cost type: (In thousands, except percentages) 2013 2012 2011Clinical studies and outside services $1,147,169 $828,278 $570,302Personnel and infrastructure expenses 714,027 686,091 412,463Facilities, IT and other costs 258,560 245,576 219,756In-process research and development impairment charges — — 26,630Total $2,119,756 $1,759,945 $1,229,15160In 2013, R&D expenses increased $359.8 million or 20% compared to 2012, due primarily to a $318.9 million increase in clinical studies and a $27.9 million increase in personnel and infrastructure expenses to support the continued progression of our clinical studies, particularly Phase 3 studies in oncology, liver diseases and HIV. These increases were partially offset by a $100.1 million decrease in stock-based compensation expense due to the acceleration of vested stock options related to our acquisition of Pharmasset, Inc. (Pharmasset) in January 2012.In 2012, clinical studies and outside services increased $258.0 million compared to 2011 due to progression and expansion of our Phase 3 studies, particularly in liver diseases and oncology. Additionally, personnel expenses increased $273.6 million due to higher headcount to support our product pipeline and study progression.During 2011, we recorded $26.6 million of impairment charges related to certain IPR&D assets acquired from CGI Pharmaceuticals, Inc.. These impairment charges were a result of changes in the anticipated market share related to the spleen tyrosine kinase (Syk) compound.In 2014, we expect R&D expenses to increase over 2013 due primarily to continued investment in advancing our product pipeline, driven primarily by the progression of our clinical studies in oncology, liver diseases and HIV. Selling, General and Administrative Expenses The following table summarizes the period over period changes in SG&A expenses:(In thousands, except percentages) 2013 Change 2012 Change 2011Selling, general and administrative $1,699,431 16% $1,461,034 18% $1,241,983SG&A expenses relate to sales and marketing, finance, human resources, legal and other administrative activities. Expenses are primarily comprised of facilities and overhead costs, outside marketing, advertising and legal expenses and other general and administrative costs. In 2013, SG&A expenses increased $238.4 million or 16% compared to 2012. The increase was due primarily to a $308.0 million increase in headcount-related and other expenses to support the ongoing growth of our business, legal expenses and pharmaceutical excise tax resulting from U.S. healthcare reform. This increase was partially offset by a $98.0 million decrease in stock-based compensation due to the acceleration of vested stock options related to our acquisition of Pharmasset in January 2012. Sequentially, SG&A expenses in the fourth quarter of 2013 increased $106.4 million or 26% compared to the third quarter of 2013 due primarily to increased marketing activities related to the launch of Sovaldi.In 2012, SG&A expenses increased $219.1 million or 18% compared to 2011. The increase was due primarily to a $100.5 million increase in costs associated with the growth of our business which include personnel and headcount-related expenses, a $98.0 million increase in stock-based compensation expenses primarily resulting from the acquisition of Pharmasset and an increase of $38.2 million in the pharmaceutical excise tax resulting from U.S. healthcare reform. This increase was partially offset by a reduction in bad debt provisions of $34.3 million, which included a gain of $29.9 million related to the sale of our accounts receivables balances in Spain in the second quarter of 2012.In 2014, we expect SG&A expenses to increase over 2013 to support our continued build-out and expansion of our commercial infrastructure in Europe and Asia to support our Sovaldi launches, increased sales and marketing efforts related to the anticipated launch of our first oncology product, idelalisib and an increase in the pharmaceutical excise tax. We estimate our portion of the pharmaceutical excise tax to be approximately $150 - $170 million in 2014, compared to approximately $110 million in 2013 and approximately $85 million in 2012.Interest ExpenseIn 2013, interest expense decreased to $306.9 million compared to $360.9 million in 2012. The decrease was due primarily to the repayment of our May 2013 Notes, conversions of our convertible senior notes due in May 2014 and May 2016 (May 2014 Notes and May 2016 Notes), and the repayment of revolving credit facilities. In 2012, interest expense increased to $360.9 million compared to $205.4 million in 2011. The increase was due primarily to the additional debt we issued in connection with our acquisition of Pharmasset, which included $3.70 billion in senior unsecured notes issued in December 2011 and $2.15 billion in bank debt issued in January 2012.Other Income (Expense), Net For 2013, other income (expense), net was a net expense of $(8.9) million compared to a net expense of $(37.3) million in 2012 and net income of $66.6 million in 2011. The changes in other income (expense), net were due primarily to a $40.1 million loss on Greek bonds related to Greece's restructuring of its sovereign debt in the first quarter of 2012.61Provision for Income Taxes Our provision for income taxes was $1.15 billion, $1.04 billion and $861.9 million in 2013, 2012 and 2011, respectively. The 2013 effective tax rate of 27.3% differed from the U.S. federal statutory rate of 35% due primarily to the retroactive extension of the 2012 federal research tax credit in January 2013, the 2013 federal research tax credit and certain operating earnings from non-U.S. subsidiaries that are considered indefinitely reinvested, partially offset by state taxes, our portion of the non-tax deductible pharmaceutical excise tax and amortization expense related to the Pharmasset acquisition and contingent consideration expense related to certain acquisitions for which we receive no tax benefit. We do not provide for U.S. income taxes on undistributed earnings of our foreign operations that are intended to be indefinitely reinvested in our foreign subsidiaries.The 2012 effective tax rate of 28.7% differed from the U.S. federal statutory rate of 35% due primarily to tax credits and certain operating earnings from non-U.S. subsidiaries that are considered indefinitely reinvested, partially offset by state taxes, the stock-based compensation expense related to the Pharmasset acquisition and contingent consideration expense related to certain acquisitions for which we receive no tax benefit.The 2011 effective tax rate of 23.6% differed from the U.S. federal statutory rate of 35% due primarily to tax credits and certain operating earnings from non-U.S. subsidiaries that are considered indefinitely reinvested, partially offset by state taxes and the non-tax deductible pharmaceutical excise tax.Our future effective tax rate may be impacted by various factors, including the amortization of certain acquisition-related intangibles for which we receive no tax benefit.AcquisitionsYM Biosciences Inc.We completed the acquisition of YM BioSciences Inc. (YM), based in Canada, for total consideration transferred of $487.6 million on February 8, 2013, at which time YM became a wholly-owned subsidiary of Gilead. YM was a drug development company primarily focused on advancing momelotinib (formerly known as CYT387), an orally administered, once-daily candidate for hematologic cancers. The fair values of acquired assets and assumed liabilities include primarily IPR&D of $362.7 million, goodwill of $127.2 million, deferred tax assets of $53.0 million with a full unrecognized tax benefit, deferred tax liabilities of $108.8 million and cash acquired of $108.9 million. Pro forma results of operations for the acquisition of YM have not been presented because this acquisition is not material to our consolidated results of operations. See Note 8, Intangible Assets and Goodwill for a description of the IPR&D acquired.Pharmasset, Inc.In January 2012, we completed the acquisition of Pharmasset, a publicly-held clinical-stage pharmaceutical company committed to discovering, developing and commercializing novel drugs to treat viral infections. Pharmasset's primary focus was the development of oral therapeutics for the treatment of HCV infection. Pharmasset's lead compound sofosbuvir (formerly known as GS-7977), is a nucleotide analog which, in December 2013, was approved by the FDA and Health Canada under the name Sovaldi, as a once-daily oral regimen for the treatment of HCV in patients with genotypes 1, 2, 3 or 4 infection, including those with hepatocellular carcinoma meeting Milan criteria (awaiting liver transplantation) and those with HCV/HIV-1 co-infection. In January 2014, the European Commission granted marketing authorization for Sovaldi in all 28 countries in the European Union. The acquisition of Pharmasset has allowed us to advance our effort to develop all-oral regimens for the treatment of HCV. We acquired all of the outstanding shares of common stock of Pharmasset for $137 per share in cash through a tender offer and subsequent merger under the terms of an agreement and plan of merger entered into in November 2011. The aggregate cash payment to acquire all of the outstanding shares of common stock was $11.05 billion. We financed the transaction with approximately $5.20 billion in cash on hand, $3.70 billion in senior unsecured notes issued in December 2011 and $2.15 billion in bank debt issued in January 2012. The Pharmasset acquisition was accounted for as a business combination. The results of operations of Pharmasset have been included in our Consolidated Statement of Income since January 13, 2012, the date on which we acquired approximately 88% of the outstanding shares of common stock of Pharmasset, cash consideration was transferred, and as a result, we obtained effective control of Pharmasset. The acquisition was completed on January 17, 2012, at which time Pharmasset became a wholly-owned subsidiary of Gilead and was integrated into our operations. As we do not track earnings results by product candidate or therapeutic area, we do not maintain separate earnings results for the acquired Pharmasset business. 62The following table summarizes the components of the cash paid to acquire Pharmasset (in thousands):Total consideration transferred$10,858,372Stock-based compensation expense193,937Total cash paid$11,052,309The $11.05 billion cash payment consisted of a $10.38 billion cash payment to the outstanding common stockholders as well as a $668.3 million cash payment to option holders under the Pharmasset stock option plans. The $10.38 billion cash payment to the outstanding common stockholders and $474.3 million of the cash payment to vested option holders under the Pharmasset stock option plans were accounted for as consideration transferred. The remaining $193.9 million of cash payment was accounted for as stock-based compensation expense resulting from the accelerated vesting of Pharmasset employee options immediately prior to the acquisition.The following table summarizes the acquisition date fair values of assets acquired and liabilities assumed, and the consideration transferred (in thousands):Identifiable intangible assets$10,738,000Cash and cash equivalents106,737Other assets acquired (liabilities assumed), net(43,182)Total identifiable net assets10,801,555Goodwill56,817Total consideration transferred$10,858,372Identifiable Intangible AssetsWe acquired intangible assets, primarily comprised of the sofosbuvir IPR&D compound, which had an estimated fair value of $10.72 billion as of the date of acquisition. The fair value was determined using a probability-weighted income approach that discounts expected future cash flows to present value. The estimated net cash flows were discounted using a discount rate of 12%, which is based on the estimated weighted-average cost of capital for companies with profiles similar to that of Pharmasset. This rate is comparable to the estimated internal rate of return for the acquisition and represents the rate that market participants would use to value the intangible asset. The projected cash flows were based on key assumptions such as: estimates of revenues and operating profits related to each project considering its stage of development on the acquisition date; the time and resources needed to complete the development and approval of the product candidate; the life of the potential commercialized product and associated risks, including the inherent difficulties and uncertainties in developing a product candidate such as obtaining marketing approval from the FDA and other regulatory agencies; and risks related to the viability of and potential alternative treatments in any future target markets. Intangible assets related to IPR&D projects are considered to be indefinite-lived assets and are not amortized until the completion or abandonment of the associated R&D efforts. In December 2013, following the approval by the FDA and commercialization of sofosbuvir as Sovaldi, we reclassified the $10.72 billion purchased IPR&D project for sofosbuvir from an indefinite-lived to finite-lived intangible asset. We are amortizing this asset over its estimated useful life, utilizing the straight-line method.Goodwill The $56.8 million of goodwill represents the excess of the consideration transferred over the fair values of assets acquired and liabilities assumed and is attributable to the synergies expected from combining our R&D operations with Pharmasset's. None of the goodwill is expected to be deductible for income tax purposes.Stock-Based Compensation ExpenseThe stock-based compensation expense recognized for the accelerated vesting of employee options immediately prior to the acquisition was reported in our Consolidated Statement of Income as follows (in thousands): Year Ended December 31, 2012Research and development expense $100,149Selling, general and administrative expense 93,788Total stock-based compensation expense $193,93763Other CostsOther costs incurred in connection with the acquisition include (in thousands): Year Ended December 31, 2012 2011Transaction costs (e.g. investment advisory, legal and accounting fees) $10,635 $28,461Bridge financing costs 7,333 23,817Restructuring costs 15,125 —Total other costs $33,093 $52,278The following table summarizes these costs by the line item in the Consolidated Statement of Income in which these costs were recognized (in thousands): Year Ended December 31, 2012 2011Research and development expense $7,906 $—Selling, general and administrative expense 17,854 28,461Interest expense 7,333 23,817Total other costs $33,093 $52,278Liquidity and Capital Resources We believe that our existing capital resources, supplemented by our cash flows generated from operating activities, will be adequate to satisfy our capital needs for the foreseeable future. Our cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities and working capital decreased significantly in 2012 compared to 2011 as we completed our acquisition of Pharmasset in January 2012. The following table summarizes our cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities, working capital and cash flow activities as of the end of, and for each of, the periods presented: (In thousands) 2013 2012 2011As of December 31: Cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities $2,570,590 $2,582,086 $9,963,972Working capital (1) $948,332 $1,918,450 $11,431,584Year Ended December 31: Cash provided by (used in): Operating activities $3,104,988 $3,194,716 $3,639,010Investing activities $(254,355) $(11,846,054) $3,589,845Financing activities $(2,543,941) $563,346 $1,763,569 (1) Certain prior period amounts have been reclassified to conform to the current presentation.Cash, Cash Equivalents and Marketable Securities Cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities remained relatively flat at $2.57 billion at December 31, 2013, when compared to $2.58 billion at December 31, 2012. During 2013, we generated $3.10 billion in operating cash flows, paid $1.04 billion for the warrants related to our May 2013 Notes that settled in August 2013, repaid $1.67 billion in debt net of proceeds from convertible note hedges and utilized $378.6 million for the acquisition of YM, net of cash acquired.Cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities totaled $2.58 billion at December 31, 2012, a decrease of $7.38 billion or 74% from December 31, 2011 primarily due to our acquisition of Pharmasset for $11.05 billion in January 2012. Of the total cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities at December 31, 2013, approximately $1.55 billion was generated from operations in foreign jurisdictions and is intended for use in our foreign operations. We do not rely on unrepatriated earnings as a source of funds for our domestic business as we expect to have sufficient cash flow and borrowing capacity in the United States to fund our domestic operational and strategic needs. 64Working Capital Working capital was $948.3 million at December 31, 2013. The decrease of $970.1 million from working capital as of December 31, 2012 was due to an increase in the current portion of long-term debt and other accrued liabilities, partially offset by increases in accounts receivable, inventories and cash and cash equivalents.Working capital was $1.92 billion at December 31, 2012. The decrease of $9.51 billion from working capital as of December 31, 2011 was primarily attributable to $11.05 billion in cash used for the Pharmasset acquisition and an increase in short-term debt of $1.17 billion related to the current portion of the bank debt issued to finance the Pharmasset acquisition and the current portion of our May 2013 Notes.Cash Provided by Operating Activities Cash provided by operating activities of $3.10 billion in 2013 primarily related to net income of $3.06 billion, adjusted for non-cash items such as $344.7 million of depreciation and amortization expenses and $252.0 million of stock-based compensation expenses. This was partially offset by $562.7 million of net cash outflow related to changes in operating assets and liabilities. In February 2014, we collected approximately $250.0 million in past due accounts receivable from customers based in Spain.Cash provided by operating activities of $3.19 billion in 2012 primarily related to net income of $2.57 billion, adjusted for non-cash items such as $278.2 million of depreciation and amortization expenses, $208.7 million of stock-based compensation expenses, $107.6 million of net cash inflow related to changes in operating assets and liabilities and $112.6 million of tax benefits from employee stock plans.Cash provided by operating activities of $3.64 billion in 2011 primarily related to net income of $2.79 billion, adjusted for non-cash items such as $302.2 million of depreciation and amortization expenses, $211.9 million of net cash inflow related to changes in operating assets and liabilities and $192.4 million of stock-based compensation expenses. Cash Provided by (Used in) Investing Activities Cash used in investing activities in 2013 was $254.4 million, consisting primarily of $378.6 million used in our acquisition of YM, net of cash acquired and $190.8 million of capital expenditures primarily related to construction in progress associated with new facilities at our headquarters to support the ongoing growth of our business. This was partially offset by $315.1 million of net proceeds from sales of marketable securities.Cash used in investing activities in 2012 was $11.85 billion, consisting primarily of $10.75 billion used for our acquisition of Pharmasset, net of the stock-based compensation expense and cash acquired, $672.4 million of net purchases of marketable securities and $397.0 million of capital expenditures, related primarily to the purchase of an office building for $180.0 million and a $155.7 million increase in construction in progress associated with new facilities at our headquarters to support the ongoing growth of our business. Cash provided by investing activities in 2011 was $3.59 billion, consisting of $4.31 billion of net proceeds related to the sales of marketable securities in connection with our acquisition of Pharmasset, partially offset by $588.6 million used in our acquisitions of Arresto Biosciences, Inc. and Calistoga Pharmaceuticals, Inc. and $131.9 million of capital expenditures. Cash Provided by (Used in) Financing Activities Cash used in financing activities in 2013 was $2.54 billion, consisting primarily of $4.44 billion used to repay debt financing which includes the maturity of our May 2013 Notes and conversions of our May 2014 Notes and May 2016 Notes, $1.04 billion for the warrants related to our May 2013 Notes that settled in August 2013 and $582.4 million used to repurchase common stock under our stock repurchase program. This cash outflow was partially offset by proceeds of $2.77 billion related to our convertible note hedges.Cash provided by financing activities in 2012 was $563.3 million, driven primarily by net proceeds of $2.14 billion from the issuance of bank debt in conjunction with the Pharmasset acquisition, proceeds of $466.3 million from issuances of common stock under our employee stock plans and $213.9 million from proceeds received related to our convertible note hedges. The cash proceeds were partially offset by the $1.84 billion used to repay debt financing during the year and $667.0 million used to repurchase common stock under our stock repurchase programs. Cash provided by financing activities in 2011 was $1.76 billion, driven primarily by the issuance of $4.66 billion in senior unsecured notes, of which $3.67 billion was raised in December 2011 to partially fund the Pharmasset acquisition, net of issuance costs, and $211.7 million in proceeds from issuances of common stock under our employee stock plans. The cash 65proceeds were partially offset by $2.38 billion used to repurchase our common stock under our stock repurchase programs and $650.0 million used to repay our convertible senior notes due in May 2011. Debt and Credit FacilityBank DebtIn January 2012, in conjunction with our acquisition of Pharmasset, we entered into a five-year $1.25 billion revolving credit facility credit agreement (the Five-Year Revolving Credit Agreement), a $750.0 million short-term revolving credit facility credit agreement (the Short-Term Revolving Credit Agreement) and a $1.00 billion term loan facility (the Term Loan Credit Agreement). We borrowed $750.0 million under the Five-Year Revolving Credit Agreement, $400.0 million under the Short-Term Revolving Credit Agreement and $1.00 billion under the Term Loan Credit Agreement, upon the close of the acquisition. In 2012, we fully repaid the $1.40 billion in outstanding debt under the Term Loan Credit Agreement and the Short-Term Revolving Credit Agreement, at which time both agreements terminated. In 2013, we repaid $150.0 million under the Five-Year Revolving Credit Agreement.The Five-Year Revolving Credit Agreement contains customary representations, warranties, affirmative, negative and financial maintenance covenants and events of default. The loan bears interest at either (i) the Eurodollar Rate plus the Applicable Margin or (ii) the Base Rate plus the Applicable Margin, each as defined in the credit agreement. We may reduce the commitments and may prepay the loan in whole or in part at any time without premium or penalty. We are required to comply with certain covenants under the credit agreement and note indentures and as of December 31, 2013, we were in compliance with all such covenants.The Five-Year Revolving Credit Agreement was inclusive of a $30.0 million swing line loan sub-facility and a $25.0 million letter of credit sub-facility. As of December 31, 2013, we had $4.7 million in letters of credit outstanding under the Five-Year Revolving Credit Agreement. The Five-Year Revolving Credit Agreement will terminate and all amounts owed under the agreement shall be due and payable in January 2017.Maturity of May 2013 Convertible Senior NotesIn 2013, a portion of the May 2013 Notes was converted and on May 1, 2013, the remainder of the notes matured. We repaid an aggregate principal balance of $426.3 million. We also paid $714.0 million in cash related to the conversion spread of the notes, which represents the conversion value in excess of the principal amount, and received $714.0 million in cash from the convertible note hedges related to these notes. The warrants related to the May 2013 Notes expired in August 2013. We paid $1.04 billion to settle the warrants as the average market price of our common stock exceeded the warrants' exercise price.Convertible Senior Notes and Senior Unsecured NotesIn 2013, a portion of our May 2014 Notes and May 2016 Notes was converted and we repaid $1.09 billion of the principal balance, primarily comprised of May 2014 Notes. We also paid $2.06 billion in cash related to the conversion spread on these notes, which represents the conversion value in excess of the principal amount, and received $2.06 billion in cash from our convertible note hedges related to these notes.In 2014, our May 2014 Notes will mature and we will settle the related warrants. As our stock price currently exceeds the conversion and warrants’ exercise prices, we expect based on the stock price as of the filing of this form, to pay approximately $3.10 to $3.40 billion to settle the aggregate principal of our May 2014 Notes and the related warrants.66The following is a summary of our borrowings under various financing arrangements (in thousands, except percentages): Interest December 31,Type of Borrowing Description Issue Date Due Date Rate 2013 2012Convertible Senior May 2013 Notes April 2006 May 2013 0.625% $— $419,433Convertible Senior May 2014 Notes July 2010 May 2014 1.00% 234,217 1,210,213Convertible Senior May 2016 Notes July 2010 May 2016 1.625% 1,113,043 1,157,692Senior Unsecured April 2021 Notes March 2011 April 2021 4.50% 993,781 992,923Senior Unsecured December 2014 Notes December 2011 December 2014 2.40% 749,710 749,394Senior Unsecured December 2016 Notes December 2011 December 2016 3.05% 699,326 699,095Senior Unsecured December 2021 Notes December 2011 December 2021 4.40% 1,247,716 1,247,428Senior Unsecured December 2041 Notes December 2011 December 2041 5.65% 997,885 997,810Credit Facility Five-Year Revolver January 2012 January 2017 Variable 600,000 750,000Total debt, net 6,635,678 8,223,988Less current portion 2,696,970 1,169,433Total long-term debt, net $3,938,708 $7,054,555We believe our existing capital resources, supplemented by cash flows generated from our operations, will be adequate to satisfy our capital needs for the foreseeable future. During 2014, we will consider financing opportunities to better position us for further growth. The amount and terms of any potential financing opportunities, as well as other factors, could affect our liquidity and financial condition. Our future capital requirements will depend on many factors, including but not limited to the following: •the commercial performance of our current and future products; •the progress and scope of our R&D efforts, including preclinical studies and clinical trials; •the cost, timing and outcome of regulatory reviews; •the expansion of our sales and marketing capabilities; •administrative expenses; •the possibility of acquiring additional manufacturing capabilities or office facilities; •the possibility of acquiring other companies or new products; •costs associated with the settlement and conversion of our convertible senior notes and related warrants;•the establishment of additional collaborative relationships with other companies; and •costs associated with the defense, settlement and adverse results of litigation and government investigations. We may in the future require additional funding, which could be in the form of proceeds from equity or debt financings. If such funding is required, we cannot guarantee that it will be available to us on favorable terms, if at all. 67Critical Accounting Policies, Estimates and Judgments The discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based on our Consolidated Financial Statements, which have been prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses and related disclosures. On an ongoing basis, we evaluate our estimates, including those related to revenue recognition, allowance for doubtful accounts, valuation of intangible assets and contingent consideration liabilities resulting from business combinations and our tax provision. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other market specific and other relevant assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ significantly from these estimates. We believe the following critical accounting policies reflect the more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our Consolidated Financial Statements. Revenue Recognition Product Sales We recognize revenues from product sales when there is persuasive evidence that an arrangement exists, delivery to the customer has occurred, the price is fixed or determinable and collectability is reasonably assured. We record estimated reductions to revenues for government rebates such as Medicaid reimbursements, customer incentives such as cash discounts for prompt payment, distributor fees and expected returns of expired products. These estimates are deducted from gross product sales at the time such revenues are recognized. Of these reductions from gross product sales, government rebates significantly impact our reported net product sales and are based upon certain estimates that require complex and significant judgment by management. Estimates are assessed each period and updated to reflect current information such as actual experience.Accrued Government Rebates and Allowance for Government ChargebacksWe estimate reductions to our revenues for government-managed Medicaid programs as well as to certain other qualifying federal, state and foreign government programs for the reimbursement of portions of the retail price of prescriptions filled that are covered by these programs. These reductions are settled either by us if invoiced directly, or through charge-backs from our wholesalers. For qualified programs that can purchase our products through wholesalers at a lower contractual government price, the wholesalers charge back to us the difference between their acquisition cost and the lower contractual government price. Although we may pay rebates in countries outside of the United States, to date, payments made to foreign governments have not represented a significant portion of our total government rebates. Our estimate of government rebates that will be invoiced directly to us are recorded in accrued government rebates on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. Our estimate of government rebates that will be charged back through our wholesalers are recorded as allowances against accounts receivable. Our consolidated accrued government rebates totaled $983.5 million as of December 31, 2013 and $745.1 million as of December 31, 2012. Our consolidated allowance for government chargebacks totaled $148.5 million as of December 31, 2013 and $111.1 million as of December 31, 2012 and were recorded against accounts receivable.For government programs in the United States, our rebate allowances are estimated based on product sold, contractual terms, historical utilization rates and estimated population and channel inventory data obtained from our major U.S. wholesalers in accordance with our inventory management agreements. We also take into consideration new information regarding changes in these programs' regulations and guidelines that would impact the amount of the actual rebates and/or our expectations regarding future utilization rates for these programs. Our U.S. accrued government rebates totaled $959.9 million as of December 31, 2013 and $716.6 million as of December 31, 2012. Our U.S. allowance for government chargebacks totaled $148.5 million as of December 31, 2013 and $111.1 million as of December 31, 2012 and were recorded against accounts receivable. U.S. government rebates and chargebacks totaled $3.08 billion during 2013, and $2.59 billion during 2012, both representing 21%, of total gross product sales which were deducted from gross product sales. During 2011, U.S. government rebates and chargebacks totaling $1.86 billion, representing 17% of total gross product sales, were deducted from gross product sales. We believe that the methodology that we use to estimate our sales allowances for government price reductions is reasonable and appropriate given the current facts and circumstances. However, actual results in future periods may differ significantly. One of the provisions of the Affordable Care Act (ACA), which became effective in 2010, was the extension of the Medicaid drug rebate program to patients in Medicaid managed care insurance plans for whom rebates were previously not required. Estimating such rebates during the implementation of the ACA has been complex, in part, due to delays in actual claims data provided by the Medicaid program.68Amounts recorded as a reduction (increase) to product sales in 2013, 2012 and 2011 that related to prior periods were $(114.0) million, $10.5 million and $22.9 million, respectively. The increase to product sales of $114.0 million, of which approximately $72.2 million related to our estimate of 2012 claims and the rest related to our estimates of 2011 and other prior years’ claims, resulted in part, due to changes in our estimates of Medicaid managed care rebates. Based on the current information available to us, actual government rebates and chargebacks claimed for prior periods have varied by less than 3% from our estimates.The following table summarizes the aggregate activity in our U.S. government rebates allowance and accrued government rebate accounts (in thousands): Accrued government rebates and allowance for government chargebacks: Balance atBeginningof Year Reduction/(Increase) to Product Sales DeductedfromAccruals Balance atEnd ofYearYear ended December 31, 2013: Activity related to 2013 sales $— $3,197,052 $2,182,454 $1,014,598Activity related to sales prior to 2013 827,691 (114,048) 619,782 93,861Total $827,691 $3,083,004 $2,802,236 $1,108,459Year ended December 31, 2012: Activity related to 2012 sales $— $2,580,317 $1,836,199 $744,118Activity related to sales prior to 2012 597,693 10,511 524,631 83,573Total $597,693 $2,590,828 $2,360,830 $827,691Allowance for Doubtful Accounts We maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments. This allowance is based on our analysis of several factors including, but not limited to, contractual payment terms, historical payment patterns of our customers and individual customer circumstances, an analysis of days sales outstanding by geographic region and a review of the local economic environment and its potential impact on government funding and reimbursement practices. If the financial condition of our customers or the economic environment in which they operate were to deteriorate, resulting in an inability to make payments, additional allowances may be required. We believe that the allowance for doubtful accounts is adequate; however, significant deterioration in any of the above factors could materially change these expectations and may result in an increase to our allowance for doubtful accounts. As of December 31, 2013 and 2012, our allowance for doubtful accounts was $58.9 million and $50.9 million, respectively.Valuation of Intangible AssetsIn conjunction with our business combinations, we have recorded intangible assets primarily related to IPR&D projects. We had total intangible assets of $11.90 billion as of December 31, 2013 and $11.74 billion as of December 31, 2012. As part of our Pharmasset acquisition, we acquired intangible assets, primarily comprised of the sofosbuvir IPR&D compound, which had an estimated fair value of $10.72 billion as of the date of acquisition. In December 2013, following the approval by the FDA and commercialization of sofosbuvir as Sovaldi, we reclassified the $10.72 billion purchased IPR&D project from an indefinite-lived to finite-lived intangible asset. We are amortizing this asset over its estimated useful life, utilizing the straight-line method. The identifiable intangible assets are measured at their respective fair values as of the acquisition date. The models used in valuing these intangible assets require the use of significant estimates and assumptions including but not limited to:•estimates of revenues and operating profits related to the products or product candidates;•the probability of success for unapproved product candidates considering their stages of development;•the time and resources needed to complete the development and approval of product candidates;•the life of the potential commercialized products and associated risks, including the inherent difficulties and uncertainties in developing a product candidate such as obtaining FDA and other regulatory approvals; and•risks related to the viability of and potential alternative treatments in any future target markets.We believe the fair values used to record intangible assets acquired in connection with a business combination are based upon reasonable estimates and assumptions given the facts and circumstances as of the related valuation dates. Intangible assets related to IPR&D projects are considered to be indefinite-lived until the completion or abandonment of the associated R&D efforts. If and when development is complete, which generally occurs if and when regulatory approval to market a product is obtained, the associated assets would be deemed finite-lived and would then be amortized based on their 69respective estimated useful lives at that point in time. During the period the assets are considered indefinite-lived, they will not be amortized but will be tested for impairment on an annual basis as well as between annual tests if we become aware of any events or changes that would indicate that it is more likely than not that the fair value of the IPR&D projects below their respective carrying amounts. The fair value of our indefinite-lived intangible assets is dependent on assumptions such as the expected timing or probability of achieving the specified milestones, changes in projected revenues or changes in discount rates. Significant judgment is employed in determining these assumptions and changes to our assumptions could have a significant impact on our results of operations in any given period.Intangible assets with finite useful lives are amortized over their estimated useful lives primarily on a straight-line basis. Intangible assets with finite useful lives are reviewed for impairment when facts or circumstances suggest that the carrying value of these assets may not be recoverable.Valuation of Contingent Consideration Liabilities Resulting from Business CombinationsIn conjunction with our business combinations, we have recorded contingent consideration liabilities payable upon the achievement of specified development, regulatory approval or sales-based milestone events. The contingent consideration liabilities are measured at their respective fair values as of the acquisition date. The models used in valuing these contingent consideration liabilities require the use of significant estimates and assumptions including but not limited to: •estimates of revenues and operating profits related to the products or product candidates; •the probability of success for unapproved product candidates considering their stages of development; •the time and resources needed to complete the development and approval of product candidates; •the life of the potential commercialized products and associated risks, including the inherent difficulties and uncertainties in developing a product candidate such as obtaining FDA and other regulatory approvals; and •risks related to the viability of and potential alternative treatments in any future target markets. We revalue contingent consideration obligations each quarter following the acquisition and record increases or decreases in their fair value in R&D expense within our Consolidated Statement of Income. Increases or decreases in the fair value of our contingent consideration liabilities can result from updates to assumptions such as the expected timing or probability of achieving the specified milestones, changes in projected revenues or changes in discount rates. Significant judgment is employed in determining these assumptions as of the acquisition date and for each subsequent period. Updates to assumptions could have a significant impact on our results of operations in any given period. Actual results may differ from estimates.We had total contingent consideration liabilities of $263.8 million as of December 31, 2013 and $205.1 million as of December 31, 2012.Tax Provision We estimate our income tax provision, including deferred tax assets and liabilities, based on significant management judgment. We evaluate the realization of all or a portion of our deferred tax assets on a quarterly basis. We record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets to the amounts that are more likely than not to be realized. We consider future taxable income, ongoing tax planning strategies and our historical financial performance in assessing the need for a valuation allowance. If we expect to realize deferred tax assets for which we have previously recorded a valuation allowance, we will reduce the valuation allowance in the period in which such determination is first made. Various factors may have favorable or unfavorable effects on our income tax rate. These factors include, but are not limited to, interpretations of existing tax laws, changes in tax laws and rates, our portion of the non-tax deductible pharmaceutical excise tax, the accounting for stock options and other share-based payments, mergers and acquisitions, the ability to manufacture product in our Cork, Ireland facility, the amortization of certain acquisition related intangibles for which we receive no tax benefit, expiration of the federal research tax credit, future levels of R&D spending, changes in accounting standards, changes in the mix of earnings in the various tax jurisdictions in which we operate, changes in overall levels of pre-tax earnings and resolution of federal, state and foreign income tax audits. The impact on our income tax provision resulting from the above mentioned factors may be significant and could have a negative impact on our net income. 70We record liabilities related to uncertain tax positions in accordance with the guidance that clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in an enterprise's financial statements by prescribing a minimum recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. We do not believe any such uncertain tax positions currently pending will have a material adverse effect on our Consolidated Financial Statements, although an adverse resolution of one or more of these uncertain tax positions in any period could have a material impact on the results of operations for that period. At December 31, 2013 and 2012, we had total federal, state and foreign unrecognized tax benefits of $236.5 million and $157.0 million, respectively. Of the total unrecognized tax benefits, $195.1 million and $126.5 million at December 31, 2013 and 2012, respectively, if recognized, would reduce our effective tax rate in the period of recognition. As of December 31, 2013, we believe that it is reasonably possible that our unrecognized tax benefits will decrease by approximately $9.0 million in the next 12 months as we expect to have clarification from the IRS and other tax authorities regarding our uncertain tax positions. With respect to the remaining unrecognized tax benefits, we are currently unable to make a reasonable estimate as to the period of cash settlement, if any, with the respective tax authorities. We file federal, state and foreign income tax returns in many jurisdictions in the United States and abroad. For federal income tax purposes, the statute of limitations is open for 2008 and onwards. For certain acquired entities, the statute of limitations is open for all years from inception due to our utilization of their net operating losses and credits carried over from prior years. For California income tax purposes, the statute of limitations is open for 2008 and onwards. Our income tax returns are audited by federal, state and foreign tax authorities. We are currently under examination by the IRS for the 2010, 2011 and 2012 tax years and by various state and foreign jurisdictions. There are differing interpretations of tax laws and regulations, and as a result, significant disputes may arise with these tax authorities involving issues of the timing and amount of deductions and allocations of income among various tax jurisdictions. We periodically evaluate our exposures associated with our tax filing positions. Off Balance Sheet Arrangements We do not have any off balance sheet arrangements as defined in Item 303(a)(4)(ii) of Regulation S-K. Contractual Obligations Our contractual obligations consist of debt obligations, operating leases, capital commitments, purchase obligations for active pharmaceutical ingredients and inventory-related items and clinical trials contracts. The following table summarizes our significant enforceable and legally binding obligations, future commitments and obligations related to all contracts that we are likely to continue regardless of the fact that certain of these obligations may be cancelable as of December 31, 2013 (in thousands): Payments due by PeriodContractual Obligations Total Less than oneyear 1-3 years 3-5 years More than 5yearsDebt (1) $9,201,555 $3,005,855 $1,055,700 $313,000 $4,827,000Operating lease obligations 226,313 48,976 87,729 57,686 31,922Capital commitments (2) 42,538 42,538 — — —Purchase obligations (3)(4) 1,990,598 1,588,544 324,974 77,080 —Clinical trials (5) 429,365 218,915 150,496 49,705 10,249Total $11,890,369 $4,904,828 $1,618,899 $497,471 $4,869,171 (1) Our debt obligations include convertible senior notes, senior unsecured notes and Five-Year Revolving Credit Agreement. We incur future interest payments based on fixed rates of 1.00% and 1.625% for May 2014 Notes and May 2016 Notes, respectively and 2.40%, 3.05%, 4.50%, 4.40% and 5.65% for our senior unsecured notes due in December 2014, December 2016, April 2021, December 2021 and December 2041, respectively. The Five-Year Revolving Credit Agreement incurs interest based on variable interest rates. During 2013, the portion of interest expense related to variable interest totaled $7.8 million.(2) At December 31, 2013, we had firm capital project commitments of approximately $42.5 million primarily relating to facilities improvement projects. (3) At December 31, 2013, we had firm purchase commitments related to active pharmaceutical ingredients and certain inventory-related items. These amounts include minimum purchase requirements and actual purchases are expected to significantly exceed these amounts. 71(4) In addition to the above, we have committed to make potential future milestone payments to third parties as part of licensing, collaboration and development arrangements. Payments under these agreements generally become due and payable only upon achievement of certain developmental, regulatory and/or commercial milestones. Because the achievement of these milestones is neither probable nor reasonably estimable, such contingencies have not been recorded on our Consolidated Balance Sheets and have not been included in the table above. (5) At December 31, 2013, we had several clinical studies in various clinical trial phases. Our most significant clinical trial expenditures are to CROs. Although all of our material contracts with CROs are cancelable, we historically have not canceled such contracts. These amounts reflect commitments based on existing contracts and do not reflect any future modifications to, or terminations of, existing contracts or anticipated or potential new contracts. We had total gross unrecognized tax benefit liabilities of $261.5 million as of December 31, 2013. We believe that it is reasonably possible that our unrecognized tax benefits will decrease by approximately $9.0 million in the next 12 months as we expect to have clarification from the IRS and other tax authorities regarding our uncertain tax positions. With respect to the remaining unrecognized tax benefits, we are currently unable to make a reasonable estimate as to the period of cash settlement, if any, with the respective tax authorities. The unrecognized tax benefits were included in current and long-term income taxes payable and long-term deferred tax assets on our Consolidated Balance Sheet and have not been included in the table above. Recent Accounting PronouncementsIn February 2013, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued an update to the existing standard for liabilities. The update provides guidance for the recognition, measurement and disclosure of obligations resulting from joint and several liability arrangements. For obligations for which the total amount is fixed at the reporting date, an entity will be required to measure those obligations as the sum of the amount the reporting entity agreed to pay on the basis of its arrangement among its co-obligors and any additional amount the reporting entity expects to pay on behalf of its co-obligors. Such entities will also be required to disclose the nature, amount and other significant information about the obligations. This guidance will become effective for us beginning in the first quarter of 2014. We believe that the adoption of this update will not have a material impact on our Consolidated Financial Statements. In July 2013, the FASB issued an update related to presentation of an unrecognized tax benefit when a net operating loss carryforward, a similar tax loss or a tax credit carryforward exists. An unrecognized tax benefit, or a portion of an unrecognized tax benefit, should be presented in the financial statements as a reduction to a deferred tax asset for a net operating loss carryforward, a similar tax loss or a tax credit carryforward, except as follows. To the extent a net operating loss carryforward, a similar tax loss or a tax credit carryforward is not available at the reporting date under the tax law of the applicable jurisdiction to settle any additional income taxes that would result from the disallowance of a tax position or the tax law of the applicable jurisdiction does not require the entity to use, and the entity does not intend to use, the deferred tax asset for such purpose, the unrecognized tax benefit should be presented in the financial statements as a liability and should not be combined with deferred tax assets. This guidance will become effective for us beginning in the first quarter of 2014. We believe that the adoption of this update will not have a material impact on our Consolidated Financial Statements.ITEM 7A.QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK We are exposed to market risks that may result from changes in foreign currency exchange rates, interest rates and credit risks. To reduce certain of these risks, we enter into various types of foreign currency or interest rate derivative hedging transactions, follow investment guidelines and monitor outstanding receivables as part of our risk management program.Foreign Currency Exchange Risk Our operations include manufacturing and sales activities in the United States, Canada and Ireland as well as sales activities in countries outside the United States, including Europe and Asia Pacific. As a result, our financial results could be significantly affected by factors such as changes in foreign currency exchange rates or weak economic conditions in the foreign markets in which we distribute our products. Our operating results are exposed to changes in foreign currency exchange rates between the U.S. dollar and various foreign currencies, the most significant of which is the Euro. When the U.S. dollar strengthens against these currencies, the relative value of sales made in the respective foreign currency decreases. Conversely, when the U.S. dollar weakens against these currencies, the relative amounts of such sales increase. Overall, we are a net receiver of foreign currencies and, therefore, benefit from a weaker U.S. dollar and are adversely affected by a stronger U.S. dollar relative to those foreign currencies in which we transact significant amounts of business. Approximately 40% of our product sales were denominated in foreign currencies during 2013. To partially mitigate the impact of changes in currency exchange rates on net cash flows from our foreign currency denominated sales, we may enter into foreign currency exchange forward and option contracts. We also hedge certain monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies, which reduces but does not eliminate our exposure to currency fluctuations between the date a transaction 72is recorded and the date that cash is collected or paid. In general, the market risks of these contracts are offset by corresponding gains and losses on the transactions being hedged. As of December 31, 2013 and 2012, we had open foreign currency forward contracts with notional amounts of $4.28 billion and $3.39 billion, respectively. A hypothetical 10% adverse movement in foreign currency exchange rates compared with the U.S. dollar relative to exchange rates at December 31, 2013, would have resulted in a reduction in fair value of these contracts of approximately $435.0 million on this date and, if realized, would negatively affect earnings over the remaining life of the contracts. The same hypothetical movement in foreign currency exchange rates compared with the U.S. dollar relative to exchange rates at December 31, 2012, would have resulted in a reduction in fair value of these contracts of approximately $350.0 million on this date and, if realized, would negatively affect earnings over the remaining life of the contracts. The analysis does not consider the impact that hypothetical changes in foreign currency exchange rates would have on anticipated transactions that these foreign currency sensitive instruments were designed to offset.Interest Rate Risk Our portfolio of available-for-sale marketable securities and our fixed and variable rate liabilities create an exposure to interest rate risk. With respect to our investment portfolio, we adhere to an investment policy that requires us to limit amounts invested in securities based on credit rating, maturity, industry group and investment type and issuer, except for securities issued by the U.S. government. The goals of our investment policy, in order of priority, are as follows: • safety and preservation of principal and diversification of risk; • liquidity of investments sufficient to meet cash flow requirements; and • competitive after-tax rate of return. The following table summarizes the expected maturities and average interest rates of our interest-generating assets and fixed interest-bearing liabilities at December 31, 2013 (in thousands, except percentages): Expected Maturity Total Fair Value at December 31, 2013 2014 2015 2016 2017 2018 Thereafter Total Assets Available-for-sale debt securities $18,756 $255,176 $157,450 $7,130 $13,759 $5,513 $457,784 $457,784Average interest rate 0.4% 0.4% 0.7% 0.6% 0.9% 2.8% Liabilities Debt (1) $2,161,091 $— $700,000 $— $— $3,250,000 $6,111,091 $9,689,387Average interest rate 1.8% —% 3.1% —% —% 4.8% (1) In December 2011, we issued senior unsecured notes due in December 2014, 2016, 2021 and 2041 in a registered offering. The notes pay interest at fixed annual rates ranging from 2.40% to 5.65%. In March 2011, we issued senior unsecured notes due in April 2021 in a registered offering. The notes pay interest at a fixed annual rate of 4.50%.In July 2010, we issued convertible senior notes due in May 2014 and May 2016 (May 2014 Notes and May 2016 Notes) in a private placement pursuant to Rule 144A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended. The May 2014 Notes and May 2016 Notes were issued at par and bear interest rates of 1.00% and 1.625%, respectively, and may be converted into shares of our common stock subject to certain circumstances.In 2012, in connection with our acquisition of Pharmasset, we entered into credit agreements that are subject to variable interest rates. During 2013, the portion of interest expense related to variable interest totaled $7.8 million.Credit RiskWe are subject to credit risk from our portfolio of cash equivalents and marketable securities. Under our investment policy, we limit amounts invested in such securities by credit rating, maturity, industry group, investment type and issuer, except for securities issued by the U.S. government. We are not exposed to any significant concentrations of credit risk from these financial instruments. The goals of our investment policy, in order of priority, are as follows: safety and preservation of principal and diversification of risk; liquidity of investments sufficient to meet cash flow requirements; and a competitive after-tax rate of return. 73We are also subject to credit risk from our accounts receivable related to our product sales. The majority of our trade accounts receivable arises from product sales in the United States and Europe. During the second quarter of 2012, we received payment on $460.6 million in past due accounts receivable from customers based in Spain. Included in this amount were proceeds from a one-time factoring arrangement where we sold receivables with a carrying value of $319.8 million, net of the allowance for doubtful accounts. We received proceeds of $349.7 million and recorded a gain of $29.9 million, resulting primarily from the reversal of the related allowance for doubtful accounts. This gain was recorded as an offset to SG&A expenses in our Consolidated Statement of Income. Subsequent to this transaction, we have had no continuing involvement with the transferred receivables, which were derecognized at the time of the sale.As of December 31, 2013, our accounts receivable in Southern Europe, specifically Greece, Italy, Portugal and Spain, totaled approximately $845.7 million, of which $402.4 million were greater than 120 days past due and $175.7 million were greater than 365 days past due. As of December 31, 2012, our accounts receivable in Southern Europe, specifically Greece, Italy, Portugal and Spain totaled approximately $822.4 million, of which $331.6 million were greater than 120 days past due and $106.3 million were greater than 365 days past due. To date, we have not experienced significant losses with respect to the collection of our accounts receivable. We believe that our allowance for doubtful accounts was adequate at December 31, 2013.74",2023-12-30 19:04:30.713824

MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS The following Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (MD&A) is intended to help the reader understand our results of operations and financial condition. MD&A is provided as a supplement to, and should be read in conjunction with, our audited Consolidated Financial Statements and the accompanying Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements and other disclosures included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K (including the disclosures under Item 1A, Risk Factors). Our Consolidated Financial Statements have been prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles and are presented in U.S. dollars. Management OverviewGilead Sciences, Inc. (Gilead, we or us), incorporated in Delaware on June 22, 1987, is a research-based biopharmaceutical company that discovers, develops and commercializes innovative medicines in areas of unmet medical need. With each new discovery and investigational drug candidate, we strive to transform and simplify care for people with life-threatening illnesses around the world. Gilead's primary areas of focus include human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), liver diseases such as chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection and chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection, oncology and inflammation, and serious cardiovascular and respiratory conditions. We have operations in more than 30 countries worldwide, with headquarters in Foster City, California. We continue to add to our existing portfolio of products through our internal discovery and clinical development programs and through a product acquisition and in-licensing strategy. Our portfolio of marketed products includes Sovaldi®, Atripla®, Truvada®, Harvoni®, Complera®/Eviplera®, Stribild®, Viread®, Letairis®, Ranexa®, AmBisome®, Zydelig®, Cayston®, Hepsera®, Emtriva®, Tybost®, Vitekta® and Tamiflu®. We have U.S. and international commercial sales operations, with marketing subsidiaries in North and South America, Europe and Asia-Pacific. We also sell and distribute certain products through our corporate partners under royalty-paying collaborative agreements.Business HighlightsDuring 2014, we continued to advance our product pipeline across our therapeutic areas with the goal of delivering best-in-class drugs that advance the current standard of care and/or address unmet medical needs. Highlights of our 2014 announcements include:Antiviral Program•received approval from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in October 2014 and the European Commission in November 2014 for Harvoni (ledipasvir 90mg/sofosbuvir 400mg), the first once-daily single tablet regimen for the treatment of HCV genotype 1 infection in adults; •received approval from the European Commission for Sovaldi in combination with other antiviral agents ribavirin and pegylated interferon alpha in all 28 countries of the European Union (EU) in January 2014;•submitted a new drug application (NDA) to Japan’s Pharmaceutical and Medical Devices Agency for approval of sofosbuvir and our single tablet regimen of ledipasvir/sofosbuvir for the treatment of chronic genotype 1 HCV infection in adults;•received approval from the FDA for Tybost, a pharmacokinetic enhancer that boosts blood levels of certain HIV medicines, and Vitekta, an integrase inhibitor for the treatment of HIV infection in adults without known mutations associated with resistance to elvitegravir;•submitted a NDA to the FDA for approval of a single tablet regimen containing elvitegravir, cobicistat, emtricitabine and tenofovir alafenamide (E/C/F/TAF) for the treatment of HIV infection in adults;•announced an expansion to our agreement with Janssen R&D Ireland Limited (Janssen) for the development and commercialization of a new single tablet regimen containing our TAF and emtricitabine, and Janssen's rilpivirine (RFTAF). We also amended our agreement with Janssen to collaborate on a single tablet regimen for HIV infection containing our TAF, emtricitabine and cobicistat and Janssen's darunavir;56•entered into an agreement with Phenex Pharmaceuticals AG (Phenex) in December 2014 under which we acquired Phenex’s Farnesoid X Receptor (FXR) program comprised of small molecule FXR agonists for the treatment of liver diseases, including nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH);•announced non-exclusive licensing agreements with India-based generic pharmaceutical manufacturers to expand access to our chronic HCV medicines in developing countries;•announced a new agreement with the Medicines Patent Pool to expand access to TAF for HIV and HBV, contingent on FDA approval.Oncology Program•received approval from the FDA in July 2014 and the European Commission in September 2014 for Zydelig for the treatment of three B-cell blood cancers. Zydelig is indicated in combination with rituximab for patients with relapsed chronic lymphocytic leukemia and as a monotherapy for patients with relapsed follicular lymphoma and small lymphocytic lymphoma;•entered into an exclusive license agreement with ONO Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd. (ONO), for the development and commercialization of ONO's oral Bruton's tyrosine kinase inhibitor for the treatment of B-cell malignancies and other diseases. Cardiovascular Program•announced positive results from the AMBITION study (a randomized, double-blind, multicenter study of first-line combination therapy with Letairis (ambrisentan) and tadalafil in patients with pulmonary arterial hypertension), which was conducted in collaboration with GlaxoSmithKline plc. We have filed a supplemental NDA in the United States to cover the use of ambrisentan in combination with tadalafil.Outlook 2015In 2015, we will continue to focus on our key operating objectives which include the progression of our product pipeline and continued uptake of our commercial products. From a research and development (R&D) perspective, we will continue to invest in conducting new and ongoing clinical studies, which support both our existing products and our product candidates. We expect to move forward on a number of late-stage clinical studies for new product candidates and plan to file marketing applications for product candidates in various therapeutic areas.From a commercial perspective, we will continue to focus on supporting the uptake of our single tablet regimens for the treatment of HIV, prepare for the launch of our new single tablet regimen containing TAF in the United States and continue to promote the use of Sovaldi, Harvoni and Zydelig in the United States and Europe. We plan to further build-out and expand our international commercial infrastructure in Asia, in particular Japan, and other international markets to support the anticipated launch of Sovaldi and Harvoni in those regions.As a result of the launch of Sovaldi and Harvoni in the United States and Sovaldi in parts of Europe, our business more than doubled in 2014. While we do not expect this level of growth in 2015, we do anticipate overall net product sales growth as we expect expanded access to Sovaldi and Harvoni in the United States and the launch of Harvoni in additional European Union countries and other international markets. However, this growth is subject to a number of uncertainties. These uncertainties include the continuation of a challenging macroeconomic environment in Europe inclusive of the potential adoption of additional pricing measures to reduce healthcare spending, particularly in HCV, the potential for continued volatility in foreign currency exchange rates, the number of HCV patients treated, an increase in discounts, chargebacks and rebates due to ongoing private and public payer negotiations, a larger than anticipated shift in payer mix to more highly discounted payer segments and the regulatory approval and commercial launches of Sovaldi and Harvoni in Japan.We expect that our product pipeline investments and expanding commercial infrastructure will enable us to execute on our 2015 operating objectives.572014 Financial Highlights During 2014, total revenues increased to $24.9 billion and total product sales increased to $24.5 billion, compared to $11.2 billion and $10.8 billion respectively, in 2013, driven primarily by sales of Sovaldi and Harvoni and increased sales of our HIV single tablet regimen products, Stribild and Complera/Eviplera. Sovaldi was approved in the United States in December 2013 and in the European Union in January 2014. Sovaldi is now available in over 40 countries. Harvoni was approved in the United States in October 2014 and in the European Union in November 2014. R&D expenses increased 35% to $2.9 billion for 2014 compared to 2013 due to continued investment in the progression and expansion in our product pipeline. Selling, general and administrative (SG&A) expenses increased 76% to $3.0 billion for 2014 compared to 2013 due to increased costs to support our business expansion related primarily to liver diseases and oncology and an increase in the Branded Prescription Drug fee (the BPD fee).Net income attributable to Gilead for 2014 was $12.1 billion or $7.35 per diluted share, compared to $3.1 billion or $1.81 per diluted share in 2013, due primarily to the launch of Sovaldi and Harvoni, partially offset by the increases in operating expenses.As of December 31, 2014, our cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities totaled $11.7 billion. During 2014, we generated $12.8 billion in operating cash flows, issued $8.0 billion in senior unsecured notes and repaid $2.3 billion in debt.Results of Operations Total Revenues Total revenues include product sales and royalty, contract and other revenues. Total revenues were $24.9 billion in 2014, compared to $11.2 billion in 2013 and $9.7 billion in 2012. Product sales represented 98%, 96% and 97% of total revenues in 2014, 2013 and 2012, respectively. Product Sales Total product sales were $24.5 billion in 2014, compared to $10.8 billion in 2013 and $9.4 billion in 2012, driven primarily by an increase in antiviral product sales. Antiviral product sales were $22.8 billion in 2014, $9.3 billion in 2013 and $8.1 billion in 2012. The increase in antiviral product sales in 2014 was driven primarily by sales of Sovaldi and Harvoni and in 2013 was driven primarily by the continued uptake of our HIV single tablet regimen products, primarily Stribild and Complera/Eviplera. Other product sales which include Letairis, Ranexa, AmBisome and Zydelig, our first oncology product which launched in 2014, were $1.7 billion in 2014, an increase of 15% compared to $1.5 billion in 2013, an increase of 16% over other product sales of $1.3 billion in 2012. In 2014 approximately 26% of our product sales were generated outside the United States. We face exposure to adverse movements in foreign currency exchange rates, primarily in the Euro. We used foreign currency exchange contracts to hedge a percentage of our foreign currency exposure. Foreign currency exchange, net of hedges, had a favorable impact of $39 million on our 2014 revenues compared to 2013 and an unfavorable impact of $65 million on our 2013 revenues compared to 2012.We record product sales net of estimated mandatory and supplemental discounts to government payers, in addition to discounts to private payers, and other related costs. These deductions are generally referred to as gross-to-net deductions and totaled $7.3 billion in 2014, $3.9 billion in 2013, and $3.1 billion in 2012. As a percentage of gross product sales, gross-to-net deductions were 23% in 2014, 26% in 2013 and 25% in 2012. The decline in gross-to-net deductions as a percentage of gross product sales in 2014 compared to 2013 was primarily due to change in our payer mix reflecting a higher proportion of private payers compared to the prior year given the launch of Sovaldi in December 2013 and Harvoni in October 2014. The increase in gross-to-net deductions as a percentage of gross product sales in 2013 compared to 2012 resulted primarily from changes in payer mix, while the dollar increase resulted from payer mix and a higher level of gross product sales.Product sales in the United States increased to $18.1 billion for 2014 compared to $6.6 billion in 2013, due primarily to sales of Sovaldi and Harvoni and increases in sales of Stribild and Complera. Product sales in the United States increased 20% for 2013 compared to $5.5 billion in 2012, driven by sales growth of our single tablet regimen products, specifically Stribild and Complera as well as the launch of Sovaldi. During the fourth quarters of 2014 and 2013, we noted inventory levels at the high end of the inventory management agreement range. As we have seen in years past, we believe that inventory could draw down in the first quarter of 2015 and then track more normally with demand through the rest of 2015. Product sales in Europe increased by 54% in 2014 to $5.1 billion compared to $3.3 billion in 2013, due primarily to sales of Sovaldi and increases in sales of Stribild and Eviplera. Product sales in Europe increased 6% in 2013 to $3.3 billion compared to $3.1 billion in 2012, driven primarily by higher underlying demand for our antiviral products, specifically Eviplera, partially offset by decreases in the average net selling price of our HIV products. Foreign currency exchange, net of 58hedges, had a favorable impact of $72 million on our European product sales for 2014 compared to 2013 and an unfavorable impact of $55 million on our European product sales in 2013 compared to 2012. The following table summarizes the period over period changes in our product sales:(In millions, except percentages) 2014 Change 2013 Change 2012Antiviral products: Sovaldi $10,283 * $139 * $—Atripla 3,470 (5)% 3,648 2 % 3,574Truvada 3,340 7 % 3,136 (1)% 3,181Harvoni 2,127 * — * —Complera/Eviplera 1,228 52 % 810 137 % 342Stribild 1,197 122 % 539 * 58Viread 1,058 10 % 959 13 % 849Other antiviral 88 (21)% 111 (20)% 138Total antiviral products 22,791 144 % 9,342 15 % 8,142Other products: Letairis 595 14 % 520 27 % 410Ranexa 510 14 % 449 20 % 373AmBisome 388 10 % 352 1 % 346Zydelig 23 * — * —Other 167 18 % 141 13 % 127Total product sales $24,474 127 % $10,804 15 % $9,398* Percentage not meaningfulAntiviral ProductsAntiviral product sales increased by 144% in 2014 compared to 2013 and by 15% in 2013 compared to 2012. The following is additional discussion of our results by product: •HCV ProductsIn 2014, sales of Sovaldi and Harvoni (HCV products) were $12.4 billion. HCV product sales accounted for 54% of our total antiviral product sales for the year. HCV product sales were $10.5 billion in the United States and $1.6 billion in Europe in 2014. Since the launch of Sovaldi in December 2013 and Harvoni in October 2014, more than 170,000 patients around the world have been treated with a sofosbuvir-based regimen.•Atripla Atripla sales accounted for 15%, 39% and 44% of our total antiviral product sales for 2014, 2013 and 2012, respectively, and decreased by 5% in 2014 compared to 2013, due primarily to declines in volume as doctors prescribed newer treatments such as Complera/Eviplera and Stribild. The efavirenz component of Atripla, which has a gross margin of zero, comprised $1.3 billion, $1.4 billion and $1.3 billion of our Atripla sales in 2014, 2013 and 2012, respectively. A generic version of Bristol-Myers Squibb Company's Sustiva (efavirenz), a component of Atripla, was made available in Canada and Europe in 2013 and will be made available in the United States in 2017. While we have observed some pricing pressure related to the efavirenz component of our Atripla sales, we have not yet observed any meaningful splitting of the Atripla single tablet regimen.•Truvada In 2014, Truvada sales increased by 7% compared to 2013 due primarily to an increase in the average net selling price and sales volume growth in the United States. In 2013, decreases in Truvada sales were due to lower sales volume, partially offset by an increase in average net selling price. Truvada sales accounted for 15%, 34% and 39% of our total antiviral product sales for 2014, 2013 and 2012, respectively. •Complera/EvipleraIn 2014, sales of Complera/Eviplera were $1.2 billion an increase of 52% compared to 2013. Increases in sales of Complera/Eviplera in both 2014 and 2013 were driven primarily by sales volume growth in Europe and the United States. In 2012, Complera/Eviplera sales increased due primarily to sales volume growth in the United States. 59•StribildIn 2014, sales of Stribild were $1.2 billion, an increase of 122% compared to 2013, due primarily to increased sales volume in the United States and Europe. In 2013 and 2012, increases in sales of Stribild were driven primarily by sales volume growth in the United States. Other ProductsOther products which include Letairis, Ranexa, AmBisome and Zydelig, our first oncology product which launched in 2014, were $1.7 billion in 2014 compared to $1.5 billion in 2013. The increase in other product sales is due primarily to increased sales volume.Royalty, Contract and Other Revenues The following table summarizes the period over period changes in our royalty, contract and other revenues: (In millions, except percentages) 2014 Change 2013 Change 2012Royalty, contract and other revenues $416 5% $398 31% $304Royalty, contract and other revenues includes royalty revenues from F. Hoffman-La Roche Ltd (Roche) for sales of Tamiflu. The majority of our royalties are recognized in the quarter following the quarter in which the corresponding product sales occur.Cost of Goods Sold and Product Gross MarginThe following table summarizes the period over period changes in our product sales, cost of goods sold and product gross margin: (In millions, except percentages) 2014 Change 2013 Change 2012Total product sales $24,474 127% $10,804 15% $9,398Cost of goods sold $3,788 32% $2,859 16% $2,471Product gross margin 85% 74% 74%Our product gross margin for 2014 increased compared to 2013 primarily due to changes in product mix, resulting from the launches of Sovaldi and Harvoni. Our product gross margin for 2013 was consistent with our product gross margin for 2012.Research and Development Expenses The following table summarizes the period over period changes in R&D expenses:(In millions, except percentages) 2014 Change 2013 Change 2012Research and development $2,854 35% $2,120 20% $1,760R&D expenses summarized above consist primarily of clinical studies performed by contract research organizations, materials and supplies, licenses and fees, milestone payments under collaboration arrangements, personnel costs, including salaries, benefits and stock-based compensation and overhead allocations consisting of various support and facilities-related costs. We do not track total R&D expenses by product candidate, therapeutic area or development phase. However, we manage our R&D expenses by identifying the R&D activities we anticipate will be performed during a given period and then prioritizing efforts based on scientific data, probability of successful development, market potential, available human and capital resources and other considerations. We continually review our R&D pipeline and the status of development and, as necessary, reallocate resources among the R&D portfolio that we believe will best support the future growth of our business.The following table provides a breakout of R&D expenses by major cost type: (In millions, except percentages) 2014 2013 2012Clinical studies and outside services $1,688 $1,147 $828Personnel and infrastructure expenses 900 714 686Facilities, IT and other costs 266 259 246Total $2,854 $2,120 $1,76060In 2014, R&D expenses increased $734 million or 35% compared to 2013, due primarily to an increase in clinical studies and outside services. The increase in clinical studies and outside services includes one-time items of $350 million for collaboration and acquisition related expenses and the purchase of a FDA priority review voucher and $191 million for expenses related to the progression of clinical study activity, primarily in the oncology and HIV areas. Personnel and infrastructure expenses increased $186 million to support our ongoing clinical study activity, geographic expansion and marketed product support. In 2013, R&D expenses increased $360 million or 20% compared to 2012, due primarily to a $319 million increase in clinical studies and a $28 million increase in personnel and infrastructure expenses to support the continued progression of our clinical studies, particularly Phase 3 studies in oncology, liver diseases and HIV. These increases were partially offset by a $100 million decrease in stock-based compensation expense due to the acceleration of vested stock options related to our acquisition of Pharmasset, Inc. (Pharmasset) in January 2012. In 2012, clinical studies and outside services increased $258 million compared to 2011 due to progression and expansion of our Phase 3 studies, particularly in liver diseases and oncology. Additionally, personnel expenses increased $274 million due to higher headcount to support our product pipeline and study progression.In 2015, we expect R&D expenses to increase over 2014 to support the expansion of our clinical studies in various therapeutic areas including liver disease, HIV and oncology. Selling, General and Administrative Expenses The following table summarizes the period over period changes in SG&A expenses:(In millions, except percentages) 2014 Change 2013 Change 2012Selling, general and administrative $2,983 76% $1,699 16% $1,461SG&A expenses relate to sales and marketing, finance, human resources, legal and other administrative activities. Expenses are primarily comprised of facilities and overhead costs, outside marketing, advertising and legal expenses and other general and administrative costs. In 2014, SG&A expenses increased $1.3 billion or 76% compared to 2013 due primarily to an increase in headcount-related and other expenses of $542 million to support the ongoing growth and expansion of our business, including commercial expansion related to the launches of Sovaldi and Harvoni and an increase in the BPD fee. During the third quarter of 2014, the Internal Revenues Service (IRS) issued final regulations which indicated that a manufacturer’s obligation to pay its portion of the BPD fee in any given calendar year is triggered by the qualifying sales in the previous year, instead of the first qualifying sale in the current calendar year. As a result of the final IRS regulations, we were required to recognize our 2014 fee of $460 million and 2013 fee of $142 million in our 2014 Consolidated Statement of Income. Our BPD fees were approximately $590 million, $110 million and $85 million in 2014, 2013 and 2012, respectively. The BPD fee is not tax deductible. In 2013, SG&A expenses increased $238 million or 16% compared to 2012. The increase was due primarily to a $308 million increase in headcount-related and other expenses to support the ongoing growth of our business, legal expenses and the BPD fee. This increase was partially offset by a $98 million decrease in stock-based compensation due to the acceleration of vested stock options related to our acquisition of Pharmasset in January 2012. In 2015 we expect SG&A expenses to increase compared to 2014 to support our continued build-out and expansion of our commercial infrastructure in Europe and Asia to support our products. Interest ExpenseIn 2014, interest expense increased to $412 million compared to $307 million in 2013. The increase was primarily a result of the issuance of our senior unsecured notes in registered offerings in March 2014 and November 2014, offset by repayment of our senior unsecured notes due in December 2014 (the December 2014 Notes), conversion and maturity of our convertible senior notes due in May 2014 (the May 2014 Notes) and partial conversion of our convertible senior notes due in May 2016 (the May 2016 Notes). In 2013, interest expense decreased to $307 million compared to $361 million in 2012. The decrease was due primarily to the repayment of our convertible senior notes due in May 2013 (the May 2013 Notes), conversion of the May 2014 Notes, partial conversion of the May 2016 Notes and the repayment of revolving credit facilities. Other Income (Expense), Net Other income (expense), net was not significant for 2014. During 2013 as compared to 2012, the changes in other income (expense), net were due primarily to a $40 million loss on Greek bonds related to Greece's restructuring of its sovereign debt in the first quarter of 2012.61Provision for Income Taxes Our provision for income taxes was $2.8 billion, $1.2 billion and $1.0 billion in 2014, 2013 and 2012, respectively. The 2014 effective tax rate of 18.8% differed from the U.S. federal statutory rate of 35% due primarily to certain operating earnings from non-U.S. subsidiaries that are considered indefinitely reinvested and tax credits, partially offset by state taxes, our portion of the non-tax deductible BPD fee and amortization expense of the intangible asset related to sofosbuvir for which we receive no tax benefit. We do not provide for U.S. income taxes on undistributed earnings of our foreign operations that are intended to be indefinitely reinvested in our foreign subsidiaries.The 2013 effective tax rate of 27.3% differed from the U.S. federal statutory rate of 35% due primarily to the retroactive extension of the 2012 federal research tax credit in January 2013, the 2013 federal research tax credit and certain operating earnings from non-U.S. subsidiaries that are considered indefinitely reinvested, partially offset by state taxes, our portion of the non-tax deductible BPD fee, amortization expense of the intangible asset related to sofosbuvir and contingent consideration expense related to certain acquisitions for which we receive no tax benefit.The 2012 effective tax rate of 28.7% differed from the U.S. federal statutory rate of 35% due primarily to tax credits and certain operating earnings from non-U.S. subsidiaries that are considered indefinitely reinvested, partially offset by state taxes, the stock-based compensation expense related to the Pharmasset acquisition and contingent consideration expense related to certain acquisitions for which we receive no tax benefit.AcquisitionsYM Biosciences Inc.We completed the acquisition of YM BioSciences Inc. (YM), based in Canada, for total consideration transferred of $488 million on February 8, 2013, at which time YM became a wholly-owned subsidiary of Gilead. YM was a drug development company primarily focused on advancing momelotinib, an orally administered, once-daily candidate for hematologic cancers. The fair values of acquired assets and assumed liabilities included primarily in-process research and development (IPR&D) of $363 million, goodwill of $127 million, deferred tax assets of $53 million with a full unrecognized tax benefit, deferred tax liabilities of $109 million and cash acquired of $109 million. Pro forma results of operations for the acquisition of YM have not been presented because this acquisition is not material to our consolidated results of operations. See Item 8, Note 8 Intangible Assets and Goodwill in our Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for a description of the IPR&D acquired.Pharmasset, Inc.In January 2012, we completed the acquisition of Pharmasset, a publicly-held clinical-stage pharmaceutical company committed to discovering, developing and commercializing novel drugs to treat viral infections. Pharmasset's primary focus was the development of oral therapeutics for the treatment of HCV infection. Pharmasset's lead compound, sofosbuvir (formerly referred to as GS-7977), is a nucleotide analog which, in December 2013, was approved by the FDA under the name Sovaldi, as a once-daily oral regimen for the treatment of HCV in patients with genotypes 1, 2, 3 or 4 infection, including those with hepatocellular carcinoma meeting Milan criteria (awaiting liver transplantation) and those with HCV/HIV-1 co-infection. In October 2014, Harvoni, which combines the NS5A inhibitor ledipasvir with sofosbuvir, received approval from the FDA for the treatment of chronic HCV genotype 1 infection in adults. The acquisition of Pharmasset has allowed us to advance our effort to develop all-oral regimens for the treatment of HCV. We acquired all of the outstanding shares of common stock of Pharmasset for $137 per share in cash through a tender offer and subsequent merger under the terms of an agreement and plan of merger entered into in November 2011. The aggregate cash payment to acquire all of the outstanding shares of common stock was $11.1 billion. We financed the transaction with approximately $5.2 billion in cash on hand, $3.7 billion in senior unsecured notes issued in December 2011 and $2.2 billion in bank debt issued in January 2012. The Pharmasset acquisition was accounted for as a business combination. The results of operations of Pharmasset have been included in our Consolidated Statements of Income since January 13, 2012, the date on which we acquired approximately 88% of the outstanding shares of common stock of Pharmasset and cash consideration was transferred, and as a result, we obtained effective control of Pharmasset. The acquisition was completed on January 17, 2012, at which time Pharmasset became a wholly-owned subsidiary of Gilead and was integrated into our operations. As we do not track earnings results by product candidate or therapeutic area, we do not maintain separate earnings results for the acquired Pharmasset business. 62The following table summarizes the components of the cash paid to acquire Pharmasset (in millions):Total consideration transferred $10,858Stock-based compensation expense 194Total cash paid $11,052The $11.1 billion cash payment consisted of a $10.4 billion cash payment to the outstanding common stockholders as well as a $668 million cash payment to option holders under the Pharmasset stock option plans. The $10.4 billion cash payment to the outstanding common stockholders and $474 million of the cash payment to vested option holders under the Pharmasset stock option plans were accounted for as consideration transferred. The remaining $194 million of cash payment was accounted for as stock-based compensation expense resulting from the accelerated vesting of Pharmasset employee options immediately prior to the acquisition.The following table summarizes the acquisition date fair values of assets acquired and liabilities assumed, and the consideration transferred (in millions):Identifiable intangible assets $10,738Cash and cash equivalents 107Other assets acquired (liabilities assumed), net (43)Total identifiable net assets 10,802Goodwill 56Total consideration transferred $10,858Refer to Item 8, Note 5 Acquisitions in our Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for more detailed information. Liquidity and Capital Resources We believe that our existing capital resources, supplemented by our cash flows generated from operating activities will be adequate to satisfy our capital needs for the foreseeable future. Our cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities and working capital increased significantly in 2014 compared to 2013 as we issued a total of $8.0 billion in senior unsecured notes in registered offerings in March 2014 and November 2014. The following table summarizes our cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities, our working capital and our cash flow activities as of the end of, and for each of, the periods presented: (in millions) 2014 2013 2012As of December 31: Cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities $11,726 $2,571 $2,582Working capital (1) $11,953 $590 $1,918Year Ended December 31: Cash provided by (used in): Operating activities $12,818 $3,105 $3,195Investing activities $(1,823) $(254) $(11,846)Financing activities $(3,025) $(2,544) $563 (1) Certain prior period amounts have been reclassified to conform to the current presentation.Cash, Cash Equivalents and Marketable Securities Cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities totaled $11.7 billion at December 31, 2014, an increase of $9.2 billion or 356% when compared to $2.6 billion at December 31, 2013. During 2014, we generated $12.8 billion in cash flows from operations; received $7.9 billion from the issuance of senior unsecured notes in registered offerings in March 2014 and November 2014; repaid $2.3 billion in debt, net of convertible note hedges; repurchased $5.3 billion of common stock; and paid approximately $4.1 billion to settle the warrants expiring in 2014 (the 2014 Warrants) related to our May 2014 Notes, which were retired in May 2014.Cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities remained relatively flat at $2.6 billion at December 31, 2013, when compared to $2.6 billion at December 31, 2012. During 2013, we generated $3.1 billion in operating cash flows, paid $1.0 billion for warrants related to our May 2013 Notes that were settled in August 2013, repaid $1.7 billion in debt net of proceeds from convertible note hedges and utilized $379 million for the acquisition of YM, net of cash acquired. 63Of the total cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities at December 31, 2014, approximately $3.2 billion was generated from operations in foreign jurisdictions and is intended for use in our foreign operations. We do not rely on unrepatriated earnings as a source of funds for our domestic business as we expect to have sufficient cash flow and borrowing capacity in the United States to fund our domestic operational and strategic needs. Working Capital Working capital was $12.0 billion at December 31, 2014. The increase of $11.4 billion from working capital as of December 31, 2013 was driven primarily by positive cash flows from operations and an increase in cash and cash equivalents due to the issuance of senior unsecured notes in March 2014 and November 2014, partially offset by cash paid to settle convertible senior notes and the 2014 Warrants, repayment of our bank debt, and repurchases of common stock.Working capital was $590 million at December 31, 2013. The decrease of $1.3 billion from working capital as of December 31, 2012 was due to an increase in the current portion of long-term debt and other accrued liabilities, partially offset by increases in accounts receivable, inventories and cash and cash equivalents.Cash Provided by Operating Activities Cash provided by operating activities was $12.8 billion in 2014, consisting primarily of net income of $12.1 billion, adjusted for non-cash items such as $1.1 billion of depreciation and amortization expenses, $360 million for stock-based compensation expense and $518 million of net cash outflow related to changes in operating assets and liabilities. Cash provided by operating activities was $3.1 billion in 2013, consisting primarily of net income of $3.1 billion, adjusted for non-cash items such as $345 million of depreciation and amortization expenses and $252 million of stock-based compensation expenses. This was partially offset by $562 million of net cash outflow related to changes in operating assets and liabilities. Cash provided by operating activities was $3.2 billion in 2012, consisting primarily of net income of $2.6 billion, adjusted for non-cash items such as $278 million of depreciation and amortization expenses, $209 million of stock-based compensation expenses, $108 million of net cash inflow related to changes in operating assets and liabilities. Cash Used in Investing Activities Cash used in investing activities in 2014 was $1.8 billion, consisting primarily of $1.2 billion in net purchases of marketable securities and $557 million in capital expenditures related to the expansion of our business.Cash used in investing activities in 2013 was $254 million, consisting primarily of $379 million used in our acquisition of YM, net of cash acquired and $190 million of capital expenditures primarily related to construction in progress associated with new facilities at our headquarters to support the ongoing growth of our business. This was partially offset by $315 million of net proceeds from sales of marketable securities. Cash used in investing activities in 2012 was $11.8 billion, consisting primarily of $10.8 billion used for our acquisition of Pharmasset, net of the stock-based compensation expense and cash acquired, $672 million of net purchases of marketable securities and $397 million of capital expenditures, related primarily to the purchase of an office building for $180 million and a $156 million increase in construction in progress associated with new facilities at our headquarters to support the ongoing growth of our business. Cash Provided by (Used in) Financing Activities Cash used in financing activities in 2014 was $3.0 billion, consisting primarily of $2.3 billion used to repay debt, net of convertible notes hedges, $5.3 billion used to repurchase common stock under our stock repurchase programs and $4.1 billion to settle the warrants related to our May 2014 Notes. These payments were primarily offset by $7.9 billion in net proceeds from the issuances of our senior unsecured notes due in April 2019 (the April 2019 Notes), senior unsecured notes due in April 2024 (the April 2024 Notes) and senior unsecured notes due in April 2044 (the April 2044 Notes, and together with the April 2019 Notes and the April 2024 Notes, the April Notes) in a registered offering for a total aggregate principal amount of $4.0 billion and from the issuances of our senior unsecured notes due in February 2020 (the February 2020 Notes), senior unsecured notes due in February 2025 (the February 2025 Notes) and senior unsecured notes due in February 2045 (February 2045 Notes, and together with the February 2020 Notes and the February 2025 Notes, the February Notes) in a registered offering for an aggregate principal amount of $4.0 billion.Cash used in financing activities in 2013 was $2.5 billion, consisting primarily of $4.4 billion used to repay debt financing which includes the maturity of our May 2013 Notes and conversions of our May 2014 Notes and May 2016 Notes, 64$1.0 billion to settle the warrants related to our May 2013 Notes that settled in August 2013 and $582 million used to repurchase common stock under our stock repurchase program. This cash outflow was partially offset by proceeds of $2.8 billion related to our convertible note hedges. Cash provided by financing activities in 2012 was $563 million, driven primarily by net proceeds of $2.1 billion from the issuance of bank debt in conjunction with the Pharmasset acquisition, proceeds of $466 million from issuances of common stock under our employee stock plans and $214 million from proceeds received related to our convertible note hedges. The cash proceeds were partially offset by the $1.8 billion used to repay debt financing during the year and $667 million used to repurchase common stock under our stock repurchase programs. Debt and Credit FacilityDebt FinancingIn March 2014, we issued senior unsecured notes in a registered offering for a total aggregate principal amount of $4.0 billion. We issued the April 2019 Notes for $500 million which pay interest at a fixed annual rate of 2.05%, the April 2024 Notes for $1.8 billion which pay interest at a fixed annual rate of 3.70% and the April 2044 Notes for $1.8 billion which pay interest at a fixed annual rate of 4.80%. In November 2014, we issued senior unsecured notes in a registered offering for a total aggregate principal amount of $4.0 billion. We issued the February 2020 Notes for $500 million which pay interest at a fixed annual rate of 2.35%, the February 2025 Notes for $1.8 billion which pay interest at a fixed annual rate of 3.50% and the February 2045 Notes for $1.8 billion which pay interest at a fixed annual rate of 4.50%. Bank DebtIn January 2012, in conjunction with the acquisition of Pharmasset, we entered into a five-year $1.3 billion revolving credit facility credit agreement (the Five-Year Revolving Credit Agreement). In 2012, we borrowed $750 million under the Five-Year Revolving Credit Agreement upon the close of the acquisition. The Five-Year Revolving Credit Agreement contains customary representations, warranties, affirmative, negative and financial maintenance covenants and events of default. The loan bears interest at either (i) the Eurodollar Rate plus the Applicable Margin or (ii) the Base Rate plus the Applicable Margin, each as defined in the credit agreement. We may reduce the commitments and may prepay the loan in whole or in part at any time without premium or penalty. We are required to comply with certain covenants under the credit agreement and note indentures and as of December 31, 2014, we were not in violation of any covenants.In 2013, we repaid $150 million under the Five-Year Revolving Credit Agreement. During 2014, we repaid the remaining balance of $600 million that was outstanding under the Five-Year Revolving Credit Agreement. The Five-Year Revolving Credit Agreement will terminate and all amounts owed under the agreement shall be due and payable in January 2017.Convertible Senior NotesDuring 2014, our May 2014 Notes matured and a portion of our May 2016 Notes (together, the May Notes) was converted. During 2014, we repaid $912 million of principal balance relating to the May Notes. We also paid $2.5 billion in cash related to the conversion spread of the May Notes, which represents the conversion value in excess of the principal amount, and received $2.5 billion in cash from the convertible note hedges related to the May Notes. During the year ended December 31, 2014, we exercised our option to settle in cash the 2014 Warrants. As a result, we paid $4.1 billion to settle the warrants as the market value of our common stock at the time of the exercise of the warrants exceeds their strike price. There were 56 million shares of our common stock underlying the 2014 Warrants, which had a strike price of $28.38 per share and expired during the 40 trading-day period commencing August 1, 2014 and ending on September 26, 2014. Because the warrants could have been settled, at our option, in cash or shares of our common stock, and the related contracts met all of the applicable criteria for equity classification, the settlement was recorded as a reduction of additional paid-in capital in our Consolidated Balance Sheets.As of December 31, 2014, the May 2016 Notes were classified as current given that their conversion criteria had been met. As a result, the related unamortized discount of $15 million was classified as equity component of currently redeemable convertible notes on our Consolidated Balance Sheets.There are 55 million shares of our common stock underlying our warrants expiring in 2016 (the 2016 Warrants). The 2016 Warrants have a strike price of $30.05 per share and are exercisable only on their expiration date. If the market value of our common stock at the time of the exercise of the warrants exceeds their strike price, we will be required to net settle in cash or shares of our common stock, at our option, for the value of the warrants in excess of the warrant strike price.65Stock Repurchase ProgramsUnder our stock repurchase program authorized in January 2011 (2011 Program), we repurchased a total of $3.3 billion or 40 million shares of common stock during 2014. In May 2014, our Board of Directors authorized a new $5.0 billion stock repurchase program (2014 Program) through open market and private block transactions pursuant to Rule 10b5-1 plans, privately negotiated transactions or other means. This new program expires three years after the completion of the 2011 Program. We began repurchases under the 2014 Program in October 2014 and repurchased a total of $2.0 billion or 19 million shares. We intend to use the additional authorization to repurchase shares opportunistically and to offset the dilution created by shares issued under employee stock plans. On February 3, 2015, we announced that our Board of Directors authorized a new $15 billion five-year share repurchase program, which we will initiate in 2015 on the completion of our 2014 Program.Long-Term ObligationsThe summary of our borrowings under various financing arrangements is included in Item 8, Note 10 Debt and Credit Facility in our Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.We believe our existing capital resources, supplemented by cash flows generated from our operations, will be adequate to satisfy our capital needs for the foreseeable future. Our future capital requirements will depend on many factors, including but not limited to the following: •the commercial performance of our current and future products; •the progress and scope of our R&D efforts, including preclinical studies and clinical trials; •the cost, timing and outcome of regulatory reviews; •the expansion of our sales and marketing capabilities; •administrative expenses; •the possibility of acquiring additional manufacturing capabilities or office facilities; •the possibility of acquiring other companies or new products; •costs associated with the settlement and conversion of our convertible senior notes and related warrants;•the establishment of additional collaborative relationships with other companies; and •costs associated with the defense, settlement and adverse results of litigation and government investigations. We may in the future require additional funding, which could be in the form of proceeds from equity or debt financings. If such funding is required, we cannot guarantee that it will be available to us on favorable terms, if at all. 66Critical Accounting Policies, Estimates and Judgments The discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based on our Consolidated Financial Statements, which have been prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses and related disclosures. On an ongoing basis, we evaluate our estimates, including those related to revenue recognition, allowance for doubtful accounts, valuation of intangible assets and contingent consideration liabilities resulting from business combinations and our tax provision. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other market specific and other relevant assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ significantly from these estimates. We believe the following critical accounting policies reflect the more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our Consolidated Financial Statements. Revenue Recognition Product Sales We recognize revenues from product sales when there is persuasive evidence that an arrangement exists, delivery has occurred, the price is fixed or determinable and collectability is reasonably assured. We record product sales net of estimated mandatory and supplemental discounts to government payers, in addition to discounts to private payers, and other related charges. These are generally referred to as gross-to-net deductions and are recorded in the same period the related sales occur. Government and other rebates and chargebacks represent the majority of our gross-to-net deductions and require complex and significant judgment by management. Estimates are assessed each period and updated to reflect current information.Government and Other Rebates and ChargebacksGovernment and other rebates and chargebacks include amounts paid to payers and healthcare providers in the United States, including Medicaid rebates, ADAPs, Veterans Administration and Public Health Service discounts, and other rebates, as well as foreign government rebates. Rebates and chargebacks are based on contractual arrangements or statutory requirements which may vary by product, by payer and individual payer plans. For qualified programs that can purchase our products through wholesalers or other distributors at a lower contractual price, the wholesalers or distributors charge back to us the difference between their acquisition cost and the lower contractual price. Our consolidated allowances for government and other chargebacks that are payable to our direct customers are classified as reductions of accounts receivable, and totaled $220 million as of December 31, 2014 and $149 million as of December 31, 2013. Our consolidated allowance for government and other rebates that will be paid to parties other than our direct customers are recorded in accrued government and other rebates on our Consolidated Balance Sheets, and totaled $2.3 billion as of December 31, 2014 and $1.0 billion as of December 31, 2013. Our allowances for government and other rebates and chargebacks are estimated based on products sold, historical utilization rates, pertinent third party industry information, estimated patient population, known market events or trends, channel inventory and/or other market data. We also take into consideration new information regarding changes in programs' regulations and guidelines that would impact the amount of the actual rebates and/or our expectations regarding future utilization rates for these programs. We believe that the methodology that we use to estimate our government and other rebates and chargebacks is reasonable and appropriate given the current facts and circumstances. However, actual results may differ significantly from our estimates. During the last three years, our actual government rebates and chargebacks claimed for prior periods have varied by less than 5% from our estimates.67The following table summarizes the consolidated activity in our government and other rebates and chargebacks accounts (in millions):Accrued government and other rebates and chargebacks: Balance atBeginningof Year Decrease/(Increase) to Product Sales Payments Balance atEnd ofYearYear ended December 31, 2014: Activity related to 2014 sales $— $6,113 $(3,650) $2,463Activity related to sales prior to 2014 1,167 (109) (985) 73Total $1,167 $6,004 $(4,635) $2,536Year ended December 31, 2013: Activity related to 2013 sales $— $3,430 $(2,357) $1,073Activity related to sales prior to 2013 886 (121) (671) 94Total $886 $3,309 $(3,028) $1,167Allowance for Doubtful Accounts We maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments. This allowance is based on our analysis of several factors, including, but not limited to, contractual payment terms, historical payment patterns of our customers and individual customer circumstances, an analysis of days sales outstanding by geographic region and a review of the local economic environment and its potential impact on government funding and reimbursement practices. If the financial condition of our customers or the economic environment in which they operate were to deteriorate, resulting in an inability to make payments, additional allowances may be required. We believe that the allowance for doubtful accounts is adequate; however, significant deterioration in any of the above factors could materially change these expectations and may result in an increase to our allowance for doubtful accounts. As of December 31, 2014 and 2013, our allowance for doubtful accounts was $31 million and $59 million, respectively.Valuation of Intangible AssetsIn conjunction with our business combinations, we have recorded intangible assets primarily related to IPR&D projects. We had total intangible assets of $11.1 billion as of December 31, 2014 and $11.9 billion as of December 31, 2013. The identifiable intangible assets are measured at their respective fair values as of the acquisition date. The models used in valuing these intangible assets require the use of significant estimates and assumptions including but not limited to:•estimates of revenues and operating profits related to the products or product candidates;•the probability of success for unapproved product candidates considering their stages of development;•the time and resources needed to complete the development and approval of product candidates;•the life of the potential commercialized products and associated risks, including the inherent difficulties and uncertainties in developing a product candidate such as obtaining FDA and other regulatory approvals; and•risks related to the viability of and potential alternative treatments in any future target markets.We believe the fair values used to record intangible assets acquired in connection with a business combination are based upon reasonable estimates and assumptions given the facts and circumstances as of the related valuation dates. Intangible assets related to IPR&D projects are considered to be indefinite-lived until the completion or abandonment of the associated R&D efforts. If and when development is complete, which generally occurs if and when regulatory approval to market a product is obtained, the associated assets would be deemed finite-lived and would then be amortized based on their respective estimated useful lives at that point in time. During the period the assets are considered indefinite-lived, they will not be amortized but will be tested for impairment on an annual basis as well as between annual tests if we become aware of any events or changes that would indicate that it is more likely than not that the fair value of the IPR&D projects below their respective carrying amounts. The fair value of our indefinite-lived intangible assets is dependent on assumptions such as the expected timing or probability of achieving the specified milestones, changes in projected revenues or changes in discount rates. Significant judgment is employed in determining these assumptions and changes to our assumptions could have a significant impact on our results of operations in any given period.Intangible assets with finite useful lives are amortized over their estimated useful lives primarily on a straight-line basis. Intangible assets with finite useful lives are reviewed for impairment when facts or circumstances suggest that the carrying value of these assets may not be recoverable.68Valuation of Contingent Consideration Liabilities Resulting from Business CombinationsIn conjunction with our business combinations and consolidation of a variable interest entity for which we are the primary beneficiary, we have recorded contingent consideration liabilities payable upon the achievement of specified development, regulatory approval, sales-based milestone events or financial results. The contingent consideration liabilities are measured at their respective fair values as of the acquisition or initial consolidation date. The models used in valuing these contingent consideration liabilities require the use of significant estimates and assumptions including but not limited to: •estimates of revenues and operating profits related to the products or product candidates; •the probability of success for unapproved product candidates considering their stages of development; •the time and resources needed to complete the development and approval of product candidates; •the life of the potential commercialized products and associated risks, including the inherent difficulties and uncertainties in developing a product candidate such as obtaining FDA and other regulatory approvals; and •risks related to the viability of and potential alternative treatments in any future target markets. We revalue contingent consideration obligations each reporting period and record changes in their fair value in R&D expense within our Consolidated Statement of Income. Changes in the fair value of our contingent consideration liabilities can result from updates to one or multiple assumptions such as the expected timing or probability of achieving the specified milestones, changes in projected revenues or changes in discount rates. Significant judgment is employed in determining these assumptions as of the acquisition date and for each subsequent reporting period. Updates to assumptions could have a significant impact on our results of operations in any given period. Actual results may differ from estimates.We had total contingent consideration liabilities of $133 million as of December 31, 2014 and $264 million as of December 31, 2013.Tax Provision We estimate our income tax provision, including deferred tax assets and liabilities, based on significant management judgment. We evaluate the realization of all or a portion of our deferred tax assets on a quarterly basis. We record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets to the amounts that are more likely than not to be realized. We consider future taxable income, ongoing tax planning strategies and our historical financial performance in assessing the need for a valuation allowance. If we expect to realize deferred tax assets for which we have previously recorded a valuation allowance, we will reduce the valuation allowance in the period in which such determination is first made. We are subject to income taxes in both the United States and various foreign jurisdictions including Ireland. Due to economic and political conditions, various countries are actively considering changes to existing tax laws. We cannot predict the form or timing of potential legislative changes that could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations. In addition, significant judgment is required in determining our worldwide provision for income taxes.We record liabilities related to uncertain tax positions in accordance with the guidance that clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in an enterprise's financial statements by prescribing a minimum recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. We do not believe any such uncertain tax positions currently pending will have a material adverse effect on our Consolidated Financial Statements, although an adverse resolution of one or more of these uncertain tax positions in any period could have a material impact on the results of operations for that period. At December 31, 2014 and 2013, we had total federal, state and foreign unrecognized tax benefits of $661 million and $237 million, respectively. Of the total unrecognized tax benefits, $602 million and $195 million at December 31, 2014 and 2013, respectively, if recognized, would reduce our effective tax rate in the period of recognition. As of December 31, 2014, we believe that it is reasonably possible that our unrecognized tax benefits will decrease by approximately $12 million in the next 12 months as we expect to have clarification from the IRS and other tax authorities regarding our uncertain tax positions. With respect to the remaining unrecognized tax benefits, we are currently unable to make a reasonable estimate as to the period of cash settlement, if any, with the respective tax authorities. We file federal, state and foreign income tax returns in many jurisdictions in the United States and abroad. For federal income tax purposes, the statute of limitations is open for 2010 and onwards. For certain acquired entities, the statute of 69limitations is open for all years from inception due to our utilization of their net operating losses and credits carried over from prior years. For California income tax purposes, the statute of limitations is open for 2008 and onwards. Our income tax returns are audited by federal, state and foreign tax authorities. We are currently under examination by the IRS for the 2010, 2011 and 2012 tax years and by various state and foreign jurisdictions. There are differing interpretations of tax laws and regulations, and as a result, significant disputes may arise with these tax authorities involving issues of the timing and amount of deductions and allocations of income among various tax jurisdictions. We periodically evaluate our exposures associated with our tax filing positions. Branded Prescription Drug Fee We, along with other pharmaceutical manufacturers of branded drug products, are required to pay a portion of the BPD fee, which is calculated based on select government sales during each calendar year as a percentage of total industry government sales. The fee is determined by estimating our total sales to government agencies along with an assumption of the total pharmaceutical industry sales to government agencies. Our estimates are based on past history along with expectations of future branded drug sales activity by us along with other pharmaceutical companies. Judgment is employed in determining these assumptions. Updates to assumptions could have an impact on our results of operations. Adjustments to our estimates in the past have not been material. In 2014, the IRS issued final regulations related to the BPD fee which indicate that an entity's obligation to pay its portion of the BPD fee in any given calendar year is triggered by the qualifying sales in the previous year, instead of the first qualifying sale in the current calendar year. As a result of the final IRS regulations, we were required to recognize our 2014 fee of $460 million and 2013 fee of $142 million in our 2014 Consolidated Statement of Income. Our BPD fees were approximately $590 million, $110 million and $85 million in 2014, 2013 and 2012, respectively. The IRS is expected to communicate the final BPD fee amounts due for 2013 sales during the third quarter of 2015 and for 2014 sales during the third quarter of 2016. Our BPD fee accrual totaled $500 million as of December 31, 2014 and $38 million as of December 31, 2013.Off Balance Sheet Arrangements We do not have any off balance sheet arrangements as defined in Item 303(a)(4)(ii) of Regulation S-K. Contractual ObligationsOur contractual obligations consist of debt obligations, operating leases, capital commitments, purchase obligations for active pharmaceutical ingredients and inventory-related items and clinical trials contracts. The following table summarizes our significant enforceable and legally binding obligations, future commitments and obligations related to all contracts that we are likely to continue regardless of the fact that certain of these obligations may be cancelable as of December 31, 2014 (in millions): Payments due by PeriodContractual Obligations Total Less than oneyear 1-3 years 3-5 years More than 5yearsDebt (1) $20,912 $453 $2,159 $1,429 $16,871Operating lease obligations 302 58 102 69 73Capital commitments (2) 399 323 76 — —Purchase obligations (3)(4) 2,809 2,252 296 261 —Clinical trials (5) 1,207 581 453 118 55Total $25,629 $3,667 $3,086 $1,877 $16,999 (1) Our debt obligations include convertible senior notes and senior unsecured notes. Interest payments are incurred and calculated based on terms of the related notes. For further information, see Item 8, Note 10 Debt and Credit Facility in our Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.(2) At December 31, 2014, we had firm capital project commitments of approximately $399 million primarily relating to construction of new buildings. (3) At December 31, 2014, we had firm purchase commitments related to active pharmaceutical ingredients and certain inventory-related items. These amounts include minimum purchase requirements. 70(4) In addition to the above, we have committed to make potential future milestone payments to third parties as part of licensing, collaboration and development arrangements. Payments under these agreements generally become due and payable only upon achievement of certain developmental, regulatory and/or commercial milestones. Because the achievement of these milestones is neither probable nor reasonably estimable, such contingencies have not been recorded on our Consolidated Balance Sheets and have not been included in the table above. (5) At December 31, 2014, we had several clinical studies in various clinical trial phases. Our most significant clinical trial expenditures are to contract research organizations (CROs). Although all of our material contracts with CROs are cancelable, we historically have not canceled such contracts. These amounts reflect commitments based on existing contracts and do not reflect any future modifications to, or terminations of, existing contracts or anticipated or potential new contracts. We had total gross unrecognized tax benefit liabilities including interest and penalties of $685 million as of December 31, 2014. We believe that it is reasonably possible that our unrecognized tax benefits will decrease by approximately $12 million in the next 12 months as we expect to have clarification from the IRS and other tax authorities regarding our uncertain tax positions. With respect to the remaining unrecognized tax benefits, we are currently unable to make a reasonable estimate as to the period of cash settlement, if any, with the respective tax authorities. The unrecognized tax benefits were included in current and long-term income taxes payable and long-term deferred tax assets on our Consolidated Balance Sheets and have not been included in the table above. Recent Accounting Pronouncements The information required by this item is included in Item 8, Note 1 Organization and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies in our Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.ITEM 7A.QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISKWe are exposed to market risks that may result from changes in foreign currency exchange rates, interest rates and credit risks. To reduce certain of these risks, we enter into various types of foreign currency or interest rate derivative hedging transactions, follow investment guidelines and monitor outstanding receivables as part of our risk management program.Foreign Currency Exchange Risk Our operations include manufacturing and sales activities in the United States, Canada and Ireland as well as sales activities in countries outside the United States, including Europe and Asia Pacific. As a result, our financial results could be significantly affected by factors such as changes in foreign currency exchange rates or weak economic conditions in the foreign markets in which we distribute our products. Our operating results are exposed to changes in foreign currency exchange rates between the U.S. dollar and various foreign currencies, the most significant of which is the Euro. When the U.S. dollar strengthens against these currencies, the relative value of sales made in the respective foreign currency decreases. Conversely, when the U.S. dollar weakens against these currencies, the relative amounts of such sales increase. Overall, we are a net receiver of foreign currencies and, therefore, benefit from a weaker U.S. dollar and are adversely affected by a stronger U.S. dollar relative to those foreign currencies in which we transact significant amounts of business. Approximately 26% of our product sales were denominated in foreign currencies during 2014. To partially mitigate the impact of changes in currency exchange rates on net cash flows from our foreign currency denominated sales, we may enter into foreign currency exchange forward and option contracts. We also hedge certain monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies, which reduces but does not eliminate our exposure to currency fluctuations between the date a transaction is recorded and the date that cash is collected or paid. In general, the market risks of these contracts are offset by corresponding gains and losses on the transactions being hedged. As of December 31, 2014 and 2013, we had open foreign currency forward contracts with notional amounts of $6.4 billion and $4.3 billion, respectively. A hypothetical 10% adverse movement in foreign currency exchange rates compared with the U.S. dollar relative to exchange rates at December 31, 2014 would have resulted in a reduction in fair value of these contracts of approximately $600 million on this date and, if realized, would negatively affect earnings over the remaining life of the contracts. The same hypothetical movement in foreign currency exchange rates compared with the U.S. dollar relative to exchange rates at December 31, 2013, would have resulted in a reduction in fair value of these contracts of approximately $435 million on this date and, if realized, would negatively affect earnings over the remaining life of the contracts. The analysis does not consider the impact that hypothetical changes in foreign currency exchange rates would have on anticipated transactions that these foreign currency sensitive instruments were designed to offset.71Interest Rate Risk Our portfolio of available-for-sale marketable securities and our fixed and variable rate liabilities create an exposure to interest rate risk. With respect to our investment portfolio, we adhere to an investment policy that requires us to limit amounts invested in securities based on credit rating, maturity, industry group and investment type and issuer, except for securities issued by the U.S. government. The goals of our investment policy, in order of priority, are as follows: • safety and preservation of principal and diversification of risk; • liquidity of investments sufficient to meet cash flow requirements; and • competitive after-tax rate of return. The following table summarizes the expected maturities and average interest rates of our interest-generating assets and fixed interest-bearing liabilities at December 31, 2014 (in millions, except percentages): Expected Maturity Total Fair Value at December 31, 2014 2015 2016 2017 2018 2019 Thereafter Total Assets Available-for-sale debt securities $101 $606 $831 $108 $35 $18 $1,699 $1,699Average interest rate 0.45% 0.71% 1.26% 0.97% 1.13% 1.66% Liabilities Debt (1) $— $1,199 $— $— $500 $10,750 $12,449 $15,000Average interest rate —% 2.46% —% —% 2.05% 4.25% (1) In December 2011, we issued senior unsecured notes due in December 2016, 2021 and 2041 in a registered offering. The notes pay interest at fixed annual rates ranging from 3.05% to 5.65%. In March 2011, we issued senior unsecured notes due in April 2021 in a registered offering. The notes pay interest at a fixed annual rate of 4.50%. In March and November 2014, we issued the April Notes and the February Notes, respectively, with interest rates ranging from 2.05% to 4.80%.In July 2010, we issued the May 2016 Notes in a private placement pursuant to Rule 144A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended. The May 2016 Notes were issued at par and bear an interest rate of 1.625%, and may be converted into shares of our common stock subject to certain circumstances.In 2012, in connection with our acquisition of Pharmasset, we entered into credit agreements that are subject to variable interest rates. During 2014, the portion of interest expense related to variable interest totaled $3 million.Credit RiskWe are subject to credit risk from our portfolio of cash equivalents and marketable securities. Under our investment policy, we limit amounts invested in such securities by credit rating, maturity, industry group, investment type and issuer, except for securities issued by the U.S. government. We are not exposed to any significant concentrations of credit risk from these financial instruments. The goals of our investment policy, in order of priority, are as follows: safety and preservation of principal and diversification of risk; liquidity of investments sufficient to meet cash flow requirements; and a competitive after-tax rate of return. We are also subject to credit risk from our accounts receivable related to our product sales. The majority of our trade accounts receivable arises from product sales in the United States and Europe. As of December 31, 2014, our accounts receivable in Southern Europe, specifically Greece, Italy, Portugal and Spain, totaled approximately $504 million, of which $157 million were greater than 120 days past due and $44 million were greater than 365 days past due. As of December 31, 2013, our accounts receivable in Southern Europe, specifically Greece, Italy, Portugal and Spain, totaled approximately $846 million, of which $402 million were greater than 120 days past due and $176 million were greater than 365 days past due. To date, we have not experienced significant losses with respect to the collection of our accounts receivable. We believe that our allowance for doubtful accounts was adequate at December 31, 2014.72",2023-12-30 19:04:27.051770

MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS The following Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (MD&A) is intended to help the reader understand our results of operations and financial condition. MD&A is provided as a supplement to, and should be read in conjunction with, our audited Consolidated Financial Statements and the accompanying Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements and other disclosures included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K (including the disclosures under Item 1A, Risk Factors). Our Consolidated Financial Statements have been prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles and are presented in U.S. dollars. Management OverviewGilead Sciences, Inc. (Gilead, we or us), incorporated in Delaware on June 22, 1987, is a research-based biopharmaceutical company that discovers, develops and commercializes innovative medicines in areas of unmet medical need. With each new discovery and investigational drug candidate, we strive to transform and simplify care for people with life-threatening illnesses around the world. Gilead's primary areas of focus include human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), liver diseases such as chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection and chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection, cardiovascular, hematology/oncology and inflammation/respiratory. We have operations in more than 30 countries worldwide, with headquarters in Foster City, California. We continue to add to our existing portfolio of products through our internal discovery and clinical development programs and through a product acquisition and in-licensing strategy.Our portfolio of marketed products includes AmBisome®, Atripla®, Cayston®, Complera®/Eviplera®, Emtriva®, Genvoya®, Harvoni®, Hepsera®, Letairis®, Ranexa®, Sovaldi®, Stribild®, Tamiflu®, Truvada®, Tybost®, Viread®, Vitekta®, and Zydelig®. We have U.S. and international commercial sales operations, with marketing subsidiaries in North and South America, Europe and Asia-Pacific. We also sell and distribute certain products through our corporate partners under royalty-paying collaborative agreements. 2015 Business HighlightsDuring 2015, we continued to advance our product pipeline across our therapeutic areas with the goal of delivering best-in-class drugs that advance the current standard of care and/or address unmet medical needs. Highlights of our 2015 activities include:Antiviral Program•U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and European Commission approved Genvoya for the treatment of HIV-1 infection. Genvoya is our first tenofovir alafenamide (TAF)-based regimen. •We submitted marketing applications to FDA and European Medicines Agency (EMA) for an investigational, once-daily single tablet regimen that combines our emtricitabine 200 mg and TAF 25 mg with rilpivirine 25 mg (R/F/TAF) from Janssen Sciences Ireland UC, one of the Janssen Pharmaceutical Companies of Johnson & Johnson, for the treatment of HIV-1 infection in adult and pediatric patients 12 years of age and older. •We submitted marketing applications to FDA and EMA for two doses of F/TAF (200/10 mg and 200/25 mg) for the treatment of HIV-1 infection in adults and pediatric patients age 12 years and older, in combination with other HIV antiretroviral agents.•FDA approved Harvoni for expanded use in patients with genotype 4, 5 and 6 HCV infection and in patients co-infected with HIV. In addition, Harvoni plus ribavirin for 12 weeks was approved as an alternate therapy to 24 weeks of Harvoni for treatment-experienced, genotype 1 patients with cirrhosis.•Japanese Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare approved Sovaldi for the suppression of viremia in patients with genotype 2 chronic HCV infection with or without compensated cirrhosis and Harvoni, the first once-daily single-tablet regimen for the treatment of chronic HCV genotype 1 infection in adults with or without compensated cirrhosis, with a treatment duration of 12 weeks. •We submitted marketing applications to FDA and EMA for an investigational, once-daily fixed-dose combination of the nucleotide analog polymerase inhibitor sofosbuvir (SOF) 400 mg and velpatasvir (VEL) 100 mg, an investigational pan-genotypic NS5A inhibitor, for the treatment of genotype 1-6 chronic HCV infection.•We received reimbursement approval for Sovaldi and Harvoni in various countries in the European Union.47Cardiovascular Program•FDA approved the use of Letairis (ambrisentan) in combination with tadalafil for the treatment of pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) to reduce the risks of disease progression and hospitalization for worsening PAH, and to improve exercise ability. Hematology/Oncology Program•We filed a supplemental new drug application for the use of Zydelig (idelalisib) in combination with ofatumumab in previously-treated patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia. Inflammation/Respiratory Program•We entered into a collaboration and license agreement with Galapagos NV, which became effective January 2016, for the development and commercialization of the JAK1-selective inhibitor filgotinib for inflammatory disease indications. This collaboration represents an opportunity to add complementary clinical programs to our growing inflammation research and development efforts. 2015 Financial Highlights During 2015, total revenues increased to $32.6 billion and total product sales increased to $32.2 billion, compared to $24.9 billion and $24.5 billion respectively, in 2014, driven primarily by sales of Harvoni and increased sales of our HIV single tablet regimen products, Stribild, Complera/Eviplera and the recently launched Genvoya, partially offset by decreased sales of Sovaldi due to the uptake of Harvoni. Harvoni was approved in the United States in October 2014, in the European Union in November 2014 and in Japan in July 2015. For 2015, product sales in the U.S. were $21.2 billion compared to $18.1 billion in 2014. In Europe, product sales were $7.2 billion compared to $5.1 billion in 2014. Sales in other international locations were $3.8 billion in 2015 compared to $1.2 billion in 2014, primarily due to sales of Sovaldi and Harvoni in Japan.R&D expenses increased 6% to $3.0 billion for 2015 compared to 2014 due to continued investment in the progression and expansion of our product pipeline. Selling, general and administrative (SG&A) expenses increased 15% to $3.4 billion for 2015 compared to 2014 due to increased costs to support our business expansion.Net income attributable to Gilead for 2015 was $18.1 billion or $11.91 per diluted share, compared to $12.1 billion or $7.35 per diluted share in 2014, due primarily to the launch of Harvoni, partially offset by the declines in sales of Sovaldi and increases in operating expenses.As of December 31, 2015, our cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities totaled $26.2 billion. During 2015, we generated $20.3 billion in operating cash flows, issued senior unsecured notes with a total aggregate principal amount of $10.0 billion (2015 Notes), and paid $3.9 billion to settle 46 million warrants related to our convertible senior notes due May 2016. We repurchased 95 million shares of our common stock in 2015 for an aggregate amount of $10.0 billion. We also initiated a quarterly cash dividend of $0.43 per share in the second quarter of 2015, and paid a total of $1.9 billion in dividends to our shareholders in 2015.Outlook 2016In 2016, we will continue to focus on our key operating objectives which include the progression of our product pipeline and continued uptake of our commercial products. From a research and development (R&D) perspective, we will continue to invest in conducting new and ongoing clinical studies, which support both our existing products and our product candidates. We expect to move forward on a number of late-stage clinical studies for new product candidates and plan to file marketing applications for product candidates in various therapeutic areas.From a commercial perspective, we will continue to focus on supporting the uptake of Genvoya and prepare for additional anticipated launches of our new TAF-based regimens, F/TAF and R/F/TAF, and continue to promote the use of our existing commercial products. In HCV, we will continue to focus on advancing care of people with the disease regardless of genotype or disease severity. SOF/VEL, if approved, would become the first and only regimen offering high sustained viral response rates with 12 weeks of treatment for patients with all HCV genotypes. We also plan to further build-out and expand our commercial infrastructure globally.Additionally, we will focus both on near term and longer term objectives to help many more patients around the world. Our progress is subject to a number of uncertainties, including, but not limited to, the continuation of an uncertain global macroeconomic environment; adoption of additional pricing measures to reduce healthcare spending particularly in HCV; volatility in foreign currency exchange rates; inaccuracies in our HCV patient start estimates; additional competitive launches in HCV; an increase in discounts, chargebacks and rebates due to ongoing private and public payer negotiations; and a larger than anticipated shift in payer mix to more highly discounted payer segments.482015 Results of Operations Total Revenues The following table summarizes our product sales, and royalty, contract and other revenues:(In millions, except percentages) 2015 Change 2014 Change 2013Revenues: Product sales $32,151 31% $24,474 127% $10,804Royalty, contract and other revenues 488 17% 416 5% 398Total revenues 32,639 31% 24,890 122% 11,202Product Sales Total product sales were $32.2 billion in 2015, compared to $24.5 billion in 2014 and $10.8 billion in 2013, driven primarily by an increase in antiviral product sales. Antiviral product sales, which include products in our HIV and liver disease areas, were $30.2 billion in 2015, $22.8 billion in 2014 and $9.3 billion in 2013. The sequential increases in antiviral product sales in 2015 and 2014 were driven primarily by the launch of Sovaldi and Harvoni. The increases in 2015 sales from the launch of Harvoni across various geographies were partially offset by a year-over-year decline in Sovaldi sales, with patients being prescribed Harvoni instead of Sovaldi. HIV products also contributed to sales increases in 2015 and 2014 primarily due to increased sales of our newer HIV single-tablet regimens, Stribild, Complera/Eviplera and the recently launched Genvoya, partially offset by declines in Atripla sales volumes. Other product sales, which include Letairis, Ranexa, AmBisome and Zydelig, were $1.9 billion in 2015, an increase of 16% compared to $1.7 billion in 2014, an increase of 15% over other product sales of $1.5 billion in 2013. In 2015, approximately 34% of our product sales were generated outside the United States. We face exposure to adverse movements in foreign currency exchange rates, primarily in the Euro and Yen. We used foreign currency exchange contracts to hedge a percentage of our foreign currency exposure. Foreign currency exchange, net of hedges, had an unfavorable impact of $737 million on our 2015 revenues compared to 2014 and a favorable impact of $39 million on our 2014 revenues compared to 2013.We record product sales net of estimated mandatory and supplemental discounts to government payers, in addition to discounts to private payers, including rebates, chargebacks, cash discounts for prompt payment, distributor fees and other related costs. These deductions are generally referred to as gross-to-net deductions and totaled $18.1 billion or 36% of gross product sales in 2015, $7.3 billion or 23% in 2014 and $3.9 billion or 26% in 2013. Of the $18.1 billion in 2015, $16.4 billion or 33% of gross product sales was related to government and other rebates and chargebacks, and $1.7 billion was related to cash discounts for prompt payment, distributor fees and other related costs. As anticipated, our 2015 gross-to-net deductions attributable to our HCV product sales exceeded our overall gross-to-net of 36% in order to obtain formulary status or expand access for patients. As a result of the launch of competing regimens, we have experienced, and may continue to experience, increased pricing pressure. The decline in gross-to-net deductions as a percentage of gross product sales in 2014 compared to 2013 was primarily due to change in our payer mix reflecting a higher proportion of product sales to private payers compared to 2013 given the launch of Sovaldi in December 2013 and Harvoni in October 2014.Product sales in the United States increased by 17% to $21.2 billion in 2015 compared to $18.1 billion in 2014, primarily due to sales of Harvoni and increases in sales of Stribild, Truvada and Complera, partially offset by declines in sales of Sovaldi. Product sales in the United States increased by 173% in 2014 compared to $6.6 billion in 2013, primarily due to sales of Sovaldi and Harvoni and increases in sales of Stribild and Complera. Product sales in Europe increased by 39% to $7.2 billion in 2015 compared to $5.1 billion in 2014, primarily due to sales of Harvoni. Product sales in Europe increased by 54% to $5.1 billion in 2014 compared to $3.3 billion in 2013, primarily due to sales of Sovaldi and increases in sales of Eviplera and Stribild. Foreign currency exchange, net of hedges, had an unfavorable impact of $611 million on our European product sales in 2015 compared to 2014 and a favorable impact of $72 million on our European product sales for 2014 compared to 2013. 49Product sales in other international locations increased to $3.8 billion in 2015 compared to $1.2 billion in 2014, primarily due to the launch in Japan of Sovaldi in March 2015 and Harvoni in July 2015. Product sales in other international locations increased by 47% in 2014 compared to $826 million in 2013, primarily due to the launch of Sovaldi in various geographies. Since our HCV products, Harvoni and Sovaldi, were only recently launched, historical sales may not be indicative of future sales. In the United States, the number of HCV new patient starts has diminished since the first quarter of 2015, indicative of the rapid initiation of treatment for many warehoused patients, followed by a flattening of patients in the remaining quarters. We anticipate that the rate at which new patients start treatment in the second half of 2015 may be more indicative of the pace of new patient starts in 2016. In Europe, we expect early launch markets to stabilize and new markets to ramp up treatment. In Japan, patient numbers are difficult to predict because our HCV products were recently launched. Additionally, we anticipate the government of Japan will impose significant pricing discounts for Harvoni and Sovaldi that will start taking effect in the first half of 2016. The following table summarizes the period over period changes in our product sales:(In millions, except percentages) 2015 Change 2014 Change 2013Antiviral products: Harvoni $13,864 * $2,127 * —Sovaldi 5,276 (49)% 10,283 * $139Truvada 3,459 4 % 3,340 7 % 3,136Atripla 3,134 (10)% 3,470 (5)% 3,648Stribild 1,825 52 % 1,197 122 % 539Complera/Eviplera 1,427 16 % 1,228 52 % 810Viread 1,108 5 % 1,058 10 % 959Genvoya 45 * — * —Other antiviral 69 (22)% 88 (21)% 111Total antiviral products 30,207 33 % 22,791 144 % 9,342Other products: Letairis 700 18 % 595 14 % 520Ranexa 588 15 % 510 14 % 449AmBisome 350 (10)% 388 10 % 352Zydelig 132 * 23 * —Other 174 4 % 167 18 % 141Total product sales $32,151 31 % $24,474 127 % $10,804* Percentage not meaningfulAntiviral ProductsThe following is additional discussion of our results by product: •HarvoniHarvoni sales accounted for 46% and 9% of our total antiviral product sales for 2015 and 2014, respectively. Harvoni was approved by FDA in October 2014, by the European Commission in November 2014 and by the Japanese Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare (MHLW) in July 2015. Harvoni was approved as the first once-daily single tablet regimen for the treatment of chronic HCV genotype 1.Net product sales of Harvoni in the United States were $10.1 billion in 2015 and $2.0 billion in 2014 driven by the product launch. Net product sales of Harvoni in Europe were $2.2 billion in 2015 and $103 million in 2014. We launched Harvoni in a number of countries including France, Germany, U.K., Italy and Spain. Net product sales of Harvoni in other international locations were $1.6 billion in 2015 and $23 million in 2014, primarily due to the product launch in Japan. 50•SovaldiSovaldi sales accounted for 17%, 45%, and 1% of our total antiviral product sales for 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively. Sovaldi was approved by FDA in December 2013, by the European Commission in January 2014 and by Japan in March 2015. Net product sales of Sovaldi decreased by 49% to $5.3 billion in 2015 compared to $10.3 billion in 2014 primarily due to volume declines in the United States with patients being prescribed Harvoni instead of Sovaldi, partially offset by volume increases in Japan and Europe as we continue to launch Sovaldi in various countries. In 2015, net product sales of Sovaldi were $2.4 billion in the United States, $1.6 billion in Europe and $1.3 billion in other international locations, primarily Japan. In 2014, net products sales of Sovaldi were $8.5 billion in United States, $1.5 billion in Europe and $230 million in other international locations.•Truvada Truvada sales accounted for 11%, 15% and 34% of our total antiviral product sales for 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively. Truvada sales increased by 4% to $3.5 billion in 2015 compared to $3.3 billion in 2014 and by 7% in 2014 compared to $3.1 billion in 2013, primarily due to sales volume growth and an increase in the average net selling price in the United States. In 2015, net product sales of Truvada were $2.1 billion in the United States, $1.1 billion in Europe and $284 million in other international locations. In 2014, net products sales of Truvada were $1.8 billion in United States, $1.3 billion in Europe and $278 million in other international locations. In 2013, net products sales of Truvada were $1.6 billion in United States, $1.3 billion in Europe and $270 million in other international locations.•Atripla Atripla sales accounted for 10%, 15% and 39% of our total antiviral product sales for 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively. Atripla sales decreased 10% to $3.1 billion in 2015 compared to $3.5 billion 2014 and 5% in 2014 compared to $3.6 billion in 2013, primarily due to declines in volume as doctors prescribed newer treatments such as Complera/Eviplera and Stribild. The efavirenz component of Atripla, which has a gross margin of zero, comprised $1.2 billion, $1.3 billion and $1.4 billion of our Atripla sales in 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively. In 2015, net product sales of Atripla were $2.2 billion in the United States, $694 million in Europe and $218 million in other international locations. In 2014, net products sales of Atripla were $2.4 billion in United States, $888 million in Europe and $225 million in other international locations. In 2013, net products sales of Atripla were $2.4 billion in United States, $1.1 billion in Europe and $231 million in other international locations.A generic version of Bristol-Myers Squibb Company's Sustiva (efavirenz), a component of Atripla, was made available in Canada and Europe in 2013 and will be made available in the United States in 2017. While we have observed some pricing pressure related to the efavirenz component of our Atripla sales, we have not yet observed any meaningful splitting of the Atripla single tablet regimen.•StribildStribild sales accounted for 6%, 5% and 6% of our total antiviral product sales for 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively. Stribild sales increased 52% to $1.8 billion in 2015 compared to $1.2 billion in 2014 and 122% compared to $539 million in 2013, primarily due to increased sales volume in the United States and Europe. In 2015, net product sales of Stribild were $1.5 billion in the United States and $282 million in Europe. In 2014, net products sales of Stribild were $1.0 billion in United States and $145 million in Europe. In 2013, net products sales of Stribild were primarily attributable to sales in United States of $510 million.•Complera/EvipleraComplera/Eviplera sales accounted for 5%, 5% and 9% of our total antiviral product sales for 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively. Complera/Eviplera sales increased by16% to $1.4 billion in 2015 compared to $1.2 billion 2014 and 52% compared to $810 million in 2013 driven primarily by sales volume growth in the United States and Europe. In 2015, net product sales of Complera/Eviplera were $796 million in the United States and $576 million in Europe. In 2014, net products sales of Complera/Eviplera were $663 million in United States and $513 million in Europe. In 2013, net products sales of Complera/Eviplera were $503 million in United States and $268 million in Europe.51•VireadViread sales accounted for 4%, 5%, 10% of our total antiviral product sales for 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively. Viread sales increased 5% in 2015 compared to 2014 and increased 10% in 2014 compared to 2013 driven primarily by sales volume in the United States and other international locations.In 2015, net product sales of Viread were $541 million in the United States, $310 million in Europe and $257 million in other international locations. In 2014, net products sales of Viread were $484 million in United States, $336 million in Europe and $238 million in other international locations. In 2013, net products sales of Viread were $428 million in United States, $354 million in Europe and $177 million in other international locations.Other ProductsOther products which include Letairis, Ranexa, AmBisome and Zydelig, were $1.9 billion in 2015, $1.7 billion in 2014 and $1.5 billion in 2013. The year-over-year increases in other product sales were primarily due to increased sales volume of Letairis and Zydelig.Royalty, Contract and Other Revenues The following table summarizes the period over period changes in our royalty, contract and other revenues: (In millions, except percentages) 2015 Change 2014 Change 2013Royalty, contract and other revenues $488 17% $416 5% $398Royalty, contract and other revenues primarily includes royalty revenues from F. Hoffman-La Roche Ltd for sales of Tamiflu. The majority of our royalties are recognized in the quarter following the quarter in which the corresponding product sales occur.Cost of Goods Sold and Product Gross MarginThe following table summarizes the period over period changes in our product sales, cost of goods sold and product gross margin: (In millions, except percentages) 2015 Change 2014 Change 2013Total product sales $32,151 31% $24,474 127% $10,804Cost of goods sold $4,006 6% $3,788 32% $2,859Product gross margin 88% 85% 74%Our product gross margin for 2015 increased compared to 2014 primarily due to changes in product mix, as Atripla sales, which include the efavirenz component at a gross margin of zero, declined and HCV sales increased as a percentage of product sales. Our product gross margin for 2014 increased compared to 2013 primarily due to changes in product mix, resulting from the launches of Sovaldi and Harvoni. Research and Development Expenses The following table summarizes the period over period changes in R&D expenses:(In millions, except percentages) 2015 Change 2014 Change 2013Research and development $3,014 6% $2,854 35% $2,120R&D expenses summarized above consist primarily of clinical studies performed by contract research organizations, materials and supplies, licenses and fees, milestone payments under collaboration arrangements, personnel costs, including salaries, benefits and stock-based compensation and overhead allocations consisting of various support and facilities-related costs. We do not track total R&D expenses by product candidate, therapeutic area or development phase. However, we manage our R&D expenses by identifying the R&D activities we anticipate will be performed during a given period and then prioritizing efforts based on scientific data, probability of successful development, market potential, available human and capital resources and other considerations. We continually review our R&D pipeline and the status of development and, as necessary, reallocate resources among the R&D portfolio that we believe will best support the future growth of our business.52The following table provides a breakout of R&D expenses by major cost type: (In millions, except percentages) 2015 2014 2013Clinical studies and outside services $1,634 $1,688 $1,147Personnel and infrastructure expenses 1,041 900 714Facilities, IT and other costs 339 266 259Total $3,014 $2,854 $2,120In 2015, R&D expenses increased $160 million or 6% compared to 2014, primarily due to increases in personnel and infrastructure expenses of $141 million and facilities, IT and other costs of $73 million to support our ongoing clinical study activity and geographic expansion. As discussed below, 2014 clinical studies and outside services included one-time items of $350 million for collaboration and acquisition related expenses and the purchase of a FDA priority review voucher.In 2014, R&D expenses increased $734 million or 35% compared to 2013, primarily due to an increase in clinical studies and outside services. The increase in clinical studies and outside services includes one-time items of $350 million for collaboration and acquisition related expenses and the purchase of a FDA priority review voucher and $191 million for expenses related to the progression of clinical study activity, primarily in the oncology and HIV areas. Personnel and infrastructure expenses increased $186 million to support our ongoing clinical study activity, geographic expansion and marketed product support. In 2016, we expect R&D expenses to increase over 2015 to support the expansion of our clinical studies in various therapeutic areas including liver disease, HIV and inflammation.Selling, General and Administrative Expenses The following table summarizes the period over period changes in SG&A expenses:(In millions, except percentages) 2015 Change 2014 Change 2013Selling, general and administrative $3,426 15% $2,983 76% $1,699SG&A expenses relate to sales and marketing, finance, human resources, legal and other administrative activities. Expenses are primarily comprised of facilities and overhead costs, information technology infrastructure, outside marketing, advertising and legal expenses and other general and administrative costs. SG&A expenses also include the Branded Prescription Drug (BPD) fee, enacted with the Affordable Care Act in 2010.In 2015, SG&A expenses increased $443 million or 15% compared to 2014 primarily due to an increase of $627 million in headcount-related, marketing and other expenses to support the growth and geographic expansion of our business, partially offset by a decrease in BPD fee expense of $100 million due to a change in estimate of our portion of the fee related to prior years.In 2014, SG&A expenses increased $1.3 billion or 76% compared to 2013 primarily due to an increase in headcount-related and other expenses of $542 million to support the ongoing growth and expansion of our business, including commercial expansion related to the launches of Sovaldi and Harvoni and an increase in BPD fee expense of $480 million. During 2014, the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) issued final regulations which accelerated the expense recognition criteria for the fee obligation from the year in which the fee is paid, to the year in which the market share used to allocate the fee is determined. As a result, we recognized $460 million in our 2014 SG&A expenses that would have previously been accrued in 2015. Our BPD fee expenses were $414 million in 2015, $590 million in 2014 and $110 million in 2013. The BPD fee is not tax deductible. In 2016, we expect SG&A expenses to increase compared to 2015 to support our continued build-out and expansion of our commercial infrastructure globally to support our products and to increase by an estimated $200 million for the BPD fee.Interest ExpenseIn 2015, interest expense increased to $688 million compared to $412 million in 2014. The increase was primarily due to the issuance of $10.0 billion aggregate principal amount of senior unsecured notes (the 2015 Notes) in 2015 and the issuance of $8.0 billion aggregate principal amount of senior unsecured notes (the 2014 Notes) in 2014. 53In 2014, interest expense increased to $412 million compared to $307 million in 2013. The increase was primarily a result of the issuance of the 2014 Notes, offset by repayment of our senior unsecured notes issued in March and December 2011 (the 2011 Notes) and conversion and maturity of our convertible senior notes due in May 2014 (the May 2014 Notes) and partial conversion of our convertible senior notes due in May 2016 (the May 2016 Notes, and collectively with the May 2014 Notes, the May Notes).Other Income (Expense), Net Other income (expense), net increased to $154 million in 2015 compared to $3 million in 2014 primarily due to higher interest income as the result of our portfolio earning a higher yield and higher cash balances. Other income (expense), net was insignificant in 2014 and 2013. Provision for Income Taxes Our provision for income taxes was $3.6 billion, $2.8 billion and $1.2 billion in 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively. The 2015 effective tax rate of 16.4% differed from the U.S. federal statutory rate of 35% primarily due to certain operating earnings from non-U.S. subsidiaries that are considered indefinitely reinvested and tax credits, partially offset by state taxes, our portion of the non-tax deductible BPD fee and amortization expense of the intangible asset related to sofosbuvir for which we receive no tax benefit. We do not provide for U.S. income taxes on undistributed earnings of our foreign operations that are intended to be indefinitely reinvested in our foreign subsidiaries.The 2014 effective tax rate of 18.8% differed from the U.S. federal statutory rate of 35% primarily due to certain operating earnings from non-U.S. subsidiaries that are considered indefinitely reinvested and tax credits, partially offset by state taxes, our portion of the non-tax deductible BPD fee and amortization expense of the intangible asset related to sofosbuvir for which we receive no tax benefit. The 2013 effective tax rate of 27.3% differed from the U.S. federal statutory rate of 35% primarily due to the retroactive extension of the 2012 federal research tax credit in January 2013, the 2013 federal research tax credit and certain operating earnings from non-U.S. subsidiaries that are considered indefinitely reinvested, partially offset by state taxes, our portion of the non-tax deductible BPD fee, amortization expense of the intangible asset related to sofosbuvir and contingent consideration expense related to certain acquisitions for which we receive no tax benefit.Subsequent EventGalapagos We entered into a license and collaboration agreement with Galapagos NV (Galapagos), a clinical-stage biotechnology company based in Belgium, for the development and commercialization of filgotinib, a JAK1-selective inhibitor being investigated for inflammatory disease indications. Under the terms of the agreement, which became effective on January 19, 2016, we made an upfront license fee payment of $300 million and a $425 million equity investment in Galapagos. In addition, Galapagos is eligible to receive development and regulatory milestone-based payments of up to $755 million, sales-based milestone payments of up to $600 million, tiered royalties on global sales and a profit split in potential co-promotion territories.Liquidity and Capital Resources We believe that our existing capital resources, supplemented by our cash flows generated from operating activities will be adequate to satisfy our capital needs for the foreseeable future. The following table summarizes our cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities and working capital: (in millions) 2015 2014 2013As of December 31: Cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities $26,208 $11,726 $2,571Working capital $14,872 $11,953 $590 Cash, Cash Equivalents and Marketable Securities Cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities totaled $26.2 billion at December 31, 2015, an increase of $14.5 billion or 124% when compared to $11.7 billion at December 31, 2014. During 2015, we generated $20.3 billion in cash flows from operations, received $9.9 billion in net proceeds from the 2015 Notes and repurchased $10.0 billion of common stock. Additionally, we utilized $3.9 billion to settle 46 million warrants related to the May 2016 Notes (the 2016 Warrants) and paid cash dividends of $1.9 billion.54Cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities totaled $11.7 billion at December 31, 2014, an increase of $9.2 billion or 356% when compared to $2.6 billion at December 31, 2013. During 2014, we generated $12.8 billion in cash flows from operations, received $7.9 billion from the issuance of the 2014 Notes, repaid $2.3 billion in debt, net of convertible note hedges, repurchased $5.3 billion of common stock and paid approximately $4.1 billion to settle the warrants expiring in 2014 related to the May 2014 Notes (the 2014 Warrants). Of the total cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities at December 31, 2015, approximately $15.7 billion was generated from operations in foreign jurisdictions and is intended for use in our foreign operations. We do not rely on unrepatriated earnings as a source of funds for our domestic business as we expect to have sufficient cash flow and borrowing capacity in the United States to fund our domestic operational and strategic needs. Working Capital Working capital was $14.9 billion at December 31, 2015. The increase of $2.9 billion from working capital as of December 31, 2014 was driven primarily by the increase in cash, cash equivalents and short-term marketable securities and an increase in accounts receivable, partially offset by increases in accrued government and other rebates.Working capital was $12.0 billion at December 31, 2014. The increase of $11.4 billion from working capital as of December 31, 2013 was driven primarily by positive cash flows from operations and an increase in cash and cash equivalents due to the issuance of the 2014 Notes, partially offset by cash paid to settle convertible senior notes and the 2014 Warrants, repayment of our bank debt, and repurchases of common stock.Cash FlowsThe following table summarizes our cash flow activities:(in millions) 2015 2014 2013Cash provided by (used in): Operating activities $20,329 $12,818 $3,105Investing activities $(12,475) $(1,823) $(254)Financing activities $(4,963) $(3,025) $(2,544) Cash Provided by Operating Activities Cash provided by operating activities was $20.3 billion in 2015, consisting primarily of net income of $18.1 billion, adjusted for non-cash items such as $1.1 billion of depreciation and amortization expenses, $382 million for stock-based compensation expense and $1.2 billion of net cash inflow related to changes in operating assets and liabilities. Cash flows from operations may decrease in the future as we continue to make cash payments related to accrued government and other rebates.Cash provided by operating activities was $12.8 billion in 2014, consisting primarily of net income of $12.1 billion, adjusted for non-cash items such as $1.1 billion of depreciation and amortization expenses and $360 million of stock-based compensation expenses. This was partially offset by $518 million of net cash outflow related to changes in operating assets and liabilities. Cash provided by operating activities was $3.1 billion in 2013, consisting primarily of net income of $3.1 billion, adjusted for non-cash items such as $345 million of depreciation and amortization expenses and $252 million of stock-based compensation expenses. This was partially offset by $562 million of net cash outflow related to changes in operating assets and liabilities. Cash Used in Investing Activities Cash used in investing activities in 2015 was $12.5 billion, consisting primarily of $11.7 billion in net purchases of marketable securities and $747 million in capital expenditures related to the expansion of our business.Cash used in investing activities in 2014 was $1.8 billion, consisting primarily of $1.2 billion in net purchases of marketable securities and $557 million in capital expenditures related to the expansion of our business.Cash used in investing activities in 2013 was $254 million, consisting primarily of $379 million used in our acquisition of YM BioSciences, net of cash acquired and $190 million of capital expenditures primarily related to construction in progress associated with new facilities at our headquarters to support the ongoing growth of our business. This was partially offset by $315 million of net proceeds from sales of marketable securities. 55Cash Used in Financing Activities Cash used in financing activities in 2015 was $5.0 billion, consisting primarily of $10.0 billion used to repurchase common stock under our stock repurchase programs, $3.9 billion used to settle 46 million of the 2016 Warrants, and $1.9 billion used to pay dividends. These payments were primarily offset by $9.9 billion in net proceeds from the issuance of our 2015 Notes.Cash used in financing activities in 2014 was $3.0 billion, consisting primarily of $2.3 billion used to repay debt, net of convertible notes hedges, $5.3 billion used to repurchase common stock under our stock repurchase programs and $4.1 billion to settle the 2014 Warrants. These payments were primarily offset by $7.9 billion in net proceeds from the issuance of our 2014 Notes.Cash used in financing activities in 2013 was $2.5 billion, consisting primarily of $4.4 billion used to repay debt financing which includes the maturity of our convertible senior notes due in May 2013 (the May 2013 Notes) and conversions of our May Notes, $1.0 billion to settle the warrants related to our May 2013 Notes that settled in August 2013 and $582 million used to repurchase common stock under our stock repurchase program. This cash outflow was partially offset by proceeds of $2.8 billion related to our convertible note hedges. Debt and Credit FacilityLong-Term ObligationsThe summary of our borrowings under various financing arrangements is included in Item 8, Note 10 Debt and Credit Facility in our Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.Debt FinancingIn September 2015, we issued our 2015 Notes in the aggregate principal amount of $10.0 billion. In 2014, we issued our 2014 Notes in the aggregate principal amount of $8.0 billion. The 2015 Notes and 2014 Notes were issued for general corporate purposes, which may include the repayment of debt, working capital, payment of dividends and the repurchase of our outstanding common stock pursuant to our authorized share repurchase programs.Convertible Senior Note Repayments and Warrant SettlementsDuring 2015, a portion of the May 2016 Notes were settled and we repaid $213 million of principal balance related to these notes. We also paid $784 million in cash related to the conversion spread of the May 2016 Notes, which represents the conversion value in excess of the principal amount, and received $784 million in cash from the convertible note hedges related to the May 2016 Notes. In 2015, we entered into modified agreements with our warrant counterparties which changed the timing of the expiration for 46 million of the 2016 Warrants. The agreements allowed us to settle the 46 million warrants at our option, in cash or shares. According to the terms of the agreements, these warrants expired during a 32 trading-day period which commenced on May 11, 2015 and ended on June 24, 2015. We exercised our option to settle in cash, and as a result, paid$3.9 billion as the market value of our common stock at the time of the exercise of the warrants exceeded their strike prices.During 2014, our May 2014 Notes matured and a portion of our May 2016 Notes was converted. During 2014, we repaid $912 million of principal balance relating to the May Notes. We also paid $2.5 billion in cash related to the conversion spread of the May Notes, which represents the conversion value in excess of the principal amount, and received $2.5 billion in cash from the convertible note hedges related to the May Notes. In 2014, we exercised our option to settle in cash the 2014 Warrants. As a result, we paid $4.1 billion to settle the warrants as the market value of our common stock at the time of the exercise of the warrants exceeded their strike price. There were 56 million shares of our common stock underlying the 2014 Warrants, which had a strike price of $28.38 per share and expired during the 40 trading-day period commencing August 1, 2014 and ending on September 26, 2014. As of December 31, 2015 we had $283 million of outstanding convertible senior notes. The notes will mature in May 2016, unless earlier repurchased or converted. The remaining 9 million outstanding 2016 Warrants have a strike price of $28.76 per share, as adjusted for quarterly dividend distributions, and are due to expire during the 40 trading-day period commencing August 1, 2016. There were no other changes in terms for the remaining 9 million 2016 warrants. Credit FacilityIn January 2012, we entered into a five-year $1.3 billion revolving credit facility credit agreement (the Five-Year Revolving Credit Agreement) and borrowed $750 million thereunder. In 2013, we repaid $150 million under the Five-Year Revolving Credit Agreement. During 2014, we repaid the remaining balance of $600 million that was outstanding. The Five-Year Revolving Credit Agreement contains customary representations, warranties, affirmative, negative and financial maintenance covenants and events of default. The loan bears interest at either (i) the Eurodollar Rate plus the Applicable 56Margin or (ii) the Base Rate plus the Applicable Margin, each as defined in the credit agreement. We may reduce the commitments and may prepay the loan in whole or in part at any time without premium or penalty. We are required to comply with certain covenants under the credit agreement and note indentures and as of December 31, 2015, we were not in violation of any covenants, and no amounts were outstanding under the credit facility.Capital Return ProgramStock Repurchase ProgramsIn January 2015, our Board of Directors authorized a five-year, $15.0 billion stock repurchase program (2015 Program). The 2015 Program commenced after the $5.0 billion stock repurchase program authorized by our Board of Directors in May 2014 was completed in the first quarter of 2015. The $5.0 billion repurchase program authorized by our Board of Directors in January 2011 was completed in 2014. As of December 31, 2015, the remaining authorized repurchase amount under the 2015 Program was $8.0 billion.The following table summarizes our stock repurchases under the above-described programs:(in millions) 2015 2014 2013Shares repurchased and retired 95 59 10Amount $10,002 $5,349 $582In February 2016, we entered into an accelerated share repurchase program (“ASR”) to repurchase $5.0 billion of our common stock. We paid $5.0 billion and received 46 million shares of our common stock, which represents approximately 80% of the total shares expected to be delivered to us under the ASR. The total number of shares to be received under the ASR will be based on the average price of our common stock during the purchase period, which will end in April 2016. In February 2016, our Board of Directors authorized a new $12.0 billion share repurchase program (2016 Program) which will commence upon the completion of our 2015 Program. Purchases under the 2016 Program may be made in the open market or in privately negotiated transactions. DividendsIn the second quarter of 2015, we began paying quarterly dividends on our common stock. During 2015, we paid cash dividends of $1.9 billion or $1.29 per share. On February 2, 2016, we announced that our Board of Directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.43 per share of our common stock, with a payment date of March 30, 2016 to all stockholders of record as of the close of business on March 16, 2016. Capital ResourcesWe believe our existing capital resources, supplemented by cash flows generated from our operations, will be adequate to satisfy our capital needs for the foreseeable future. Our future capital requirements will depend on many factors, including but not limited to the following: •the commercial performance of our current and future products; •the progress and scope of our R&D efforts, including preclinical studies and clinical trials; •the cost, timing and outcome of regulatory reviews; •the expansion of our sales and marketing capabilities; •administrative expenses; •the possibility of acquiring additional manufacturing capabilities or office facilities; •the possibility of acquiring other companies or new products; •costs associated with the settlement and conversion of our convertible senior notes and related warrants;•the establishment of additional collaborative relationships with other companies; and •costs associated with the defense, settlement and adverse results of litigation and government investigations. We may in the future require additional funding, which could be in the form of proceeds from equity or debt financings. If such funding is required, we cannot guarantee that it will be available to us on favorable terms, if at all. 57Critical Accounting Policies, Estimates and Judgments The discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based on our Consolidated Financial Statements, which have been prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses and related disclosures. On an ongoing basis, we evaluate and base our estimates on historical experience and on various other market specific and other relevant assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ significantly from these estimates. We believe the following critical accounting policies reflect the more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our Consolidated Financial Statements. Revenue Recognition Product Sales We recognize revenues from product sales when there is persuasive evidence that an arrangement exists, delivery has occurred, the price is fixed or determinable and collectability is reasonably assured. We record product sales net of estimated mandatory and supplemental discounts to government payers, in addition to discounts to private payers, and other related charges. These are generally referred to as gross-to-net deductions and are recorded in the same period the related sales occur. Government and other rebates and chargebacks represent the majority of our gross-to-net deductions and require complex and significant judgment by management. Estimates are assessed each period and updated to reflect current information.Government and Other Rebates and ChargebacksGovernment and other rebates and chargebacks include amounts paid to payers and healthcare providers in the United States, including Medicaid rebates, ADAPs, Veterans Administration and Public Health Service discounts, and other rebates, as well as foreign government rebates. Rebates and chargebacks are based on contractual arrangements or statutory requirements which may vary by product, by payer and individual payer plans. For qualified programs that can purchase our products through wholesalers or other distributors at a lower contractual price, the wholesalers or distributors charge back to us the difference between their acquisition cost and the lower contractual price. Our consolidated allowances for government and other chargebacks that are payable to our direct customers are classified as reductions of accounts receivable, and totaled $907 million as of December 31, 2015 and $220 million as of December 31, 2014. Our consolidated allowance for government and other rebates that will be paid to parties other than our direct customers are recorded in accrued government and other rebates on our Consolidated Balance Sheets, and totaled $4.1 billion as of December 31, 2015 and $2.3 billion as of December 31, 2014. Our allowances for government and other rebates and chargebacks are estimated based on products sold, historical utilization rates, pertinent third party industry information, estimated patient population, known market events or trends, channel inventory data and/or other market data. We also consider new information regarding changes in programs' regulations and guidelines that would impact the amount of the actual rebates and/or our expectations regarding future utilization rates for these programs. We believe that the methodology that we use to estimate our government and other rebates and chargebacks is reasonable and appropriate given the current facts and circumstances. However, actual results may differ significantly from our estimates. During the last three years, our actual government rebates and chargebacks claimed for prior periods have varied by less than 5% from our estimates.58The following table summarizes the consolidated activity in our government and other rebates and chargebacks accounts (in millions):Accrued government and other rebates and chargebacks: Balance at Beginning of Year Decrease/(Increase) to Product Sales Payments Balance at End of YearYear ended December 31, 2015: Activity related to 2015 sales $— $16,400 $(11,597) $4,803Activity related to sales prior to 2015 2,536 7 (2,321) 222Total $2,536 $16,407 $(13,918) $5,025Year ended December 31, 2014: Activity related to 2014 sales $— $6,113 $(3,650) $2,463Activity related to sales prior to 2014 1,167 (109) (985) 73Total $1,167 $6,004 $(4,635) $2,536The majority of the increase in accrued government and other rebates and chargebacks in 2015, compared to 2014, was driven by the increase in sales volume in 2015.Allowance for Doubtful Accounts We maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments. This allowance is based on our analysis of several factors, including, but not limited to, contractual payment terms, historical payment patterns of our customers and individual customer circumstances, an analysis of days sales outstanding by geographic region and a review of the local economic environment and its potential impact on government funding and reimbursement practices. If the financial condition of our customers or the economic environment in which they operate were to deteriorate, resulting in an inability to make payments, additional allowances may be required. We believe that the allowance for doubtful accounts is adequate; however, significant deterioration in any of the above factors could materially change these expectations and may result in an increase to our allowance for doubtful accounts. As of December 31, 2015 and 2014, our accounts receivable, net were $5.9 billion and $4.6 billion and our allowances for doubtful accounts were $65 million and $31 million, respectively.Valuation of Intangible AssetsIn conjunction with our business combinations, we have recorded intangible assets primarily related to in-process research and development (IPR&D) projects. We had total intangible assets of $10.2 billion as of December 31, 2015 and $11.1 billion as of December 31, 2014. The identifiable intangible assets are measured at their respective fair values as of the acquisition date. The models used in valuing these intangible assets require the use of significant estimates and assumptions including but not limited to:•estimates of revenues and operating profits related to the products or product candidates;•the probability of success for unapproved product candidates considering their stages of development;•the time and resources needed to complete the development and approval of product candidates;•the life of the potential commercialized products and associated risks, including the inherent difficulties and uncertainties in developing a product candidate such as obtaining FDA and other regulatory approvals; and•risks related to the viability of and potential alternative treatments in any future target markets.We believe the fair values used to record intangible assets acquired in connection with a business combination are based upon reasonable estimates and assumptions given the facts and circumstances as of the related valuation dates. Intangible assets related to IPR&D projects are considered to be indefinite-lived until the completion or abandonment of the associated R&D efforts. If and when development is complete, which generally occurs if and when regulatory approval to market a product is obtained, the associated assets would be deemed finite-lived and would then be amortized based on their respective estimated useful lives at that point in time. During the period the assets are considered indefinite-lived, they will not be amortized but will be tested for impairment on an annual basis as well as between annual tests if we become aware of any events or changes that would indicate that it is more likely than not that the fair value of the IPR&D projects below their respective carrying amounts. The fair value of our indefinite-lived intangible assets is dependent on assumptions such as the expected timing or probability of achieving the specified milestones, changes in projected revenues or changes in discount rates. Significant judgment is employed in determining these assumptions and changes to our assumptions could have a significant impact on our results of operations in any given period.59Intangible assets with finite useful lives are amortized over their estimated useful lives primarily on a straight-line basis. Intangible assets with finite useful lives are reviewed for impairment when facts or circumstances suggest that the carrying value of these assets may not be recoverable.Tax Provision We estimate our income tax provision, including deferred tax assets and liabilities, based on significant management judgment. We evaluate the realization of all or a portion of our deferred tax assets on a quarterly basis. We record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets to the amounts that are more likely than not to be realized. We consider future taxable income, ongoing tax planning strategies and our historical financial performance in assessing the need for a valuation allowance. If we expect to realize deferred tax assets for which we have previously recorded a valuation allowance, we will reduce the valuation allowance in the period in which such determination is first made. We are subject to income taxes in both the United States and various foreign jurisdictions including Ireland. Due to economic and political conditions, various countries are actively considering changes to existing tax laws. We cannot predict the form or timing of potential legislative changes that could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations. In addition, significant judgment is required in determining our worldwide provision for income taxes.We record liabilities related to uncertain tax positions in accordance with the guidance that clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in an enterprise's financial statements by prescribing a minimum recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. We do not believe any such uncertain tax positions currently pending will have a material adverse effect on our Consolidated Financial Statements, although an adverse resolution of one or more of these uncertain tax positions in any period could have a material impact on the results of operations for that period. At December 31, 2015 and 2014, we had total federal, state and foreign unrecognized tax benefits of $1.4 billion and $661 million, respectively. Of the total unrecognized tax benefits, $1.3 billion and $602 million at December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively, if recognized, would reduce our effective tax rate in the period of recognition. As of December 31, 2015, we believe that it is reasonably possible that our unrecognized tax benefits will decrease by approximately $7 million in the next 12 months as we expect to have clarification from the IRS and other tax authorities regarding our uncertain tax positions. With respect to the remaining unrecognized tax benefits, we are currently unable to make a reasonable estimate as to the period of cash settlement, if any, with the respective tax authorities. We file federal, state and foreign income tax returns in many jurisdictions in the United States and abroad. For federal income tax purposes, the statute of limitations is open for 2010 and onwards. For certain acquired entities, the statute of limitations is open for all years from inception due to our utilization of their net operating losses and credits carried over from prior years. For California income tax purposes, the statute of limitations is open for 2010 and onwards. Our income tax returns are subject to audit by federal, state and foreign tax authorities. We are currently under examination by the IRS for the 2010, 2011 and 2012 tax years and by various state and foreign jurisdictions. There are differing interpretations of tax laws and regulations, and as a result, significant disputes may arise with these tax authorities involving issues of the timing and amount of deductions and allocations of income among various tax jurisdictions. We periodically evaluate our exposures associated with our tax filing positions. Off Balance Sheet Arrangements We do not have any off balance sheet arrangements as defined in Item 303(a)(4)(ii) of Regulation S-K. 60Contractual ObligationsOur contractual obligations consist of debt obligations, operating leases, capital commitments, purchase obligations for active pharmaceutical ingredients and inventory-related items and clinical trials contracts. The following table summarizes our significant enforceable and legally binding obligations, future commitments and obligations related to all contracts that we are likely to continue regardless of the fact that certain of these obligations may be cancelable as of December 31, 2015 (in millions): Payments due by PeriodContractual Obligations Total Less than oneyear 1-3 years 3-5 years More than 5yearsDebt (1) $36,003 $1,819 $2,645 $4,587 $26,952Operating lease obligations 317 66 114 74 63Capital commitments (2) 847 387 438 22 —Purchase obligations (3)(4) 3,084 1,759 1,034 208 83Clinical trials (5) 1,336 683 481 126 46Total $41,587 $4,714 $4,712 $5,017 $27,144 (1) Our debt obligations include senior unsecured notes and convertible senior notes. Interest payments are incurred and calculated based on terms of the related notes. For further information, see Item 8, Note 10 Debt and Credit Facility in our Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.(2) At December 31, 2015, we had firm capital project commitments of approximately $847 million primarily relating to construction of new buildings. (3) At December 31, 2015, we had firm purchase commitments related to active pharmaceutical ingredients and certain inventory-related items. These amounts include minimum purchase requirements. (4) In addition to the above, we have committed to make potential future milestone payments to third parties as part of licensing, collaboration and development arrangements. Payments under these agreements generally become due and payable only upon achievement of certain developmental, regulatory and/or commercial milestones. Because the achievement of these milestones is neither probable nor reasonably estimable, such contingencies have not been recorded on our Consolidated Balance Sheets and have not been included in the table above. (5) At December 31, 2015, we had several clinical studies in various clinical trial phases. Our most significant clinical trial expenditures are to contract research organizations (CROs). Although all of our material contracts with CROs are cancelable, we historically have not canceled such contracts. These amounts reflect commitments based on existing contracts and do not reflect any future modifications to, or terminations of, existing contracts or anticipated or potential new contracts. We had total gross unrecognized tax benefit liabilities including interest and penalties of $1.4 billion as of December 31, 2015. We believe that it is reasonably possible that our unrecognized tax benefits will decrease by approximately $7 million in the next 12 months as we expect to have clarification from the IRS and other tax authorities regarding our uncertain tax positions. With respect to the remaining unrecognized tax benefits, we are currently unable to make a reasonable estimate as to the period of cash settlement, if any, with the respective tax authorities. The unrecognized tax benefits were included in current and long-term income taxes payable and long-term deferred tax assets on our Consolidated Balance Sheets and have not been included in the table above. Recent Accounting Pronouncements The information required by this item is included in Item 8, Note 1 Organization and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies in our Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.ITEM 7A.QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISKWe are exposed to market risks that may result from changes in foreign currency exchange rates, interest rates and credit risks. To reduce certain of these risks, we enter into various types of foreign currency or interest rate derivative hedging transactions, follow investment guidelines and monitor outstanding receivables as part of our risk management program.Foreign Currency Exchange Risk Our operations include manufacturing and sales activities in the United States, Canada and Ireland as well as sales activities in countries outside the United States, including Europe and Asia Pacific. As a result, our financial results could be significantly affected by factors such as changes in foreign currency exchange rates or weak economic conditions in the foreign markets in which we distribute our products. Our operating results are exposed to changes in foreign currency exchange rates 61between the U.S. dollar and various foreign currencies, the most significant of which are the Euro and Yen. When the U.S. dollar strengthens against these currencies, the relative value of sales made in the respective foreign currency decreases. Conversely, when the U.S. dollar weakens against these currencies, the relative amounts of such sales increase. Overall, we are a net receiver of foreign currencies and, therefore, benefit from a weaker U.S. dollar and are adversely affected by a stronger U.S. dollar relative to those foreign currencies in which we transact significant amounts of business. Approximately 34% of our product sales were denominated in foreign currencies during 2015. To partially mitigate the impact of changes in currency exchange rates on net cash flows from our foreign currency denominated sales, we may enter into foreign currency exchange forward and option contracts. We also hedge certain monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies, which reduces but does not eliminate our exposure to currency fluctuations between the date a transaction is recorded and the date that cash is collected or paid. In general, the market risks of these contracts are offset by corresponding gains and losses on the transactions being hedged. As of December 31, 2015 and 2014, we had open foreign currency forward contracts with notional amounts of $9.1 billion and $6.4 billion, respectively. A hypothetical 10% adverse movement in foreign currency exchange rates compared with the U.S. dollar relative to exchange rates at December 31, 2015 would have resulted in a reduction in fair value of these contracts of approximately $893 million on this date and, if realized, would negatively affect earnings over the remaining life of the contracts. The same hypothetical movement in foreign currency exchange rates compared with the U.S. dollar relative to exchange rates at December 31, 2014, would have resulted in a reduction in fair value of these contracts of approximately $600 million on this date and, if realized, would negatively affect earnings over the remaining life of the contracts. The analysis does not consider the impact that hypothetical changes in foreign currency exchange rates would have on anticipated transactions that these foreign currency sensitive instruments were designed to offset.Interest Rate Risk Our portfolio of available-for-sale marketable securities and our fixed and variable rate liabilities create an exposure to interest rate risk. With respect to our investment portfolio, we adhere to an investment policy that requires us to limit amounts invested in securities based on credit rating, maturity, industry group and investment type and issuer, except for securities issued by the U.S. government. The goals of our investment policy, in order of priority, are as follows: • safety and preservation of principal and diversification of risk; • liquidity of investments sufficient to meet cash flow requirements; and • competitive after-tax rate of return. The following table summarizes the expected maturities and average interest rates of our interest-generating assets and fixed interest-bearing liabilities at December 31, 2015 (in millions, except percentages): Expected Maturity Total Fair Value 2016 2017 2018 2019 2020 Thereafter Total Assets Available-for-sale debt securities $1,759 $6,020 $4,466 $525 $384 $206 $13,360 $13,360Average interest rate 0.75% 1.21% 1.58% 1.36% 1.48% 1.71% Liabilities Debt (1) $985 $— $1,000 $500 $2,500 $17,250 $22,235 $23,738Average interest rate 2.64% —% 1.85% 2.05% 2.51% 4.24% (1) As of December 31, 2015 our debt consisted of senior unsecured notes and convertible senior notes with an aggregate carrying value of $22.2 billion. Since these instruments bear interest at fixed rates, changes in interest rates do not affect interest expense or cash flows. However, the fair value of these instruments fluctuates when interest rates change. See Note 10, Debt and Credit Facility in our Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information.Credit RiskWe are subject to credit risk from our portfolio of cash equivalents and marketable securities. Under our investment policy, we limit amounts invested in such securities by credit rating, maturity, industry group, investment type and issuer, except for securities issued by the U.S. government. We are not exposed to any significant concentrations of credit risk from these financial instruments. The goals of our investment policy, in order of priority, are as follows: safety and preservation of principal and diversification of risk; liquidity of investments sufficient to meet cash flow requirements; and a competitive after-tax rate of return. 62We are also subject to credit risk from our accounts receivable related to our product sales. The majority of our trade accounts receivable arises from product sales in the United States and Europe. As of December 31, 2015, our accounts receivable in Southern Europe, specifically Greece, Italy, Portugal and Spain, totaled approximately $1.3 billion, of which $218 million were greater than 120 days past due, including $31 million greater than 365 days past due. As of December 31, 2014, our accounts receivable in Southern Europe, specifically Greece, Italy, Portugal and Spain, totaled approximately $504 million, of which $157 million were greater than 120 days past due, including $44 million greater than 365 days past due. To date, we have not experienced significant losses with respect to the collection of our accounts receivable.63",2023-12-30 19:04:30.793880

The Nimbus program includes the lead candidate NDI-010976, an ACC inhibitor, and other pre-clinical ACC inhibitors for the potential treatment of non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), hepatocellular carcinoma and other diseases.•Closed on a license and collaboration agreement with Galapagos NV (Galapagos), a clinical-stage biotechnology company based in Belgium, for the development and commercialization of filgotinib, a JAK1-selective inhibitor being investigated for inflammatory disease indications. 2016 Financial Highlights During 2016, total revenues decreased to $30.4 billion and total product sales decreased to $30.0 billion, compared to $32.6 billion and $32.2 billion in 2015, respectively, primarily due to lower sales of Harvoni and Sovaldi, partially offset by sales of Epclusa and TAF-based products, Genvoya, Descovy and Odefsey. In the United States, product sales were $19.3 billion in 2016, compared to $21.2 billion in 2015. In Europe, product sales were $6.1 billion in 2016, compared to $7.2 billion in 2015. In Japan, product sales were $2.5 billion, compared to $1.9 billion in 2015. Sales in other international locations were $2.1 billion in 2016, compared to $1.9 billion in 2015. 47Research and development (R&D) expenses increased 69% to $5.1 billion for 2016 compared to 2015, primarily due to the overall progression of clinical studies, including ongoing milestone payments, our purchase of an FDA priority review voucher, up-front collaboration expenses related to our license and collaboration agreement with Galapagos and our purchase of Nimbus. In addition, we recorded in-process R&D (IPR&D) impairment charges related to momelotinib and simtuzumab.Selling, general and administrative (SG&A) expenses were $3.4 billion for 2016 and 2015. Declines in our branded prescription drug (BPD) fee expense were offset by higher costs to support new product launches and our geographic expansion.Net income attributable to Gilead for 2016 was $13.5 billion or $9.94 per diluted share, compared to $18.1 billion or $11.91 per diluted share in 2015, primarily due to lower product sales and higher R&D expenses. Year-over-year earnings per share were favorably impacted by our share repurchase activities. During 2016, we repurchased a total of 123 million shares for $11.0 billion, of which 54 million shares or $5.0 billion were repurchased under an accelerated stock repurchase program.As of December 31, 2016, we had $32.4 billion of cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities, compared to $26.2 billion as of December 31, 2015. This increase was primarily due to the issuance of $5.0 billion aggregate principal amount of senior unsecured notes in September 2016 (the 2016 Notes). During 2016, we generated $16.7 billion in operating cash flow, utilized $11.0 billion to repurchase stock and paid cash dividends of $2.5 billion. Outlook 2017In 2017, we will continue to maintain our strong operating and financial discipline. From a R&D perspective, we will continue to invest in conducting new and ongoing clinical studies, which support both our existing products and our product candidates. We expect to move forward on a number of late-stage clinical studies for new product candidates, including progress of our Phase 3 studies of selonsertib for NASH. In order to further develop our product pipeline, we will focus on leveraging our capital to pursue external licensing and acquisition opportunities which fit into our long-term strategic plan.From a commercial perspective, we will continue to focus on supporting the uptake of our recently launched TAF-based regimens and continue to promote the use of our existing commercial products. We also hired a field-based team to promote Truvada for PrEP as we believe it will continue to be an integral part of our growth in HIV in the United States as communities embrace the public health benefits of prevention. In HCV, it is very difficult for us to accurately predict our revenue because HCV is a cure market. We expect patient starts to decline relative to 2016 in all major markets, and this will be the primary driver of our expected decline in total product sales. We also expect product sales to be impacted by the effects of competition on market share and net price, as well as a continued decrease in the average duration of treatment as fewer patients are treated for 24 or 12 weeks and more patients are treated for 8 weeks. While we anticipate HCV revenues in 2017 to decline from prior year levels, there are still many patients to treat and we expect our HCV products to generate significant revenues and cash flows in the future. We will continue to focus on helping HCV patients get diagnosed and into treater care. In addition, we will continue to invest strategically and selectively in educational programs that raise awareness and access to our medications.We will continue to focus on ensuring patient access to our products around the world. Our progress on all of these initiatives is subject to a number of uncertainties, including, but not limited to, the continuation of an uncertain global macroeconomic environment; additional pricing pressures from payers and competitors; slower than anticipated growth in our HIV franchise; an increase in discounts, chargebacks and rebates due to ongoing contracts and future negotiations with commercial and government payers; market share and price erosion caused by the introduction of generic versions of Truvada outside the United States and Viread later in 2017; inaccuracies in our HCV patient start estimates; potential amendments to the Affordable Care Act or other government action that could have the effect of lowering prices; a larger than anticipated shift in payer mix to more highly discounted payer segment; and volatility in foreign currency exchange rates.482016 Results of OperationsTotal Revenues The following table summarizes the period over period changes in our product sales and royalty, contract and other revenues:(In millions, except percentages) 2016 Change 2015 Change 2014Revenues: Product sales $29,953 (7)% $32,151 31% $24,474Royalty, contract and other revenues 437 (10)% 488 17% 416Total revenues $30,390 (7)% $32,639 31% $24,890Product Sales2016 Compared to 2015Total product sales were $30.0 billion in 2016, compared to $32.2 billion in 2015, primarily due to a decrease in antiviral product sales. Antiviral product sales, which include sales of our HIV and other antiviral products and our HCV products, were $27.7 billion in 2016, compared to $30.2 billion in 2015. HIV and other antiviral product sales were $12.9 billion in 2016, compared to $11.1 billion in 2015. The increase was primarily driven by the continued uptake of our TAF-based products, Genvoya, Descovy and Odefsey, partially offset by decreases in sales of tenofovir disoproxil (TDF)-based products. HCV product sales, which consist of Harvoni, Sovaldi and Epclusa, were $14.8 billion in 2016, compared to $19.1 billion in 2015. The declines were due to lower sales of Harvoni and Sovaldi, partially offset by sales of Epclusa, which was launched in 2016 across various locations.Other product sales, which include sales of Letairis, Ranexa and AmBisome, were $2.2 billion in 2016, an increase of 14% compared to $1.9 billion in 2015.Of our product sales in 2016, 36% were generated outside the United States. We faced exposure to movements in foreign currency exchange rates, primarily in the Euro and Yen. We used foreign currency exchange contracts to hedge a percentage of our foreign currency exposure. Foreign currency exchange, net of hedges, had an unfavorable impact of $498 million on our 2016 product sales compared to 2015. We record product sales net of estimated mandatory and supplemental discounts to government payers, in addition to discounts to private payers, including rebates, chargebacks, cash discounts for prompt payment, distributor fees and other related costs. These deductions are generally referred to as gross-to-net deductions and totaled $20.3 billion or 40% of gross product sales in 2016, compared to $18.1 billion or 36% in 2015. Of the $20.3 billion in 2016, $19.1 billion or 38% of gross product sales was related to government and other rebates and chargebacks, and $1.2 billion was related to cash discounts for prompt payment, distributor fees and other related costs. The increase in our 2016 gross-to-net deductions was primarily due to an increase in discounts and a higher percentage of sales to more deeply discounted segments for our HCV products in the United States.Product sales in the United States decreased by 9% to $19.3 billion in 2016, compared to $21.2 billion in 2015. Declines in sales of our HCV products were partially offset by increases in sales of our HIV and other antiviral products. The increases in the sales of our HIV and other antiviral products were primarily driven by sales of our newly launched TAF-based products and a favorable revision to our rebate reserves of $332 million, primarily related to our TDF-based products. Product sales in Europe decreased by 15% to $6.1 billion in 2016, compared to $7.2 billion in 2015, primarily due to lower Harvoni and Sovaldi sales volume. Foreign currency exchange, net of hedges, had an unfavorable impact of $503 million on our product sales in 2016 compared to 2015.Product sales in Japan, which consist of Sovaldi and Harvoni, increased by 31% to $2.5 billion in 2016, compared to $1.9 billion in 2015. The increase was primarily driven by higher sales volume of Harvoni, which was launched in September 2015, partially offset by a mandatory price reduction of 32% for Sovaldi and Harvoni that was effective April 1, 2016.Product sales in other international locations increased by 10% to $2.1 billion in 2016, compared to $1.9 billion in 2015, primarily driven by continued launches of our HCV and TAF-based products across various locations. 2015 Compared to 2014Total product sales were $32.2 billion in 2015, compared to $24.5 billion in 2014, primarily driven by an increase in antiviral product sales. 49Antiviral product sales were $30.2 billion in 2015, compared to $22.8 billion in 2014. The increase was primarily driven by the launch of Harvoni across various geographies, partially offset by a decline in Sovaldi sales with patients being prescribed Harvoni instead of Sovaldi. HIV products also contributed to the sales increases primarily due to increased sales of our newer HIV single-tablet regimens, Stribild, Complera/Eviplera and Genvoya, partially offset by declines in Atripla sales volumes. Other product sales, which include sales of Letairis, Ranexa, AmBisome and Zydelig, were $1.9 billion in 2015, an increase of 16% compared to $1.7 billion in 2014.Of our product sales in 2015, 34% were generated outside the United States. Foreign currency exchange, net of hedges, had an unfavorable impact of $737 million on our 2015 product sales compared to 2014. Our gross-to-net deductions totaled $18.1 billion or 36% in 2015, compared to $7.3 billion or 23% in 2014. Of the $18.1 billion in 2015, $16.4 billion or 33% of gross product sales was related to government and other rebates and chargebacks, and $1.7 billion was related to cash discounts for prompt payment, distributor fees and other related costs. Our 2015 gross-to-net deductions attributable to our HCV product sales exceeded our overall gross-to-net of 36% in order to obtain formulary status or expand access for patients.Product sales in the United States increased by 17% to $21.2 billion in 2015, compared to $18.1 billion in 2014, primarily due to sales of Harvoni and increases in sales of Stribild, Truvada and Complera, partially offset by declines in sales of Sovaldi.Product sales in Europe increased by 39% to $7.2 billion in 2015, compared to $5.1 billion in 2014, primarily due to sales of Harvoni. Foreign currency exchange, net of hedges, had an unfavorable impact of $611 million on our product sales in 2015 compared to 2014.Product sales in other international locations increased to $3.8 billion in 2015 compared to $1.2 billion in 2014, primarily due to the launch in Japan of Sovaldi in May 2015 and Harvoni in September 2015. The following table summarizes the period over period changes in our product sales:(In millions, except percentages) 2016 Change 2015 Change 2014Antiviral products: HCV products Harvoni $9,081 (34)% $13,864 * $2,127Sovaldi 4,001 (24)% 5,276 (49)% 10,283Epclusa 1,752 * — * —HIV and other antiviral products Truvada 3,566 3 % 3,459 4 % 3,340Atripla 2,605 (17)% 3,134 (10)% 3,470Stribild 1,914 5 % 1,825 52 % 1,197Genvoya 1,484 * 45 * —Complera/Eviplera 1,457 2 % 1,427 16 % 1,228Viread 1,186 7 % 1,108 5 % 1,058Odefsey 329 * — * —Descovy 298 * — * —Other antiviral 72 4 % 69 (22)% 88Total antiviral products 27,745 (8)% 30,207 33 % 22,791Other products: Letairis 819 17 % 700 18 % 595Ranexa 677 15 % 588 15 % 510AmBisome 356 2 % 350 (10)% 388Zydelig 168 27 % 132 * 23Other 188 8 % 174 4 % 167Total product sales $29,953 (7)% $32,151 31 % $24,474_______________________ * Percentage not meaningful50The following is additional discussion of our results by product: •HarvoniHarvoni was approved by FDA in October 2014, by the European Commission in November 2014 and by the Japanese MHLW in July 2015.Harvoni sales accounted for 33%, 46% and 9% of our total antiviral product sales for 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively. In 2016, product sales were $4.9 billion in the United States, $1.8 billion in Europe, $1.8 billion in Japan and $491 million in other international locations. In 2015, product sales were $10.1 billion in the United States, $2.2 billion in Europe, $1.0 billion in Japan and $545 million in other international locations. In 2014, product sales were $2.0 billion in the United States and $103 million in Europe.In the United States, the decrease in 2016 compared to 2015 was primarily due to lower sales volume and a lower average net selling price, which was partially offset by a favorable revision to our sales return reserve of $181 million recorded during the second quarter of 2016. The number of patients that started treatment with Harvoni in the United States peaked in the first half of 2015, as many warehoused patients initiated treatment after the product launch. In Europe, the decrease in 2016 compared to 2015 was primarily due to lower sales volume and unfavorable foreign currency exchange, net of hedges. In Japan, the increase in 2016 compared to 2015 was driven by higher sales volume, partially offset by a mandatory price reduction of 32% that was effective April 1, 2016. In other international locations, the decrease in 2016 compared to 2015 was primarily due to a lower average net selling price, partially offset by the continued launches of Harvoni across various locations.The increase in product sales in 2015 compared to 2014 was primarily due to the launch of Harvoni in the United States, Europe and Japan. •SovaldiSovaldi was approved by FDA in December 2013, by the European Commission in January 2014 and by the Japanese MHLW in March 2015.Sovaldi sales accounted for 14%, 17% and 45% of our total antiviral product sales for 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively. In 2016, product sales were $1.9 billion in the United States, $891 million in Europe, $635 million in Japan and $580 million in other international locations. In 2015, product sales were $2.4 billion in the United States, $1.6 billion in Europe, $878 million in Japan and $409 million in other international locations. In 2014, product sales were $8.5 billion in the United States, $1.5 billion in Europe and $230 million in other international locations.In the United States, the decrease in 2016 compared to 2015 was primarily due to lower sales volume, partially offset by a favorable revision to our sales return reserve of $98 million recorded during the second quarter of 2016. In Europe, the decrease in 2016 compared to 2015 was primarily due to lower sales volume. In Japan, the decrease in 2016 compared to 2015 was primarily due to a mandatory price reduction of 32% that was effective April 1, 2016 and lower sales volume. In other international locations, the increase in 2016 compared to 2015 was primarily driven by higher sales volume. The decrease in product sales in 2015 compared to 2014 was primarily due to volume declines in the United States with patients being prescribed Harvoni instead of Sovaldi, partially offset by volume increases in Japan and Europe due to the launch of Sovaldi.•EpclusaEpclusa was launched in the United States and Europe in June and July 2016, respectively, and accounted for 6% of our total antiviral product sales. In 2016, product sales were $1.8 billion, primarily driven by sales in the United States of $1.6 billion.•Truvada Truvada sales accounted for 13%, 11% and 15% of our total antiviral product sales for 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively. In 2016, product sales were $2.4 billion in the United States, $913 million in Europe and $269 million in other international locations. In 2015, product sales were $2.1 billion in the United States, $1.1 billion in Europe and $284 million in other international locations. In 2014, product sales were $1.8 billion in the United States, $1.3 billion in Europe and $278 million in other international locations.Truvada sales increased by 3% to $3.6 billion in 2016, compared to $3.5 billion in 2015, primarily due to a higher average net selling price and higher sales volume in the United States, as a result of the increased usage of Truvada for PrEP. Truvada sales increased by 4% in 2015, compared to $3.3 billion in 2014, primarily due to sales volume growth and an increase in the average net selling price in the United States. 51•Atripla Atripla sales accounted for 9%, 10% and 15% of our total antiviral product sales for 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively. In 2016, product sales were $1.9 billion in the United States, $520 million in Europe and $187 million in other international locations. In 2015, product sales were $2.2 billion in the United States, $694 million in Europe and $218 million in other international locations. In 2014, product sales were $2.4 billion in the United States, $888 million in Europe and $225 million in other international locations.Atripla sales decreased by 17% to $2.6 billion in 2016, compared to $3.1 billion in 2015 and by 10% in 2015, compared to $3.5 billion in 2014, primarily due to declines in sales volume as doctors prescribed newer regimens, including TDF- and TAF-based regimens. The efavirenz component of Atripla, which has a gross margin of zero, comprised $966 million, $1.2 billion and $1.3 billion of our Atripla sales in 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively. A generic version of Bristol-Myers Squibb Company’s Sustiva (efavirenz) was made available in Canada and Europe in 2013 and will be made available in the United States in 2017. While we have observed some pricing pressure related to the efavirenz component of our Atripla sales, we have not yet observed any meaningful splitting of the Atripla single-tablet regimen.•StribildStribild sales accounted for 7%, 6% and 5% of our total antiviral product sales for 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively. In 2016, product sales were $1.5 billion in the United States and $314 million in Europe. In 2015, product sales were $1.5 billion in the United States and $282 million in Europe. In 2014, product sales were $1.0 billion in the United States and $145 million in Europe. Stribild sales increased by 5% to $1.9 billion in 2016, compared to $1.8 billion in 2015, primarily due to a favorable revision to our rebate reserves of $223 million during the third quarter of 2016, partially offset by lower sales volume as a result of the continued launch of our new TAF-based product, Genvoya. Stribild sales increased by 52% in 2015, compared to $1.2 billion in 2014, primarily due to higher sales volume in the United States and Europe.•TAF-based regimens - Genvoya, Descovy and OdefseyGenvoya was launched in the United States and Europe in November 2015. Descovy was launched in the United States and Europe in April 2016. Odefsey was launched in the United States in March 2016 and launched in Europe in July 2016. Our newly launched TAF-based regimens accounted for 8% of our total antiviral product sales for 2016. In 2016, product sales of our TAF-based regimens were $2.1 billion, primarily driven by sales in the United States of $1.8 billion. •Complera/EvipleraComplera/Eviplera sales accounted for 5% of our total antiviral product sales for 2016, 2015 and 2014. In 2016, product sales were $821 million in the United States and $580 million in Europe. In 2015, product sales were $796 million in the United States and $576 million in Europe. In 2014, product sales were $663 million in the United States and $513 million in Europe.Complera/Eviplera sales increased by 2% to $1.5 billion in 2016, compared to $1.4 billion in 2015, primarily due to a favorable revision to our rebate reserves of $89 million during the third quarter of 2016. Complera/Eviplera increased by 16% in 2015, compared to $1.2 billion in 2014, driven primarily by higher sales volume in the United States and Europe. Royalty, Contract and Other Revenues The following table summarizes the period over period changes in our royalty, contract and other revenues: (In millions, except percentages) 2016 Change 2015 Change 2014Royalty, contract and other revenues $437 (10)% $488 17% $416Royalty, contract and other revenues declined by 10% to $437 million in 2016, compared to $488 million in 2015 and increased by 17% in 2015, compared to $416 million in 2014. The changes were primarily due to royalty revenues from F. Hoffman-La Roche Ltd for sales of Tamiflu. The majority of our royalties are recognized in the quarter following the quarter in which the corresponding product sales occur.52Cost of Goods Sold and Product Gross MarginThe following table summarizes the period over period changes in our product sales, cost of goods sold and product gross margin: (In millions, except percentages) 2016 Change 2015 Change 2014Total product sales $29,953 (7)% $32,151 31% $24,474Cost of goods sold $4,261 6 % $4,006 6% $3,788Product gross margin 86% 88% 85%Our product gross margin for 2016 decreased compared to 2015 primarily due to changes in product mix, as our HCV product sales decreased as a percentage of total product sales. Our product gross margin for 2015 increased compared to 2014 primarily due to changes in product mix, as Atripla sales, which include the efavirenz component at a gross margin of zero, declined and HCV product sales increased as a percentage of total product sales. Research and Development Expenses The following table summarizes the period over period changes in R&D expenses:(In millions, except percentages) 2016 Change 2015 Change 2014R&D expenses $5,098 69% $3,014 6% $2,854R&D expenses summarized above consisted primarily of clinical studies performed by contract research organizations, materials and supplies, licenses and fees, up-front payments under collaboration agreements, milestone payments, personnel costs, including salaries, benefits and stock-based compensation and overhead allocations consisting of various support and facilities-related costs. We do not track total R&D expenses by product candidate, therapeutic area or development phase. However, we manage our R&D expenses by identifying the R&D activities we anticipate will be performed during a given period and then prioritizing efforts based on scientific data, probability of successful development, market potential, available human and capital resources and other considerations. We continually review our R&D pipeline and the status of development and, as necessary, reallocate resources among the R&D portfolio that we believe will best support the future growth of our business.The following table provides a breakout of R&D expenses by major cost type: (In millions, except percentages) 2016 2015 2014Clinical studies and outside services $3,219 $1,634 $1,688Personnel and infrastructure expenses 1,122 1,041 900Facilities, IT and other costs 325 339 266IPR&D impairment charges 432 — —Total $5,098 $3,014 $2,854In 2016, R&D expenses increased $2.1 billion or 69%, compared to 2015, primarily due to increases in clinical studies and outside services expenses of $1.6 billion. The increases in clinical studies and outside services were primarily due to the overall progression of clinical studies, including ongoing milestone payments, our purchase of an FDA priority review voucher, up-front collaboration expenses related to our license and collaboration agreement with Galapagos and our purchase of Nimbus. IPR&D impairment charges were a result of termination of clinical developments for momelotinib and simtuzumab.In 2015, R&D expenses increased $160 million or 6%, compared to 2014, primarily due to increases in personnel and infrastructure expenses of $141 million and facilities, IT and other costs of $73 million to support our ongoing clinical study activity and geographic expansion. In 2014, clinical studies and outside services included expenses of $350 million for collaboration and acquisition related expenses and the purchase of an FDA priority review voucher.Selling, General and Administrative Expenses The following table summarizes the period over period changes in SG&A expenses:(In millions, except percentages) 2016 Change 2015 Change 2014SG&A expenses $3,398 (1)% $3,426 15% $2,98353SG&A expenses relate to sales and marketing, finance, human resources, legal and other administrative activities. Expenses are primarily comprised of facilities and overhead costs, outside marketing, advertising and legal expenses, and other general and administrative costs. SG&A expenses also include the BPD fee. In the United States, we, along with other pharmaceutical manufacturers of branded drug products, are required to pay a portion of an industry fee (the BPD fee), which is estimated based on select government sales during each calendar year as a percentage of total industry government sales and is trued-up upon receipt of invoices from the Internal Revenue Service (IRS). The amount of the annual BPD fee imposed on the pharmaceutical industry as a whole was $3.0 billion in 2016 and will increase to $4.0 billion in 2017.In 2016, SG&A expenses were flat compared to 2015. Declines in our BPD fee were offset by higher costs to support new product launches and our geographic expansion. The 2016 BPD fee was favorably impacted by a credit of $191 million based on receipt of the IRS invoice. In 2015, SG&A expenses increased $443 million or 15% compared to 2014, primarily due to an increase of $627 million in headcount-related, marketing and other expenses to support the growth and geographic expansion of our business, partially offset by a decrease in BPD fee of $100 million based on receipt of the IRS invoice.Our BPD fee expenses were $270 million in 2016, $414 million in 2015 and $590 million in 2014. The BPD fee is not tax deductible. Interest ExpenseIn 2016, interest expense increased to $964 million, compared to $688 million in 2015, primarily due to the issuance of $5.0 billion aggregate principal amount of the 2016 Notes and $10.0 billion aggregate principal amount of senior unsecured notes (the 2015 Notes). In 2015, interest expense increased to $688 million, compared to $412 million in 2014, primarily due to the issuance of the 2015 Notes and the issuance of $8.0 billion aggregate principal amount of senior unsecured notes in 2014. Other Income (Expense), Net Other income (expense), net was $428 million, $154 million and $3 million in 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively, primarily due to our cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities earning a higher yield.Provision for Income Taxes Our provision for income taxes was $3.6 billion, $3.6 billion and $2.8 billion in 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively. The effective tax rate of 21.1%, 16.4% and 18.8% for 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively, differed from the U.S. federal statutory rate of 35% primarily due to earnings from non-U.S. subsidiaries that operate in jurisdictions with lower tax rates than the United States and where the earnings are considered indefinitely reinvested. Liquidity and Capital Resources We believe that our existing capital resources, supplemented by our cash flows generated from operating activities will be adequate to satisfy our capital needs for the foreseeable future. The following table summarizes our cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities and working capital (in millions): December 31, 2016 2015 2014Cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities $32,380 $26,208 $11,726Working capital $11,226 $14,872 $11,953Cash, Cash Equivalents and Marketable Securities Cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities totaled $32.4 billion at December 31, 2016, an increase of $6.2 billion or 24% when compared to $26.2 billion at December 31, 2015. During 2016, we generated $16.7 billion in operating cash flow, received $4.9 billion in net proceeds from the 2016 Notes, utilized $11.0 billion to repurchase stock, repaid $985 million principal balance of our senior notes and convertible senior notes and paid cash dividends of $2.5 billion. Cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities totaled $26.2 billion at December 31, 2015, an increase of $14.5 billion or 124% when compared to $11.7 billion at December 31, 2014. During 2015, we generated $20.3 billion in operating cash flow, received $9.9 billion in net proceeds from our issuance of senior unsecured notes, utilized $10.0 billion to repurchase stock, utilized $3.9 billion to settle 46 million warrants related to the convertible senior notes due in May 2016 (the Convertible Notes) and paid cash dividends of $1.9 billion.54Of the total cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities at December 31, 2016, approximately $27.4 billion was generated from operations in foreign jurisdictions and is intended for use in our foreign operations. We do not rely on unrepatriated earnings as a source of funds for our domestic business as we expect to have sufficient cash flow and borrowing capacity in the United States to fund our domestic operational and strategic needs. Working Capital Working capital was $11.2 billion at December 31, 2016. The decrease of $3.6 billion from working capital as of December 31, 2015 was primarily due to a decline in cash and cash equivalents, as a result of an increase in our long-term marketable securities.Working capital was $14.9 billion at December 31, 2015. The increase of $2.9 billion from working capital as of December 31, 2014 was driven primarily by the increase in cash, cash equivalents and short-term marketable securities and an increase in accounts receivable, partially offset by increases in accrued government and other rebates.Cash FlowsThe following table summarizes our cash flow activities (in millions): 2016 2015 2014Cash provided by (used in): Operating activities $16,669 $20,329 $12,818Investing activities $(11,985) $(12,475) $(1,823)Financing activities $(9,347) $(4,963) $(3,025)Cash Provided by Operating Activities Cash provided by operating activities represents the cash receipts and disbursements related to all of our activities other than investing and financing activities. Operating cash flow is derived by adjusting our net income for non-cash items and changes in operating assets and liabilities. Cash provided by operating activities decreased by $3.7 billion to $16.7 billion in 2016 when compared to 2015, primarily due to lower cash receipts as a result of lower product sales and higher cash payments related to accrued government and other rebates and chargebacks. Cash flows from operations may decrease in the future as our HCV product sales are expected to decline.Cash provided by operating activities increased by $7.5 billion to $20.3 billion in 2015 when compared to 2014, primarily due to higher cash receipts as a result of higher product sales. Cash Used in Investing Activities Cash used in investing activities primarily consists of net purchases of marketable securities and other investments and our capital expenditures. Cash used in investing activities decreased by $490 million to $12.0 billion in 2016 when compared to 2015, primarily due to lower net purchases of marketable securities, partially offset by other investments related to our license and collaboration agreement with Galapagos. Cash used in investing activities increased by $10.7 billion to $12.5 billion in 2015 when compared to 2014, primarily due to higher net purchases of marketable securities.Cash Used in Financing Activities Cash used in financing activities increased by $4.4 billion to $9.3 billion in 2016 when compared to 2015, primarily due to higher repurchases of our common stock, higher net payments on debt, higher payments of cash dividends and lower proceeds from the issuances of debt. These increases were partially offset by lower payments to settle warrants related to the Convertible Notes. Cash used in financing activities increased by $1.9 billion to $5.0 billion in 2015 when compared to 2014, primarily due to higher repurchases of our common stock and payments of cash dividends, which began in 2015. These increases were partially offset by lower net payments on debt and higher proceeds from the issuances of debt. Debt and Credit Facility Long-Term ObligationsThe summary of our borrowings under various financing arrangements is included in Note 11, Debt and Credit Facility of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.55Debt FinancingIn September 2016, we issued our 2016 Notes in the aggregate principal amount of $5.0 billion and in December 2016, repaid $700 million of principal balance related to our senior unsecured notes. In September 2015, we issued our 2015 Notes in the aggregate principal amount of $10.0 billion. We intend to use the net proceeds from the 2016 Notes and 2015 Notes for general corporate purposes, which may include the repayment of debt, working capital, payments of cash dividends, repurchases of our outstanding common stock pursuant to our authorized share repurchase program and future acquisitions. We are required to comply with certain covenants under our notes indentures and as of December 31, 2016, we were not in violation of any covenants.Convertible Notes Repayment and Warrant SettlementsOur Convertible Notes were partially converted during 2016 and 2015 and on May 1, 2016, the remainder matured. We repaid an aggregate principal balance of $285 million and $213 million during 2016 and 2015, respectively. We also paid in cash $956 million and $784 million during 2016 and 2015, respectively, related to the conversion spread of the Convertible Notes. We received $956 million and $784 million in cash during 2016 and 2015, respectively, from our convertible note hedges related to the Convertible Notes. During 2015, a portion of the warrants related to the Convertible Notes was modified and settled, and in August 2016, the remainder expired. We paid $469 million and $3.9 billion during 2016 and 2015, respectively, to settle the warrants as the average market price of our common stock exceeded the warrants’ exercise price. Credit FacilityIn 2016, we terminated our existing revolving credit facility and entered into a new $2.5 billion, five-year revolving credit facility maturing in May 2021. The facility can be used for working capital requirements and for general corporate purposes, including, without limitation, acquisitions. We are required to comply with certain covenants under the credit agreement and as of December 31, 2016, we were not in violation of any covenants, and no amounts were outstanding under the revolving credit facility.Capital Return ProgramStock Repurchase ProgramsIn February 2016, our Board of Directors authorized a $12.0 billion stock repurchase program (2016 Program). Purchases under the 2016 Program may be made in the open market or in privately negotiated transactions. The 2016 Program commenced after the $15.0 billion stock repurchase program authorized by our Board of Directors in January 2015 was completed in the second quarter of 2016. The $5.0 billion stock repurchase program authorized by our Board of Directors in May 2014 was completed in the first quarter of 2015. The $5.0 billion repurchase program authorized by our Board of Directors in January 2011 was completed in 2014. As of December 31, 2016, the remaining authorized repurchase amount under the 2016 Program was $9 billion. The following table summarizes our stock repurchases under the above-described programs (in millions): 2016 2015 2014Shares repurchased and retired 123 95 59Amount $11,001 $10,002 $5,349DividendsOn February 7, 2017, we announced that our Board of Directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.52 per share of our common stock, with a payment date of March 30, 2017 to all stockholders of record as of the close of business on March 16, 2017. In April 2016, we announced that our Board of Directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.47 per common share, which became effective for the second quarter of 2016. During 2016, we declared and paid quarterly cash dividends for an aggregate amount of $2.5 billion or $1.84 per common share. In the second quarter of 2015, we initiated a cash dividend of $0.43 per common share. During 2015, we declared and paid quarterly cash dividends for an aggregate amount of $1.9 billion or $1.29 per share.Capital ResourcesWe believe our existing capital resources, supplemented by cash flows generated from our operations, will be adequate to satisfy our capital needs for the foreseeable future. Our future capital requirements will depend on many factors, including but not limited to the following: •the commercial performance of our current and future products; 56•the progress and scope of our R&D efforts, including preclinical studies and clinical trials; •the cost, timing and outcome of regulatory reviews; •the expansion of our sales and marketing capabilities; •the possibility of acquiring additional manufacturing capabilities or office facilities; •the possibility of acquiring other companies or new products;•debt service requirements;•the establishment of additional collaborative relationships with other companies; and •costs associated with the defense, settlement and adverse results of government investigations and litigation, including matters related to sofosbuvir. We may in the future require additional funding, which could be in the form of proceeds from equity or debt financings. If such funding is required, we cannot guarantee that it will be available to us on favorable terms, if at all. Critical Accounting Policies, Estimates and Judgments The discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based on our Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, which have been prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses and related disclosures. On an ongoing basis, we evaluate and base our estimates on historical experience and on various other market specific and other relevant assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ significantly from these estimates. We believe the following critical accounting policies reflect the more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our Consolidated Financial Statements. Revenue Recognition Product Sales We recognize revenues from product sales when there is persuasive evidence that an arrangement exists, delivery has occurred, the price is fixed or determinable and collectability is reasonably assured. We record product sales net of estimated mandatory and supplemental discounts to government payers, in addition to discounts to private payers, and other related charges. These are generally referred to as gross-to-net deductions and are recorded in the same period the related sales occur. Government and other rebates and chargebacks represent the majority of our gross-to-net deductions and require complex and significant judgment by management. Estimates are assessed each period and updated to reflect current information.Government and Other Rebates and ChargebacksGovernment and other rebates and chargebacks include amounts paid to payers and healthcare providers in the United States, including Medicaid rebates, AIDS Drug Assistance Programs, Veterans Administration and Public Health Service discounts, and other rebates, as well as foreign government rebates. Rebates and chargebacks are based on contractual arrangements or statutory requirements which may vary by product, by payer and individual payer plans. For qualified programs that can purchase our products through wholesalers or other distributors at a lower contractual price, the wholesalers or distributors charge back to us the difference between their acquisition cost and the lower contractual price. Our consolidated allowances for government and other chargebacks that are payable to our direct customers are classified as reductions of accounts receivable, and totaled $636 million as of December 31, 2016 and $907 million as of December 31, 2015. Our consolidated allowance for government and other rebates that will be paid to parties other than our direct customers are recorded in Accrued government and other rebates on our Consolidated Balance Sheets, and totaled $5.0 billion as of December 31, 2016 and $4.1 billion as of December 31, 2015. Our allowances for government and other rebates and chargebacks are estimated based on products sold, historical utilization rates, pertinent third-party industry information, estimated patient population, known market events or trends, channel inventory data and/or other market data. We also consider new information regarding changes in programs’ regulations and guidelines that would impact the amount of the actual rebates and/or our expectations regarding future utilization rates for these programs. We believe that the methodology that we use to estimate our government and other rebates and chargebacks is reasonable and appropriate given the current facts and circumstances. However, actual results may differ significantly from our estimates. During the last 57three years, our actual government rebates and chargebacks claimed for prior periods have varied by less than 5% from our estimates.The following table summarizes the consolidated activities and ending balances in our government and other rebates and chargebacks accounts (in millions):Accrued government and other rebates and chargebacks: Balance at Beginning of Year Decrease/(Increase) to Product Sales Payments Balance at End of YearYear ended December 31, 2016: Activity related to 2016 sales $— $19,219 $(13,920) $5,299Activity related to sales prior to 2016 5,025 (148) (4,519) 358Total $5,025 $19,071 $(18,439) $5,657Year ended December 31, 2015: Activity related to 2015 sales $— $16,400 $(11,597) $4,803Activity related to sales prior to 2015 2,536 7 (2,321) 222Total $2,536 $16,407 $(13,918) $5,025The majority of the increase in allowance for government and other rebates and chargebacks in 2016 compared to 2015 was driven by higher rebates and chargebacks for our HCV products.Legal ContingenciesWe are a party to various legal actions. The most significant of these are described in Note 12, Commitments and Contingencies - Legal Proceedings of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. It is not possible to determine the outcome of these matters. We recognize accruals for such actions to the extent that we conclude that a loss is both probable and reasonably estimable. We accrue for the best estimate of a loss within a range; however, if no estimate in the range is better than any other, then we accrue the minimum amount in the range. If we determine that a loss is reasonably possible and the loss or range of loss can be estimated, we disclose the possible loss. Significant judgment is required in both the determination of probability and the determination as to whether an exposure is reasonably estimable. Because of the inherent uncertainty and unpredictability related to these matters, accruals are based on what we believe to be the best information available at the time of our assessment, including the legal facts and circumstances of the case, status of the proceedings, applicable law and the views of legal counsel. Upon the final resolution of such matters, it is possible that there may be a loss in excess of the amount recorded, and such amounts could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, cash flows or financial position. We periodically reassess these matters when additional information becomes available and adjust our estimates and assumptions when facts and circumstances indicate the need for any changes. We did not recognize any accruals for such matters as of December 31, 2016 and 2015 as we did not believe losses were probable.Valuation of Intangible AssetsIn conjunction with our business combinations, we have recorded intangible assets primarily related to IPR&D projects. We had total intangible assets of $9.0 billion as of December 31, 2016 and $10.2 billion as of December 31, 2015. The identifiable intangible assets are measured at their respective fair values as of the acquisition date. The models used in valuing these intangible assets require the use of significant estimates and assumptions including but not limited to:•estimates of revenues and operating profits related to the products or product candidates;•the probability of success for unapproved product candidates considering their stages of development;•the time and resources needed to complete the development and approval of product candidates;•the life of the potential commercialized products and associated risks, including the inherent difficulties and uncertainties in developing a product candidate such as obtaining FDA and other regulatory approvals; and•risks related to the viability of and potential alternative treatments in any future target markets.We believe the fair values used to record intangible assets acquired in connection with a business combination are based upon reasonable estimates and assumptions given the facts and circumstances as of the related valuation dates. 58Intangible assets related to IPR&D projects are considered to be indefinite-lived until the completion or abandonment of the associated R&D efforts. If and when development is complete, which generally occurs if and when regulatory approval to market a product is obtained, the associated assets would be deemed finite-lived and would then be amortized based on their respective estimated useful lives at that point in time. During the period the assets are considered indefinite-lived, they are not amortized but are tested for impairment on an annual basis as well as between annual tests if we become aware of any events or changes that would indicate that it is more likely than not that the fair value of the IPR&D projects below their respective carrying amounts. The fair value of our indefinite-lived intangible assets is dependent on assumptions such as the expected timing or probability of achieving the specified milestones, changes in projected revenues or changes in discount rates. Significant judgment is employed in determining these assumptions and changes to our assumptions could have a significant impact on our results of operations in any given period. In 2016, the estimated fair value of our IPR&D related to momelotinib and simtuzumab was written down to zero due to termination of clinical developments of such programs, and as a result, we recorded impairment charges of $432 million within Research and development expenses on our Consolidated Statements of Income included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Intangible assets with finite useful lives are amortized over their estimated useful lives primarily on a straight-line basis. Intangible assets with finite useful lives are reviewed for impairment when facts or circumstances suggest that the carrying value of these assets may not be recoverable.Tax Provision We estimate our income tax provision, including deferred tax assets and liabilities, based on significant management judgment. We evaluate the realization of all or a portion of our deferred tax assets on a quarterly basis. We record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets to the amounts that are more likely than not to be realized. We consider future taxable income, ongoing tax planning strategies and our historical financial performance in assessing the need for a valuation allowance. If we expect to realize deferred tax assets for which we have previously recorded a valuation allowance, we will reduce the valuation allowance in the period in which such determination is first made. The valuation allowance was $126 million as of December 31, 2016 and $6 million as of December 31, 2015. The increase of our valuation allowance from December 31, 2015 to December 31, 2016 was primarily due to write down of the IPR&D value of momelotinib during 2016. We are subject to income taxes in the United States and various foreign jurisdictions including Ireland. Due to economic and political conditions, various countries are actively considering changes to existing tax laws. We cannot predict the form or timing of potential legislative changes that could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations. In addition, significant judgment is required in determining our worldwide provision for income taxes.We record liabilities related to uncertain tax positions in accordance with the guidance that clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in an enterprise’s financial statements by prescribing a minimum recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. An adverse resolution of one or more of these uncertain tax positions in any period could have a material impact on the results of operations for that period. At December 31, 2016 and 2015, we had total federal, state and foreign unrecognized tax benefits of $1.9 billion and $1.4 billion, respectively. Of the total unrecognized tax benefits, $1.8 billion and $1.3 billion at December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively, if recognized, would reduce our effective tax rate in the period of recognition. As of December 31, 2016, we do not believe our unrecognized tax benefits will significantly change in the next 12 months. Due to the high degree of uncertainly on the timing of clarification from the IRS and other tax authorities regarding our uncertain tax positions, we are unable to reasonably estimate the period of cash settlement, if any, with the respective tax authorities. We file federal, state and foreign income tax returns in the United States and in many jurisdictions abroad. For federal income tax purposes, the statute of limitations is open for 2010 and onwards. For certain acquired entities, the statute of limitations is open for all years from inception due to our utilization of their net operating losses and credits carried over from prior years. For California income tax purposes, the statute of limitations is open for 2010 and onwards. Our income tax returns are subject to audit by federal, state and foreign tax authorities. We are currently under examination by the IRS for the 2010, 2011, 2012, 2013 and 2014 tax years and by various state and foreign jurisdictions. There are differing interpretations of tax laws and regulations, and as a result, significant disputes may arise with these tax authorities involving issues of the timing and amount of deductions and allocations of income among various tax jurisdictions. We periodically evaluate our exposures associated with our tax filing positions. 59Off Balance Sheet ArrangementsWe do not have any off balance sheet arrangements as defined in Item 303(a)(4)(ii) of Regulation S-K.Contractual ObligationsOur contractual obligations consist of debt obligations, operating leases, capital commitments, purchase obligations for active pharmaceutical ingredients and inventory-related items and clinical trials contracts. The following table summarizes our significant enforceable and legally binding obligations, future commitments and obligations related to all contracts that we are likely to continue regardless of the fact that certain of these obligations may be cancelable as of December 31, 2016 (in millions): Payments due by PeriodContractual Obligations Total Less than oneyear 1-3 years 3-5 years More than 5yearsDebt (1) $42,874 $982 $3,769 $6,582 $31,541Operating lease obligations 369 75 120 72 102Capital commitments (2) 880 536 341 1 2Purchase obligations (3)(4) 2,124 1,551 505 44 24Clinical trials (5) 1,737 752 675 204 106Total (6) $47,984 $3,896 $5,410 $6,903 $31,775_______________________ Notes:(1) Debt primarily consisted of senior unsecured notes, including principal and interest payments. Interest payments are incurred and calculated based on terms of the related notes. See Note 11, Debt and Credit Facility of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information.(2) Amounts include firm capital project commitments primarily relating to construction of new buildings. (3) Amounts include firm purchase commitments primarily relating to active pharmaceutical ingredients and certain inventory-related items. These amounts include minimum purchase requirements. (4) In addition to the above, we have committed to make potential future milestone payments to third parties as part of licensing, collaboration and development arrangements. Payments under these agreements generally become due and payable only upon achievement of certain developmental, regulatory and/or commercial milestones. Because the achievement of these milestones is neither probable nor reasonably estimable, such contingencies have not been recorded on our Consolidated Balance Sheets and have not been included in the table above. (5) At December 31, 2016, we had several clinical studies in various clinical trial phases. Our most significant clinical trial expenditures are to contract research organizations (CROs). Although all of our material contracts with CROs are cancelable, we historically have not canceled such contracts. These amounts reflect commitments based on existing contracts and do not reflect any future modifications to, or terminations of, existing contracts or anticipated or potential new contracts.(6) As of December 31, 2016, our Consolidated Balance Sheets reflect liabilities for unrecognized tax positions, interest and penalties totaling $1.9 billion. Due to the high degree of uncertainty on the timing of future cash settlement and other events that could extinguish these liabilities, we are unable to estimate the period of cash settlement and therefore we have excluded the liabilities related to unrecognized tax positions from the table above. Recent Accounting PronouncementsThe information required by this item is included in Note 1, Organization and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.ITEM 7A.QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISKWe are exposed to market risks that may result from changes in foreign currency exchange rates, interest rates and credit risks. To reduce certain of these risks, we enter into various types of foreign currency or interest rate derivative hedging transactions, follow investment guidelines and monitor outstanding receivables as part of our risk management program.Foreign Currency Exchange Risk Our operations include manufacturing and sales activities in the United States, Canada and Ireland as well as sales activities in countries outside the United States, including Europe and Asia Pacific. As a result, our financial results could be significantly affected by factors such as changes in foreign currency exchange rates or weak economic conditions in the foreign markets in which we distribute our products. Our operating results are exposed to changes in foreign currency exchange rates between the U.S. dollar and various foreign currencies, the most significant of which are the Euro and Yen. When the U.S. dollar strengthens against these currencies, the relative value of sales made in the respective foreign currency decreases. Conversely, when the U.S. dollar weakens against these currencies, the relative amounts of such sales increase. Overall, we are a net receiver of foreign currencies and, therefore, benefit from a weaker U.S. dollar and are adversely affected by a stronger U.S. dollar relative to those foreign currencies in which we transact significant amounts of business. 60Approximately 36% of our product sales were denominated in foreign currencies during 2016. To partially mitigate the impact of changes in currency exchange rates on net cash flows from our foreign currency denominated sales, we may enter into foreign currency exchange forward and option contracts. We also hedge certain monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies, which reduces but does not eliminate our exposure to currency fluctuations between the date a transaction is recorded and the date that cash is collected or paid. In general, the market risks of these contracts are offset by corresponding gains and losses on the transactions being hedged. As of December 31, 2016 and 2015, we had open foreign currency forward contracts with notional amounts of $6.2 billion and $9.1 billion, respectively. A hypothetical 10% adverse movement in foreign currency exchange rates compared with the U.S. dollar relative to exchange rates at December 31, 2016 would have resulted in a reduction in fair value of these contracts of approximately $583 million on this date and, if realized, would negatively affect earnings over the remaining life of the contracts. The same hypothetical movement in foreign currency exchange rates compared with the U.S. dollar relative to exchange rates at December 31, 2015, would have resulted in a reduction in fair value of these contracts of approximately $893 million on this date and, if realized, would negatively affect earnings over the remaining life of the contracts. The analysis does not consider the impact that hypothetical changes in foreign currency exchange rates would have on anticipated transactions that these foreign currency sensitive instruments were designed to offset.Interest Rate Risk Our portfolio of available-for-sale marketable securities and our fixed and variable rate liabilities create an exposure to interest rate risk. With respect to our investment portfolio, we adhere to an investment policy that requires us to limit amounts invested in securities based on credit rating, maturity, industry group and investment type and issuer, except for securities issued by the U.S. government. The goals of our investment policy, in order of priority, are as follows: • safety and preservation of principal and diversification of risk; • liquidity of investments sufficient to meet cash flow requirements; and • competitive after-tax rate of return. The following table summarizes the expected maturities and average interest rates of our interest-generating assets and interest-bearing liabilities at December 31, 2016 (in millions, except percentages): Expected Maturity Total Fair Value 2017 2018 2019 2020 2021 Thereafter Total Assets Available-for-sale debt securities$3,914 $8,834 $9,018 $1,158 $747 $728 $24,399 $24,399Average interest rate1.21% 1.43% 1.69% 1.31% 1.53% 1.99% Liabilities Debt(1)$— $1,000 $812 $2,500 $2,250 $20,000 $26,562 $27,002Average interest rate—% 1.85% 2.05% 2.51% 4.44% 4.00% _______________________ Note:(1) As of December 31, 2016, our debt consisted primarily of fixed rate senior unsecured notes, which were reported at their amortized cost on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. Since these instruments bear interest at fixed rates, changes in interest rates do not affect interest expense or cash flows; however, the fair value of these instruments fluctuates when interest rates change. In addition to the senior unsecured notes, we have a $2.5 billion five-year revolving credit facility. Interest charged on loans under the revolving credit facility is based on floating rates which may fluctuate when interest rates change. There were no amounts outstanding under the revolving credit facility as of December 31, 2016. See Note 11, Debt and Credit Facility of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information.Credit RiskWe are subject to credit risk from our portfolio of cash equivalents and marketable securities. Under our investment policy, we limit amounts invested in such securities by credit rating, maturity, industry group, investment type and issuer, except for securities issued by the U.S. government. We are not exposed to any significant concentrations of credit risk from these financial instruments. The goals of our investment policy, in order of priority, are as follows: safety and preservation of principal and diversification of risk; liquidity of investments sufficient to meet cash flow requirements; and a competitive after-tax rate of return. We are also subject to credit risk from our accounts receivable related to our product sales. The majority of our trade accounts receivable arises from product sales in the United States and Europe. 61As of December 31, 2016, our accounts receivable, net in Southern Europe, specifically Greece, Italy, Portugal and Spain, totaled approximately $317 million, of which $110 million were greater than 120 days past due, including $45 million greater than 365 days past due. As of December 31, 2015, our accounts receivable, net in Southern Europe, specifically Greece, Italy, Portugal and Spain, totaled approximately $713 million, of which $213 million were greater than 120 days past due, including $31 million greater than 365 days past due.

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS The following Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (MD&A) is intended to help the reader understand our results of operations and financial condition. MD&A is provided as a supplement to, and should be read in conjunction with, our audited Consolidated Financial Statements and the accompanying Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements and other disclosures included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K (including the disclosures under Part I, Item 1A, “Risk Factors”). Our Consolidated Financial Statements have been prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles and are presented in U.S. dollars. Management OverviewGilead Sciences, Inc. (Gilead, we, our or us), incorporated in Delaware on June 22, 1987, is a research-based biopharmaceutical company that discovers, develops and commercializes innovative medicines in areas of unmet medical need. With each new discovery and investigational drug candidate, we strive to transform and simplify care for people with life-threatening illnesses around the world. We have operations in more than 35 countries worldwide, with headquarters in Foster City, California. Gilead’s primary areas of focus include HIV/AIDS, liver diseases, hematology/oncology and inflammation/respiratory diseases. We seek to add to our existing portfolio of products through our internal discovery and clinical development programs and through product acquisition and in-licensing strategies.Our portfolio of marketed products includes AmBisome®, Atripla®, Biktarvy®, Cayston®, Complera®/Eviplera®, Descovy®, Emtriva®, Epclusa®, Genvoya®, Harvoni®, Hepsera®, Letairis®, Odefsey®, Ranexa®, Sovaldi®, Stribild®, Truvada®, Tybost®, Vemlidy®, Viread®, Vosevi®, YescartaTM and Zydelig®. We have U.S. and international commercial sales operations, with marketing subsidiaries in over 35 countries. We also sell and distribute certain products through our corporate partners under royalty-paying collaborative agreements.2017 Business Highlights2017 was marked by operational excellence across our business, as we accomplished many key goals that position us for future growth. During 2017, we observed strong performance in our HIV and cardiovascular products. We continued to execute on and maximize the opportunity in HCV in a changing competitive landscape. In addition, we continued to advance our product pipeline across our therapeutic areas with the goal of delivering best-in-class drugs that advance the current standard of care and/or address unmet medical need. Recent key developments include:Key Announcements•FDA granted priority review for our new drug application (NDA) for Biktarvy, our fixed-dose combination of bictegravir (BIC), a novel investigational integrase strand transfer inhibitor, and emtricitabine/tenofovir alafenamide (TAF), for the treatment of HIV-1 infection. In addition, our marketing authorization application for Biktarvy has been fully validated and is now under evaluation by the European Medicines Agency (EMA). We received U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval for Biktarvy on February 7, 2018.•European Commission granted marketing authorization for Vemlidy, a once-daily tablet for the treatment of chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection in adults and adolescents (aged 12 years and older with body weight at least 35 kg). •European Commission and FDA approved Vosevi, a once-daily single tablet regimen for the treatment of HCV infection in adults with genotype 1-6. Vosevi is the first and only single tablet regimen for patients who have previously failed therapy with direct-acting antiviral (DAA) treatments and is the latest regimen in our portfolio of sofosbuvir-based HCV DAA treatments.•We announced a new licensing agreement with the Medicines Patent Pool (MPP), a United Nations-backed public health organization, to expand access to BIC. Through this agreement, MPP can sub-license rights to BIC to generic drug companies in India, China and South Africa to manufacture therapies containing BIC for distribution in certain low- and middle-income countries.•China Food and Drug Administration approved Sovaldi for the treatment of HCV infection. Sovaldi was approved for the treatment of adults and adolescents (aged 12 to 18 years) infected with HCV genotypes 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 or 6 as a component of a combination antiviral treatment regimen. Sovaldi is our first HCV medicine approved in China.•FDA approved expanded labeling for Epclusa, the first all-oral, pan-genotypic, once-daily single tablet regimen for the treatment of adults with HCV infection, to include use in patients co-infected with HIV.•European Commission extended marketing authorization for Harvoni to include the treatment of HCV infection in adolescents infected with genotype 1, 3, 4, 5 or 6. Harvoni is the first DAA regimen to receive marketing authorization in the European Union extended for use in the adolescent population.42•FDA approved supplemental indications for Harvoni and Sovaldi for the treatment of HCV infection in adolescents without cirrhosis or with compensated cirrhosis, 12 years of age and older, or weighing at least 35 kilograms. Harvoni was approved for pediatric patients with genotype 1, 4, 5 or 6 HCV infection. Sovaldi was approved for pediatric patients with genotype 2 or 3 HCV infection, in combination with ribavirin.Acquisitions•In October 2017, we completed a tender offer for all of the outstanding common stock of Kite Pharma, Inc. (Kite) for $180 per share in cash, or approximately $11.2 billion, excluding approximately $0.7 billion relating to the portion of the replaced stock-based awards attributable to the post combination period. We financed the transaction with $3.0 billion aggregate principal amount in senior unsecured notes issued in September 2017, a $6.0 billion aggregate principal amount term loan facility credit agreement entered into in September 2017 and drawn in October 2017, of which $1.5 billion was repaid in December 2017, as well as cash on hand. Kite’s cell therapies express either a chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) or an engineered T cell receptor, depending on the type of cancer. The acquisition resulted in Kite becoming our wholly-owned subsidiary and established us as a leader in cellular therapy. Through the Kite acquisition, we acquired axicabtagene ciloleucel, a CAR T cell therapy. In October 2017, we received approval from FDA for axicabtagene ciloleucel, now known commercially as Yescarta, making it the first CAR T cell therapy for the treatment of adult patients with relapsed or refractory large B-cell lymphoma after two or more lines of systemic therapy, which includes diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, transformed follicular lymphoma and primary mediastinal B-cell lymphoma. We have also filed a marketing authorization application for axicabtagene ciloleucel for the treatment of the same indications with EMA, representing the first known submission in Europe for a CAR T cell therapy. Approval in Europe is expected in the first half of 2018, although there can be no assurance that we will receive such approval on a timely basis or at all. In addition to axicabtagene ciloleucel, we also acquired therapy candidates in clinical trials in both hematologic cancers and solid tumors, including KITE-585, a CAR T cell therapy candidate that targets B-cell maturation antigen expressed in multiple myeloma.•In December 2017, we acquired all of the issued and outstanding stock of Cell Design Labs, Inc. (Cell Design Labs), a privately held company, which was in addition to the approximately 12.2% of shares in Cell Design Labs we obtained in the acquisition of Kite. With this acquisition, we gained new technology platforms that will enhance research and development efforts in cellular therapy. See Note 5, Acquisitions of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information regarding the acquisition of Kite and Cell Design Labs.2017 Financial Highlights During 2017, total revenues decreased to $26.1 billion and total product sales decreased to $25.7 billion, compared to $30.4 billion and $30.0 billion in 2016, respectively, primarily due to the competitive dynamics of the HCV market, which lowered sales of our HCV products, partially offset by higher sales of our HIV products. In the United States, product sales were $18.1 billion in 2017, compared to $19.3 billion in 2016. In Europe, product sales were $5.0 billion in 2017, compared to $6.1 billion in 2016. Sales in other international locations were $2.6 billion in 2017, compared to $4.6 billion in 2016. Research and development (R&D) expenses decreased 27% to $3.7 billion for 2017 compared to 2016, primarily due to the 2016 impacts of business development activities resulting in up-front collaboration expense related to our license and collaboration agreement with Galapagos NV (Galapagos) and acquired in-process R&D (IPR&D) expense related to our purchase of Nimbus Apollo, Inc. (Nimbus), IPR&D impairment charges and ongoing milestone payments, partially offset by acquired IPR&D expense related to our purchase of Cell Design Labs in 2017.Selling, general and administrative (SG&A) expenses increased 14% to $3.9 billion for 2017 compared to 2016, primarily due to costs associated with our acquisition of Kite and higher branded drug prescription (BPD) fee expense.Provision for income taxes increased to $8.9 billion for 2017 compared to $3.6 billion in 2016, primarily due to an estimated $5.5 billion net charge related to the enactment of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (Tax Reform) in the fourth quarter of 2017.Net income attributable to Gilead for 2017 was $4.6 billion or $3.51 per diluted share, compared to $13.5 billion or $9.94 per diluted share in 2016, primarily due to lower product sales and the impact from Tax Reform. As of December 31, 2017, we had $36.7 billion of cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities compared to $32.4 billion as of December 31, 2016. During 2017, we generated $11.9 billion in operating cash flow, paid cash dividends of $2.7 billion and repurchased a total of 13 million shares for $954 million through open market transactions.43Outlook 2018In 2018, we will continue to maintain our strong focus on operational excellence and financial discipline. From a R&D perspective, we will continue to invest in new and ongoing clinical studies, which support both our existing products and our product candidates. We expect to move forward on a number of clinical studies for new product candidates, including advancing our cell therapy pipeline and continuing the progression of our Phase 3 studies of selonsertib for nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) and filgotinib for rheumatoid arthritis and inflammatory bowel disease. In order to further develop our product pipeline, we will focus on leveraging our balance sheet to pursue partnering and acquisition opportunities which fit into our long-term strategic plan.From a commercial perspective, we will support the launch of Biktarvy and continue to promote the use of our existing TAF-containing regimens. In addition, we believe Truvada for pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) will continue to be an integral part of our growth in HIV in the United States as communities embrace the public health benefits of prevention. In HCV, we expect a decline in product sales in all major markets as a result of increased competition. HCV revenues are driven by four variables: patient starts, net pricing, market share and treatment duration. Treatment duration has stabilized as a variable and pricing of all regimens has gravitated towards the 8-week regimen price. We anticipate both pricing and market share to stabilize by mid-2018 with more predictable, but slightly declining, patient starts moving forward. In cell therapy, we will continue to promote the use of Yescarta in the United States and prepare for anticipated approval in Europe.We will continue to help ensure patient access to our products around the world, including through our Gilead Access Program, under which more than 10 million people receive our HIV medicines in low- and middle-income countries.Our progress on all of these initiatives is subject to a number of uncertainties, including, but not limited to, the continuation of an uncertain global macroeconomic environment; additional pricing pressures from payers and competitors; slower than anticipated growth in our HIV products; an increase in discounts, chargebacks and rebates due to ongoing contracts and future negotiations with commercial and government payers; market share and price erosion caused by the introduction of generic versions of Truvada outside the United States and Viread and Letairis in the United States; inaccuracies in our HCV patient start estimates; potential amendments to the Affordable Care Act or other government action that could have the effect of lowering prices; a larger than anticipated shift in payer mix to more highly discounted payer segment; and volatility in foreign currency exchange rates. 2017 Results of OperationsTotal Revenues The following table summarizes the period over period changes in our product sales and royalty, contract and other revenues:(In millions, except percentages) 2017 Change 2016 Change 2015Revenues: Product sales $25,662 (14)% $29,953 (7)% $32,151Royalty, contract and other revenues 445 2 % 437 (10)% 488Total revenues $26,107 (14)% $30,390 (7)% $32,639Product Sales2017 Compared to 2016Total product sales were $25.7 billion in 2017, compared to $30.0 billion in 2016, primarily due to a decrease in antiviral product sales. Antiviral product sales, which include sales of our HIV, HBV and HCV products, were $23.3 billion in 2017, compared to $27.7 billion in 2016. HIV and HBV product sales were $14.2 billion in 2017, compared to $12.9 billion in 2016. The increase was primarily driven by the continued uptake of our TAF-based products, partially offset by decreases in sales of tenofovir disoproxil (TDF)-based products. HCV product sales, which consist of Harvoni, Epclusa, Sovaldi and Vosevi, were $9.1 billion in 2017, compared to $14.8 billion in 2016. The declines of our HCV product sales across all major markets were a result of increased competition and lower total market patient starts.Other product sales, which include sales of Letairis, Ranexa and AmBisome, were $2.3 billion in 2017, an increase of 5% compared to $2.2 billion in 2016. Letairis is expected to face generic competition in the United States starting in July 2018.Of our product sales in 2017, 29% were generated outside the United States. We faced exposure to movements in foreign currency exchange rates, primarily in the Euro. We used foreign currency exchange contracts to hedge a percentage of our foreign currency exposure. Foreign currency exchange, net of hedges, had an unfavorable impact of $117 million on our 2017 product sales compared to 2016. 44We record product sales net of estimated mandatory and supplemental discounts to government payers, in addition to discounts to private payers, including rebates, chargebacks, cash discounts for prompt payment, distributor fees and other related costs. These deductions are generally referred to as gross-to-net deductions and totaled $17.2 billion or 40% of gross product sales in 2017, compared to $20.3 billion or 40% in 2016. Of the $17.2 billion in 2017, $15.5 billion or 36% of gross product sales was related to government and other rebates and chargebacks, and $1.7 billion was related to cash discounts for prompt payment, distributor fees and other related costs.Product sales in the United States decreased by 6% to $18.1 billion in 2017, compared to $19.3 billion in 2016. Declines in sales of our HCV products were partially offset by increases in sales of our HIV and HBV products. The declines in sales of our HCV products were primarily due to lower Harvoni and Sovaldi sales volume as a result of increased competition and lower total market patient starts. Additionally, increases in Epclusa and Vosevi sales volume were partially offset by lower average net selling price for Epclusa as pricing of all regimens has gravitated towards the 8-week regimen price. The increases in the sales of our HIV and HBV products were primarily driven by higher sales volume of our TAF-based products and higher average net selling prices, partially offset by decreases in our TDF-based products and the prior year impact of a favorable revision to our rebate reserves of $332 million, primarily related to our TDF-based products.Product sales in Europe decreased by 18% to $5.0 billion in 2017, compared to $6.1 billion in 2016, primarily due to lower Harvoni and Sovaldi sales volume, partially offset by higher Epclusa sales volume. Foreign currency exchange, net of hedges, had an unfavorable impact of $89 million on our product sales in 2017 compared to 2016.Product sales in other international locations decreased by 45% to $2.6 billion in 2017, compared to $4.6 billion in 2016, primarily due to lower sales in Japan. Sales of our HCV products in Japan were $692 million for 2017, compared to $2.5 billion for the same period in 2016, primarily due to lower sales volume as a result of lower total market patient starts and increased competition. 2016 Compared to 2015Total product sales were $30.0 billion in 2016, compared to $32.2 billion in 2015, primarily due to a decrease in antiviral product sales. Antiviral product sales were $27.7 billion in 2016, compared to $30.2 billion in 2015. HIV and HBV product sales were $12.9 billion in 2016, compared to $11.1 billion in 2015. The increase was primarily driven by the continued uptake of our TAF-based products, partially offset by decreases in sales of TDF-based products. HCV product sales were $14.8 billion in 2016, compared to $19.1 billion in 2015. The declines were due to lower sales of Harvoni and Sovaldi, partially offset by sales of Epclusa, which was launched in 2016 across various locations.Other product sales, which include sales of Letairis, Ranexa and AmBisome, were $2.2 billion in 2016, an increase of 14% compared to $1.9 billion in 2015.Of our product sales in 2016, 36% were generated outside the United States. Foreign currency exchange, net of hedges, had an unfavorable impact of $498 million on our 2016 product sales compared to 2015. Our gross-to-net deductions totaled $20.3 billion or 40% of gross product sales in 2016, compared to $18.1 billion or 36% in 2015. Of the $20.3 billion in 2016, $19.1 billion or 38% of gross product sales was related to government and other rebates and chargebacks, and $1.2 billion was related to cash discounts for prompt payment, distributor fees and other related costs. The increase in our 2016 gross-to-net deductions was primarily due to an increase in discounts and a higher percentage of sales to more deeply discounted segments for our HCV products in the United States.Product sales in the United States decreased by 9% to $19.3 billion in 2016, compared to $21.2 billion in 2015. Declines in sales of our HCV products were partially offset by increases in sales of our HIV and HBV products. The increases in the sales of our HIV and HBV products were primarily driven by sales of our newly launched TAF-based products and a favorable revision to our rebate reserves of $332 million, primarily related to our TDF-based products. Product sales in Europe decreased by 15% to $6.1 billion in 2016, compared to $7.2 billion in 2015, primarily due to lower Harvoni and Sovaldi sales volume. Foreign currency exchange, net of hedges, had an unfavorable impact of $503 million on our product sales in 2016 compared to 2015.Product sales in other international locations increased by 20% to $4.6 billion in 2016, compared to $3.8 billion in 2015, primarily due to sales in Japan. Sales of our HCV products in Japan were $2.5 billion for 2016, compared to $1.9 billion in 2015. The increase was primarily driven by higher sales volume of Harvoni, which was launched in September 2015, partially offset by a mandatory price reduction of 32% for Sovaldi and Harvoni that was effective April 1, 2016.45The following table summarizes the period over period changes in our product sales:(In millions, except percentages) 2017 Change 2016 Change 2015Antiviral products: HCV products Harvoni $4,370 (52)% $9,081 (34)% $13,864Epclusa 3,510 100 % 1,752 * —Sovaldi 964 (76)% 4,001 (24)% 5,276Vosevi 293 * — * —HIV and HBV products Genvoya 3,674 148 % 1,484 * 45Truvada 3,134 (12)% 3,566 3 % 3,459Atripla 1,806 (31)% 2,605 (17)% 3,134Descovy 1,218 * 298 * —Odefsey 1,106 * 329 * —Stribild 1,053 (45)% 1,914 5 % 1,825Viread 1,046 (12)% 1,186 7 % 1,108Complera/Eviplera 966 (34)% 1,457 2 % 1,427Other 196 * 72 4 % 69Total antiviral products 23,336 (16)% 27,745 (8)% 30,207Other products: Letairis 887 8 % 819 17 % 700Ranexa 717 6 % 677 15 % 588AmBisome 366 3 % 356 2 % 350Zydelig 149 (11)% 168 27 % 132Other 207 10 % 188 8 % 174Total product sales $25,662 (14)% $29,953 (7)% $32,151 * Percentage not meaningfulThe following is additional discussion of our results by product: •HarvoniHarvoni sales accounted for 19%, 33% and 46% of our total antiviral product sales for 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively. In 2017, product sales were $3.1 billion in the United States, $704 million in Europe and $613 million in other international locations. In 2016, product sales were $4.9 billion in the United States, $1.8 billion in Europe and $2.3 billion in other international locations. In 2015, product sales were $10.1 billion in the United States, $2.2 billion in Europe and $1.6 billion in other international locations.The decreases in 2017 compared to 2016 in all major markets were primarily due to lower sales volume. In the United States, the decrease in 2016 compared to 2015 was primarily due to lower sales volume and a lower average net selling price, which was partially offset by a favorable revision to our sales return reserve of $181 million recorded during the second quarter of 2016. The number of patients that started treatment with Harvoni in the United States peaked in the first half of 2015, as many warehoused patients initiated treatment after the product launch. In Europe, the decrease in 2016 compared to 2015 was primarily due to lower sales volume and unfavorable foreign currency exchange, net of hedges. In other international locations, the increase in 2016 compared to 2015 was primarily due to higher sales in Japan. Sales in Japan were $1.8 billion in 2016 compared to $1.0 billion in 2015, driven by higher sales volume, partially offset by a mandatory price reduction of 32% that was effective April 1, 2016. •EpclusaEpclusa was approved by FDA and the European Commission in June and July 2016, respectively. Epclusa sales accounted for 15% and 6% of our total antiviral product sales for 2017 and 2016, respectively. In 2017, product sales were $2.4 billion in the United States, $869 million in Europe and $237 million in other international 46locations. In 2016, product sales were $1.6 billion in the United States, $141 million in Europe and $20 million in other international locations.The increases in 2017 compared to 2016 in all major markets were primarily due to higher sales volume, partially offset by a decrease in average net selling price. •SovaldiSovaldi sales accounted for 4%, 14% and 17% of our total antiviral product sales for 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively. In 2017, product sales were $130 million in the United States, $258 million in Europe and $576 million in other international locations. In 2016, product sales were $1.9 billion in the United States, $891 million in Europe and $1.2 billion in other international locations. In 2015, product sales were $2.4 billion in the United States, $1.6 billion in Europe and $1.3 billion in other international locations.The decreases in 2017 compared to 2016 in all major markets were primarily due to lower sales volume driven by a shift in the market from Sovaldi to Epclusa. In the United States, the decrease in 2016 compared to 2015 was primarily due to lower sales volume, partially offset by a favorable revision to our sales return reserve of $98 million recorded during the second quarter of 2016. In Europe, the decrease in 2016 compared to 2015 was primarily due to lower sales volume. In other international locations, the slight decrease was primarily due to lower sales in Japan. Sales in Japan were $635 million in 2016 compared to $878 million in 2015 due to a mandatory price reduction of 32% that was effective April 1, 2016 and lower sales volume. •TAF-based regimens - Genvoya, Descovy and OdefseyGenvoya was approved by FDA and the European Commission in November 2015. Descovy was approved by FDA and the European Commission in April 2016. Odefsey was approved by FDA and the European Commission in March and June 2016, respectively.Product sales of these TAF-based regimens were $6.0 billion, $2.1 billion and $45 million in 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively, and accounted for 26% and 8% of our total antiviral product sales for 2017 and 2016, respectively. In 2017, product sales were $5.0 billion in the United States, $892 million in Europe and $151 million in other international locations. In 2016, product sales were $1.8 billion in the United States, $256 million in Europe and $26 million in other international locations. The increases in 2017 compared to 2016 in all major markets were primarily driven by higher sales volume as patients shifted away from TDF-based regimens. In Europe, product sales of our TAF-based regimens continue to grow despite the availability of generic Viread and Truvada in several countries.•TDF-based regimens - Stribild, Complera/Eviplera, Atripla, Truvada and VireadProduct sales of these TDF-based regimens were $8.0 billion, $10.7 billion and $11.0 billion in 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively, and accounted for 34%, 39% and 36% of our total antiviral product sales for 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively. In 2017, product sales were $5.3 billion in the United States, $1.9 billion in Europe and $805 million in other international locations. In 2016, product sales were $7.2 billion in the United States, $2.6 billion in Europe and $882 million in other international locations. In 2015, product sales were $7.1 billion in the United States, $3.0 billion in Europe and $881 million in other international locations.In the United States, the decreases in 2017 compared to 2016 were primarily due to lower sales volume as a result of the continued uptake of our TAF-based regimens, partially offset by the increased usage of Truvada for PrEP. In Europe, the decreases in 2017 compared to 2016 were primarily due to lower sales volume as a result of the availability of generic Viread and Truvada in several countries and the continued uptake of our TAF-based regimens. In the United States, the increases in 2016 compared to 2015 were primarily due to a favorable revision to our rebate reserves of $312 million relating to Stribild and Complera in the third quarter of 2016. In Europe, the decreases in 2016 compared to 2015 were primarily due to lower sales volume as a result of the continued uptake of our TAF-based regimens. Royalty, Contract and Other Revenues The following table summarizes the period over period changes in our royalty, contract and other revenues: (In millions, except percentages) 2017 Change 2016 Change 2015Royalty, contract and other revenues $445 2% $437 (10)% $48847Royalty, contract and other revenues in 2017 were up slightly compared to the same period in 2016, and decreased by 10% in 2016, compared to $488 million in 2015. The decrease in 2016 compared to 2015 was primarily due to royalty revenues from F. Hoffman-La Roche Ltd for sales of Tamiflu. Cost of Goods Sold and Product Gross MarginThe following table summarizes the period over period changes in our product sales, cost of goods sold and product gross margin: (In millions, except percentages) 2017 Change 2016 Change 2015Total product sales $25,662 (14)% $29,953 (7)% $32,151Cost of goods sold $4,371 3 % $4,261 6 % $4,006Product gross margin 83% 86% 88%The decreases in our product gross margin in 2017 compared to 2016 and in 2016 compared to 2015 were primarily due to changes in product mix, as our HCV product sales decreased as a percentage of total product sales. Research and Development Expenses The following table summarizes the period over period changes in R&D expenses:(In millions, except percentages) 2017 Change 2016 Change 2015R&D expenses $3,734 (27)% $5,098 69% $3,014R&D expenses summarized above consisted primarily of clinical studies performed by contract research organizations, materials and supplies, licenses and fees, up-front payments under collaboration agreements, milestone payments, personnel costs, including salaries, benefits and stock-based compensation and overhead allocations consisting of various support and facilities-related costs. We do not track total R&D expenses by product candidate, therapeutic area or development phase. However, we manage our R&D expenses by identifying the R&D activities we anticipate will be performed during a given period and then prioritizing efforts based on scientific data, probability of successful development, market potential, available human and capital resources and other considerations. We continually review our R&D pipeline and the status of development and, as necessary, reallocate resources among the R&D portfolio that we believe will best support the future growth of our business.The following table provides a breakout of R&D expenses by major cost type: (In millions, except percentages) 2017 2016 2015Clinical studies and outside services $1,881 $2,446 $1,568Personnel and infrastructure expenses 1,271 1,122 1,041Facilities, IT and other costs 360 325 339IPR&D impairment charges — 432 —Acquired IPR&D 222 400 66Up-front collaboration expenses — 373 —Total $3,734 $5,098 $3,014In 2017, R&D expenses decreased $1.4 billion or 27%, compared to 2016, primarily due to the 2016 impacts of business development activities resulting in up-front collaboration expense related to our license and collaboration agreement with Galapagos and acquired IPR&D expense related to our purchase of Nimbus, IPR&D impairment charges and ongoing milestone payments, partially offset by acquired IPR&D expense related to our purchase of Cell Design Labs in 2017.In 2016, R&D expenses increased $2.1 billion or 69%, compared to 2015, primarily due to the overall progression of clinical studies, including ongoing milestone payments, our purchase of an FDA priority review voucher, up-front collaboration expenses related to our license and collaboration agreement with Galapagos and acquired IPR&D expense related to our purchase of Nimbus. IPR&D impairment charges were a result of termination of clinical development for momelotinib and simtuzumab.48Selling, General and Administrative Expenses The following table summarizes the period over period changes in SG&A expenses:(In millions, except percentages) 2017 Change 2016 Change 2015SG&A expenses $3,878 14% $3,398 (1)% $3,426SG&A expenses relate to sales and marketing, finance, human resources, legal and other administrative activities. Expenses consist primarily of personnel costs, facilities and overhead costs, outside marketing, advertising and legal expenses, and other general and administrative costs. SG&A expenses also include the BPD fee. In the United States, we, along with other pharmaceutical manufacturers of branded drug products, are required to pay a portion of the BPD fee, which is estimated based on select government sales during each calendar year as a percentage of total industry government sales and is trued-up upon receipt of invoices from the Internal Revenue Service (IRS). In 2017, SG&A expenses increased $480 million or 14% compared to 2016, primarily due to costs associated with our acquisition of Kite, which primarily consist of stock-based compensation and transaction costs, as well as higher BPD fee expenses resulting from a favorable adjustment of $191 million in the first quarter of 2016.In 2016, SG&A expenses were flat compared to 2015. Declines in our BPD fee expenses were offset by higher costs to support new product launches and our geographic expansion. The 2016 BPD fee expenses were favorably impacted by a credit of $191 million based on our receipt of the IRS invoice. Our BPD fee expenses were $385 million in 2017, $270 million in 2016 and $414 million in 2015. The BPD fee expenses are not tax deductible. Interest ExpenseIn 2017, interest expense increased to $1.1 billion, compared to $964 million in 2016, primarily due to the issuance of $5.0 billion aggregate principal amount of senior unsecured notes in September 2016 (the 2016 Notes). In 2016, interest expense increased to $964 million, compared to $688 million in 2015, primarily due to the issuance of the 2016 Notes and $10.0 billion aggregate principal amount of senior unsecured notes issued in September 2015. Other Income (Expense), Net Other income (expense), net, was $523 million, $428 million and $154 million in 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively. The increases were primarily due to our cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities earning a higher yield and higher cash balances.Provision for Income Taxes Our provision for income taxes was $8.9 billion in 2017 compared to $3.6 billion in 2016. The 2017 effective tax rate increased to 65.7% from the 2016 effective tax rate of 21.1%, primarily due to the enactment of Tax Reform in December 2017. Changes to the geographic mix of earnings also contributed to the increase in the 2017 effective tax rate.On December 22, 2017, Tax Reform was signed into law in the United States making significant changes to the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended. Changes include, but are not limited to, a corporate tax rate decrease from 35% to 21% effective for tax years beginning after December 31, 2017, implementation of a modified territorial tax system and a repatriation tax on deemed repatriated earnings of foreign subsidiaries. We calculated a provisional estimate of the impact from Tax Reform in our 2017 income tax provision in accordance with our interpretation of Tax Reform and guidance available as of the date of this filing. As a result, we recorded an estimated $5.5 billion net charge to income tax expense in the fourth quarter of 2017, the period in which Tax Reform was enacted. This amount includes: i) a provisional $308 million deferred tax benefit related to the re-measurement of certain deferred tax assets and liabilities, based on the revised rates at which they are expected to reverse in the future, and ii) a provisional $5.8 billion charge related to the transition tax on the mandatory deemed repatriation of accumulated foreign earnings determined as of December 31, 2017. The provisional transition tax charge includes federal (net of certain offsetting adjustments related to unrecognized tax benefits), state and local, and foreign withholding tax on the accumulated foreign earnings, which are no longer considered indefinitely reinvested as of December 31, 2017.The accrued federal liability for the transition tax of $6.1 billion will be payable over an eight year period. As of December 31, 2017, $487 million of the transition tax was recorded within Other accrued liabilities and $5.6 billion was recorded in Long-term income taxes payable on our Consolidated Balance Sheets.In accordance with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 118 (SAB 118), we have determined that the $308 million of the deferred tax benefit recorded in connection with the re-measurement of certain deferred tax assets and liabilities and the $5.8 billion of current tax expense recorded in connection with the transition tax on the mandatory deemed repatriation of foreign earnings are provisional and subject to further adjustment during the measurement period (not to exceed one year from the enactment of Tax Reform). Given the complexity of Tax Reform, we may be refining our 49estimates of these provisional amounts as further guidance is issued from the U.S. Treasury, the SEC and the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB). Additionally, we are continuing to evaluate the accounting policy election required with regard to the tax on Global Intangible Low-Taxed Income (the Global Minimum Tax). The FASB allows companies to adopt a policy election to account for the Global Minimum Tax under one of two methods: (i) account for the Global Minimum Tax as a component of tax expense in the period in which a company is subject to the rules (the period cost method), or (ii) account for the Global Minimum Tax in a company’s measurement of deferred taxes (the deferred method). We have not elected a method and will only do so after our completion of the analysis of the Global Minimum Tax provisions. Our election method will depend, in part, on analyzing expected future U.S. taxable income inclusions related to Global Minimum Tax under both methodologies in order to determine the most appropriate method. Should we decide to elect the deferred method of accounting for the Global Minimum Tax, it is possible that our provisional estimate for re-measuring our deferred taxes may materially change. We will finalize the analysis for the accounting policy election during the measurement period.Our provision for income taxes was $3.6 billion in both 2016 and 2015. The effective tax rate increased to 21.1% in 2016 from 16.4% in 2015 primarily due to changes in the geographic mix of earnings.Liquidity and Capital Resources We believe that our existing capital resources, supplemented by our cash flows generated from operating activities will be adequate to satisfy our capital needs for the foreseeable future. The following table summarizes our cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities and working capital (in millions): December 31, 2017 2016 2015Cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities $36,694 $32,380 $26,208Working capital $20,188 $10,370 $14,044Cash, Cash Equivalents and Marketable Securities Cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities totaled $36.7 billion at December 31, 2017, an increase of $4.3 billion or 13% when compared to $32.4 billion at December 31, 2016. During 2017, we generated $11.9 billion in operating cash flow and in connection with our acquisition of Kite, we issued $3.0 billion aggregate principal amount of senior unsecured notes and entered into and drew on a $6.0 billion aggregate principal amount term loan facility credit agreement, of which $1.5 billion was repaid in December 2017. Additionally, we paid cash dividends of $2.7 billion and utilized $954 million on stock repurchases. See Note 5, Acquisitions of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional details on our acquisition of Kite. Cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities totaled $32.4 billion at December 31, 2016, an increase of $6.2 billion or 24% when compared to $26.2 billion at December 31, 2015. During 2016, we generated $17.0 billion in operating cash flow, received $4.9 billion in net proceeds from the 2016 Notes, utilized $11.0 billion to repurchase stock, repaid $985 million principal balance of our senior notes and convertible senior notes and paid cash dividends of $2.5 billion.Of the total cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities at December 31, 2017, approximately $31.5 billion was generated from operations in foreign jurisdictions. In February 2018, we repatriated $28.0 billion of cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities to our parent company headquartered in the United States. Prior to the enactment of Tax Reform, these earnings were considered indefinitely reinvested and no U.S. taxes had been provided. In 2017, U.S. taxes have been provided on these earnings through the accrual of the Tax Reform transition tax. See Note 17, Income Taxes of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional details on Tax Reform. Working Capital Working capital was $20.2 billion at December 31, 2017. The increase of $9.8 billion from working capital at December 31, 2016 was primarily driven by an increase in cash, cash equivalents and short-term marketable securities resulting from a shift in the duration of our marketable securities portfolio to reduce interest rate risk, partially offset by $2.7 billion increase in current portion of long-term debt based on contractual maturity.Working capital was $10.4 billion at December 31, 2016. The decrease of $3.7 billion from working capital at December 31, 2015 was primarily due to a decline in cash and cash equivalents, as a result of an increase in our long-term marketable securities.50Cash FlowsThe following table summarizes our cash flow activities (in millions): 2017 2016 2015Cash provided by (used in): Operating activities $11,898 $17,047 $21,250Investing activities $(16,069) $(11,985) $(12,475)Financing activities $3,393 $(9,725) $(5,884)Cash Provided by Operating Activities Cash provided by operating activities represents the cash receipts and disbursements related to all of our activities other than investing and financing activities. Operating cash flow is derived by adjusting our net income for non-cash items and changes in operating assets and liabilities. Cash provided by operating activities decreased by $5.1 billion to $11.9 billion in 2017 when compared to 2016, primarily due to lower cash receipts as a result of lower product sales and higher tax payments. Cash provided by operating activities decreased by $4.2 billion to $17.0 billion in 2016 when compared to 2015, primarily due to lower cash receipts as a result of lower product sales and higher cash payments related to accrued government and other rebates and chargebacks. Cash Used in Investing Activities Cash used in investing activities primarily consists of acquisitions (net of cash acquired), net purchases of marketable securities and other investments and our capital expenditures. Cash used in investing activities increased by $4.1 billion to $16.1 billion in 2017 when compared to 2016, primarily due to our acquisition of Kite, partially offset by lower net purchases of marketable securities. Cash used in investing activities decreased by $490 million to $12.0 billion in 2016 when compared to 2015, primarily due to lower net purchases of marketable securities, partially offset by other investments related to our license and collaboration agreement with Galapagos. Cash Provided by (Used in) Financing Activities Cash provided by financing activities was $3.4 billion in 2017, compared to cash used in financing activities of $9.7 billion in 2016, primarily due to lower repurchases of our common stock and higher proceeds from the issuances of debt to partially fund our acquisition of Kite. Cash used in financing activities increased by $3.8 billion to $9.7 billion in 2016 when compared to 2015, primarily due to higher repurchases of our common stock, higher net payments on debt, higher payments of cash dividends and lower proceeds from the issuances of debt. These increases were partially offset by lower payments to settle warrants related to our convertible senior notes that were due in May 2016.Debt and Credit FacilitiesLong-Term ObligationsThe summary of our borrowings under various financing arrangements is included in Note 11, Debt and Credit Facilities of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.Senior Unsecured NotesIn 2017, in connection with our acquisition of Kite, we issued $3.0 billion aggregate principal amount of senior unsecured notes consisting of $750 million principal amount of floating rate notes due September 2018, $750 million principal amount of floating rate notes due March 2019, and $500 million principal amount of floating rate notes due September 2019 (collectively, the Floating Rate Notes) and $1.0 billion principal amount of 1.85% senior notes due September 2019 (the Fixed Rate Notes and, collectively with the Floating Rate Notes, the 2017 Notes). The Floating Rate Notes bear interest rates equal to three month London Interbank Offered Rates (LIBOR), plus 0.17% with respect to the Floating Rate Notes due September 2018, 0.22% with respect to the Floating Rate Notes due March 2019 and 0.25% with respect to the Floating Rate Notes due September 2019. The Fixed Rate Notes will pay interest semiannually and the Floating Rate Notes will pay interest quarterly. In September 2016, we issued the 2016 Notes in the aggregate principal amount of $5.0 billion and in December 2016, repaid $700 million of principal balance related to our senior unsecured notes. 51We are required to comply with certain covenants under our notes indentures and as of December 31, 2017, we were not in violation of any covenants.Term Loan FacilitiesIn September 2017, we entered into a $6.0 billion aggregate principal amount term loan facility credit agreement consisting of a $1.0 billion principal amount 364-day senior unsecured term loan facility, a $2.5 billion principal amount three-year senior unsecured term loan facility and a $2.5 billion principal amount five-year senior unsecured term loan facility (collectively, the Term Loan Facilities). In October 2017, we drew $6.0 billion aggregate principal amount on the Term Loan Facilities and used the proceeds to finance our acquisition of Kite. The Term Loan Facilities bear interest at floating rates based on LIBOR plus an applicable margin which will vary based on our debt ratings from Fitch Ratings, Inc., Moody’s Investors Service, Inc. and S&P Global Ratings. The 364-day senior unsecured term loan facility and three-year senior unsecured term loan facility will be due and payable at maturity. The five-year senior unsecured term loan facility will be payable in quarterly amounts equal to 2.5% of the initial principal amount of the five-year senior unsecured term loan facility on each fiscal quarter end date after the second anniversary of the closing date, with any remaining balance due and payable at maturity. We may prepay loans under the Term Loan Facilities in whole or in part at any time without premium or penalty. Amounts repaid under the Term Loan Facilities cannot be reborrowed. The Term Loan Facilities contain customary representations, warranties, affirmative, negative and financial maintenance covenants and events of default. As of December 31, 2017, we were not in violation of any covenants.In 2017, we repaid $1.5 billion of principal balance related to the three-year senior unsecured term loan facility and $311 million of our term loan facility issued in May 2016.Credit FacilitiesIn 2016, we terminated our five-year $1.3 billion revolving credit facility and entered into a $2.5 billion five-year revolving credit facility maturing in May 2021 (the Five-Year Revolving Credit Agreement). The revolving credit facility can be used for working capital requirements and for general corporate purposes, including, without limitation, acquisitions. We are required to comply with certain covenants under the Five-Year Revolving Credit Agreement and as of December 31, 2017, we were not in violation of any covenants, and no amounts were outstanding under the Five-Year Revolving Credit Agreement.Capital Return ProgramStock Repurchase ProgramsIn the first quarter of 2016, our Board of Directors authorized a $12.0 billion stock repurchase program (2016 Program), under which repurchases may be made in the open market or in privately negotiated transactions. The 2016 Program commenced after the $15.0 billion stock repurchase program authorized by our Board of Directors in January 2015 was completed in the second quarter of 2016. The $5.0 billion stock repurchase program authorized by our Board of Directors in May 2014 was completed in the first quarter of 2015. As of December 31, 2017, the remaining authorized repurchase amount under the 2016 Program was $8.0 billion. The following table summarizes our stock repurchases under the above-described programs (in millions): Year ended December 31, 2017 (1) 2016 (2) 2015 (3)Shares repurchased and retired 13 123 95Amount $954 $11,001 $10,002_______________________ Notes: (1) All repurchases were under the 2016 Program.(2) Includes 36 million shares repurchased for $3.0 billion under the 2016 Program and 87 million shares repurchased for $8.0 billion under the 2015 Program.(3) Includes 65 million shares repurchased for $7.0 billion under the 2015 Program and 30 million shares repurchased for $3.0 billion under the 2014 Program.DividendsOn February 6, 2018, we announced that our Board of Directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.57 per share of our common stock, with a payment date of March 29, 2018 to all stockholders of record as of the close of business on March 16, 2018. Future dividends are subject to declaration by the Board of Directors.During 2017, we declared and paid quarterly cash dividends for an aggregate amount of $2.7 billion or $2.08 per common share. During 2016, we declared and paid quarterly cash dividends for an aggregate amount of $2.5 billion or $1.84 per common 52share. See Note 13, Stockholders’ Equity of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information. Capital ResourcesWe believe our existing capital resources, supplemented by cash flows generated from our operations, will be adequate to satisfy our capital needs for the foreseeable future. Our future capital requirements will depend on many factors, including but not limited to the following: •the commercial performance of our current and future products; •the progress and scope of our R&D efforts, including preclinical studies and clinical trials; •the cost, timing and outcome of regulatory reviews; •the expansion of our sales and marketing capabilities; •the possibility of acquiring additional manufacturing capabilities or office facilities; •the possibility of acquiring other companies or new products;•debt service requirements;•the establishment of additional collaborative relationships with other companies; and •costs associated with the defense, settlement and adverse results of government investigations and litigation, including matters related to sofosbuvir. We may in the future require additional funding, which could be in the form of proceeds from equity or debt financings. If such funding is required, we cannot guarantee that it will be available to us on favorable terms, if at all. Other In 2004, we entered into a collaboration arrangement with Bristol-Myers Squibb Company (BMS) to develop and commercialize a single tablet regimen containing our Truvada and BMS’s Sustiva (efavirenz) in the United States and Canada. This combination was approved for use in the United States in 2006 and is sold under the brand name Atripla. We and BMS structured this collaboration as a joint venture that operated as a limited liability company, which we consolidated. We and BMS granted royalty-free sublicenses to the joint venture for the use of our respective company owned technologies and, in return, were granted certain licenses by the joint venture to use the intellectual property resulting from the collaboration. The economic interests of the joint venture held by us and BMS (including the sharing of revenues and out-of-pocket expenses) were based on the portion of the net selling price of Atripla attributable to Truvada and efavirenz. Since the net selling price for Truvada changed over time relative to the net selling price of efavirenz, both our and BMS’s respective economic interests in the joint venture varied annually over the course of the collaboration.Under the agreement, either party could terminate the other party’s participation in the collaboration within 30 days after the launch of at least one generic version of such other party’s single agent products (or double agent products). The terminating party then had the right to continue to sell Atripla and become the continuing party, but was obligated to pay the terminated party certain royalties for a three-year period following the effective date of the termination. In December 2017, a generic version of efavirenz was launched in the United States. Upon the generic version launch, we terminated BMS’s participation in the collaboration and became the continuing party and the sole owner of the joint venture. December 31, 2017 was the last day of the collaboration. As a result of the termination and the transfer to Gilead of BMS’s ownership interest in the joint venture, we consolidate the limited liability company as a wholly-owned subsidiary. BMS no longer has any ownership interest in the joint venture and is not permitted to commercialize Atripla in the United States and Canada, but is entitled to receive from us certain royalties on net sales of Atripla for the next three calendar years, on a declining annual scale. We may continue to purchase efavirenz from BMS as needed to continue manufacturing Atripla for the United States and Canada markets. See Note 10, Collaborative Arrangements of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information.Critical Accounting Policies, Estimates and Judgments The discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based on our Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, which have been prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses and related disclosures. On an ongoing basis, we evaluate and base our estimates on historical experience and on various other market specific and other relevant assumptions that we believe 53to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ significantly from these estimates. We believe the following critical accounting policies reflect the more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our Consolidated Financial Statements. Revenue Recognition Product Sales We recognize revenues from product sales when there is persuasive evidence that an arrangement exists, delivery has occurred, the price is fixed or determinable and collectability is reasonably assured. We record product sales net of estimated mandatory and supplemental discounts to government payers, in addition to discounts to private payers, and other related charges. These are generally referred to as gross-to-net deductions and are recorded in the same period the related sales occur. Government and other rebates and chargebacks represent the majority of our gross-to-net deductions and require complex and significant judgment by management. Estimates are assessed each period and updated to reflect current information.Government and Other Rebates and ChargebacksGovernment and other rebates and chargebacks include amounts paid to payers and healthcare providers in the United States, including Medicaid rebates, AIDS Drug Assistance Programs, Veterans Administration and Public Health Service discounts, and other rebates, as well as foreign government rebates. Rebates and chargebacks are based on contractual arrangements or statutory requirements which may vary by product, by payer and individual payer plans. For qualified programs that can purchase our products through wholesalers or other distributors at a lower contractual price, the wholesalers or distributors charge back to us the difference between their acquisition cost and the lower contractual price. Our consolidated allowances for government and other chargebacks that are payable to our direct customers are classified as reductions of accounts receivable, and totaled $340 million as of December 31, 2017 and $636 million as of December 31, 2016. Our consolidated allowance for government and other rebates that will be paid to parties other than our direct customers are recorded in Accrued government and other rebates on our Consolidated Balance Sheets, and totaled $4.7 billion as of December 31, 2017 and $5.0 billion as of December 31, 2016. Our allowances for government and other rebates and chargebacks are estimated based on products sold, historical utilization rates, pertinent third-party industry information, estimated patient population, known market events or trends, channel inventory data and/or other market data. We also consider new information regarding changes in programs’ regulations and guidelines that would impact the amount of the actual rebates and/or our expectations regarding future utilization rates for these programs. We believe that the methodology that we use to estimate our government and other rebates and chargebacks is reasonable and appropriate given the current facts and circumstances. However, actual results may differ significantly from our estimates. During the last three years, our actual government rebates and chargebacks claimed for prior periods have varied by less than 5% from our estimates.The following table summarizes the consolidated activities and ending balances in our government and other rebates and chargebacks accounts (in millions):Accrued government and other rebates and chargebacks: Balance at Beginning of Year Decrease/(Increase) to Product Sales Payments Balance at End of YearYear ended December 31, 2017: Activity related to 2017 sales $— $15,809 $(11,170) $4,639Activity related to sales prior to 2017 5,657 (264) (4,988) 405Total $5,657 $15,545 $(16,158) $5,044Year ended December 31, 2016: Activity related to 2016 sales $— $19,219 $(13,920) $5,299Activity related to sales prior to 2016 5,025 (148) (4,519) 358Total $5,025 $19,071 $(18,439) $5,657The decrease in our government and other rebates and chargebacks in 2017 compared to 2016 was primarily driven by lower HCV sales.54Legal ContingenciesWe are a party to various legal actions. The most significant of these are described in Note 12, Commitments and Contingencies - Legal Proceedings of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. It is not possible to determine the outcome of these matters. We recognize accruals for such actions to the extent that we conclude that a loss is both probable and reasonably estimable. We accrue for the best estimate of a loss within a range; however, if no estimate in the range is better than any other, then we accrue the minimum amount in the range. If we determine that a loss is reasonably possible and the loss or range of loss can be estimated, we disclose the possible loss. Significant judgment is required in both the determination of probability and the determination as to whether an exposure is reasonably estimable. Because of the inherent uncertainty and unpredictability related to these matters, accruals are based on what we believe to be the best information available at the time of our assessment, including the legal facts and circumstances of the case, status of the proceedings, applicable law and the views of legal counsel. Upon the final resolution of such matters, it is possible that there may be a loss in excess of the amount recorded, and such amounts could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, cash flows or financial position. We periodically reassess these matters when additional information becomes available and adjust our estimates and assumptions when facts and circumstances indicate the need for any changes. We did not recognize any accruals for such matters as of December 31, 2017 and 2016 as we did not believe losses were probable.Valuation of Intangible AssetsIn conjunction with our business combinations, we have recorded intangible assets primarily related to IPR&D projects. We had total intangible assets of $17.1 billion as of December 31, 2017, compared to $9.0 billion as of December 31, 2016. The identifiable intangible assets are measured at their respective fair values as of the acquisition date and may be subject to revision within the measurement period, which may be up to one year from the acquisition date. The models used in valuing these intangible assets require the use of significant estimates and assumptions including but not limited to:•estimates of revenues and operating profits related to the products or product candidates;•the probability of success for unapproved product candidates considering their stages of development;•the time and resources needed to complete the development and approval of product candidates;•the life of the potential commercialized products and associated risks, including the inherent difficulties and uncertainties in developing a product candidate such as obtaining FDA and other regulatory approvals; and•risks related to the viability of and potential alternative treatments in any future target markets.We believe the fair values used to record intangible assets acquired in connection with a business combination using information known and knowable and are based upon reasonable estimates and assumptions given the facts and circumstances as of the related valuation dates. Intangible assets related to IPR&D projects are considered to be indefinite-lived until the completion or abandonment of the associated R&D efforts. If and when development is complete, which generally occurs if and when regulatory approval to market a product is obtained, the associated assets would be deemed finite-lived and would then be amortized based on their respective estimated useful lives at that point in time. During the period the assets are considered indefinite-lived, they are not amortized but are tested for impairment on an annual basis as well as between annual tests if we become aware of any events or changes that would indicate that it is more likely than not that the fair values of the IPR&D projects are below their respective carrying amounts. The fair value of our indefinite-lived intangible assets is dependent on assumptions such as the expected timing or probability of achieving the specified milestones, changes in projected revenues or changes in discount rates. Significant judgment is employed in determining these assumptions and changes to our assumptions could have a significant impact on our results of operations in any given period. Intangible assets with finite useful lives are amortized over their estimated useful lives primarily on a straight-line basis. Intangible assets with finite useful lives are reviewed for impairment when facts or circumstances suggest that the carrying value of these assets may not be recoverable. On October 3, 2017, in connection with our Kite acquisition, we acquired intangible assets primarily related to IPR&D for axicabtagene ciloleucel, KITE-585 and KTE-C19, which had an estimated aggregate fair value of $9.0 billion. On October 18, 2017, FDA approved axicabtagene ciloleucel, now known commercially as Yescarta, making it the first CAR T cell therapy for the treatment of adult patients with relapsed or refractory large B-cell lymphoma after two or more lines of systemic therapy, which includes diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, transformed follicular lymphoma and primary mediastinal B-cell lymphoma. Upon approval, we reclassified $6.2 billion of the purchased IPR&D as a finite-lived intangible asset. We are amortizing this asset over an estimated useful life of 18 years using the straight-line method. See Note 5, Acquisitions of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.55As of December 31, 2017, we had indefinite-lived intangible assets of $2.8 billion which consisted of purchased IPR&D from our acquisition of Kite. See Note 5, Acquisitions of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. In 2016, the estimated fair value of our IPR&D related to momelotinib and simtuzumab was written down to zero due to termination of clinical developments of such programs, and as a result, we recorded impairment charges of $432 million within Research and development expenses on our Consolidated Statements of Income included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Provision for Income TaxesWe estimate our income tax provision, including deferred tax assets and liabilities, based on significant management judgment. We evaluate the realization of all or a portion of our deferred tax assets on a quarterly basis. We record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets to the amounts that are more likely than not to be realized. We consider future taxable income, ongoing tax planning strategies and our historical financial performance in assessing the need for a valuation allowance. If we expect to realize deferred tax assets for which we have previously recorded a valuation allowance, we will reduce the valuation allowance in the period in which such determination is first made. The valuation allowance was $162 million as of December 31, 2017 and $126 million as of December 31, 2016. The increase of our valuation allowance from December 31, 2016 to December 31, 2017 was primarily related to Kite. We are subject to income taxes in the United States and various foreign jurisdictions including Ireland. Due to economic and political conditions, various countries are actively considering and have made changes to existing tax laws (for example, the United States recently enacted significant tax reform, and certain provisions of the new law will significantly affect us). We cannot predict the form or timing of potential legislative changes that could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations. In addition, significant judgment is required in determining our worldwide provision for income taxes.On December 22, 2017, Tax Reform was signed into law in the United States making significant changes to the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended. Changes include, but are not limited to, a corporate tax rate decrease from 35% to 21% effective for tax years beginning after December 31, 2017, implementation of a modified territorial tax system and a repatriation tax on deemed repatriated earnings of foreign subsidiaries. We calculated a provisional estimate of the impact from Tax Reform in our 2017 income tax provision in accordance with our interpretation of Tax Reform and guidance available as of the date of this filing. As a result, we recorded an estimated $5.5 billion net charge to income tax expense in the fourth quarter of 2017, the period in which Tax Reform was enacted. This amount includes: i) a provisional $308 million deferred tax benefit related to the re-measurement of certain deferred tax assets and liabilities, based on the revised rates at which they are expected to reverse in the future, and ii) a provisional $5.8 billion charge related to the transition tax on the mandatory deemed repatriation of accumulated foreign earnings determined as of December 31, 2017. The provisional transition tax charge includes federal (net of certain offsetting adjustments related to unrecognized tax benefits), state and local, and foreign withholding tax on the accumulated foreign earnings, which are no longer considered indefinitely reinvested as of December 31, 2017. In accordance with the SEC SAB 118, we have determined that the $308 million of the deferred tax benefit recorded in connection with the re-measurement of certain deferred tax assets and liabilities and the $5.8 billion of current tax expense recorded in connection with the transition tax on the mandatory deemed repatriation of foreign earnings are provisional and subject to further adjustment during the measurement period (not to exceed one year from the enactment of Tax Reform). Given the complexity of Tax Reform, we may be refining our estimates of these provisional amounts as further guidance is issued from the U.S. Treasury, the SEC and the FASB. Additionally, we are continuing to evaluate the accounting policy election required with regard to the tax on Global Intangible Low-Taxed Income (the Global Minimum Tax). The FASB allows companies to adopt a policy election to account for the Global Minimum Tax under one of two methods: (i) account for the Global Minimum Tax as a component of tax expense in the period in which a company is subject to the rules (the period cost method), or (ii) account for the Global Minimum Tax in a company’s measurement of deferred taxes (the deferred method). We have not elected a method and will only do so after our completion of the analysis of the Global Minimum Tax provisions. Our election method will depend, in part, on analyzing expected future U.S. taxable income inclusions related to Global Minimum Tax under both methodologies in order to determine the most appropriate method. Should we decide to elect the deferred method of accounting for the Global Minimum Tax, it is possible that our provisional estimate for re-measuring our deferred taxes may materially change. We will finalize the analysis for the accounting policy election during the measurement period.We record liabilities related to unrecognized tax benefits in accordance with the guidance that clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in an enterprise’s financial statements by prescribing a minimum recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. An adverse resolution of one or more of these uncertain tax positions in any period could have a material impact on the results of operations for that period.56Of the total unrecognized tax benefits, $1.8 billion at both December 31, 2017 and 2016, if recognized, would reduce our effective tax rate in the period of recognition. As of December 31, 2017, we believe that it is reasonably possible that our unrecognized tax benefits will decrease by approximately $800 million in the next 12 months due to potential settlement of tax examinations and lapse of statute of limitations. We file federal, state and foreign income tax returns in the United States and in many foreign jurisdictions. For federal and California income tax purposes, the statute of limitations is open for 2010 and onwards. For certain acquired entities, the statute of limitations is open for all years from inception due to our utilization of their net operating losses and credits carried over from prior years.Our income tax returns are subject to audit by federal, state and foreign tax authorities. We are currently under examination by the IRS for the tax years from 2010 to 2014 and by various state and foreign jurisdictions. There are differing interpretations of tax laws and regulations and, as a result, significant disputes may arise with these tax authorities involving issues of the timing and amount of deductions and allocations of income among various tax jurisdictions. We periodically evaluate our exposures associated with our tax filing positions.See Note 17, Income Taxes of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information.Off Balance Sheet ArrangementsWe do not have any off balance sheet arrangements as defined in Item 303(a)(4)(ii) of Regulation S-K.Contractual ObligationsOur contractual obligations consist of debt obligations, operating leases, capital commitments, purchase obligations for active pharmaceutical ingredients and inventory-related items and clinical trials contracts. The following table summarizes our significant enforceable and legally binding obligations, future commitments and obligations related to all contracts that we are likely to continue regardless of the fact that certain of these obligations may be cancelable as of December 31, 2017 (in millions): Payments due by PeriodContractual Obligations Total Less than oneyear 1-3 years 3-5 years More than 5yearsDebt (1) $49,524 $3,900 $8,676 $7,701 $29,247Operating lease obligations 519 77 132 95 215Capital commitments (2) 535 450 85 — —Purchase obligations (3)(4) 1,746 1,256 286 104 100Clinical trials (5) 2,356 1,079 802 293 182Transition Tax Payable (6) 6,084 487 1,460 1,460 2,677Total (7) $60,764 $7,249 $11,441 $9,653 $32,421_______________________ Notes:(1) Debt primarily consisted of senior unsecured notes and term loan facilities, including principal and interest payments. Interest payments for our fixed rate senior unsecured notes are incurred and calculated based on terms of the related notes. Interest payments for our variable rate debt are calculated based on the interest rates on the last reset date in 2017 for each debt instrument. See Note 11, Debt and Credit Facilities of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information. (2) Amounts include firm capital project commitments primarily relating to construction of new buildings. (3) Amounts include firm purchase commitments primarily relating to active pharmaceutical ingredients and certain inventory-related items. These amounts include minimum purchase requirements. (4) In addition to the above, we have committed to make potential future milestone payments to third parties as part of licensing, collaboration and development arrangements. Payments under these agreements generally become due and payable only upon achievement of certain developmental, regulatory and/or commercial milestones. Because the achievement of these milestones is neither probable nor reasonably estimable, such contingencies have not been recorded on our Consolidated Balance Sheets and have not been included in the table above. (5) At December 31, 2017, we had several clinical studies in various clinical trial phases. Our most significant clinical trial expenditures are to contract research organizations (CROs). Although all of our material contracts with CROs are cancelable, we historically have not canceled such contracts. These amounts reflect commitments based on existing contracts and do not reflect any future modifications to, or terminations of, existing contracts or anticipated or potential new contracts.(6) In connection with Tax Reform, as of December 31, 2017, we recorded a federal income tax payable of $6.1 billion of transition tax on the mandatory deemed repatriation of foreign earnings. The amounts included in the table above represent the federal income tax payable of $6.1 billion of the transition tax that will be payable over an eight year period. Amounts associated with Tax Reform are considered provisional and may be subject to further adjustment during the measurement period. See Note 17, Income Taxes of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional details on Tax Reform. 57(7) As of December 31, 2017, our long-term income taxes payable include unrecognized tax benefits, interest and penalties totaling $1.2 billion. Due to the high degree of uncertainty on the timing of future cash settlement and other events that could extinguish these unrecognized tax benefits, we are unable to estimate the period of cash settlement and therefore we have excluded these unrecognized tax benefits from the table above.Recent Accounting PronouncementsThe information required by this item is included in Note 1, Organization and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.ITEM 7A.QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISKWe are exposed to market risks that may result from changes in foreign currency exchange rates, interest rates, credit risks and market price. To reduce certain of these risks, we enter into various types of foreign currency or interest rate derivative hedging transactions, follow investment guidelines and monitor outstanding receivables as part of our risk management program.Foreign Currency Exchange Risk Our operations include manufacturing and sales activities in the United States, Canada and Ireland as well as sales activities in countries outside the United States, including Europe and Asia Pacific. As a result, our financial results could be significantly affected by factors such as changes in foreign currency exchange rates or weak economic conditions in the foreign markets in which we distribute our products. Our operating results are exposed to changes in foreign currency exchange rates between the U.S. dollar and various foreign currencies, the most significant of which is the Euro. When the U.S. dollar strengthens against these currencies, the relative value of sales made in the respective foreign currency decreases. Conversely, when the U.S. dollar weakens against these currencies, the relative amounts of such sales increase. Overall, we are a net receiver of foreign currencies and, therefore, benefit from a weaker U.S. dollar and are adversely affected by a stronger U.S. dollar relative to those foreign currencies in which we transact significant amounts of business. Approximately 29% of our product sales were denominated in foreign currencies during 2017. To partially mitigate the impact of changes in currency exchange rates on net cash flows from our foreign currency denominated sales, we may enter into foreign currency exchange forward and option contracts. We also hedge certain monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies, which reduces but does not eliminate our exposure to currency fluctuations between the date a transaction is recorded and the date that cash is collected or paid. In general, the market risks of these contracts are offset by corresponding gains and losses on the transactions being hedged. As of December 31, 2017 and 2016, we had open foreign currency forward contracts with notional amounts of $2.8 billion and $6.2 billion, respectively. A hypothetical 10% adverse movement in foreign currency exchange rates compared with the U.S. dollar relative to exchange rates at December 31, 2017 would have resulted in a reduction in fair value of these contracts of approximately $285 million on this date and, if realized, would negatively affect earnings over the remaining life of the contracts. The same hypothetical movement in foreign currency exchange rates compared with the U.S. dollar relative to exchange rates at December 31, 2016, would have resulted in a reduction in fair value of these contracts of approximately $583 million on this date and, if realized, would negatively affect earnings over the remaining life of the contracts. The analysis does not consider the impact that hypothetical changes in foreign currency exchange rates would have on anticipated transactions that these foreign currency sensitive instruments were designed to offset.Interest Rate Risk Our portfolio of available-for-sale marketable securities and our fixed and variable rate liabilities create an exposure to interest rate risk. With respect to our investment portfolio, we adhere to an investment policy that requires us to limit amounts invested in securities based on credit rating, maturity, industry group and investment type and issuer, except for securities issued by the U.S. government. The goals of our investment policy, in order of priority, are as follows: • safety and preservation of principal and diversification of risk; • liquidity of investments sufficient to meet cash flow requirements; and • competitive after-tax rate of return. 58The following table summarizes the expected maturities and average interest rates of our interest-generating assets and interest-bearing liabilities at December 31, 2017 (in millions, except percentages): Expected Maturity Total Fair Value 2018 2019 2020 2021 2022 Thereafter Total Assets Available-for-sale debt securities$18,403 $8,577 $1,957 $488 $29 $133 $29,587 $29,587Average interest rate1.73% 2.07% 1.94% 2.17% 2.10% 2.33% Liabilities Long-term debt, including current portion(1): Fixed rate$1,000 $1,500 $2,500 $2,250 $1,500 $18,500 $27,250 $29,021Average interest rate1.85% 1.92% 2.51% 4.44% 2.82% 4.09% Variable rate(2)$1,750 $1,312 $1,250 $250 $1,938 $— $6,500 $6,500Average interest rate(3)2.04% 1.88% 2.46% 2.34% 2.34% _______________________ Notes:(1) Amounts represent principal balances. In addition to these fixed and variable rate long-term debt, we have a $2.5 billion five-year revolving credit facility. There were no amounts outstanding under the five-year revolving credit facility as of December 31, 2017. See Note 11, Debt and Credit Facilities of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information.(2) Our $2.5 billion principal amount five-year senior unsecured term loan facility issued in October 2017 will be payable in quarterly amounts equal to 2.5% of the initial principal amount on each fiscal quarter end date starting in the fourth quarter of 2019, with any remaining balance due and payable at maturity.(3) Average interest rates for our variable rate debt were based on the interest rates on the last reset date in 2017 for each debt instrument and are dependent upon several factors subject to change, including but not limited to LIBOR, the principal amount of debt outstanding and credit ratings on each reset date.Credit RiskWe are subject to credit risk from our portfolio of cash equivalents and marketable securities. Under our investment policy, we limit amounts invested in such securities by credit rating, maturity, industry group, investment type and issuer, except for securities issued by the U.S. government. We are not exposed to any significant concentrations of credit risk from these financial instruments. The goals of our investment policy, in order of priority, are as follows: safety and preservation of principal and diversification of risk; liquidity of investments sufficient to meet cash flow requirements; and a competitive after-tax rate of return. We are also subject to credit risk from our accounts receivable related to our product sales. The majority of our trade accounts receivable arises from product sales in the United States and Europe. As of December 31, 2017, our accounts receivable, net, in Southern Europe, specifically Greece, Italy, Portugal and Spain, totaled approximately $326 million, of which $131 million were greater than 120 days past due, including $52 million greater than 365 days past due. As of December 31, 2016, our accounts receivable, net, in Southern Europe, specifically Greece, Italy, Portugal and Spain, totaled approximately $317 million, of which $110 million were greater than 120 days past due, including $45 million greater than 365 days past due. To date, we have not experienced significant losses with respect to the collection of our accounts receivable.Market Price Risk We hold 6.8 million shares of common stock of Galapagos, a clinical-stage biotechnology company based in Belgium, in connection with a license and collaboration agreement entered into with Galapagos. This equity security was classified as an available-for-sale security, the fair value of which was approximately $635 million and $428 million as of December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively. The year-over-year increase was due to an increase in the common stock price of Galapagos. This available-for-sale equity security is subject to potential changes in fair value due to the volatility of the stock market and changes in general economic conditions, among other factors. A hypothetical 20% decrease in the stock price of this investment would decrease its fair value at December 31, 2017 by approximately $127 million. We monitor this investment for an other than temporary decline in fair value and would record an impairment loss to income when an other than temporary decline in fair value occurs.59",2023-12-30 19:04:30.659505

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS The following Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (MD&A) is intended to help the reader understand our results of operations and financial condition. MD&A is provided as a supplement to, and should be read in conjunction with, our audited Consolidated Financial Statements and the accompanying Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements and other disclosures included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K (including the disclosures under Part I, Item 1A, “Risk Factors”). Our Consolidated Financial Statements have been prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles and are presented in U.S. dollars. Management OverviewGilead Sciences, Inc. (Gilead, we, our or us), incorporated in Delaware on June 22, 1987, is a research-based biopharmaceutical company that discovers, develops and commercializes innovative medicines in areas of unmet medical need. With each new discovery and investigational drug candidate, we strive to transform and simplify care for people with life-threatening illnesses around the world. We have operations in more than 35 countries worldwide, with headquarters in Foster City, California. Gilead’s primary areas of focus include HIV/AIDS, liver diseases, hematology/oncology and inflammation/respiratory diseases. We seek to add to our existing portfolio of products through our internal discovery and clinical development programs, product acquisition, in-licensing and strategic collaborations.Our portfolio of marketed products includes AmBisome®, Atripla®, Biktarvy®, Cayston®, Complera®/Eviplera®, Descovy®, Emtriva®, Epclusa®, Genvoya®, Harvoni®, Hepsera®, Letairis®, Odefsey®, Ranexa®, Sovaldi®, Stribild®, Truvada®, Tybost®, Vemlidy®, Viread®, Vosevi®, Yescarta® and Zydelig®. We also sell and distribute certain products through our corporate partners under collaborative agreements.2018 Business Highlights2018 was marked by operational excellence and transition as we positioned ourselves for the future growth of our business. We continued to develop and deliver innovative medicines to help people with life-threatening illnesses around the world. Highlights of our 2018 performance include:•HIV: We achieved record sales of our HIV products in 2018, with HIV product revenues increasing by 19% in the United States and 12% worldwide compared to 2017. This growth was driven by the successful launch of Biktarvy and the continued strong uptake of our single tablet regimens containing tenofovir alafenamide (TAF) for the treatment of HIV infection as well as Truvada for a pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) indication for HIV prevention. Biktarvy, a once-daily single tablet regimen containing bictegravir, emtricitabine (FTC) and TAF for the treatment of HIV infection in adults, was approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in February and by the European Commission in June. •Liver Diseases: Our revenues from our chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV) products became more predictable in 2018. Because we wanted to introduce a lower-priced alternative to our HCV products without significant disruption to the healthcare system and our business, we authorized the launch of generic versions of Epclusa and Harvoni in the United States starting in January 2019 through our separate subsidiary, Asegua Therapeutics LLC (Asegua). We also continued to advance our clinical trials for the treatment of chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV) and nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), including completing enrollment of Phase 3 clinical trials of NASH.•Cell Therapy and Immuno-Oncology: We advanced our pipeline of cancer therapies and positioned ourselves as a leader in cell therapy. Yescarta was approved by the European Commission in August for the treatment of relapsed or refractory diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) and primary mediastinal large B-cell lymphoma (PMBCL) after two or more lines of systemic therapy. We certified additional centers in the United States and Europe to provide treatment for Yescarta. In order to advance and accelerate research and development efforts in cell therapy and immuno-oncology, during the year, we entered into key strategic collaborations with the National Cancer Institute, Pfizer, Inc. (Pfizer), Sangamo Therapeutics, Inc. (Sangamo), Gadeta B.V. (Gadeta), HiFiBiO Therapeutics (HiFiBiO), Tango Therapeutics (Tango) and Agenus Inc. (Agenus).•Inflammation: We continued to advance our pipeline of novel investigational agents for inflammatory diseases, including announcing positive data on filgotinib in ongoing Phase 2 and 3 clinical trials. We also entered into a strategic collaboration with Verily Life Sciences LLC, an Alphabet company (Verily), using Verily’s Immunoscape platform to identify and better understand the immunological basis of inflammatory diseases.During the year, we continued to invest in and advance our research and development pipeline across our therapeutic areas. At the end of 2018, our research and development pipeline included 119 active clinical studies, of which 41 were Phase 3 clinical trials. Additionally, we completed 26 collaborations, partnerships and strategic investments in 2018, which reflects our commitment to enabling our access to new technologies and drug candidates with the potential to evolve care for people with life-threatening illnesses. Our investments in research and development reflect our commitment to expanding our pipeline across a range of diseases to address areas of significant unmet medical need and positioning ourselves for the long-term growth of our business.29Recent key announcements include: HIV and Liver Diseases Programs•FDA and European Commission granted marketing authorization for Biktarvy for the treatment of HIV-1 infection. •FDA approved Truvada - in combination with safer sex practices - to reduce the risk of sexually acquired HIV-1 in at-risk adolescents.•China National Drug Administration (CDA, succeeded by China National Medical Products Administration (NMPA)) approved Genvoya in China for the treatment of HIV-1 infection.•NMPA approved Descovy in China for the treatment of HIV-1 infection in adults and adolescents.•We entered into an agreement with Japan Tobacco Inc.

Milligan, Ph.D., stepped down from his role as President and Chief Executive Officer (CEO) effective December 31, 2018. Our Board announced the selection of Daniel O’Day to be our new Chairman and CEO effective March 1, 2019. Mr. O’Day brings more than 30 years of executive management, creative leadership and operational excellence. Most recently, Mr. O’Day served as the CEO of Roche Pharmaceuticals, the pharma division of Roche Group. We had other leadership transitions throughout the year resulting from planned successions and normal industry turnover.2018 Financial Highlights Total revenues decreased to $22.1 billion and total product sales decreased to $21.7 billion in 2018, compared to $26.1 billion and $25.7 billion in 2017, respectively, primarily due to lower sales of our HCV products, partially offset by higher sales of our HIV products. In the United States, product sales were $16.2 billion in 2018, compared to $18.1 billion in 2017. In Europe, product sales were $3.7 billion in 2018, compared to $5.0 billion in 2017. Product sales in other international locations were $1.8 billion in 2018, compared to $2.6 billion in 2017. Cost of goods sold increased to $4.9 billion in 2018, compared to $4.4 billion in 2017, primarily due to reserves for excess raw material inventory, and higher amortization related to intangible assets acquired in connection with our acquisition of Kite Pharma, Inc. (Kite). In 2018, inventory reserves of $440 million were recorded for excess raw materials primarily due to a sustained decrease in demand for Harvoni as a result of a shift in the market from Harvoni to Epclusa. Research and development (R&D) expenses increased to $5.0 billion in 2018, compared to $3.7 billion in 2017, primarily due to an $820 million impairment charge related to in-process R&D (IPR&D) for the KITE-585 program (an anti-BCMA being evaluated for the treatment of multiple myeloma), an increase in up-front collaboration expenses to further enhance our pipeline, a full year of investments to support the growth of our business following the acquisition of Kite and higher stock-based compensation expenses associated with the acquisition of Kite. Selling, general and administrative (SG&A) expenses increased to $4.1 billion for 2018, compared to $3.9 billion in 2017, primarily due to a full year of investments to support the growth of our business following the acquisition of Kite, partially offset by lower acquisition-related costs associated with the acquisition of Kite and lower branded prescription drug (BPD) fees.Net income attributable to Gilead was $5.5 billion or $4.17 per diluted share in 2018, compared to $4.6 billion or $3.51 per diluted share in 2017. The increase was primarily due to a $5.5 billion charge to income tax expense related to the enactment of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (Tax Reform) recorded in 2017 and higher HIV product sales in 2018, partially offset by lower HCV product sales and higher operating expenses associated with advancement of our pipeline and investments to support the growth of our business following the acquisition of Kite in 2018. As of December 31, 2018, we had $31.5 billion of cash, cash equivalents and marketable debt securities compared to $36.7 billion as of December 31, 2017. During 2018, we generated $8.4 billion in operating cash flow, repaid $6.3 billion of principal amount of debt, paid cash dividends of $3.0 billion and repurchased a total of 40 million shares for $2.9 billion through open market transactions.Outlook 2019In 2019, we expect to continue to maintain our strong focus on operational excellence and financial discipline. From an R&D perspective, we expect to continue to invest in new and ongoing clinical studies that support both our existing products and product candidates. We expect data read-outs in 2019 including selonsertib or STELLAR-3 for the treatment of NASH, filgotinib for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis, and Descovy for PrEP indication. In order to further augment our product pipeline, we continue to pursue opportunities for collaborations, partnerships and strategic investments that fit into our long term strategic plan.From a commercial perspective, we expect to continue to promote Biktarvy and other HIV regimens containing TAF. In addition, we believe Truvada for PrEP will continue to be an integral part of our growth in HIV in the United States as communities continue to embrace the public health benefits of prevention. In HCV, we expect a decline in product sales as a result of lower patient starts across all markets and competitive factors, although at a lower rate than in 2018. We believe the launch of authorized generic versions of Epclusa and Harvoni in the United States through our separate subsidiary, Asegua, will increase access to the medications for patients at lower prices. In cell therapy, we expect to continue to promote Yescarta in the United States and support its launch in Europe.We will continue to help promote patient access to our products around the world, including through our Gilead Access Program, under which more than 11 million people receive our HIV medicines in low- and middle-income countries.31Our progress on all of these initiatives is subject to a number of uncertainties, including, but not limited to, the possibility of unfavorable results from new and ongoing clinical trials (for example, we recently announced that STELLAR-4, a Phase 3 study evaluating the safety and efficacy of selonsertib in patients with compensated cirrhosis due to NASH, did not meet the pre-specified week 48 primary endpoint); the continuation of an uncertain global macroeconomic environment; additional pricing pressures from payers and competitors; slower than anticipated growth in our HIV products; an increase in discounts, chargebacks and rebates due to ongoing contracts and future negotiations with commercial and government payers; market share and price erosion caused by the introduction of generic versions of products containing tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (TDF) outside the United States and Viread, Letairis and Ranexa in the United States; inaccuracies in our HCV patient start estimates; potential amendments to the Affordable Care Act or other government action that could have the effect of lowering prices; a larger-than-anticipated shift in payer mix to more highly discounted payer segment; and volatility in foreign currency exchange rates. 2018 Results of OperationsTotal Revenues The following table summarizes the period-over-period changes in our product sales and royalty, contract and other revenues:(In millions, except percentages) 2018 Change 2017 Change 2016Revenues: Product sales $21,677 (16)% $25,662 (14)% $29,953Royalty, contract and other revenues 450 1 % 445 2 % 437Total revenues $22,127 (15)% $26,107 (14)% $30,390On January 1, 2018, we adopted Accounting Standards Update No. 2014-09 “Revenue from Contracts with Customers” (Topic 606) using the modified retrospective method applied to those contracts which were not completed as of January 1, 2018. As such, results for 2018 are presented under Topic 606, while the information for prior periods has not been adjusted and continues to be reported in accordance with our historical accounting under Topic 605 “Revenue Recognition” (Topic 605). The impact as a result of applying Topic 606 in place of Topic 605 was not material for the year ended December 31, 2018. See Note 1, Organization and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, and Note 2, Revenues, of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for further information.Product Sales2018 Compared to 2017Total product sales decreased by 16% to $21.7 billion in 2018, compared to $25.7 billion in 2017, primarily due to lower sales of our HCV products, partially offset by increased sales of our HIV products.HIV product sales increased by 12% to $14.6 billion in 2018, compared to $13.0 billion in 2017, primarily due to the launch of Biktarvy in 2018 and the continued uptake of Descovy, Genvoya and Odefsey.HCV product sales decreased by 60% to $3.7 billion in 2018, compared to $9.1 billion in 2017, primarily due to lower average net selling price and lower sales volume across all major markets as a result of increased competition and lower patient starts. Yescarta generated $264 million in sales in 2018, compared to $7 million in sales in 2017.Other product sales, which include products from our HBV, cardiovascular, oncology and other categories inclusive of Vemlidy, Viread, Letairis, Ranexa, Zydelig and AmBisome, decreased by 12% to $3.1 billion in 2018, compared to $3.5 billion in 2017. Sales of Viread, which is primarily used for the treatment of chronic HBV infection, decreased due to the availability of generic versions of the product. Letairis is expected to face generic competition in the United States because the U.S. patent for ambrisentan, the active pharmaceutical ingredient in Letairis, expired in July 2018. Ranexa is also expected to face generic competition in the United States. We expect a decline in our Letairis and Ranexa sales in the United States after the generic entries.Of our total product sales, 25% were generated outside the United States in 2018. We faced exposure to movements in foreign currency exchange rates, primarily in the Euro. We used foreign currency exchange contracts to hedge a percentage of our foreign currency exposure. Foreign currency exchange, net of hedges, had a favorable impact on our product sales of $94 million in 2018, compared to 2017.We record product sales net of estimated mandatory and supplemental discounts to government payers, in addition to discounts to private payers, including rebates, chargebacks, cash discounts for prompt payment, distributor fees and other related costs. These deductions are generally referred to as gross-to-net deductions, which totaled $16.5 billion, or 43% of gross product sales in 2018, compared to $17.2 billion, or 40% of gross products sales in 2017. Of the $16.5 billion in 2018, $14.8 billion or 39% of 32gross product sales was related to government and other rebates and chargebacks, and $1.7 billion was related to cash discounts for prompt payment, distributor fees and other related costs.Product sales in the United States decreased by 11% to $16.2 billion in 2018, compared to $18.1 billion in 2017. The decrease was primarily due to lower sales of our HCV products, partially offset by higher sales of our HIV products. The decrease in sales of our HCV products was primarily due to lower average net selling price and lower sales volume as a result of increased competition. The increase in the sales of our HIV products was primarily due to the launch of Biktarvy in 2018, the continued uptake of Descovy, Genvoya and Odefsey, the increased usage of Truvada for PrEP and higher average net selling price, partially offset by the decreases in sales volume of Atripla, Complera and Stribild. Product sales in Europe decreased by 26% to $3.7 billion in 2018, compared to $5.0 billion in 2017. The decrease was primarily due to lower sales of our HCV products and the availability of generic versions of Truvada, Atripla and Viread. The decrease in sales of our HCV products was primarily due to lower sales volume and average net selling price as a result of increased competition. The decrease was partially offset by our launch of Biktarvy in 2018 and the continued uptake of Descovy, Genvoya and Odefsey. Foreign currency exchange, net of hedges, had a favorable impact on our product sales in Europe of $68 million in 2018, compared to 2017.Product sales in other international locations decreased by 30% to $1.8 billion in 2018, compared to $2.6 billion in 2017, primarily due to lower sales of our HCV products in Japan. Sales of our HCV products in Japan decreased to $167 million for 2018, compared to $692 million in 2017, primarily due to lower market share as a result of increased competition.2017 Compared to 2016Total product sales decreased by 14% to $25.7 billion in 2017, compared to $30.0 billion in 2016, primarily due to lower sales of our HCV products, partially offset by increased sales of our HIV products.HIV product sales increased by 11% to $13.0 billion in 2017, compared to $11.7 billion in 2016, primarily driven by the continued uptake of Descovy, Genvoya and Odefsey, partially offset by decreases in sales of Truvada, Atripla, Complera and Stribild. HCV product sales decreased by 38% to $9.1 billion in 2017, compared to $14.8 billion in 2016, primarily due to declines across all major markets as a result of increased competition and lower total market patient starts.Other product sales, which include products from our HBV, cardiovascular, oncology and other categories inclusive of Vemlidy, Viread, Letairis, Ranexa, Zydelig and AmBisome, increased by 2% to $3.5 billion in 2017, compared to $3.4 billion in 2016.Of our total product sales, 29% were generated outside the United States in 2017. We faced exposure to movements in foreign currency exchange rates, primarily in the Euro. We used foreign currency exchange contracts to hedge a percentage of our foreign currency exposure. Foreign currency exchange, net of hedges, had an unfavorable impact on our product sales of $117 million in 2017, compared to 2016.Our gross-to-net deductions totaled $17.2 billion, or 40% of gross product sales in 2017, compared to $20.3 billion, or 40% of gross products sales in 2016. Of the $17.2 billion in 2017, $15.5 billion or 36% of gross product sales was related to government and other rebates and chargebacks, and $1.7 billion was related to cash discounts for prompt payment, distributor fees and other related costs.Product sales in the United States decreased by 6% to $18.1 billion in 2017, compared to $19.3 billion in 2016. The declines in sales of our HCV products was partially offset by the increase in sales of our HIV products. The declines in sales of our HCV products was primarily due to lower Harvoni and Sovaldi sales volume as a result of increased competition and lower total market patient starts. Additionally, increases in Epclusa and Vosevi sales volume were partially offset by lower average net selling price for Epclusa as pricing of all regimens has gravitated towards the 8-week regimen price. The increase in the sales of our HIV products was primarily due to the continued uptake of Descovy, Genvoya and Odefsey and higher average net selling prices, partially offset by decreases of Truvada, Atripla, Complera and Stribild and the prior year favorable impact of a revision to our rebate reserves of $332 million, primarily related to Truvada, Atripla, Complera and Stribild. Product sales in Europe decreased by 18% to $5.0 billion in 2017, compared to $6.1 billion in 2016, primarily due to lower Harvoni and Sovaldi sales volume, partially offset by higher Epclusa sales volume. Foreign currency exchange, net of hedges, had an unfavorable impact on our product sales in Europe of $89 million in 2017 compared to 2016.Product sales in other international locations decreased by 45% to $2.6 billion in 2017, compared to $4.6 billion in 2016, primarily due to lower sales in Japan. Sales of our HCV products in Japan decreased to $692 million in 2017, compared to $2.5 billion in 2016, primarily due to lower sales volume as a result of lower total market patient starts and increased competition. 33The following table summarizes the period-over-period changes in our product sales:(In millions, except percentages) 2018 Change 2017 Change 2016Atripla $1,206 (33)% $1,806 (31)% $2,605Biktarvy 1,184 * — * —Complera/Eviplera 653 (32)% 966 (34)% 1,457Descovy 1,581 30 % 1,218 * 298Genvoya 4,624 26 % 3,674 * 1,484Odefsey 1,598 44 % 1,106 * 329Stribild 644 (39)% 1,053 (45)% 1,914Truvada 2,997 (4)% 3,134 (12)% 3,566Other HIV(1) 61 5 % 58 23 % 47Revenue share - Symtuza(2) 79 * — * —Total HIV 14,627 12 % 13,015 11 % 11,700AmBisome 420 15 % 366 3 % 356Epclusa 1,966 (44)% 3,510 100 % 1,752Harvoni 1,222 (72)% 4,370 (52)% 9,081Letairis 943 6 % 887 8 % 819Ranexa 758 6 % 717 6 % 677Vemlidy 321 * 122 * 3Viread 307 (71)% 1,046 (12)% 1,186Vosevi 396 35 % 293 * —Yescarta 264 * 7 * —Zydelig 133 (11)% 149 (11)% 168Other(3) 320 (73)% 1,180 (72)% 4,211Total product sales $21,677 (16)% $25,662 (14)% $29,953_______________________ Notes:* Percentage not meaningful(1) Includes Emtriva and Tybost (2) Represents our revenue from cobicistat (C), FTC and TAF in Symtuza® (darunavir/C/FTC/TAF), a fixed dose combination product commercialized by Janssen(3) Includes Cayston, Hepsera and SovaldiThe following is additional discussion of our results on certain products:•Descovy (FTC/TAF)-based products - Biktarvy, Descovy, Genvoya and OdefseyProduct sales of our Descovy (FTC/TAF)-based products were $9.0 billion, $6.0 billion and $2.1 billion, and were 41%, 23% and 7% of our total product sales in 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively. In 2018, sales of our Descovy (FTC/TAF)-based products were $7.2 billion in the United States and $1.5 billion in Europe, compared to $5.0 billion in the United States and $892 million in Europe in 2017 and $1.8 billion in the United States and $256 million in Europe in 2016. The increase in 2018 compared to 2017 in all major markets was primarily driven by higher sales volume reflecting our launch of Biktarvy in 2018 and the continued uptake of Genvoya, Odefsey and Descovy.The increase in 2017 compared to 2016 in all major markets was primarily driven by higher sales volume as patients shifted away from Truvada (FTC/TDF)-based regimens. •Truvada (FTC/TDF)-based products - Atripla, Complera/Eviplera, Stribild and TruvadaProduct sales of our Truvada (FTC/TDF)-based products were $5.5 billion, $7.0 billion and $9.5 billion, and were 25%, 27% and 32% of our total product sales in 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively. In 2018, sales of our Truvada (FTC/TDF)-based products were $4.4 billion in the United States and $815 million in Europe, compared to $4.8 billion in the United States and $1.7 billion in Europe in 2017 and $6.6 billion in the United States and $2.3 billion in Europe in 2016. 34In the United States, the decrease in 2018 compared to 2017 was primarily due to lower sales volume as a result of patients switching to newer regimens containing TAF, partially offset by the increased usage of Truvada for PrEP and higher average net selling price of certain of our Truvada (FTC/TDF)-based products. In Europe, the decrease in 2018 compared to 2017 was primarily due to lower sales volume as a result of the availability of generic versions of Truvada and Atripla and patients switching to newer regimens containing TAF.In the United States, the decrease in 2017 compared to 2016 was primarily due to lower sales volume as a result of patients switching to newer regimens containing TAF, partially offset by the increased usage of Truvada for PrEP. In Europe, the decreases in 2017 compared to 2016 was primarily due to lower sales volume as a result of the availability of generic versions of Truvada in several countries and patients switching to newer regimens containing TAF.•HCV products - Epclusa, Harvoni, Sovaldi and VoseviHCV product sales were $3.7 billion, $9.1 billion and $14.8 billion, and were 17%, 36% and 50% of our total product sales in 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively.In 2018, sales of our HCV products were $2.0 billion in the United States, $896 million in Europe and $767 million in other international locations. In 2017, sales of our HCV products were $5.9 billion in the United States, $1.9 billion in Europe and $1.4 billion in other international locations. In 2016, sales of our HCV products were $8.4 billion in the United States, $2.8 billion in Europe and $3.6 billion in other international locations. The decrease in 2018 compared to 2017 in all major markets was primarily due to lower sales volume and lower average net selling price as a result of increased competition and lower total market patient starts. Harvoni and Sovaldi product sales also decreased as a result of a shift in the market from Harvoni and Sovaldi to Epclusa. The decrease in 2017 compared to 2016 in all major markets was primarily due to lower sales volume and lower average net selling price as a result of increased competition and lower total market patient starts. Harvoni and Sovaldi product sales also decreased as a result of a shift in the market from Harvoni and Sovaldi to Epclusa. Epclusa product sales increased in 2017 compared to 2016 primarily due to a full year of sales. Epclusa was approved by FDA and European Commission in June and July 2016, respectively.Cost of Goods Sold and Product Gross MarginThe following table summarizes the period-over-period changes in our product sales, cost of goods sold and product gross margin: (In millions, except percentages) 2018 Change 2017 Change 2016Total product sales $21,677 (16)% $25,662 (14)% $29,953Cost of goods sold $4,853 11 % $4,371 3 % $4,261Product gross margin 78% 83% 86%Our cost of goods sold for 2018 increased by $482 million or 11%, compared to 2017, primarily due to higher inventory reserves. In 2018, we recorded inventory reserves of $572 million, of which $440 million was related to excess raw materials primarily due to a sustained decrease in demand for Harvoni as a result of a shift in the market from Harvoni to Epclusa. Inventory reserves recorded for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016 were not material. Cost of goods sold also increased due to a full year of amortization expense related to intangible assets acquired in connection with our acquisition of Kite in October 2017. The increases were partially offset by lower costs of efavirenz, a component of Atripla, as a result of the termination of a collaboration arrangement with Bristol-Myers Squibb Company on December 31, 2017.The decrease in our product gross margin in 2018 compared to 2017 was primarily due to the factors impacting cost of goods sold noted above and changes in product mix. The decrease in our product gross margin in 2017 compared to 2016 was primarily due to changes in product mix, as our HCV product sales decreased as a percentage of total product sales. Research and Development Expenses The following table summarizes the period-over-period changes in R&D expenses:(In millions, except percentages) 2018 Change 2017 Change 2016R&D expenses $5,018 34% $3,734 (27)% $5,098R&D expenses consist primarily of clinical studies performed by contract research organizations, materials and supplies, licenses and fees, up-front and milestone payments under collaboration agreements, personnel costs, including salaries, benefits and stock-based compensation and overhead allocations consisting of various support and facilities-related costs. 35We do not track total R&D expenses by product candidate, therapeutic area or development phase. However, we manage our R&D expenses by identifying the R&D activities we anticipate will be performed during a given period and then prioritizing efforts based on scientific data, probability of successful development, market potential, available human and capital resources and other considerations. We continually review our R&D pipeline and the status of development and, as necessary, reallocate resources among the R&D portfolio that we believe will best support the future growth of our business.The following table provides a breakout of R&D expenses by major cost type (in millions): 2018 2017 2016Clinical studies and outside services $1,665 $1,881 $2,446Personnel, infrastructure and other expenses 1,876 1,399 1,271IPR&D impairment charges 820 — 432Up-front collaboration expenses 278 — 373Acquired IPR&D — 222 400Stock-based compensation expenses 379 232 176Total $5,018 $3,734 $5,098In 2018, R&D expenses increased by $1.3 billion or 34%, compared to 2017, primarily due to an $820 million impairment charge related to the IPR&D for the KITE-585 program due to its discontinuance, an increase in up-front collaboration expenses and higher personnel and facilities-related costs to support the growth of our business following the acquisition of Kite, partially offset by higher acquired IPR&D expense in 2017 as a result of our purchase of Cell Design Labs, Inc.In 2017, R&D expenses decreased by $1.4 billion or 27%, compared to 2016, primarily due to the 2016 impacts of business development activities resulting in up-front collaboration expense related to our license and collaboration agreement with Galapagos NV and acquired IPR&D expense related to our purchase of Nimbus Apollo, Inc., IPR&D impairment charges and ongoing milestone payments, partially offset by acquired IPR&D expense related to our purchase of Cell Design Labs, Inc. in 2017.Selling, General and Administrative Expenses The following table summarizes the period-over-period changes in SG&A expenses:(In millions, except percentages) 2018 Change 2017 Change 2016SG&A expenses $4,056 5% $3,878 14% $3,398SG&A expenses relate to sales and marketing, finance, human resources, legal and other administrative activities. Expenses consist primarily of personnel costs, facilities and overhead costs, outside marketing, advertising and legal expenses and other general and administrative costs. SG&A expenses also include the BPD fee. In the United States, we, along with other pharmaceutical manufacturers of branded drug products, are required to pay a portion of the BPD fee, which is estimated based on select government sales during the prior year as a percentage of total industry government sales and is trued-up upon receipt of invoices from the Internal Revenue Service.In 2018, SG&A expenses increased by $178 million or 5%, compared to 2017, primarily due to a full year of expense to support the growth of our business following the acquisition of Kite, partially offset by lower acquisition-related costs associated with the acquisition of Kite and lower BPD fees.In 2017, SG&A expenses increased by $480 million or 14%, compared to 2016, primarily due to costs associated with our acquisition of Kite, which primarily consist of stock-based compensation and transaction costs, as well as higher BPD fee expenses resulting from a favorable adjustment of $191 million in the first quarter of 2016.BPD fee expenses were $229 million, $385 million and $270 million in 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively. BPD fee expenses are not tax-deductible. Other Income (Expense), Net Other income (expense), net, was $676 million, $523 million and $428 million in 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively. The increase in 2018 compared to 2017 was primarily due to unrealized gains from changes in the fair value of our marketable equity securities. Starting in January 2018, we recorded unrealized gains (losses) from changes in the fair value of our marketable equity securities in Other income (expense), net, on our Consolidated Statements of Income as a result of the adoption of Accounting Standards Update No. 2016-01 “Financial Instruments-Overall: Recognition and Measurement of Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities”. See Note 1, Organization and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for further information.36The increase in other income (expense), net, in 2017 compared to 2016 was primarily due to our cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities earning a higher yield and higher cash balances.Provision for Income Taxes Provision for income taxes was $2.3 billion in 2018 compared to $8.9 billion in 2017. The 2018 effective tax rate decreased to 30.0% from the 2017 effective tax rate of 65.7%, primarily due to a $5.5 billion net tax charge in 2017 and a reduction to the U.S. corporate tax rate in 2018 as a result of the enactment of Tax Reform in December 2017. In addition, the 2018 effective tax rate was further decreased due to a $202 million tax benefit recorded in 2018 related to settlement of tax examinations, offset by a $588 million deferred tax charge in 2018 resulting from a transfer of acquired intangible assets between wholly owned subsidiaries, changes to the geographic mix of earnings and the tax on Global Intangible Low-Taxed Income (enacted as part of Tax Reform). We are continuing to evaluate certain changes to our legal entity structure in response to guidelines and requirements in various international tax jurisdictions where we conduct business. These changes may take multiple reporting periods to implement and may result in certain material, but non-recurring, adjustments to our deferred tax assets and/or liabilities, which will cause an offsetting increase or decrease to our tax provision. Estimates of these adjustments cannot be reasonably determined at this time and are dependent on the changes actually implemented.Our provision for income taxes was $8.9 billion in 2017 compared to $3.6 billion in 2016. The 2017 effective tax rate increased to 65.7% from the 2016 effective tax rate of 21.1%, primarily due to the enactment of Tax Reform in December 2017. Changes to the geographic mix of earnings also contributed to the increase in the 2017 effective tax rate.See Note 18, Income Taxes of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional details on Tax Reform.Liquidity and Capital Resources The following table summarizes our cash, cash equivalents, and marketable debt securities and working capital (in millions): December 31, 2018 2017Cash, cash equivalents and marketable debt securities $31,512 $36,694Working capital $25,231 $20,188Cash, Cash Equivalents and Marketable debt Securities Cash, cash equivalents and marketable debt securities decreased by $5.2 billion, or 14%, compared to December 31, 2017. During 2018, we generated $8.4 billion in operating cash flow, repaid $1.8 billion principal amount of senior unsecured notes at maturity, repaid $4.5 billion of term loans borrowed in connection with our acquisition of Kite, paid cash dividends of $3.0 billion and utilized $2.9 billion on stock repurchases.Working Capital Working capital increased by $5.0 billion, or 25%, compared to December 31, 2017, primarily driven by an increase in cash and cash equivalents resulting from a shift in the average remaining term to maturity of our marketable debt securities portfolio to reduce interest rate risk.Cash FlowsThe following table summarizes our cash flow activities (in millions): 2018 2017 2016Cash provided by (used in): Operating activities $8,400 $11,898 $17,047Investing activities $14,355 $(16,069) $(11,985)Financing activities $(12,318) $3,393 $(9,725)Cash Provided by Operating Activities Cash provided by operating activities represents the cash receipts and disbursements related to all of our activities other than investing and financing activities. Operating cash flow is derived by adjusting our net income for non-cash items and changes in operating assets and liabilities. Cash provided by operating activities decreased by $3.5 billion to $8.4 billion in 2018 compared to 2017, primarily due to lower cash receipts as a result of lower product sales and higher tax payments. The tax payments made 37in 2018 included a $500 million payment related to the first annual installment of the Tax Reform transition tax, a $771 million deemed early payment of the Tax Reform transition tax and a $514 million settlement of a tax examination.Cash provided by operating activities decreased by $5.1 billion to $11.9 billion in 2017 compared to 2016, primarily due to lower cash receipts as a result of lower product sales and higher tax payments. Cash Provided by (Used in) Investing Activities Cash provided by (used in) investing activities primarily consists of purchases, sales and maturities of our marketable debt securities, capital expenditures, acquisitions (net of cash acquired) and other investments. Cash provided by investing activities was $14.4 billion in 2018 compared to cash used in investing activities of $16.1 billion in 2017. The change in cash provided by (used in) investing activities was primarily due to higher proceeds from maturities of our marketable debt securities and lower purchases of marketable debt securities, partially offset by lower proceeds from sales of our marketable debt securities. In addition, $10.4 billion cash was used to acquire Kite in 2017, whereas no cash was used for acquisitions in 2018.Cash used in investing activities increased by $4.1 billion to $16.1 billion in 2017 compared to 2016, primarily due to our acquisition of Kite, partially offset by higher proceeds from maturities and sales of marketable debt securities and lower purchases of marketable debt securities.Cash Provided by (Used in) Financing Activities Cash used in financing activities was $12.3 billion in 2018, compared to cash provided by financing activities of $3.4 billion in 2017. The change in cash provided by (used in) financing activities was primarily due to higher repayment of debt and repurchases of our common stock in 2018. In addition, we had $9.0 billion net proceeds from debt issuances to partially fund our acquisition of Kite in 2017, whereas no debt was issued in 2018. Cash provided by financing activities was $3.4 billion in 2017, compared to cash used in financing activities of $9.7 billion in 2016, primarily due to lower repurchases of our common stock and higher proceeds from the issuances of debt. Debt and Credit FacilitiesLong-Term ObligationsThe summary of our borrowings under various financing arrangements is included in Note 12, Debt and Credit Facilities of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of our Annual Report on Form 10-K.Senior Unsecured NotesIn 2018, we repaid at maturity $1.0 billion principal amount of senior unsecured notes that were issued in September 2015 and $750 million of principal amount of senior unsecured notes that were issued in September 2017.In 2017, in connection with our acquisition of Kite, we issued $3.0 billion aggregate principal amount of senior unsecured notes consisting of $750 million principal amount of floating rate notes due September 2018, $750 million principal amount of floating rate notes due March 2019, and $500 million principal amount of floating rate notes due September 2019 (collectively, the Floating Rate Notes) and $1.0 billion principal amount of 1.85% senior notes due September 2019 (the Fixed Rate Notes, and collectively with the Floating Rate Notes, the 2017 Notes). The Floating Rate Notes bear interest rates equal to three month London Interbank Offered Rates (LIBOR), plus 0.17% with respect to the Floating Rate Notes due September 2018, 0.22% with respect to the Floating Rate Notes due March 2019 and 0.25% with respect to the Floating Rate Notes due September 2019. The Fixed Rate Notes pay interest semiannually and the Floating Rate Notes pay interest quarterly. We are required to comply with certain covenants under our notes indentures and as of December 31, 2018, we were not in violation of any covenants.Term Loan FacilitiesIn September 2017, we entered into a $6.0 billion aggregate principal amount term loan facility credit agreement consisting of a $1.0 billion principal amount 364-day senior unsecured term loan facility, a $2.5 billion principal amount three-year senior unsecured term loan facility and a $2.5 billion principal amount five-year senior unsecured term loan facility (collectively, the Term Loan Facilities). In October 2017, we drew $6.0 billion aggregate principal amount on the Term Loan Facilities and used the proceeds to finance our acquisition of Kite, of which $1.5 billion was repaid in 2017 and the remaining $4.5 billion was repaid in 2018. The term loan facility credit agreement was terminated in 2018. 38Credit FacilitiesIn 2016, we entered into a $2.5 billion five-year revolving credit facility maturing in May 2021 (the Five-Year Revolving Credit Agreement). The revolving credit facility can be used for working capital requirements and for general corporate purposes, including, without limitation, acquisitions. We are required to comply with certain covenants under the Five-Year Revolving Credit Agreement and as of December 31, 2018, we were not in violation of any covenants, and no amounts were outstanding under the Five-Year Revolving Credit Agreement.Capital Return ProgramThe details of our Stock Repurchase Programs and Dividends are included in Note 14, Stockholders’ Equity of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information. Stock Repurchase ProgramsIn the first quarter of 2016, our Board of Directors authorized a $12.0 billion stock repurchase program (2016 Program), under which repurchases may be made in the open market or in privately negotiated transactions. We started repurchases under the 2016 Program in April 2016. Repurchases under the 2016 Program were 40 million and 13 million shares of our common stock for $2.9 billion and $954 million in 2018 and 2017, respectively. As of December 31, 2018, the remaining authorized repurchase amount under the 2016 Program was $5.1 billion.DividendsWe declared and paid quarterly cash dividends for an aggregate amount of $3.0 billion or $2.28 per common share and $2.7 billion or $2.08 per common share in 2018 and 2017, respectively. On February 4, 2019, we announced that our Board of Directors declared a quarterly cash dividend increase of 11% from $0.57 to $0.63 per share of our common stock, with a payment date of March 28, 2019 to all stockholders of record as of the close of business on March 15, 2019. Future dividends are subject to declaration by the Board of Directors.Capital ResourcesWe believe our existing capital resources, supplemented by cash flows generated from our operations, will be adequate to satisfy our capital needs for the foreseeable future. Our future capital requirements will depend on many factors, including but not limited to the following: •the commercial performance of our current and future products; •the progress and scope of our R&D efforts, including preclinical studies and clinical trials; •the cost, timing and outcome of regulatory reviews; •the expansion of our sales and marketing capabilities; •the possibility of acquiring additional manufacturing capabilities or office facilities; •the possibility of acquiring other companies or new products;•debt service requirements;•the establishment of additional collaborative relationships with other companies; and •costs associated with the defense, settlement and adverse results of government investigations and litigation We may in the future require additional funding, which could be in the form of proceeds from equity or debt financings. If such funding is required, we cannot guarantee that it will be available to us on favorable terms, if at all. Critical Accounting Policies, Estimates and JudgmentsThe discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based on our Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, which have been prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses and related disclosures. On an ongoing basis, we evaluate and base our estimates on historical experience and on various other market specific and other relevant assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ significantly from these estimates. 39We believe the following critical accounting policies reflect the more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our Consolidated Financial Statements. Revenue Recognition Adoption of ASC Topic 606, “Revenue from Contracts with Customers”On January 1, 2018, we adopted Topic 606 using the modified retrospective method whereby results for reporting periods beginning after January 1, 2018 are presented under Topic 606, while prior period amounts are not adjusted and continue to be reported in accordance with our historical accounting under Topic 605. Under Topic 606, an entity recognizes revenue when it transfers control of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. We recorded the cumulative effect of applying the new revenue standard as a net increase of $190 million to the opening balance of retained earnings. The impact as a result of applying Topic 606 in place of Topic 605 was not material for the year ended December 31, 2018.Product Sales We recognize revenue from product sales when control of the product transfers, generally upon shipment or delivery, to the customer, or in certain cases, upon the corresponding sales by our customer to a third party. We record product sales net of estimated mandatory and supplemental discounts to government and private payers, in addition to discounts to private payers, and other related charges. These are generally accounted for as variable consideration estimated in the same period the related sales occur. Government and other rebates and chargebacks represent the majority of our variable consideration and require complex and significant judgment by management. Estimates are assessed each period and updated to reflect current information. Government and Other Rebates and ChargebacksGovernment and other rebates and chargebacks include amounts paid to payers and healthcare providers in the United States, including Medicaid rebates, AIDS Drug Assistance Program rebates and chargebacks, Veterans Administration and Public Health Service chargebacks and other rebates, as well as foreign government rebates. Rebates and chargebacks are based on contractual arrangements or statutory requirements which may vary by product, by payer and individual payer plans.For qualified programs that can purchase our products through wholesalers or other distributors at a lower contractual price, the wholesalers or distributors charge back to us the difference between their acquisition cost and the lower contractual price. Our allowances for government and other rebates and chargebacks are estimated based on products sold, historical payer mix, pertinent third-party industry information, estimated patient population, known market events or trends, channel inventory data and/or other market data. We also consider new information regarding changes in programs’ regulations and guidelines that would impact the amount of the actual rebates and/or our expectations regarding future payer mix for these programs. We believe the methodology that we use to estimate our government and other rebates and chargebacks is reasonable and appropriate given the current facts and circumstances. However, actual results may differ significantly from our estimates. Historically, our actual government rebates and chargebacks claimed for prior periods have varied by less than 5% from our estimates.Government and other chargebacks that are payable to our direct customers are classified as reductions of Accounts receivable on our Consolidated Balance Sheets and totaled $492 million and $340 million at December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively. Government and other rebates that are invoiced directly to us are recorded in Accrued government and other rebates on our Consolidated Balance Sheets and totaled $3.9 billion and $4.7 billion at December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively. The following table summarizes the consolidated activities and ending balances in our government and other rebates and chargebacks accounts (in millions):Accrued government and other rebates and chargebacks: Balance at Beginning of Year Decrease/(Increase) to Product Sales Payments Balance at End of YearYear ended December 31, 2018: Activity related to 2018 sales $— $14,784 $(10,953) $3,831Activity related to sales prior to 2018 5,044 41 (4,496) 589Total $5,044 $14,825 $(15,449) $4,420Year ended December 31, 2017: Activity related to 2017 sales $— $15,809 $(11,170) $4,639Activity related to sales prior to 2017 5,657 (264) (4,988) 405Total $5,657 $15,545 $(16,158) $5,04440Legal ContingenciesWe are a party to various legal actions. The most significant of these are described in Note 13, Commitments and Contingencies - Legal Proceedings of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. It is not possible to determine the outcome of these matters. We recognize accruals for such actions to the extent that we conclude that a loss is both probable and reasonably estimable. We accrue for the best estimate of a loss within a range; however, if no estimate in the range is better than any other, then we accrue the minimum amount in the range. If we determine that a loss is reasonably possible and the loss or range of loss can be estimated, we disclose the possible loss. Significant judgment is required in both the determination of probability and the determination as to whether an exposure is reasonably estimable. Because of the inherent uncertainty and unpredictability related to these matters, accruals are based on what we believe to be the best information available at the time of our assessment, including the legal facts and circumstances of the case, status of the proceedings, applicable law and the views of legal counsel. Upon the final resolution of such matters, it is possible that there may be a loss in excess of the amount recorded, and such amounts could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, cash flows or financial position. We periodically reassess these matters when additional information becomes available and adjust our estimates and assumptions when facts and circumstances indicate the need for any changes. We did not recognize any accruals in our Consolidated Balance Sheets for such matters as of December 31, 2018 and 2017 as we did not believe losses were probable.Valuation of Intangible Assets The identifiable intangible assets are measured at their respective fair values as of the acquisition date and may be subject to revision within the measurement period, which may be up to one year from the acquisition date. The models used in valuing these intangible assets require the use of significant estimates and assumptions including but not limited to:•estimates of revenues and operating profits related to the products or product candidates;•the probability of success for unapproved product candidates considering their stages of development;•the time and resources needed to complete the development and approval of product candidates;•the life of the potential commercialized products and associated risks, including the inherent difficulties and uncertainties in developing a product candidate such as obtaining FDA and other regulatory approvals; and•risks related to the viability of and potential alternative treatments in any future target markets.We believe the fair values used to record intangible assets acquired in connection with a business combination using information known and knowable and are based upon reasonable estimates and assumptions given the facts and circumstances as of the related valuation dates. Intangible assets related to IPR&D projects are considered to be indefinite-lived until the completion or abandonment of the associated R&D efforts. If and when development is complete, which generally occurs if and when regulatory approval to market a product is obtained, the associated assets would be deemed finite-lived and would then be amortized based on their respective estimated useful lives at that point in time. During the period the assets are considered indefinite-lived, they are not amortized but are tested for impairment on an annual basis as well as between annual tests if we become aware of any events or changes that would indicate that it is more likely than not that the fair values of the IPR&D projects are below their respective carrying amounts. The fair value of our indefinite-lived intangible assets is dependent on assumptions such as the expected timing or probability of achieving the specified milestones, changes in projected revenues or changes in discount rates. Significant judgment is employed in determining these assumptions and changes to our assumptions could have a significant impact on our results of operations in any given period. Intangible assets with finite useful lives are amortized over their estimated useful lives primarily on a straight-line basis. Intangible assets with finite useful lives are reviewed for impairment when facts or circumstances suggest that the carrying value of these assets may not be recoverable. On October 3, 2017, in connection with our Kite acquisition, we acquired intangible assets primarily related to IPR&D for axicabtagene ciloleucel, KITE-585 (an anti-BCMA, being evaluated for the treatment of multiple myeloma) and KTE-X19 (being evaluated for the treatment of adult and pediatric acute lymphoblastic leukemia), which had an estimated aggregate fair value of $9.0 billion. On October 18, 2017, FDA approved axicabtagene ciloleucel, now known commercially as Yescarta, making it the first CAR T cell therapy for the treatment of adult patients with relapsed or refractory large B-cell lymphoma after two or more lines of systemic therapy, which includes diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, transformed follicular lymphoma and primary mediastinal B-cell lymphoma. Upon approval, we reclassified $6.2 billion of the purchased IPR&D as a finite-lived intangible asset. We are amortizing this asset over an estimated useful life of 18 years using the straight-line method. During the fourth quarter of 2018, we concluded that the efficacy profile of the KITE-585 program did not justify further efforts based on the totality of the clinical data gathered and made a decision to discontinue the KITE-585 program. As a result, 41the estimated fair value of the IPR&D relating to the KITE-585 program was written down to zero and we recorded an impairment charge of $820 million within Research and development expenses on our Consolidated Statements of Income included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.Provision for Income TaxesWe estimate our income tax provision, including deferred tax assets and liabilities, based on significant management judgment. We evaluate the realization of all or a portion of our deferred tax assets on a quarterly basis. We record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets to the amounts that are more likely than not to be realized. We consider future taxable income, ongoing tax planning strategies and our historical financial performance in assessing the need for a valuation allowance. If we expect to realize deferred tax assets for which we have previously recorded a valuation allowance, we will reduce the valuation allowance in the period in which such determination is first made. The valuation allowance was $331 million and $162 million at December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively. The increase of our valuation allowance in 2018 was primarily related to certain Kite tax attributes and certain foreign jurisdictions, which do not have sufficient history of profit to realize the benefit of the losses on a more-likely-than-not basis.We are subject to income taxes in the United States and various foreign jurisdictions including Ireland. Due to economic and political conditions, various countries are actively considering and have made changes to existing tax laws (for example, the United States enacted significant tax reform, and certain provisions of the new law will continue to significantly affect us). We cannot predict the form or timing of potential legislative changes that could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations. In addition, significant judgment is required in determining our worldwide provision for income taxes.We record liabilities related to uncertain tax positions in accordance with the guidance that clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in an enterprise’s financial statements by prescribing a minimum recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. An adverse resolution of one or more of these uncertain tax positions in any period could have a material impact on the results of operations for that period. Of the total unrecognized tax benefits, $1.3 billion and $1.8 billion at December 31, 2018 and 2017, if recognized, would reduce our effective tax rate in the period of recognition. As of December 31, 2018, we believe that it is reasonably possible that our unrecognized tax benefits will decrease by approximately $100 million in the next 12 months due to potential settlements with taxing authorities. We file federal, state and foreign income tax returns in the United States and in many foreign jurisdictions. For federal income tax purposes, the statute of limitations is open for 2013 and onwards and 2010 and onwards for California income tax purposes. For certain acquired entities, the statute of limitations is open for all years from inception due to our utilization of their net operating losses and credits carried over from prior years. Our income tax returns are subject to audit by federal, state and foreign tax authorities. We are currently under examination by the IRS for the tax years from 2013 to 2015 and by various state and foreign jurisdictions. There are differing interpretations of tax laws and regulations, and as a result, significant disputes may arise with these tax authorities involving issues of the timing and amount of deductions and allocations of income among various tax jurisdictions. We periodically evaluate our exposures associated with our tax filing positions.See Note 18, Income Taxes of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information.Off Balance Sheet ArrangementsWe do not have any off balance sheet arrangements as defined in Item 303(a)(4)(ii) of Regulation S-K.42Contractual ObligationsOur contractual obligations consist of debt obligations, operating leases, capital commitments, purchase obligations for active pharmaceutical ingredients and inventory-related items and clinical trials contracts. The following table summarizes our significant enforceable and legally binding obligations, future commitments and obligations related to all contracts that we are likely to continue regardless of the fact that certain of these obligations may be cancelable as of December 31, 2018 (in millions): Payments due by PeriodContractual Obligations Total Less than oneyear 1-3 years 3-5 years More than 5yearsDebt (1) $41,876 $3,753 $6,582 $3,801 $27,740Operating lease obligations 574 89 144 112 229Capital commitments (2) 336 336 — — —Purchase obligations (3) 1,629 1,280 214 72 63Clinical trials (5) 1,678 930 505 207 36Transition Tax Payable (6) 4,639 — 621 1,359 2,659Total (4)(7) $50,732 $6,388 $8,066 $5,551 $30,727_______________________ Notes:(1) Debt consists of senior unsecured notes and includes principal and interest payments. Interest payments for our fixed rate senior unsecured notes are incurred and calculated based on terms of the related notes. Interest payments for our variable rate debt are calculated based on the interest rates on the last reset date in 2018 for each debt instrument. See Note 12, Debt and Credit Facilities of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information. (2) Amounts include capital project commitments primarily relating to construction of new buildings. (3) Amounts include purchase commitments primarily relating to active pharmaceutical ingredients with minimum purchase requirements and certain inventory-related items. These amounts also include a $365 million accrued payment to Japan Tobacco, Inc. as a result of a collaboration arrangement. See Note 11, Collaborative Arrangements of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information. (4) In addition to the above, we have committed to make potential future milestone payments to third parties as part of licensing, collaboration and development arrangements. Payments under these agreements generally become due and payable only upon achievement of certain developmental, regulatory and/or commercial milestones. Because the achievement of these milestones is neither probable nor reasonably estimable, such contingencies have not been recorded on our Consolidated Balance Sheets and have not been included in the table above. (5) At December 31, 2018, we had several clinical studies in various clinical trial phases. Our most significant clinical trial expenditures are to contract research organizations (CROs). Although all of our material contracts with CROs are cancelable, we historically have not canceled such contracts. These amounts reflect commitments based on existing contracts and do not reflect any future modifications to, or terminations of, existing contracts or anticipated or potential new contracts.(6) In connection with Tax Reform, as of December 31, 2017, we recorded a federal income tax payable for transition tax on the mandatory deemed repatriation of foreign earnings that will be payable over an eight-year period. The amounts included in the table above represent the remaining federal income tax payable after applying the first year’s installment payment and early payments of future installments. See Note 18, Income Taxes of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional details on Tax Reform.(7) As of December 31, 2018, our long-term income taxes payable includes unrecognized tax benefits, interest and penalties totaling $1.3 billion. Due to the high degree of uncertainty on the timing of future cash settlement and other events that could extinguish these unrecognized tax benefits, we are unable to estimate the period of cash settlement and therefore we have excluded these unrecognized tax benefits from the table above.Recent Accounting PronouncementsThe information required by this item is included in Note 1, Organization and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.ITEM 7A.QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISKWe are exposed to market risks that may result from changes in foreign currency exchange rates, interest rates, credit risks and market price. To reduce certain of these risks, we enter into various types of foreign currency or interest rate derivative hedging transactions, follow investment guidelines and monitor outstanding receivables as part of our risk management program.Foreign Currency Exchange Risk Our operations include manufacturing and sales activities in the United States, Canada and Ireland as well as sales activities in countries outside the United States, including Europe and Asia Pacific. As a result, our financial results could be significantly affected by factors such as changes in foreign currency exchange rates or weak economic conditions in the foreign markets in which we distribute our products. Our operating results are exposed to changes in foreign currency exchange rates between the U.S. dollar and various foreign currencies, the most significant of which is the Euro. When the U.S. dollar strengthens against 43these currencies, the relative value of sales made in the respective foreign currency decreases. Conversely, when the U.S. dollar weakens against these currencies, the relative amounts of such sales increase. Overall, we are a net receiver of foreign currencies and, therefore, benefit from a weaker U.S. dollar and are adversely affected by a stronger U.S. dollar relative to those foreign currencies in which we transact significant amounts of business. Approximately 25% of our product sales were denominated in foreign currencies during 2018. To partially mitigate the impact of changes in currency exchange rates on net cash flows from our foreign currency denominated sales, we may enter into foreign currency exchange forward and option contracts. We also hedge certain monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies, which reduces but does not eliminate our exposure to currency fluctuations between the date a transaction is recorded and the date that cash is collected or paid. In general, the market risks of these contracts are offset by corresponding gains and losses on the transactions being hedged. As of December 31, 2018 and 2017, we had open foreign currency forward contracts with notional amounts of $2.2 billion and $2.8 billion, respectively. A hypothetical 10% adverse movement in foreign currency exchange rates compared with the U.S. dollar relative to exchange rates at December 31, 2018 would have resulted in a reduction in fair value of these contracts of approximately $218 million on this date and, if realized, would negatively affect earnings over the remaining life of the contracts. The same hypothetical movement in foreign currency exchange rates compared with the U.S. dollar relative to exchange rates at December 31, 2017, would have resulted in a reduction in fair value of these contracts of approximately $285 million on this date and, if realized, would negatively affect earnings over the remaining life of the contracts. The analysis does not consider the impact that hypothetical changes in foreign currency exchange rates would have on anticipated transactions that these foreign currency sensitive instruments were designed to offset.Interest Rate Risk Our portfolio of available-for-sale marketable debt securities and our fixed and variable rate liabilities create an exposure to interest rate risk. With respect to our investment portfolio, we adhere to an investment policy that requires us to limit amounts invested in securities based on credit rating, maturity, industry group and investment type and issuer, except for securities issued by the U.S. government. The goals of our investment policy, in order of priority, are as follows: • safety and preservation of principal and diversification of risk; • liquidity of investments sufficient to meet cash flow requirements; and • competitive after-tax rate of return. The following table summarizes the expected maturities and average interest rates of our interest-generating assets and interest-bearing liabilities at December 31, 2018 (in millions, except percentages): Expected Maturity Total Fair Value 2019 2020 2021 2022 2023 Thereafter Total Assets Available-for-sale debt securities$22,741 $1,001 $311 $16 $30 $65 $24,164 $24,164Average interest rate 2.61% 3.10% 2.97% 2.89% 2.54% 3.47% Liabilities Long-term debt, including current portion(1): Fixed rate$1,500 $2,500 $2,250 $1,500 $750 $17,750 $26,250 $25,886Average interest rate 1.92% 2.51% 4.44% 2.82% 2.50% 4.16% Variable rate$1,250 $— $— $— $— $— $1,250 $1,250Average interest rate(2) 3.02% —% —% —% —% —% _______________________ Notes:(1) Amounts represent principal balances. In addition to these fixed and variable rate long-term debt, we have a $2.5 billion five-year revolving credit facility. There were no amounts outstanding under the five-year revolving credit facility as of December 31, 2018. See Note 12, Debt and Credit Facilities of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information.(2) Average interest rates for our variable rate debt were based on the interest rates on the last reset date in 2018 for each debt instrument and are dependent upon several factors subject to change, including but not limited to LIBOR, the principal amount of debt outstanding and credit ratings on each reset date.Credit RiskWe are subject to credit risk from our portfolio of cash equivalents and marketable debt securities. Under our investment policy, we limit amounts invested in such securities by credit rating, maturity, industry group, investment type and issuer, except for securities issued by the U.S. government. We are not exposed to any significant concentrations of credit risk from these financial 44instruments. The goals of our investment policy, in order of priority, are as follows: safety and preservation of principal and diversification of risk; liquidity of investments sufficient to meet cash flow requirements; and a competitive after-tax rate of return. We are also subject to credit risk from our accounts receivable related to our product sales. The majority of our trade accounts receivable arises from product sales in the United States and Europe. As of December 31, 2018, our accounts receivable, net, in Southern Europe, specifically Greece, Italy, Portugal and Spain, totaled approximately $161 million, of which $31 million were greater than 120 days past due, including $27 million greater than 365 days past due. As of December 31, 2017, our accounts receivable, net, in Southern Europe, specifically Greece, Italy, Portugal and Spain, totaled approximately $326 million, of which $131 million were greater than 120 days past due, including $52 million greater than 365 days past due. To date, we have not experienced significant losses with respect to the collection of our accounts receivable.Market Price Risk We hold shares of common stock of certain publicly traded biotechnology companies in connection with license and collaboration agreements. These equity securities are measured at fair value with any changes in fair value recognized in earnings starting on January 1, 2018 as a result of our adoption of Accounting Standards Update No. 2016-01 “Financial Instruments-Overall: Recognition and Measurement of Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities”. See Note 1, Organization and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for further information.The fair value of these equity securities was approximately $881 million and $635 million as of December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively. Changes in fair value of these equity securities are primarily due to the volatility of the stock market and changes in general economic conditions, among other factors. A hypothetical 20% increase or decrease in the stock prices of these equity securities would increase or decrease their fair value at December 31, 2018 and 2017 by approximately $176 million and $127 million, respectively. 45",2023-12-30 19:04:30.291750

We currently have 40 clinical-stage programs, with 14 programs either in registrational or in label-enabling studies. Of these programs, four have already received Breakthrough Therapy designation from U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA). •We achieved sales of $16.4 billion across our HIV franchise in 2019, an increase of 12% from 2018, reaching another all-time high. The continued revenue growth of our HIV products was driven by the demand for Biktarvy and the increase in the number of individuals taking our products for pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP). At the end of 2019, Biktarvy was available in most major markets and, in the United States, approximately 27% of individuals on PrEP were receiving Descovy.•We entered into a transformative R&D collaboration with Galapagos NV (Galapagos) in July, building on an existing partnership, and effectively enabling us to double our R&D footprint and accelerate our development of novel treatments for inflammatory and fibrotic diseases. We submitted a regulatory filing for filgotinib to FDA, and the compound is now under priority review for rheumatoid arthritis (RA). We also submitted filgotinib for approval in Europe and Japan and actively prepared for competitive launches in all three regions. We and Galapagos continued to advance the Phase 3 study of GLPG-1690 for the treatment of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis. With regard to nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), after the STELLAR and ATLAS studies failed to reach their primary endpoints, we continued to work to understand the results to determine appropriate next steps for these therapies, including the potential for combination therapeutic approaches.•In cell therapy, Kite, a Gilead company (Kite), submitted KTE-X19 for regulatory approval in the United States and Europe as a treatment for relapsed or refractory mantle cell lymphoma (MCL). If approved, Kite will be the first company with two cell therapies on the market. We also continued to demonstrate the efficacy of Yescarta. Data shared at the end of 2019 showed that approximately half of patients treated with Yescarta for refractory large B-cell lymphoma were still alive three years following treatment in the ZUMA-1 study, confirming Yescarta’s benefit/risk profile. In addition to cell therapy, we continued to grow our research portfolio in immuno-oncology. •Our business also expanded geographically, including in China, where eight products have been approved since 2017 and four products (Vemlidy, Epclusa, Harvoni and Genvoya) have been listed on the National Reimbursement Drug List effective in January 2020. 30During 2019, we continued to advance our product pipeline across our therapeutic areas with the goal of delivering best-in-class drugs that have the potential to improve the lives of patients with serious illnesses.Key corporate, product, pipeline and other updates included:Viral Diseases•Licensing and collaboration agreements with The Rockefeller University, Novartis AG and Lyndra Therapeutics, Inc.•Approval of Vosevi and Biktarvy by the China National Medical Products Administration.•Approval of a PrEP indication for Descovy by FDA. •Approval of Biktarvy and Epclusa by Japan’s Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare (MHLW).Inflammatory and Fibrotic Diseases•Collaborations with Kyverna Therapeutics, Inc. Glympse Bio, Inc., Renown Institute for Health Innovation, Goldfinch Bio, Inc., Insitro, Inc., Novo Nordisk A/S and Yuhan Corporation.•Agreement with Eisai Co., Ltd. for the distribution and co-promotion of filgotinib in Japan, pending regulatory approval from Japan’s MHLW, for the treatment of RA.•Submission of a New Drug Application (NDA) under priority review to FDA and submission of a NDA to Japan’s MHLW for filgotinib.•Topline results from the Phase 2 ATLAS study of combination and monotherapy investigational treatments in patients with bridging fibrosis (F3) and compensated cirrhosis (F4) due to NASH. While the study did not meet its primary endpoint, we continued to analyze the ATLAS data to determine appropriate next steps for these therapies. •Collaboration with Galapagos and equity investment in Galapagos to gain access to Galapagos’ current and future product portfolio. See Note 11.

Senior leadership changes in 2019 included the appointment of Daniel P. O’Day as Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Andrew D. Dickinson as Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, Merdad V. Parsey as Chief Medical Officer, Christi L. Shaw as Chief Executive Officer of Kite, Johanna Mercier as Chief Commercial Officer; the departures of John G. McHutchison, Chief Scientific Officer and Head of Research and Development, Gregg H. Alton, Chief Patient Officer, and Katie L. Watson, Executive Vice President, Human Resources; and the planned retirement of Robin L. Washington from her role as Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer.Other•Donation to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention of up to 2.4 million bottles of Truvada and Descovy annually until 2030 for uninsured Americans at risk for HIV.2019 Financial Highlights Total revenues increased to $22.4 billion and total product sales increased to $22.1 billion in 2019, compared to $22.1 billion and $21.7 billion in 2018, respectively, primarily due to higher sales of our HIV products, partially offset by lower sales of Ranexa and Letairis and our HCV products. In the United States, product sales were $16.6 billion in 2019, compared to $16.2 billion in 2018. In Europe, product sales were $3.6 billion in 2019, compared to $3.7 billion in 2018. Product sales in other international locations were $2.0 billion in 2019, compared to $1.8 billion in 2018.Cost of goods sold decreased to $4.7 billion in 2019, compared to $4.9 billion in 2018, primarily due to $259 million of lower royalty expenses, and lower amortization expenses related to intangible assets associated with Ranexa, partially offset by higher inventory write-downs. In 2019 and 2018, we recorded write-downs of $547 million and $440 million, respectively, for 31slow moving and excess raw material and work in process inventory primarily due to lower long-term demand for our HCV products.R&D expenses increased to $9.1 billion in 2019, compared to $5.0 billion in 2018, primarily due to up-front collaboration and licensing expenses of $3.9 billion related to our collaboration with Galapagos as well as higher personnel costs largely to support our cell therapy business, partially offset by lower stock-based compensation expense. In 2019 and 2018, we recorded impairment charges of $800 million and $820 million, respectively, related to in-process R&D (IPR&D) intangible assets acquired in connection with the acquisition of Kite Pharma, Inc.Selling, general and administrative (SG&A) expenses increased to $4.4 billion in 2019, compared to $4.1 billion in 2018, primarily due to promotional expenses in the United States and expenses associated with the expansion of our business in Japan and China, partially offset by lower stock-based compensation expense.Net income attributable to Gilead changed to $5.4 billion or $4.22 per diluted share in 2019, compared to $5.5 billion or $4.17 per diluted share in 2018, primarily due to pre-tax up-front collaboration and licensing expenses of $3.9 billion related to our collaboration with Galapagos, partially offset by the net favorable fluctuation in tax effects of intra-entity intangible asset transfers to different tax jurisdictions and an increase in net unrealized gains from equity securities. The year-over-year diluted earnings per share were favorably impacted by our stock repurchase activities.As of December 31, 2019, we had $25.8 billion of cash, cash equivalents and marketable debt securities compared to $31.5 billion as of December 31, 2018. During 2019, we generated $9.1 billion in operating cash flow and paid $5.6 billion in connection with the collaboration with and equity investments in Galapagos, which was classified as cash flows from investing activities. We also repaid $2.8 billion of principal amount of debt, paid cash dividends of $3.2 billion and utilized $1.7 billion on repurchases of common stock in 2019.Strategy and Outlook 2020Our focus is to create possibilities for patients through scientific breakthroughs and innovation, by leveraging our pillars of a durable core business, existing pipeline opportunities and our strategy to drive additional growth. Our strategy includes ambitions and priorities, which enable us to achieve those ambitions. Our strategic ambitions define what success looks like over the next decade and are summarized as (i) bring 10+ transformative therapies to patients by 2030; (ii) be the biotech employer and partner of choice; and (iii) deliver shareholder value in a sustainable and responsible manner. Our strategic priorities reflect how we will deliver those ambitions: (i) expand internal and external innovation; (ii) strengthen portfolio strategy and decision making; (iii) increase patient benefit and access; and (iv) continue to evolve our culture.In 2020, we expect underlying growth in our base business, which is expected to offset the full-year impact of our cardiopulmonary products loss of exclusivity, which occurred in 2019, and the initial generic version of Truvada in the United States in late 2020. We will also continue to invest to support the growth of Biktarvy, our Descovy for PrEP launch, preparation for competitive launches of filgotinib in RA in the United States, Japan and Europe, and continued investments in our pipeline, cell therapy and external partnerships. Our overall plan is now guided by our newly established corporate strategy that provides focus and guides resource and capital allocation priorities. We expect data read-outs in 2020 including filgotinib for ulcerative colitis, KTE-X19 for acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), axicabtagene ciloleucel CD19 for indolent B-cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma (iNHL) and second line diffuse large B-cell lymphoma and GLPG-1972 for osteoarthritis. To further augment our product pipeline, we continue to pursue opportunities for collaborations, partnerships and strategic investments that fit into our long-term strategic plan.Our progress on all of these initiatives is subject to a number of uncertainties, including, but not limited to, the possibility of unfavorable results from new and ongoing clinical trials; the continuation of an uncertain global macroeconomic environment; additional pricing pressures from payers and competitors; slower than anticipated growth in our HIV products; an increase in discounts, chargebacks and rebates due to ongoing contracts and future negotiations with commercial and government payers; market share and price erosion caused by the introduction of generic versions of products containing tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (TDF) outside the United States and Viread, Letairis and Ranexa in the United States; inaccuracies in our HCV patient start estimates; potential amendments to the Affordable Care Act or other government action that could have the effect of lowering prices; a larger-than anticipated shift in payer mix to more highly discounted payer segment; and volatility in foreign currency exchange rates.32RESULTS OF OPERATIONSTotal RevenuesThe following table summarizes the period-over-period changes in our revenues:(In millions, except percentages) 2019 Change 2018 Change 2017Revenues: Product sales $22,119 2 % $21,677 (16)% $25,662Royalty, contract and other revenues 330 (27)% 450 1 % 445Total revenues $22,449 1 % $22,127 (15)% $26,107Product Sales2019 Compared to 2018Total product sales increased by 2% to $22.1 billion in 2019, compared to $21.7 billion in 2018, primarily due to higher sales of our HIV products, partially offset by lower sales of Ranexa and Letairis and our HCV products.HIV product sales increased by 12% to $16.4 billion in 2019, compared to $14.6 billion in 2018, primarily due to higher sales volume as a result of the continued uptake of Biktarvy. The increase was partially offset by decreases in sales volumes of Genvoya and our Truvada (emtricitabine (FTC)/TDF)-based products and lower average net selling price.HCV product sales decreased by 20% to $2.9 billion in 2019, compared to $3.7 billion in 2018, primarily due to lower average net selling price, including a decline in U.S. Medicare prices in 2019.Yescarta sales increased by 73% to $456 million in 2019, compared to $264 million in 2018, primarily due to a higher number of therapies provided to patients and the continued expansion in Europe.Other product sales, which include Vemlidy, Viread, Letairis, Ranexa, Zydelig, AmBisome and Cayston, decreased by 26% to $2.3 billion in 2019, compared to $3.1 billion in 2018, primarily due to the expected decline in sales of Ranexa and Letairis after the entry of generic versions in the United States in early 2019.Of our total product sales, 25% were generated outside the United States in 2019. We faced exposure to movements in foreign currency exchange rates, primarily in the Euro. We used foreign currency exchange contracts to hedge a percentage of our foreign currency exposure. Foreign currency exchange, net of hedges, had an immaterial impact on our product sales in 2019, based on a comparison using foreign currency exchange rates from 2018.We record product sales net of estimated government and other rebates and chargebacks, cash discounts for prompt payment, distributor fees and other related costs. These deductions are generally referred to as gross-to-net deductions, which totaled $15.3 billion, or 41% of gross product sales in 2019, compared to $16.5 billion, or 43% of gross product sales in 2018. Of the $15.3 billion in 2019, $13.5 billion or 36% of gross product sales in 2019 was related to government and other rebates and chargebacks, and $1.8 billion was related to cash discounts for prompt payment, distributor fees and other related costs.Product sales in the United States increased by 2% to $16.6 billion in 2019, compared to $16.2 billion in 2018, primarily due to higher sales of our HIV products, partially offset by lower sales of Ranexa and Letairis following the entry of generic versions in 2019 and lower sales of our HCV products. The increase in sales of our HIV products was primarily due to the continued uptake of Biktarvy and an increase in the number of individuals taking PrEP, partially offset by the decreases in sales volumes of our other HIV products including Genvoya, Atripla and Stribild. The decrease in sales of our HCV products was primarily due to lower average net selling price, including a decline in U.S. Medicare prices in 2019.Product sales in Europe decreased by 3% to $3.6 billion in 2019, compared to $3.7 billion in 2018, primarily due to lower sales of our HCV products and the broader availability of generic versions of Truvada and Atripla. The decrease in sales of our HCV products was primarily due to lower patient starts and lower average net selling price. The decrease was partially offset by the continued uptake of Biktarvy, Odefsey and Yescarta, and favorable net adjustments for government rebates related to sales made in prior years.Product sales in other international locations increased by 11% to $2.0 billion in 2019, compared to $1.8 billion in 2018, primarily due to higher HIV product sales in Japan, as a result of acquiring the rights to certain products in our HIV portfolio in Japan effective January 1, 2019, and higher HCV product sales in Japan due to the launch of Epclusa in 2019.33The following table summarizes the period-over-period changes in our product sales:(In millions, except percentages) 2019 Change 2018 Change 2017Atripla $600 (50)% $1,206 (33)% $1,806Biktarvy 4,738 * 1,184 * —Complera/Eviplera 406 (38)% 653 (32)% 966Descovy 1,500 (5)% 1,581 30 % 1,218Genvoya 3,931 (15)% 4,624 26 % 3,674Odefsey 1,655 4 % 1,598 44 % 1,106Stribild 369 (43)% 644 (39)% 1,053Truvada 2,813 (6)% 2,997 (4)% 3,134Other HIV(1) 47 (23)% 61 5 % 58Revenue share - Symtuza(2) 379 * 79 * —Total HIV 16,438 12 % 14,627 12 % 13,015AmBisome 407 (3)% 420 15 % 366Ledipasvir/Sofosbuvir(3) 643 (47)% 1,222 (72)% 4,370Letairis 618 (34)% 943 6 % 887Ranexa 216 (72)% 758 6 % 717Sofosbuvir/Velpatasvir(4) 1,965 — % 1,966 (44)% 3,510Vemlidy 488 52 % 321 * 122Viread 243 (21)% 307 (71)% 1,046Vosevi 257 (35)% 396 35 % 293Yescarta 456 73 % 264 * 7Zydelig 103 (23)% 133 (11)% 149Other(5) 285 (11)% 320 (73)% 1,180Total product sales $22,119 2 % $21,677 (16)% $25,662_________________________________________*Percentage is greater than 100%(1)Includes Emtriva and Tybost(2)Represents our revenue from cobicistat (C), emtricitabine (FTC) and tenofovir alafenamide (TAF) in Symtuza (darunavir/C/FTC/TAF), a fixed dose combination product commercialized by Janssen Sciences Ireland UC(3)Amounts consist of sales of Harvoni and the authorized generic version of Harvoni sold by our separate subsidiary, Asegua Therapeutics LLC(4)Amounts consist of sales of Epclusa and the authorized generic version of Epclusa sold by our separate subsidiary, Asegua Therapeutics LLC(5)Includes Cayston, Hepsera and SovaldiThe following is additional discussion of sales of our HIV and HCV products:•Descovy (FTC/TAF)-based products: Biktarvy, Descovy, Genvoya, Odefsey and Revenue Share - SymtuzaThe following table summarizes the period-over-period changes in our sales of Descovy (FTC/TAF)-based products:(In millions, except percentages) 2019 Change 2018 Change 2017U.S. $9,716 34% $7,261 47% $4,955Europe 1,857 22% 1,528 71% 892Other locations 630 127% 277 83% 151Total $12,203 35% $9,066 51% $5,998% of total product sales 55% 42% 23%% of HIV product sales 74% 62% 46%Descovy (FTC/TAF)-based product sales increased in all major markets in 2019 compared to 2018. The increase in both the United States and Europe was primarily due to higher demand and a shift in product mix toward Biktarvy. The increase in other international locations was primarily due to higher product sales in Japan as a result of acquiring the rights to certain products in our HIV portfolio in Japan effective January 1, 2019.34•Truvada (FTC/TDF)-based products: Atripla, Complera/Eviplera, Stribild and TruvadaThe following table summarizes the period-over-period changes in our sales of Truvada (FTC/TDF)-based products:(In millions, except percentages) 2019 Change 2018 Change 2017U.S. $3,569 (18)% $4,353 (9)% $4,771Europe 450 (45)% 815 (51)% 1,677Other locations 169 (49)% 332 (35)% 511Total $4,188 (24)% $5,500 (21)% $6,959% of total product sales 19% 25% 27%Truvada (FTC/TDF)-based product sales decreased in the United States and Europe in 2019 compared to 2018. The decrease in U.S. sales was primarily due to lower sales volume as a result of patients switching to newer regimens containing FTC/TAF, partially offset by the increased usage of Truvada for PrEP. The decrease in Europe sales was primarily due to lower sales volumes of Truvada and Atripla as a result of the broader availability of generic versions and patients switching to newer regimens containing FTC/TAF. We expect a decline in our sales of Truvada in the United States as patients switch to Descovy for PrEP from Truvada for PrEP and the expected entry of generic versions in late 2020.•HCV products: Epclusa, Harvoni, Sovaldi, Vosevi and Authorized Generics of Epclusa and HarvoniThe following table summarizes the period-over-period changes in our sales of HCV products:(In millions, except percentages) 2019 Change 2018 Change 2017U.S. $1,465 (28)% $2,023 (65)% $5,854Europe 742 (17)% 896 (52)% 1,853Other locations 729 (5)% 767 (46)% 1,430Total $2,936 (20)% $3,686 (60)% $9,137% of total product sales 13% 17% 36%The decrease in HCV product sales in the United States in 2019 compared to 2018 was primarily due to lower average net selling price, including a decline in U.S. Medicare prices in 2019. The decrease in HCV product sales in Europe in 2019 compared to 2018 was primarily due to lower patient starts and lower average net selling price, partially offset by favorable net adjustments for government rebates and discounts related to sales made in prior years. The decrease in HCV product sales in other international locations in 2019 compared to 2018 was primarily due to lower sales of Sovaldi, partially offset by higher sales of Epclusa.Cost of Goods Sold and Product Gross MarginThe following table summarizes the period-over-period changes in our product sales, cost of goods sold and product gross margin: (In millions, except percentages) 2019 Change 2018 Change 2017Total product sales $22,119 2 % $21,677 (16)% $25,662Cost of goods sold $4,675 (4)% $4,853 11 % $4,371Product gross margin 79% 78% 83%In 2019, cost of goods sold decreased by $178 million compared to 2018, primarily due to lower royalty expenses and lower amortization expense related to the intangible assets associated with Ranexa, which was fully amortized in the first quarter of 2019, partially offset by higher inventory write-downs. In 2019, we recorded inventory write-downs of $649 million, of which $547 million was related to slow moving and excess raw material and work in process inventory primarily due to lower long-term demand for our HCV products. In 2018, we recorded inventory write-downs of $572 million, of which $440 million was related to excess raw materials primarily due to a sustained decrease in demand for Harvoni as a result of a shift in the market from Harvoni to Epclusa. Royalty expenses decreased by $259 million in 2019, compared to 2018, primarily due to lower sales of Atripla, Ranexa, Letairis and products containing elvitegravir.Research and Development Expenses The following table summarizes the period-over-period changes in our R&D expenses:(In millions, except percentages) 2019 Change 2018 Change 2017R&D expenses $9,106 81% $5,018 34% $3,73435R&D expenses consist primarily of clinical studies performed by contract research organizations, materials and supplies, payments under collaborative and other arrangements, including up-front and milestone payments, licenses and fees, as well as expense reimbursements to the collaboration partners, IPR&D impairment charges, personnel costs, including salaries, benefits and stock-based compensation expense, and overhead allocations consisting of various support and infrastructure costs.We do not track total R&D expenses by product candidate, therapeutic area or development phase. However, we manage our R&D expenses by identifying the R&D activities we anticipate will be performed during a given period and then prioritizing efforts based on scientific data, probability of technical and regulatory successful development, market potential, available human and capital resources and other considerations. We continually review our R&D projects based on unmet medical need and, as necessary, reallocate resources among our internal R&D portfolio and external opportunities that we believe will best support the long-term growth of our business.The following table provides a breakout of our R&D expenses by major cost type: (In millions, except percentages) 2019 Change 2018 Change 2017Up-front collaboration and licensing expenses $4,251 * $278 25 % $222Personnel, infrastructure and other expenses 2,016 7 % 1,876 34 % 1,399Clinical studies and outside services 1,750 5 % 1,665 (11)% 1,881IPR&D impairment charges 800 (2)% 820 * —Stock-based compensation expenses 289 (24)% 379 63 % 232Total $9,106 81 % $5,018 34 % $3,734_________________________________________*Percentage is greater than 100%In 2019, R&D expenses increased by $4.1 billion compared to 2018, primarily due to $3.9 billion of up-front collaboration and licensing expenses related to our collaboration with Galapagos as well as higher personnel costs largely to support our cell therapy business and increased investment in our research projects, partially offset by lower stock-based compensation expense.In 2019, we recorded an impairment charge of $800 million related to IPR&D intangible assets acquired in connection with our acquisition of Kite Pharma, Inc. primarily for the treatment of indolent non-Hodgkin lymphoma largely driven by changes in the estimated market opportunities as new therapies or combinations of existing therapies were approved. In 2018, we recorded an impairment charge of $820 million related to IPR&D intangible assets for the KITE-585 program (an anti-B cell maturation antigen being evaluated for the treatment of multiple myeloma) due to its discontinuance. Stock-based compensation expense for 2019 decreased by $90 million, compared to 2018, primarily due to the 2018 impact of stock-based compensation expense associated with our acquisition of Kite Pharma, Inc.Selling, General and Administrative Expenses The following table summarizes the period-over-period changes in our SG&A expenses:(In millions, except percentages) 2019 Change 2018 Change 2017SG&A expenses $4,381 8% $4,056 5% $3,878SG&A expenses relate to sales and marketing, finance, human resources, legal and other administrative activities. Expenses consist primarily of personnel costs, facilities and overhead costs, outside marketing, advertising and legal expenses and other general and administrative costs. SG&A expenses also include the Branded Prescription Drug (BPD) fee. In the United States, we, along with other pharmaceutical manufacturers of branded drug products, are required to pay a portion of the BPD fee, which is estimated based on select government sales during the prior year as a percentage of total industry government sales and is trued-up upon receipt of invoices from the Internal Revenue Service.In 2019, SG&A expenses increased by $325 million compared to 2018, primarily due to higher promotional expenses in the United States and expenses associated with the expansion of our business in Japan and China, partially offset by lower stock-based compensation expense. Stock-based compensation expense for 2019 decreased by $106 million, compared to 2018, primarily due to the 2018 impact of stock-based compensation expense associated with our acquisition of Kite Pharma, Inc.BPD fee expenses were $247 million, $229 million and $385 million in 2019, 2018 and 2017, respectively. BPD fee expenses are not tax-deductible.36Other Income (Expense), Net The following table summarizes the period-over-period changes in our Other income (expense), net:(In millions, except percentages) 2019 Change 2018 Change 2017Other income (expense), net $1,868 176% $676 29% $523The change in Other income (expense), net in 2019, compared to 2018, was primarily due to higher net unrealized gains of $1.1 billion from changes in the fair value of our equity securities largely relating to our equity investments in Galapagos. Starting in January 2018, we recorded unrealized gains (losses) from changes in the fair value of our marketable equity securities in Other income (expense), net, on our Consolidated Statements of Income as a result of the adoption of Accounting Standards Update No. 2016-01 “Financial Instruments - Overall: Recognition and Measurement of Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities.”Provision for Income Taxes The following table summarizes the period-over-period changes in our Provision for income taxes:(In millions, except percentages) 2019 Change 2018 Change 2017Effective tax rate (4.0)% (34.0)% 30.0% (35.7)% 65.7%Provision for income taxes $(204) $2,339 $8,885The decrease in effective tax rate and provision for income taxes in 2019, compared to 2018, was primarily due to a $1.2 billion deferred tax benefit in 2019 related to intangible asset transfers from a foreign subsidiary to Ireland and the United States. The 2018 effective tax rate included a $588 million deferred tax charge resulting from a transfer of acquired intangible assets from a foreign subsidiary to the United States.The decrease in effective tax rate and provision for income taxes in 2018, compared to 2017, was primarily due to a $5.5 billion net tax charge in 2017 and a reduction to the U.S. corporate tax rate in 2018 as a result of the enactment of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (Tax Reform) in December 2017. The 2018 effective tax rate was further decreased due to a $202 million tax benefit recorded in 2018 related to settlement of tax examinations, offset by the $588 million deferred tax charge in 2018 discussed above, changes to the geographic mix of earnings and the tax on Global Intangible Low-Taxed Income (enacted as part of Tax Reform). See Note 19. Income Taxes of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional details on Tax Reform.LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCESThe following table summarizes our cash, cash equivalents, and marketable debt securities and working capital: December 31,(In millions) 2019 2018Cash, cash equivalents and marketable debt securities $25,840 $31,512Working capital $20,537 $25,231Cash, Cash Equivalents and Marketable Debt SecuritiesCash, cash equivalents and marketable debt securities decreased by $5.7 billion, or 18%, compared to December 31, 2018. During 2019, we generated $9.1 billion in operating cash flow, paid $5.6 billion in connection with our collaboration with and equity investments in Galapagos, repaid $2.8 billion of debt, paid cash dividends of $3.2 billion and repurchased 26 million shares of our common stock for $1.7 billion through open market transactions.Working CapitalWorking capital decreased by $4.7 billion, or 19%, compared to December 31, 2018, primarily due to the use of cash noted above under the heading Cash, Cash Equivalents and Marketable Debt Securities.37Cash FlowsThe following table summarizes our cash flow activities:(In millions) 2019 2018 2017Cash provided by (used in): Operating activities $9,144 $8,400 $11,898Investing activities $(7,817) $14,355 $(16,069)Financing activities $(7,634) $(12,318) $3,393Cash Provided by Operating ActivitiesCash provided by operating activities represents the cash receipts and disbursements related to all of our activities other than investing and financing activities. Operating cash flow is derived by adjusting our net income for non-cash items and changes in operating assets and liabilities. Cash provided by operating activities increased by $744 million to $9.1 billion in 2019 compared to 2018, primarily due to lower tax payments in 2019, partially offset by lower collections on accounts receivable in 2019 and the collection of a receivable from Bristol-Myers Squibb Company in 2018 following the termination of a collaboration pursuant to the terms of the existing agreements. The tax payments made in 2018 included a $500 million payment related to the first annual installment of the Tax Reform transition tax, a $771 million deemed early payment of the Tax Reform transition tax and a $514 million settlement of a tax examination. Starting in 2019, up-front and milestone payments related to collaborative and other arrangements are classified as cash flows from investing activities in our Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. Comparative prior year amounts were not material and were not reclassified to investing activities from operating activities.Cash Provided by (Used in) Investing ActivitiesCash provided by (used in) investing activities primarily consists of purchases, sales and maturities of our marketable debt securities, capital expenditures, up-front and milestone payments related to collaborative and other arrangements, purchases of equity securities and other investments. Cash used in investing activities was $7.8 billion in 2019 compared to cash provided by investing activities of $14.4 billion in 2018. The change in cash provided by (used in) investing activities was primarily due to higher purchases of marketable debt securities and the $5.6 billion payments made in connection with our collaboration with and equity investments in Galapagos, partially offset by higher proceeds from sales of marketable debt securities. The higher purchases of marketable debt securities were the result of a shift in our investment strategy to investing in longer dated securities in 2019 compared to 2018. In addition, we paid Japan Tobacco Inc. $365 million during 2019 in connection with acquiring the rights to market and distribute certain HIV products in Japan.Cash provided by investing activities was $14.4 billion in 2018 compared to cash used in investing activities of $16.1 billion in 2017. The change in cash provided by (used in) investing activities was primarily due to higher proceeds from maturities of our marketable debt securities and lower purchases of marketable debt securities, partially offset by lower proceeds from sales of our marketable debt securities. In addition, $10.4 billion cash was used to acquire Kite Pharma, Inc. in 2017, whereas no cash was used for business combinations in 2018.Cash Provided by (Used in) Financing ActivitiesCash used in financing activities decreased by $4.7 billion to $7.6 billion in 2019 compared to 2018, primarily due to $3.5 billion lower repayments of debt and $1.2 billion lower repurchases of our common stock during 2019.Cash used in financing activities was $12.3 billion in 2018, compared to cash provided by financing activities of $3.4 billion in 2017. The change in cash provided by (used in) financing activities was primarily due to higher repayment of debt and repurchases of our common stock in 2018. In addition, we had $9.0 billion net proceeds from debt issuances to partially fund our acquisition of Kite Pharma, Inc. in 2017, whereas no debt was issued in 2018.Debt and Credit FacilitiesIn 2019 and 2018, we repaid at maturity $2.8 billion and $1.8 billion principal amount of senior unsecured notes, respectively. In addition, in 2018, we repaid $4.5 billion borrowed under our term loan facility credit agreement, at which time the term loan facility credit agreement was terminated. In February 2020, we repaid at maturity $500 million principal amount of senior unsecured notes.As of December 31, 2019, no amounts were outstanding under our $2.5 billion five-year revolving credit facility maturing in May 2021.38We are required to comply with certain covenants under our notes indentures, and as of December 31, 2019, we were not in violation of any covenants.The summary of our borrowings under various financing arrangements is included in Note 12. Debt and Credit Facilities of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.Capital Return ProgramThe details of our Stock Repurchase Programs and Dividends are included in Note 15. Stockholders’ Equity of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.Stock Repurchase ProgramsIn the first quarter of 2016, our Board of Directors authorized a $12.0 billion stock repurchase program (2016 Program), under which repurchases may be made in the open market or in privately negotiated transactions. We started repurchases under the 2016 Program in April 2016. Repurchases under the 2016 Program were 26 million and 40 million shares of our common stock for $1.7 billion and $2.9 billion in 2019 and 2018, respectively. As of December 31, 2019, the remaining authorized repurchase amount under the 2016 Program was $3.4 billion.In the first quarter of 2020, our Board of Directors authorized a new $5.0 billion stock repurchase program (2020 Program), which will commence upon the completion of the 2016 Program. Purchases under the 2020 Program may be made in the open market or in privately negotiated transactions.DividendsWe declared and paid quarterly cash dividends for an aggregate amount of $3.2 billion or $2.52 per share of our common stock and $3.0 billion or $2.28 per share of our common stock in 2019 and 2018, respectively.On February 4, 2020, we announced that our Board of Directors declared a quarterly cash dividend increase of 8% from $0.63 to $0.68 per share of our common stock, with a payment date of March 30, 2020 to all stockholders of record as of the close of business on March 13, 2020. Future dividends are subject to declaration by the Board of Directors.Capital ResourcesWe believe our existing capital resources, supplemented by cash flows generated from our operations, will be adequate to satisfy our capital needs for the foreseeable future. Our future capital requirements will depend on many factors, including but not limited to the following:•the commercial performance of our current and future products;•the progress and scope of our R&D efforts, including preclinical studies and clinical trials;•the cost, timing and outcome of regulatory reviews;•the expansion of our sales and marketing capabilities;•the possibility of acquiring additional manufacturing capabilities or office facilities;•the possibility of acquiring other companies or new products;•debt service requirements;•the establishment of additional collaborative relationships with other companies; and•costs associated with the defense, settlement and adverse results of government investigations and litigation.We may in the future require additional funding, which could be in the form of proceeds from equity or debt financings. If such funding is required, we cannot guarantee that it will be available to us on favorable terms, if at all.39CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES, ESTIMATES AND JUDGMENTSThe discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based on our Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, which have been prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses and related disclosures. On an ongoing basis, we evaluate and base our estimates on historical experience and on various other market specific and other relevant assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ significantly from these estimates. We believe the following critical accounting policies reflect the more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our Consolidated Financial Statements. Revenue Recognition Product Sales We recognize revenue from product sales when control of the product transfers, generally upon shipment or delivery, to the customer, or in certain cases, upon the corresponding sales by our customer to a third party. Upon recognition of revenue from product sales, provisions are made for various forms of variable consideration, which include government and other rebates such as Medicaid reimbursements, customer incentives such as cash discounts for prompt payment, distributor fees and expected returns of expired products, as appropriate. Variable consideration is included in the net sales price only to the extent a significant reversal in the amount of cumulative revenue recognized is not probable of occurring when the uncertainty associated with the variable consideration is subsequently resolved. Government and other rebates and chargebacks represent the majority of our variable consideration and require complex and significant judgment by management. Estimates are assessed each period and updated to reflect current information. Government and Other Rebates and ChargebacksGovernment and other rebates and chargebacks include amounts paid to payers and healthcare providers in the United States, including Medicaid rebates, AIDS Drug Assistance Program rebates and chargebacks, Veterans Administration and Public Health Service chargebacks and other rebates, as well as foreign government rebates. Rebates and chargebacks are based on contractual arrangements or statutory requirements which may vary by product, by payer and individual payer plans.For qualified programs that can purchase our products through wholesalers or other distributors at a lower contractual price, the wholesalers or distributors charge back to us the difference between their acquisition cost and the lower contractual price. Our allowances for government and other rebates and chargebacks are estimated based on products sold, historical payer mix, and as available, pertinent third-party industry information, estimated patient population, known market events or trends, and for our U.S. product sales, channel inventory data obtained from our major U.S. wholesalers in accordance with our inventory management agreements. We also take into consideration, as available, new information regarding changes in programs’ regulations and guidelines that would impact the amount of the actual rebates and/or our expectations regarding future payer mix for these programs. We believe the methodology that we use to estimate our government and other rebates and chargebacks is reasonable and appropriate given the current facts and circumstances. However, actual results may differ significantly from our estimates. Historically, our actual government rebates and chargebacks claimed for prior periods have varied by less than 5% from our estimates.Government and other chargebacks that are payable to our direct customers are classified as reductions of Accounts receivable in our Consolidated Balance Sheets and totaled $655 million and $492 million at December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively. Government and other rebates that are payable to third party payers and healthcare providers are recorded in Accrued government and other rebates on our Consolidated Balance Sheets and totaled $3.5 billion and $3.9 billion at December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively. 40The following table summarizes the consolidated activities and ending balances in our government and other rebates and chargebacks accounts:(in millions) Balance at Beginning of Year Decrease/(Increase) to Product Sales Payments Balance at End of YearYear ended December 31, 2019: Activity related to 2019 sales $— $13,791 $(9,920) $3,871Activity related to sales prior to 2019 4,420 (279) (3,904) 237Total $4,420 $13,512 $(13,824) $4,108Year ended December 31, 2018: Activity related to 2018 sales $— $14,784 $(10,953) $3,831Activity related to sales prior to 2018 5,044 41 (4,496) 589Total $5,044 $14,825 $(15,449) $4,420Legal ContingenciesWe are a party to various legal actions. The most significant of these are described in Note 14. Commitments and Contingencies - Legal Proceedings of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. It is not possible to determine the outcome of these matters. We recognize accruals for such actions to the extent that we conclude that a loss is both probable and reasonably estimable. We accrue for the best estimate of a loss within a range; however, if no estimate in the range is better than any other, then we accrue the minimum amount in the range. If we determine that a loss is reasonably possible and the loss or range of loss can be estimated, we disclose the possible loss. Significant judgment is required in both the determination of probability and the determination as to whether an exposure is reasonably estimable. Because of the inherent uncertainty and unpredictability related to these matters, accruals are based on what we believe to be the best information available at the time of our assessment, including the legal facts and circumstances of the case, status of the proceedings, applicable law and the views of legal counsel. Upon the final resolution of such matters, it is possible that there may be a loss in excess of the amount recorded, and such amounts could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, cash flows or financial position. We periodically reassess these matters when additional information becomes available and adjust our estimates and assumptions when facts and circumstances indicate the need for any changes. We did not have any material accruals in our Consolidated Balance Sheets for such matters as of December 31, 2019 and 2018.Valuation of Intangible Assets We have acquired, and expect to continue to acquire, intangible assets through acquisition or consolidation of variable interest entities. The identifiable intangible assets are measured at their respective fair values as of the acquisition date and may be subject to revision within the measurement period, which may be up to one year from the acquisition date. The fair values of the assets are generally determined using a probability-weighted income approach that discounts expected future cash flows to present value. The estimated net cash flows are discounted using a discount rate that is based on the estimated weighted-average cost of capital for companies with profiles similar to our profile and represents the rate that market participants would use to value the intangible assets. The discounted cash flow models used in valuing these intangible assets require the use of significant estimates and assumptions including but not limited to:•estimates of revenues and operating profits related to the products or product candidates;•the probability of technical and regulatory success for unapproved product candidates considering their stages of development;•the time and resources needed to complete the development and approval of product candidates;•the life of the potential commercialized products and associated risks, including the inherent difficulties and uncertainties in developing a product candidate such as obtaining FDA and other regulatory approvals; and•risks related to the viability of and potential alternative treatments in any future target markets.We believe the fair values used to record intangible assets acquired are based upon reasonable estimates and assumptions given the facts and circumstances as of the related valuation dates. Intangible assets related to IPR&D projects are considered to be indefinite-lived until the completion or abandonment of the associated R&D efforts. During the period the assets are considered indefinite-lived, they are not amortized. When development is complete, which generally occurs if and when regulatory approval to market a product is obtained, the associated assets would 41be deemed finite-lived and then be amortized based on their respective estimated useful lives at that point in time primarily on a straight-line basis. Intangible assets are reviewed for impairment on an annual basis as well as between annual tests if we become aware of any events or changes that would indicate that it is more likely than not that the fair values of the intangible assets and/or IPR&D projects are below their respective carrying amounts. When performing quantitative impairment assessments, we calculate the fair value using discounted cash flow models that require significant estimates and assumptions similar to the methodology for determining the acquisition date fair value of intangible assets, as described above. If the carrying value of an intangible asset exceeds its fair value, then the intangible asset is written-down to its fair value. Significant judgment is employed in determining these estimates and assumptions and changes to our estimates and assumptions could have a significant impact on our results of operations in any given period. For example, in 2019, we recognized an $800 million impairment charge related to IPR&D projects primarily for the treatment of indolent non-Hodgkin lymphoma due to changes in estimated market opportunities. There are often major risks and uncertainties associated with IPR&D projects as we are required to obtain regulatory approvals in order to be able to market these products. Such approvals require completing clinical trials that demonstrate a product candidate is safe and effective. Consequently, the eventual realized value of the acquired IPR&D project may vary from its fair value at the date of acquisition, and IPR&D impairment charges may occur in future periods which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations. For example, in 2018, we concluded that the KITE-585 program acquired in connection with our acquisition of Kite Pharma, Inc. did not justify further efforts based on the totality of the clinical data gathered and discontinued the program. As a result, the carrying value of the IPR&D relating to the KITE-585 program was written down to zero and we recorded an impairment charge of $820 million.See Note 9. Intangible Assets of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information on the impairment charges related to our indefinite-lived IPR&D intangible assets.Provision for Income TaxesWe estimate our income tax provision, including deferred tax assets and liabilities, based on significant management judgment. We evaluate the realization of all or a portion of our deferred tax assets on a quarterly basis. We record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets to the amounts that are more likely than not to be realized. We consider future taxable income, ongoing tax planning strategies and our historical financial performance in assessing the need for a valuation allowance. If we expect to realize deferred tax assets for which we have previously recorded a valuation allowance, we will reduce the valuation allowance in the period in which such determination is first made. We are subject to income taxes in the United States and various foreign jurisdictions including Ireland. Due to economic and political conditions, various countries are actively considering and have made changes to existing tax laws. For example, the United States enacted significant tax reform, and certain provisions of the new law will continue to significantly affect us. We cannot predict the form or timing of potential legislative changes that could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations. In addition, significant judgment is required in determining our worldwide provision for income taxes.We record liabilities related to uncertain tax positions in accordance with the guidance that clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in an enterprise’s financial statements by prescribing a minimum recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. An adverse resolution of one or more of these uncertain tax positions in any period could have a material impact on the results of operations for that period. See Note 19. Income Taxes of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information.OFF BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTSWe do not have any off balance sheet arrangements as defined in Item 303(a)(4)(ii) of Regulation S-K.42CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONSContractual obligations represent future cash commitments related to significant enforceable and legally binding obligations and certain purchase obligations that we are likely to continue regardless of the fact that they may be cancelable. The expected timing and payment amounts presented below are estimated based on existing contracts and do not reflect any future modifications to, or terminations of, existing contracts or anticipated or potential new contracts.The following table summarizes the aggregate maturities of our contractual obligations as of December 31, 2019: Payments due by Period(In millions) Total 2020 2021-2022 2023-2024 ThereafterDebt(1) $38,123 $3,456 $5,421 $3,962 $25,284Operating lease obligations(2) 850 125 226 187 312Purchase obligations(3) 1,682 1,315 267 84 16Transition tax payable(4) 4,639 148 946 2,068 1,477Total(5)(6) $45,294 $5,044 $6,860 $6,301 $27,089_________________________________________(1)Debt consists of senior unsecured notes and includes principal and future interest payments. Interest payments for our fixed rate senior unsecured notes are incurred and calculated based on terms of the related notes. See Note 12. Debt and Credit Facilities of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information. (2)See Note 13. Leases of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information. (3)Amounts primarily relate to capital commitments, active pharmaceutical ingredients (API) with minimum purchase commitments and certain inventory-related items, advertising and R&D commitments. Significant R&D commitments related to clinical studies performed by contract research organizations (CROs) are excluded from the table as material CRO contracts are cancelable by us. In addition, the table does not reflect approximately $220 million of additional minimum purchase commitments resulting from an API contract amended in January 2020. (4)In connection with Tax Reform we recorded a federal income tax payable for transition tax on the mandatory deemed repatriation of foreign earnings that is payable over an eight-year period. The amounts included in the table above represent the remaining federal income tax payable at December 31, 2019.(5)As of December 31, 2019, our long-term income taxes payable includes unrecognized tax benefits, interest and penalties totaling $1.6 billion. Due to the high degree of uncertainty on the timing of future cash settlement and other events that could extinguish these unrecognized tax benefits, we are unable to estimate the period of cash settlement and therefore we have excluded these unrecognized tax benefits.(6)We have committed to make potential future milestone and other payments to third parties as part of licensing, collaboration, development and other arrangements. Payments under these agreements generally are contingent upon certain future events including achievement of certain developmental, regulatory or commercial milestones. Because the achievement of these events is neither probable nor reasonably estimable and such potential payments have not been recorded in our Consolidated Balance Sheets, they have not been included in the table above.RECENT ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTSThe information required by this item is included in Note 1. Organization and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.ITEM 7A.QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISKWe are exposed to market risks that may result from changes in foreign currency exchange rates, interest rates, credit risks and market price. To reduce certain of these risks, we enter into various types of foreign currency or interest rate derivative hedging transactions, follow investment guidelines and monitor outstanding receivables as part of our risk management program.Foreign Currency Exchange Risk We have operations in more than 35 countries worldwide. As a result, our financial results could be significantly affected by factors such as changes in foreign currency exchange rates or weak economic conditions in the foreign markets in which we distribute our products. Our operating results are exposed to changes in foreign currency exchange rates between the U.S. dollar and various foreign currencies, the most significant of which is the Euro. When the U.S. dollar strengthens against these currencies, the relative value of sales made in the respective foreign currency decreases. Conversely, when the U.S. dollar weakens against these currencies, the relative amounts of such sales increase. Overall, we are a net receiver of foreign currencies and, therefore, benefit from a weaker U.S. dollar and are adversely affected by a stronger U.S. dollar relative to those foreign currencies in which we transact significant amounts of business. Approximately 25% of our product sales were denominated in foreign currencies during 2019. To partially mitigate the impact of changes in currency exchange rates on net cash flows from our foreign currency denominated sales, we may enter into foreign currency exchange forward and option contracts. We also hedge certain monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies, which reduces but does not eliminate our exposure to currency fluctuations between the date a transaction is recorded and the date that cash is collected or paid. In general, the market risks of these contracts are offset by corresponding gains and losses on the transactions being hedged. 43As of December 31, 2019 and 2018, we had open foreign currency forward contracts with notional amounts of $2.9 billion and $2.2 billion, respectively. A hypothetical 10% adverse movement in foreign currency exchange rates compared with the U.S. dollar relative to exchange rates at December 31, 2019 and December 31, 2018 would have resulted in a reduction in fair value of these contracts of approximately $285 million and $218 million, respectively, on this date and, if realized, would negatively affect earnings over the remaining life of the contracts. The analysis does not consider the impact that hypothetical changes in foreign currency exchange rates would have on anticipated transactions that these foreign currency sensitive instruments were designed to offset.Interest Rate Risk Our portfolio of available-for-sale debt securities and our fixed rate long-term debt create an exposure to interest rate risk. With respect to our investment portfolio, we adhere to an investment policy that requires us to limit amounts invested in securities based on credit rating, maturity, industry group and investment type and issuer, except for securities issued by the U.S. government. The goals of our investment policy, in order of priority, are as follows: • safety and preservation of principal and diversification of risk; • liquidity of investments sufficient to meet cash flow requirements; and • competitive after-tax rate of return. The following table summarizes the expected maturities and average interest rates of our interest-generating assets and interest-bearing liabilities at December 31, 2019: Expected Maturity Total Fair Value(In millions, except percentages) 2020 2021 2022 2023 2024 Thereafter Total Assets Available-for-sale debt securities $15,012 $1,453 $5 $3 $4 $23 $16,500 $16,500Average interest rate 1.88% 1.98% 2.04% 3.50% 3.53% 2.18% Liabilities Fixed rate long-term debt, including current portion(1): $2,500 $2,250 $1,500 $750 $1,750 $16,000 $24,750 $27,298Average interest rate 2.51% 4.44% 2.82% 2.50% 3.70% 4.21% _________________________________________(1)Amounts represent principal balances. In addition to the fixed rate long-term debt, we have a $2.5 billion five-year revolving credit facility that matures in May 2021. There were no amounts outstanding under the five-year revolving credit facility as of December 31, 2019. See Note 12. Debt and Credit Facilities of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information.Market Price Risk We hold shares of common stock of certain publicly traded biotechnology companies primarily in connection with license and collaboration agreements. These equity securities are measured at fair value with any changes in fair value recognized in earnings. The fair value of these equity securities was approximately $3.8 billion and $881 million as of December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively. Changes in fair value of these equity securities are impacted by the volatility of the stock market and changes in general economic conditions, among other factors. A hypothetical 20% increase or decrease in the stock prices of these equity securities would increase or decrease their fair value at December 31, 2019 and 2018 by approximately $760 million and $176 million, respectively.44",2023-12-30 19:04:26.923201

Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” of our 2019 Form 10-K filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”), and is incorporated by reference into this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Our Consolidated Financial Statements have been prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles and are presented in U.S. dollars. MANAGEMENT OVERVIEWGilead Sciences, Inc. (“Gilead”, “we”, “our” or “us”) is a biopharmaceutical company that has pursued and achieved breakthroughs in medicine for more than three decades, with the goal of creating a healthier world for all people. We are committed to advancing innovative medicines to prevent and treat life-threatening diseases, including HIV, viral hepatitis and cancer. We operate in more than 35 countries worldwide, with headquarters in Foster City, California. Our portfolio of marketed products includes AmBisome®, Atripla®, Biktarvy®, Cayston®, Complera®, Descovy®, Descovy for PrEP®, Emtriva®, Epclusa®, Eviplera®, Genvoya®, Harvoni®, Hepsera®, Jyseleca®, Letairis®, Odefsey®, Ranexa®, Sovaldi®, Stribild®, TecartusTM, Trodelvy®, Truvada®, Truvada for PrEP®, Tybost®, Veklury®, Vemlidy®, Viread®, Vosevi®, Yescarta® and Zydelig®. The approval status of Jyseleca varies worldwide, and Jyseleca is not approved in the United States. We also sell and distribute authorized generic versions of Epclusa and Harvoni in the United States through our separate subsidiary, Asegua Therapeutics, LLC. In addition, we sell and distribute certain products through our corporate partners under collaborative agreements.2020 Business HighlightsOur financial performance was strong in 2020, despite the global impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, which is a clear reflection of the solid underlying fundamentals of our business driven by the HIV franchise and the increased demand we saw for Veklury amid the COVID-19 pandemic. We also continued to expand and strengthen our commercial portfolio and clinical pipeline across various therapeutic areas to drive future growth potential. •In April, we acquired Forty Seven, Inc. (“Forty Seven”) for approximately $4.7 billion, gaining an investigational drug candidate, magrolimab, which is currently in Phase 2/3 clinical studies for a number of hematological cancers, including myelodysplastic syndrome, acute myeloid leukemia, non-Hodgkin lymphoma and solid tumors. •In October, we acquired Immunomedics, Inc. (“Immunomedics”) for approximately $20.6 billion and gained Trodelvy, a Trop-2-directed antibody-drug conjugate, which was granted accelerated approval by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (“FDA”) for the treatment of adult patients with metastatic triple-negative breast cancer (“mTNBC”). Trodelvy has potential broader applicability for multiple tumor types, and is being studied as a monotherapy and combination agent for additional tumor types, including HR+/HER2- breast cancer, urothelial cancer, non-small cell lung cancer and other solid tumors.•In December, we entered into a definitive agreement to acquire MYR GmbH. Upon closing, which is subject to regulatory clearances and other conditions, the acquisition will provide us with Hepcludex® (bulevirtide), which was conditionally approved by the European Medicines Agency (“EMA”) for the treatment for chronic hepatitis delta virus (“HDV”) in July 2020.•We significantly expanded our oncology portfolio through licensing, strategic collaboration as well as equity investments with our third-party collaboration partners. Additional information is included in Note 11. Collaborations and Other Arrangements of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.In addition to the assets we acquired pursuant to our strategic transactions, we developed several other therapies and treatments in our portfolio: Jyseleca, Tecartus and Veklury, the first FDA-approved antiviral therapy for COVID-19.

The increase was partially offset by lower sales volume of our Truvada (emtricitabine (“FTC”) and tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (“TDF”))-based products primarily due to the loss of exclusivity of Truvada and Atripla in the United States in October 2020, lower sales of HCV products due to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and the expected declines in sales of Letairis and Ranexa after generic entries in the first half of 2019. Net income attributable to Gilead was $123 million or $0.10 per diluted share in 2020, compared to $5.4 billion or $4.22 per diluted share in 2019, primarily due to unfavorable changes in the fair value of our equity investments in Galapagos, the $1.2 billion discrete tax benefit recorded in 2019 related to intra-entity transfers of intangible assets to different tax jurisdictions, higher acquired in-process research and development (“IPR&D”) expenses related to our acquisition of Forty Seven and our collaborations and other investments we entered into during the year, as well as higher acquisition-related expenses.Strategy and Outlook 2021Our purpose is to deliver life-changing medications to patients in need through scientific breakthroughs, innovation and strong operational execution. Our strategic ambitions are to (i) bring 10+ transformative therapies to patients by 2030; (ii) be the biotech employer and partner of choice; and (iii) deliver shareholder value in a sustainable and responsible manner. Our strategic priorities reflect how we will deliver those ambitions: (i) expand internal and external innovation; (ii) strengthen portfolio strategy and decision making; (iii) increase patient benefit and access; and (iv) continue to evolve our culture. In 2021, we will continue to focus on executing our strategy to expand and strengthen our commercial portfolio and clinical pipelines in new therapeutic areas, including oncology and inflammation, while maintaining our leadership in antiviral medications through the continued growth of Biktarvy, the development of lenacapavir, the expansion of our viral hepatitis business and our on-going efforts to develop safe and effective antivirals to patients suffering from viral infections. Beyond expanding our products and pipeline, we also continue to focus on our employees, the evolution of our culture and our efforts to promote racial equity.The COVID-19 pandemic continues to impact our business and broader market dynamics. We expect a gradual recovery in underlying market dynamics starting the second quarter 2021. Truvada and Atripla sales are expected to continue to decline in the first quarter of 2021 and beyond as multiple generics are expected to enter the market starting in the second quarter of 2021. Biktarvy, Trodelvy, Vemlidy and cell therapy are expected to be key growth drivers in 2021 absorbing the full year impact of the loss of exclusivity for Truvada and Atripla in the United States. Veklury sales are generated in a highly dynamic and complex global environment, which continues to evolve. As a result, Veklury sales are subject to significant volatility and uncertainty. Future product demand will depend on the nature of the COVID-19 pandemic, including duration of the pandemic, infection rates, hospitalizations, and availability of alternative therapies and vaccines being developed. The acquisition of 35Immunomedics will continue to contribute to our revenue growth in 2021. Our capital allocation priorities remain unchanged from 2020 and we plan to prioritize investment in our business and R&D pipeline and maintain a rigorous focus on disciplined expense management.Our ability to deliver on our strategy and 2021 objectives is subject to a number of uncertainties, including, but not limited to, the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic, which remains unpredictable; the continuation of an uncertain global macroeconomic environment; our ability to realize the potential benefits of our acquisitions, collaborations or licensing arrangements; our ability to initiate, progress or complete clinical trials within currently anticipated timeframes; the possibility of unfavorable results from new and ongoing clinical trials; additional pricing pressures from payers and competitors; higher than anticipated effects of the loss of exclusivity from Truvada and Atripla; slower than anticipated growth in Biktarvy, Trodelvy, Vemlidy and cell therapy products; an increase in discounts, chargebacks and rebates due to ongoing contracts and future negotiations with commercial and government payers; market share and price erosion caused by the introduction of generics; loss of exclusivity of our products; inaccuracies in our HCV patient start estimates; potential government actions that could have the effect of lowering prices; a larger-than anticipated shift in payer mix to more highly discounted payer segment; and volatility in foreign currency exchange rates.RESULTS OF OPERATIONSTotal Revenues The following table summarizes the period-over-period changes in our revenues:(In millions, except percentages)2020Change2019Change2018Product sales:HIV products$16,938 3 %$16,438 12 %$14,627 HCV products2,064 (30)%2,936 (20)%3,686 Veklury2,811 NM— NM— Cell therapy products607 33 %456 73 %264 Trodelvy49 NM— NM— Other Products1,886 (18)%2,289 (26)%3,100 Total product sales24,355 10 %22,119 2 %21,677 Royalty, contract and other revenues334 1 %330 (27)%450 Total revenues$24,689 10 %$22,449 1 %$22,127 ________________________________NM - Not Meaningful2020 Compared to 2019Total Product SalesTotal product sales increased by 10% to $24.4 billion in 2020, compared to $22.1 billion in 2019, primarily due to Veklury sales and higher product sales in our HIV products, including the continued patient uptake of Biktarvy and growth of Descovy for PrEP. The increase was partially offset by lower sales volume of our Truvada (FTC/TDF)-based products primarily due to the loss of exclusivity of Truvada and Atripla in the United States in October 2020, lower HCV sales due to lower patient starts due to the COVID-19 pandemic and the expected declines in sales of Letairis and Ranexa after generic entries in the first half of 2019.HIV Product SalesHIV product sales increased by 3% to $16.9 billion in 2020, compared to $16.4 billion in 2019, primarily due to the continued patient uptake of Biktarvy and growth of Descovy for PrEP, partially offset by lower sales volume of our Truvada (FTC/TDF)-based products driven by the loss of exclusivity of Truvada and Atripla in the United States in October 2020 and lower average net selling price driven by unfavorable payer mix primarily due to higher public health service utilization. Our HIV franchise, including PrEP was also unfavorably impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic. HIV product sales in 2019 included favorable net adjustments primarily due to government rebates and discounts.Descovy (FTC/TAF)-based product sales increased in all major markets in 2020 compared to 2019. The increase in the United States was primarily due to the continued patient uptake of Biktarvy and growth of Descovy for PrEP, partially offset by lower sales volume of Genvoya. The increase in Europe and other international locations was primarily due to higher sales volume of Biktarvy, partially offset by lower sales volume of Genvoya.36Truvada (FTC/TDF)-based product sales decreased in the United States and Europe in 2020 compared to 2019. The decrease in the United States was primarily due to lower sales volume driven by the loss of exclusivity of Truvada and Atripla in October 2020 and patients switching to regimens containing FTC/TAF. We expect Truvada sales to continue to decline in 2021 and beyond as multiple generics are expected to enter the market starting in the second quarter 2021. The decrease in European sales was primarily due to lower sales volume as a result of the broader availability of generic versions of Truvada and patients switching to regimens containing FTC/TAF.HCV Product SalesHCV product sales decreased by 30% to $2.1 billion in 2020, compared to $2.9 billion in 2019, primarily due to lower sales volume driven by lower patient starts in the United States and Europe attributable to the COVID-19 pandemic and the continuing decline of total market patient starts unrelated to the pandemic, as well as lower average net selling price reflecting higher sales return provisions and discounts. HCV product sales in 2019 included favorable net adjustments primarily due to government rebates and discounts.The decrease in HCV product sales in the United States and Europe in 2020 compared to 2019 was primarily due to lower patient starts, including declines attributable to a decrease in health care provider visits and screenings due to the COVID-19 pandemic as well as lower average net selling price. The decrease in Europe was also impacted by favorable net adjustments primarily due to government rebates and discounts in 2019, which did not reoccur in 2020. The decrease in HCV product sales in other international locations in 2020 compared to 2019 was primarily due to lower sales volume.VekluryVeklury generated $2.8 billion in sales in 2020 primarily in the United States and Europe, reflecting higher hospitalization and treatment rates due to the fourth quarter COVID-19 surge. Cell Therapy Product SalesCell therapy product sales, which include Yescarta and Tecartus, increased by 33% to $607 million in 2020, compared to $456 million in 2019, primarily due to the continued uptake of Yescarta in Europe and the third quarter 2020 product launch of Tecartus in the United States. TrodelvyTrodelvy generated $49 million in sales in the United States, following our acquisition of Immunomedics on October 23, 2020.Other Product SalesOther product sales, which include Vemlidy, Viread, Letairis, Ranexa, Zydelig, AmBisome, Cayston and Jyseleca, decreased by 18% to $1.9 billion in 2020, compared to $2.3 billion in 2019, primarily due to the expected declines in sales of Letairis and Ranexa after generic entries in the first half of 2019, partially offset by higher sales volume of Vemlidy in other international locations.Gross-to-Net DeductionsWe record product sales net of estimated government and other rebates and chargebacks, cash discounts for prompt payment, distributor fees, sales return provisions and other related costs. These deductions to product sales are generally referred to as gross-to-net (“GTN”) deductions, which totaled $15.3 billion, or 39% of gross product sales in 2020, compared to $15.3 billion, or 41% of gross product sales in 2019. Of the $15.3 billion in 2020, $13.0 billion or 33% of gross product sales was related to government and other rebates and chargebacks, $1.7 billion was related to cash discounts for prompt payment, distributor fees and other related costs and $572 million was related to sales return provisions.Product Sales by Geographic AreaOf our total product sales, 26% and 25% were generated outside the United States in 2020 and 2019, respectively. We faced exposure to movements in foreign currency exchange rates, primarily in the Euro. We used foreign currency exchange contracts to hedge a percentage of our foreign currency exposure. Foreign currency exchange, net of hedges, had an unfavorable impact on our product sales of $29 million in 2020, based on a comparison using foreign currency exchange rates from 2019.Product sales in the United States increased by 10% to $18.1 billion in 2020, compared to $16.6 billion in 2019, primarily due to sales of Veklury, the continued patient uptake of Biktarvy and growth of Descovy for PrEP, partially offset by decreases in sales of Truvada (FTC/TDF)-based products driven by the loss of exclusivity of Truvada and Atripla in the United States in October 2020. The increase was also partially offset by lower sales volume of Letairis and Ranexa and lower sales of our HCV products. The decrease in sales of our HCV products was primarily due to lower patient starts and average net selling price as discussed above.37Product sales in Europe increased by 9% to $3.9 billion in 2020, compared to $3.6 billion in 2019, primarily due to sales of Veklury, and the continued patient uptake of Biktarvy and Yescarta. The increase was partially offset by lower patient starts and average net selling price as discussed above. Product sales in Europe in 2019 included favorable net adjustments primarily due to government rebates and discounts.Product sales in other international locations increased by 17% to $2.3 billion in 2020, compared to $2.0 billion in 2019, primarily due to higher sales volumes of Biktarvy, Veklury and Vemlidy.The following table summarizes the period-over-period changes in our product sales: (In millions, except percentages)2020Change2019Change2018HIV ProductsDescovy (FTC/TAF) Based ProductsBiktarvy – U.S.$6,095 44 %$4,225 NM$1,144 Biktarvy – Europe735 99 %370 NM39 Biktarvy – Other International429 NM143 NM1 7,259 53 %4,738 NM1,184 Descovy – U.S.1,526 42 %1,078 (11)%1,217 Descovy – Europe197 (23)%255 (17)%308 Descovy – Other International138 (17)%167 NM56 1,861 24 %1,500 (5)%1,581 Genvoya – U.S.2,605 (13)%2,984 (18)%3,631 Genvoya – Europe490 (26)%664 (16)%794 Genvoya – Other International243 (14)%283 42 %199 3,338 (15)%3,931 (15)%4,624 Odefsey – U.S.1,172 (1)%1,180 (5)%1,242 Odefsey – Europe450 3 %438 31 %335 Odefsey – Other International50 35 %37 76 %21 1,672 1 %1,655 4 %1,598 Revenue share – Symtuza(1) – U.S.331 33 %249 NM27 Revenue share – Symtuza(1) – Europe149 15 %130 NM52 Revenue share – Symtuza(1) – Other International8 NM— NM— 488 29 %379 NM79 Total Descovy (FTC/TAF) Based Products – U.S.11,729 21 %9,716 34 %7,261 Total Descovy (FTC/TAF) Based Products – Europe2,021 9 %1,857 22 %1,528 Total Descovy (FTC/TAF) Based Products – Other International868 38 %630 NM277 14,618 20 %12,203 35 %9,066 Truvada (FTC/TDF) Based ProductsAtripla – U.S.307 (39)%501 (48)%967 Atripla – Europe21 (65)%60 (54)%131 Atripla – Other International21 (46)%39 (64)%108 349 (42)%600 (50)%1,206 Complera / Eviplera – U.S.89 (44)%160 (42)%276 Complera / Eviplera – Europe159 (26)%214 (35)%327 Complera / Eviplera – Other International21 (34)%32 (36)%50 269 (34)%406 (38)%653 Stribild – U.S.125 (53)%268 (47)%505 Stribild – Europe54 (28)%75 (23)%97 Stribild – Other International17 (35)%26 (38)%42 196 (47)%369 (43)%644 Truvada – U.S.1,376 (48)%2,640 1 %2,605 Truvada – Europe27 (73)%101 (61)%260 Truvada – Other International45 (38)%72 (45)%132 1,448 (49)%2,813 (6)%2,997 Total Truvada (FTC/TDF) Based Products – U.S.1,897 (47)%3,569 (18)%4,353 Total Truvada (FTC/TDF) Based Products – Europe261 (42)%450 (45)%815 Total Truvada (FTC/TDF) Based Products – Other International104 (38)%169 (49)%332 2,262 (46)%4,188 (24)%5,500 38Other HIV(2) – U.S.25 (17)%30 (25)%40 Other HIV(2) – Europe5 — %5 (29)%7 Other HIV(2) – Other International28 NM12 (14)%14 58 23 %47 (23)%61 Total HIV – U.S.13,651 3 %13,315 14 %11,654 Total HIV – Europe2,287 (1)%2,312 (2)%2,350 Total HIV – Other International1,000 23 %811 30 %623 16,938 3 %16,438 12 %14,627 HCV ProductsLedipasvir / Sofosbuvir(3) – U.S.92 (71)%312 (61)%802 Ledipasvir / Sofosbuvir(3) – Europe29 (59)%71 (51)%144 Ledipasvir / Sofosbuvir(3) – Other International151 (42)%260 (6)%276 272 (58)%643 (47)%1,222 Sofosbuvir / Velpatasvir(4) – U.S.864 (11)%971 4 %934 Sofosbuvir / Velpatasvir(4) – Europe337 (39)%553 (15)%654 Sofosbuvir / Velpatasvir(4) – Other International398 (10)%441 17 %378 1,599 (19)%1,965 — %1,966 Other HCV(5) – U.S.132 (27)%182 (37)%287 Other HCV(5) – Europe48 (59)%118 20 %98 Other HCV(5) – Other International13 (54)%28 (75)%113 193 (41)%328 (34)%498 Total HCV – U.S.1,088 (26)%1,465 (28)%2,023 Total HCV – Europe414 (44)%742 (17)%896 Total HCV – Other International562 (23)%729 (5)%767 2,064 (30)%2,936 (20)%3,686 VekluryVeklury – U.S.2,026 NM— NM— Veklury – Europe607 NM— NM— Veklury – Other International178 NM— NM— 2,811 NM— NM— Cell Therapy ProductsYescarta – U.S.362 (3)%373 42 %263 Yescarta – Europe191 NM83 NM1 Yescarta – Other International10 NM— NM— 563 23 %456 73 %264 Tecartus – U.S.34 NM— NM— Tecartus – Europe10 NM— NM— Tecartus – Other International— NM— NM— 44 NM— NM— Total Cell Therapy – U.S.396 6 %373 42 %263 Total Cell Therapy – Europe201 NM83 NM1 Total Cell Therapy – Other International10 NM— NM— 607 33 %456 73 %264 Trodelvy -

Not MeaningfulCost of Goods Sold and Product Gross MarginIn 2020, cost of goods sold decreased by $103 million compared to 2019, primarily due to the 2019 inventory write-down charges of $649 million, of which $547 million was related to slow moving and excess raw material and work in process inventory primarily due to lower long-term demand for our HCV products. The decrease in cost of goods sold was partially offset by higher manufacturing ramp-up expenses related to Veklury as a treatment for COVID-19 and acquisition-related expenses from amortization of finite-lived intangible assets and inventory step-up charges, as well as accelerated stock-based compensation expenses related to our acquisition of Immunomedics. In addition, royalty expenses decreased by $126 million in 2020, compared to 2019, primarily due to lower sales of products containing elvitegravir, Letairis and Atripla. In 2020, product gross margin increased compared to 2019, primarily due to factors described above. Research and Development Expenses R&D expenses consist primarily of clinical studies performed by contract research organizations, materials and supplies, payments under collaborative and other arrangements including milestone payments, licenses and fees, expense reimbursements to the collaboration partners, personnel costs including salaries, benefits and stock-based compensation expense, and overhead allocations consisting of various support and infrastructure costs.40We do not track total R&D expenses by product candidate, therapeutic area or development phase. However, we manage our R&D expenses by identifying the R&D activities we anticipate will be performed during a given period and then prioritizing efforts based on scientific data, probability of technical and regulatory successful development, market potential, available human and capital resources and other considerations. We continually review our R&D projects based on unmet medical need and, as necessary, reallocate resources among our internal R&D portfolio and external opportunities that we believe will best support the long-term growth of our business.The following table provides a breakout of our R&D expenses by major cost type:(In millions, except percentages)2020Change2019Change2018Clinical studies and outside services$2,317 32 %$1,750 5 %$1,665 Personnel, infrastructure and other expenses2,260 12 %2,016 7 %1,876 Stock-based compensation expenses462 60 %289 (24)%379 Total$5,039 24 %$4,055 3 %$3,920 In 2020, R&D expenses increased by $1.0 billion compared to 2019, primarily due to higher clinical trial expenses related to the investigation of remdesivir as a treatment for COVID-19 including material costs, the fourth quarter charge of $190 million (€160 million) in connection with the agreement to amend the existing arrangement with Galapagos for the commercialization and development of Jyseleca, accelerated stock-based compensation expenses of $166 million related to our acquisitions of Immunomedics and Forty Seven, higher investments in oncology programs including magrolimab, an investigational anti-CD47 monoclonal antibody, and to a lesser extent, Trodelvy, and accruals for milestone payments of $70 million to Pionyr Immunotherapeutics, Inc. (“Pionyr”). The increase was partially offset by lower clinical trial expenses from the completion of certain inflammation programs and lower costs as a result of our pause or postponement of certain clinical trials due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Acquired In-Process Research and Development ExpensesAcquired IPR&D expenses reflect IPR&D impairments as well as the initial costs of externally developed IPR&D projects, acquired directly in a transaction other than a business combination, that do not have an alternative future use, including upfront payments related to various collaborations and the initial costs of rights to IPR&D projects. Beginning in the second quarter of 2020, acquired IPR&D expenses were reported separately from Research and development expenses on our Consolidated Statements of Income. IPR&D assets capitalized are tested for impairment in the fourth quarter of each year, or earlier if impairment indicators exist. No IPR&D impairment charges were recorded in 2020. Acquired IPR&D expenses of $5.9 billion for 2020 were primarily related to our acquisition of Forty Seven as well as collaborations and other investments we entered into during the year with Arcus Biosciences, Inc., Pionyr, Tango Therapeutics, Inc., Tizona Therapeutics, Inc. and Jounce Therapeutics, Inc.Acquired IPR&D expenses of $5.1 billion for 2019 included $3.9 billion in upfront charges related to our global research and development collaboration agreement with Galapagos and the $800 million impairment charge from assets obtained in our Kite acquisition. Selling, General and Administrative Expenses SG&A expenses relate to sales and marketing, finance, human resources, legal and other administrative activities, including information technology investments. Expenses consist primarily of personnel costs, facilities and overhead costs, outside marketing, advertising and legal expenses and other general and administrative costs. SG&A expenses also include the Branded Prescription Drug (“BPD”) fee. In the United States, we, along with other pharmaceutical manufacturers of branded drug products, are required to pay a portion of the BPD fee, which is estimated based on select government sales during the prior year as a percentage of total industry government sales and is trued-up upon receipt of invoices from the Internal Revenue Service.In 2020, SG&A expenses increased by $770 million compared to 2019, primarily due to accelerated stock-based compensation expenses of $204 million related to our acquisitions of Immunomedics and Forty Seven, a $97 million charge related to a previously disclosed legal settlement, increased corporate grants, costs associated with the commercialization efforts for Veklury and to a lesser extent, Trodelvy, higher marketing expenses related to Biktarvy and donations of remdesivir. The increases were partially offset by lower travel and other spend due to the COVID-19 pandemic.BPD fee expenses were $198 million, $247 million and $229 million in 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively. BPD fee expenses are not tax-deductible.41Other Income (Expense), Net and Interest ExpenseThe following table summarizes the period-over-period changes in our Other income (expense), net and Interest expense:(In millions, except percentages)2020Change2019Change2018Other income (expense), net$(1,418)NM$1,868 NM$676 Interest expense$(984)(1)%$(995)(8)%$(1,077)_______________________________NM - Not MeaningfulThe unrealized losses primarily relating to our investments in Galapagos unfavorably impacted Other income (expense), net in 2020, compared to unrealized gains in 2019.Income Taxes The following table summarizes the period-over-period changes in our income tax expense (benefit):(In millions, except percentages)202020192018Income before income taxes$1,669 $5,160 $7,799 Income tax expense (benefit)$1,580 $(204)$2,339 Effective tax rate94.7 %(4.0)%30.0 %Our effective tax rate increased in 2020, compared to 2019, primarily due to a $4.5 billion acquired IPR&D charge recorded in connection with our acquisition of Forty Seven, $511 million of certain other acquired IPR&D charges and $1.8 billion of unfavorable changes in the fair value of our equity investments in Galapagos that are non-deductible for tax purposes. The 2019 effective tax rate included a $1.2 billion discrete tax benefit related to intra-entity intangible asset transfers to different tax jurisdictions. LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCESThe following table summarizes our cash, cash equivalents, and marketable debt securities and working capital:December 31,(In millions)20202019Cash, cash equivalents and marketable debt securities$7,910 $25,840 Working capital$4,599 $20,537 Cash, Cash Equivalents and Marketable Debt SecuritiesCash, cash equivalents and marketable debt securities as of December 31, 2020, decreased by $17.9 billion, or 69%, compared to December 31, 2019. During 2020, we generated $8.2 billion in operating cash flow, utilized $25.7 billion on acquisitions, including IPR&D, net of cash acquired, issued senior unsecured notes in an aggregate principal amount of $7.2 billion, net of issuance costs, borrowed an aggregate principal amount of $1.0 billion under a three-year term loan facility, repaid $2.5 billion of principal amount of debt, paid cash dividends of $3.4 billion and utilized $1.6 billion on repurchases of common stock. In January 2021, we repaid $1.0 billion of senior unsecured notes prior to the April 2021 maturity.We may choose to repay certain of our long-term debt obligations prior to their maturity dates based on our assessment of current and long-term liquidity and capital requirements. Our acquisition of MYR GmbH is expected to close in the first quarter of 2021. Per the agreement, we will make a consideration payment of approximately €1.2 billion in cash (or approximately $1.4 billion) upon closing.Working CapitalWorking capital, which is current assets less current liabilities, decreased by $15.9 billion, or 78%, compared to December 31, 2019, primarily due to the utilization of significant cash, cash equivalents and marketable debt securities for our acquisitions of Immunomedics and Forty Seven as noted above and reclassifications of senior unsecured notes from Long-term debt, net. The decrease was partially offset by increased accounts receivables due to Veklury sales and the reclassification of a portion of our Galapagos equity investments from Other long-term assets. Accounts receivable increased by $1.3 billion, compared to December 31, 2019, primarily reflecting increased sales driven by Veklury due to COVID-19 surge in the fourth quarter of 2020. Other accrued liabilities increased by $1.3 billion compared to December 31, 2019, primarily due to a reclassification from long-term income taxes payable for certain tax payments expected to be made within a year.42Cash FlowsThe following table summarizes our cash flow activities:(In millions)202020192018Net cash provided by (used in): Operating activities$8,168 $9,144 $8,400 Investing activities$(14,615)$(7,817)$14,355 Financing activities$770 $(7,634)$(12,318)Operating ActivitiesCash provided by operating activities represents the cash receipts and disbursements related to all of our activities other than investing and financing activities. Operating cash flow is derived by adjusting our net income for non-cash items and changes in operating assets and liabilities. Cash provided by operating activities decreased by $976 million to $8.2 billion in 2020 compared to 2019. The decrease was primarily the result of changes in working capital reflecting increases in accounts receivable from the fourth quarter 2020 Veklury sales and certain tax payments made to taxing authorities.Investing ActivitiesCash used in / provided by investing activities primarily consists of purchases, sales and maturities of our marketable debt securities, capital expenditures, acquisitions, including IPR&D, net of cash acquired, purchases of equity securities and other investments. Cash used in investing activities was $14.6 billion in 2020 compared to $7.8 billion in 2019. The change in cash used in / provided by investing activities was due to $25.7 billion of payments made primarily related to our acquisitions of Immunomedics and Forty Seven in 2020, compared to $4.3 billion of payments made primarily related to our collaboration with and equity investments in Galapagos in 2019.Financing ActivitiesThe change in cash provided by / used in financing activities in 2020 compared to 2019, was primarily due to $7.2 billion in proceeds from the September 2020 senior unsecured notes offering, net of issuance costs and $995 million borrowed under a three-year term loan facility, net of issuance costs in October 2020 in connection with our acquisition of Immunomedics.Debt and Credit FacilitiesThe summary of our borrowings under various financing arrangements is included in Note 12. Debt and Credit Facilities of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. We may choose to repay certain of our long-term debt obligations prior to maturity dates based on our assessment of current and long-term liquidity and capital requirements.Senior Unsecured Notes OfferingIn September 2020, in connection with our acquisition of Immunomedics, we issued senior unsecured notes consisting of (i) $500 million principal amount of floating rate notes due September 2021 and $500 million principal amount of floating rate notes due September 2023; and (ii) $2.0 billion principal amount of 0.75% senior notes due September 2023, $750 million principal amount of 1.20% senior notes due October 2027, $1.0 billion principal amount of 1.65% senior notes due October 2030, $1.0 billion principal amount of 2.60% senior notes due October 2040 and $1.5 billion principal amount of 2.80% senior notes due October 2050.Senior Unsecured Notes RepaymentsIn 2020 and 2019, we repaid at maturity $2.5 billion and $2.8 billion principal amount of senior unsecured notes, respectively. In January 2021, we repaid $1.0 billion of senior unsecured notes prior to the April 2021 maturity.Term Loan FacilityIn October 2020, in connection with our acquisition of Immunomedics, we borrowed an aggregate principal amount of $1.0 billion under a three-year term loan facility (“Term Loan Facility”).Liability Related to Future RoyaltiesIn connection with our acquisition of Immunomedics, we assumed a liability related to a funding arrangement, which was originally entered into by Immunomedics and RPI Finance Trust (“RPI”). The liability related to future royalties was primarily included in Long-term debt, net on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. See Note 6. Acquisitions of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information.43Credit FacilityIn June 2020, we terminated our $2.5 billion revolving credit facility maturing in May 2021 (the “2016 Revolving Credit Facility”) and entered into a new $2.5 billion revolving credit facility maturing in June 2025 (the “2020 Revolving Credit Facility”), which had terms substantially similar to the 2016 Revolving Credit Facility. The 2020 Revolving Credit Facility can be used for working capital requirements and for general corporate purposes, including, without limitation, acquisitions. As of December 31, 2020 and 2019, there were no amounts outstanding under these revolving credit facilities. We are required to comply with certain covenants under our notes indentures, and as of December 31, 2020, we were not in violation of any covenants.Capital Return ProgramThe details of our Stock Repurchase Programs and Dividends are included in Note 15. Stockholders’ Equity of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.Stock Repurchase ProgramsIn the first quarter of 2016, our Board of Directors authorized a $12.0 billion stock repurchase program (“2016 Program”), under which repurchases may be made in the open market or in privately negotiated transactions. We started repurchases under the 2016 Program in April 2016.We purchased 22 million and 26 million shares of our common stock under the 2016 Program for $1.6 billion and $1.7 billion in 2020 and 2019, respectively. In the first quarter of 2020, our Board of Directors authorized a new $5.0 billion stock repurchase program (“2020 Program”), which will commence upon the completion of the 2016 Program. Purchases under the 2020 Program may be made in the open market or in privately negotiated transactions.As of December 31, 2020, the remaining authorized repurchase amount from both programs was $6.8 billion.DividendsWe declared and paid quarterly cash dividends for an aggregate amount of $3.4 billion or $2.72 per share of our common stock and $3.2 billion or $2.52 per share of our common stock in 2020 and 2019, respectively.On February 4, 2021, we announced that our Board of Directors declared a quarterly cash dividend increase of 4.4% from $0.68 to $0.71 per share of our common stock, with a payment date of March 30, 2021 to all stockholders of record as of the close of business on March 15, 2021. Future dividends are subject to declaration by our Board of Directors.Capital ResourcesWe believe our existing capital resources, supplemented by cash flows generated from our operations, will be adequate to satisfy our capital needs for the foreseeable future. Our future capital requirements will depend on many factors, including but not limited to the following:•the commercial performance of our current and future products;•the progress and scope of our R&D efforts, including preclinical studies and clinical trials;•the cost, timing and outcome of regulatory reviews;•the expansion of our sales and marketing capabilities;•the possibility of acquiring additional manufacturing capabilities or office facilities;•the possibility of acquiring other companies or new products;•debt service requirements;•the establishment of additional collaborative relationships with other companies; and•costs associated with the defense, settlement and adverse results of government investigations and litigation.We may in the future require additional funding, which could be in the form of proceeds from equity or debt financings. If such funding is required, we cannot guarantee that it will be available to us on favorable terms, if at all.44CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES, ESTIMATES AND JUDGMENTSThe discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based on our Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, which have been prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses and related disclosures. On an ongoing basis, we evaluate and base our estimates on historical experience and on various other market specific and other relevant assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ significantly from these estimates. We believe the following critical accounting policies reflect the more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our Consolidated Financial Statements. Revenue Recognition We recognize revenue from product sales when control of the product transfers, generally upon shipment or delivery, to the customer, or in certain cases, upon the corresponding sales by our customer to a third party. The revenues are recognized, net of estimated government and other rebates and chargebacks, cash discounts for prompt payment, distributor fees, sales return provisions and other related deductions. These deductions to product sales are referred to as GTN deductions, and are estimated and recorded in the period in which the related product sales occur. Variable consideration is included in the net sales price only to the extent a significant reversal in the amount of cumulative revenue recognized is not probable of occurring when the uncertainty associated with the variable consideration is subsequently resolved.Government and other rebates and chargebacks represent the majority of our GTN deductions and are subject to a complex estimation process, which requires significant judgment by management in part due to the lag between the date of the product sales and the date the related rebates or chargeback claims are settled. Government and other rebates and chargebacks include amounts payable to payers and healthcare providers under various programs, and may vary by product, by payer and individual payer plans. For qualified programs that can purchase our products through wholesalers or other distributors at a lower contractual price, the wholesalers or distributors charge back to us the difference between their acquisition cost and the lower contractual price. Rebates and chargebacks are estimated primarily based on product sales, and expected payer mix and discount rates, which require significant estimates and judgment. Additionally, in developing our estimates of government and other rebates and chargebacks, we consider the following factors: •historical and estimated payer mix;•statutory discount requirements and contractual terms;•historical claims experience and processing time lags;•estimated patient population;•known market events or trends; •market research;•channel inventory data obtained from our major U.S. wholesalers; and•other pertinent internal or external information.We assess and update our estimates every quarter to reflect actual claims and other current information. Our actual government and other rebates and chargebacks claimed for prior periods have varied from our estimates by less than 3% of the amounts deducted from product sales for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019. We believe the methodology that we use to estimate our government and other rebates and chargebacks is reasonable and appropriate given the current facts and circumstances. However, actual results may differ significantly from our estimates.Government and other chargebacks that are payable to our direct customers are classified as reductions of Accounts receivable in our Consolidated Balance Sheets and totaled $552 million and $655 million at December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. See Note 10. Other Financial Information of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information. Government and other rebates that are payable to third party payers and healthcare providers are generally recorded in Accrued government and other rebates on our Consolidated Balance Sheets and totaled $3.5 billion at December 31, 2020 and 2019. The allowance for sales returns is generally recorded in Other accrued liabilities on our Consolidated Balance Sheets and totaled $587 million and $137 million at December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. The increase in the allowance for sales returns in 2020 reflects the estimated Veklury sales returns and an increase of HCV and HIV sales return provisions.45The following table summarizes the consolidated activities and ending balances in our government and other rebates and chargebacks accounts:(in millions)Balance at Beginning of YearDecrease/(Increase) to Product SalesPaymentsBalance at End of YearYear ended December 31, 2020: Activity related to 2020 sales$— $13,199 $(9,500)$3,699 Activity related to sales prior to 20204,108 (235)(3,560)313 Total$4,108 $12,964 $(13,060)$4,012 Year ended December 31, 2019: Activity related to 2019 sales$— $13,791 $(9,920)$3,871 Activity related to sales prior to 20194,420 (279)(3,904)237 Total$4,420 $13,512 $(13,824)$4,108 Acquisitions and Valuation of IntangiblesWe make certain judgments to determine whether transactions should be accounted for as acquisitions of assets or as business combinations. If it is determined that substantially all of the fair value of gross assets acquired in a transaction is concentrated in a single asset (or a group of similar assets), the transaction is treated as an acquisition of assets. We evaluate the inputs, processes, and outputs associated with the acquired set of activities. If the assets in a transaction include an input and a substantive process that together significantly contribute to the ability to create outputs, the transaction is treated as an acquisition of a business.We account for business combinations using the acquisition method of accounting, which requires that assets acquired and liabilities assumed generally be recorded at their fair values as of the acquisition date. Excess of consideration over the fair value of net assets acquired is recorded as goodwill. Estimating fair value requires us to make significant judgments and assumptions. We perform impairment testing of goodwill annually, or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that it is more likely than not that the asset is impaired.In transactions accounted for as acquisitions of assets, no goodwill is recorded and contingent consideration such as payments upon achievement of various developmental, regulatory and commercial milestones generally is not recognized at the acquisition date. In an asset acquisition, upfront payments allocated to IPR&D projects at the acquisition date are expensed unless there is an alternative future use. In addition, product development milestones are expensed upon achievement. Valuation of Intangible Assets We have acquired, and expect to continue to acquire, intangible assets through asset acquisition, business combination or consolidation of variable interest entities. The identifiable intangible assets are measured at their respective fair values as of the acquisition date. Intangible assets acquired through business combinations are subject to potential adjustments within the measurement period, which is up to one year from the acquisition date. The fair values of the intangible assets are generally determined using a probability-weighted income approach that discounts expected future cash flows to present value. The estimated net cash flows are discounted using a discount rate that is based on the estimated weighted-average cost of capital for companies with profiles similar to our profile and represents the rate that market participants would use to value the intangible assets. The discounted cash flow models used in valuing these intangible assets require the use of significant estimates and assumptions including but not limited to:•identification of product candidates with sufficient substance requiring separate recognition;•estimates of projected future cash flows including revenues and operating profits related to the products or product candidates;•the probability of technical and regulatory success for unapproved product candidates considering their stages of development;•the time and resources needed to complete the development and approval of product candidates;•appropriate discount rate;•the life of the potential commercialized products and associated risks, including the inherent difficulties and uncertainties in developing a product candidate such as obtaining FDA and other regulatory approvals; and•risks related to the viability of and potential alternative treatments in any future target markets.We believe the fair values used to record intangible assets acquired are based upon reasonable estimates and assumptions given the facts and circumstances as of the related valuation dates. 46Impairment and Amortization of Intangible AssetsIntangible assets related to IPR&D projects acquired in a business combination are capitalized as indefinite-lived intangible assets until the completion or abandonment of the associated R&D efforts. During the period the assets are considered indefinite-lived, they are not amortized. When development is complete, which generally occurs if and when regulatory approval to market a product is obtained, the associated assets would be deemed finite-lived and then be amortized based on their respective estimated useful lives at that point in time primarily on a straight-line basis. Indefinite-lived intangible assets are tested for impairment annually, or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that it is more likely than not that the assets are impaired. Estimates of fair value result from a complex series of judgments about future events and uncertainties and make assumptions at a point in time (acquisition date or subsequent impairment assessment date). Changes in estimates and assumptions, including the timing of product launch, pricing reductions, failure to obtain anticipated regulatory approval, deterioration in U.S. and global financial markets or other unanticipated events and circumstances, may decrease the projected cash flows or increase the discount rate and could potentially result in an impairment charge. The eventual realized value of the acquired IPR&D project may vary from its fair value at the date of acquisition. If the carrying value of an intangible asset exceeds its estimated fair value, an impairment charge is recorded to write down the intangible asset to its estimated fair value. For example, in 2019, we recognized an $800 million impairment charge related to IPR&D projects primarily for the treatment of indolent non-Hodgkin lymphoma due to changes in estimated market opportunities. A high rate of failure is inherent in the discovery and development of new products. For example, in 2018, we concluded that the KITE-585 program acquired in connection with our acquisition of Kite did not justify further efforts based on the totality of the clinical data gathered and discontinued the program. As a result, the carrying value of the IPR&D relating to the KITE-585 program was written down to zero and we recorded an impairment charge of $820 million.Intangible assets are also periodically reviewed for changes in facts or circumstances resulting in a reduction to the estimated useful life of the asset, requiring the acceleration of amortization.See Note 9. Goodwill and Intangible Assets of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information on the impairment charges related to our indefinite-lived IPR&D intangible assets.Legal ContingenciesWe are a party to various legal actions. The most significant of these are described in Note 14. Commitments and Contingencies - Legal Proceedings of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. It is not possible to determine the outcome of these matters. We recognize accruals for such actions to the extent that we conclude that a loss is both probable and reasonably estimable. We accrue for the best estimate of a loss within a range; however, if no estimate in the range is better than any other, then we accrue the minimum amount in the range. If we determine that a loss is reasonably possible and the loss or range of loss can be estimated, we disclose the possible loss. Significant judgment is required in both the determination of probability and the determination as to whether an exposure is reasonably estimable. Because of the inherent uncertainty and unpredictability related to these matters, accruals are based on what we believe to be the best information available at the time of our assessment, including the legal facts and circumstances of the case, status of the proceedings, applicable law and the views of legal counsel. Upon the final resolution of such matters, it is possible that there may be a loss in excess of the amount recorded, and such amounts could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, cash flows or financial position. We periodically reassess these matters when additional information becomes available and adjust our estimates and assumptions when facts and circumstances indicate the need for any changes. We did not have any material accruals in our Consolidated Balance Sheets for such matters as of December 31, 2020 and 2019.Income TaxesWe estimate our income tax provision, including deferred tax assets and liabilities, based on significant management judgment. We evaluate the realization of all or a portion of our deferred tax assets on a quarterly basis. We record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets to the amounts that are more likely than not to be realized. We consider future taxable income, ongoing tax planning strategies and our historical financial performance in assessing the need for a valuation allowance. If we expect to realize deferred tax assets for which we have previously recorded a valuation allowance, we will reduce the valuation allowance in the period in which such determination is first made. We are subject to income taxes in the United States and various foreign jurisdictions including Ireland. Due to economic and political conditions, various countries are actively considering and have made changes to existing tax laws. For example, the United States enacted significant tax reform, and certain provisions of the new law will continue to significantly affect us. We cannot predict the form or timing of potential legislative changes that could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations. In addition, significant judgment is required in determining our worldwide provision for income taxes.47We record liabilities related to uncertain tax positions in accordance with the guidance that clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in an enterprise’s financial statements by prescribing a minimum recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. An adverse resolution of one or more of these uncertain tax positions in any period could have a material impact on the results of operations for that period. See Note 18. Income Taxes of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information.OFF BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTSWe do not have any off balance sheet arrangements as defined in Item 303(a)(4)(ii) of Regulation S-K.CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONSContractual obligations represent future cash commitments related to significant enforceable and legally binding obligations and certain purchase obligations that we are likely to continue regardless of the fact that they may be cancelable. The expected timing and payment amounts presented below are estimated based on existing contracts and do not reflect any future modifications to, or terminations of, existing contracts or anticipated or potential new contracts.The following table summarizes the aggregate maturities of our contractual obligations as of December 31, 2020:Payments due by Period(In millions)Total20212022-20232024-2025ThereafterDebt(1)$46,410 $3,752 $7,595 $5,142 $29,921 Operating lease obligations(2)828 127 234 167 300 Purchase obligations(3)3,872 2,254 1,230 265 123 Transition tax payable(4)4,491 473 1,359 2,659 — Total(5)(6)(7)$55,601 $6,606 $10,418 $8,233 $30,344 _______________________________(1) Debt includes principal and future interest payments of senior unsecured notes and the Term Loan Facility. Interest payments for our fixed rate senior unsecured notes are incurred and calculated based on terms of the related notes. Debt also includes a liability related to future royalty obligations we assumed through the acquisition of Immunomedics. See Note 6. Acquisitions and Note 12. Debt and Credit Facilities of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information. (2) See Note 13. Leases of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information.(3) Amounts primarily relate to active pharmaceutical ingredients (“API”) with minimum purchase commitments and certain inventory-related items, R&D commitments and capital commitments. Significant R&D commitments related to clinical studies performed by contract research organizations (“CRO”s) are excluded from the table as material CRO contracts are cancelable by us.(4) In connection with Tax Reform we recorded a federal income tax payable for transition tax on the mandatory deemed repatriation of foreign earnings that is payable over an eight-year period. The amounts included in the table above represent the remaining federal income tax payable at December 31, 2020.(5) As of December 31, 2020, our long-term income taxes payable includes unrecognized tax benefits, interest and penalties totaling $1.1 billion. Due to the high degree of uncertainty on the timing of future cash settlement and other events that could extinguish these unrecognized tax benefits, we are unable to estimate the period of cash settlement and therefore we have excluded these unrecognized tax benefits from the table above. (6) We have committed to make potential future milestone and other payments to third parties as part of licensing, collaboration, development and other arrangements. Payments under these agreements generally are contingent upon certain future events including achievement of certain developmental, regulatory or commercial milestones. Because the achievement of these events is neither probable nor reasonably estimable and such potential payments have not been recorded in our Consolidated Balance Sheets, they have not been included in the table above. (7) The consideration payment of approximately €1.2 billion in cash (or approximately $1.4 billion) for our acquisition of MYR GmbH, which is expected to close by the end of the first quarter of 2021, is excluded from the table above. See Note 6. Acquisitions of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information.RECENT ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTSThe information required by this item is included in Note 1. Organization and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISKWe are exposed to market risks that may result from changes in foreign currency exchange rates, interest rates, credit risks and market price. To reduce certain of these risks, we enter into various types of foreign currency or interest rate derivative hedging transactions, follow investment guidelines and monitor outstanding receivables as part of our risk management program.48Foreign Currency Exchange Risk We have operations in more than 35 countries worldwide. As a result, our financial results could be significantly affected by factors such as changes in foreign currency exchange rates or weak economic conditions in the foreign markets in which we distribute our products. Our operating results are exposed to changes in foreign currency exchange rates between the U.S. dollar and various foreign currencies, the most significant of which is the Euro. When the U.S. dollar strengthens against these currencies, the relative value of sales made in the respective foreign currency decreases. Conversely, when the U.S. dollar weakens against these currencies, the relative amounts of such sales increase. Overall, we are a net receiver of foreign currencies and, therefore, benefit from a weaker U.S. dollar and are adversely affected by a stronger U.S. dollar relative to those foreign currencies in which we transact significant amounts of business. Approximately 26% of our product sales were denominated in foreign currencies during 2020. To partially mitigate the impact of changes in currency exchange rates on net cash flows from our foreign currency denominated sales, we may enter into foreign currency exchange forward and option contracts. We also hedge certain monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies, which reduces but does not eliminate our exposure to currency fluctuations between the date a transaction is recorded and the date that cash is collected or paid. In general, the market risks of these contracts are offset by corresponding gains and losses on the transactions being hedged. As of December 31, 2020 and 2019, we had open foreign currency forward contracts with notional amounts of $2.4 billion and $2.9 billion, respectively. A hypothetical 10% adverse movement in foreign currency exchange rates compared with the U.S. dollar relative to exchange rates at December 31, 2020 and 2019 would have resulted in a reduction in fair value of these contracts of approximately $249 million and $285 million, respectively, on this date and, if realized, would negatively affect earnings over the remaining life of the contracts. The analysis does not consider the impact that hypothetical changes in foreign currency exchange rates would have on anticipated transactions that these foreign currency sensitive instruments were designed to offset.Interest Rate Risk Our portfolio of available-for-sale debt securities and our senior unsecured notes create an exposure to interest rate risk. With respect to our investment portfolio, we adhere to an investment policy that requires us to limit amounts invested in securities based on credit rating, maturity, industry group and investment type and issuer, except for securities issued by the U.S. government. The goals of our investment policy, in order of priority, are as follows: • safety and preservation of principal and diversification of risk; • liquidity of investments sufficient to meet cash flow requirements; and • competitive after-tax rate of return.

Debt and Credit Facilities of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information. Market Price Risk We hold shares of common stock of certain publicly traded biotechnology companies primarily in connection with license and collaboration agreements. These equity securities are measured at fair value with any changes in fair value recognized in earnings. 49The fair value of these equity securities was approximately $2.4 billion and $3.8 billion as of December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. Changes in fair value of these equity securities are impacted by the volatility of the stock market and changes in general economic conditions, among other factors. A hypothetical 20% increase or decrease in the stock prices of these equity securities would increase or decrease their fair value at December 31, 2020 and 2019 by approximately $478 million and $760 million, respectively.50",2023-12-30 19:04:08.661080

We also sell and distribute authorized generic versions of Epclusa and Harvoni in the United States through our separate subsidiary, Asegua Therapeutics, LLC. In addition, we sell and distribute certain products through our corporate partners under collaborative agreements.Business Highlights(1)We delivered strong financial performance in 2021. Veklury continued to play a critical role in addressing the coronavirus disease 2019 (“COVID-19”) pandemic. Veklury’s performance helped mitigate the impacts of COVID-19 on other parts of the business, including on our HIV and chronic hepatitis C virus (“HCV”) franchises, and the impacts of the October 2020 loss of exclusivity of Truvada and Atripla in the United States. Despite these transitory headwinds, underlying demand for our virology portfolio remained strong, led by the continued growth of our Biktarvy franchise. We also received increased contributions from our oncology franchise, experiencing growth in Trodelvy, as well as our Cell Therapy franchise.33We continued to expand and strengthen both our commercial portfolio and clinical pipeline across therapeutic focus areas to drive future growth potential. During 2021, we announced an additional six filings for regulatory approval. In addition to investing in our internal pipeline programs, we also continued to enter into and leverage our existing strategic collaborations and partnerships, including opting into four additional pipeline assets from our collaboration with Arcus Biosciences, Inc. (“Arcus”) to further develop the foundation for a more sustainable and diversified business.Viral Diseases•In October 2021, U.S. Food and Drug Administration (“FDA”) approved a new low-dose tablet dosage form of Biktarvy for pediatric patients weighing at least 14 kg to less than 25 kg who are virologically suppressed or new to antiretroviral therapy.•In August 2021, our Marketing Authorization Application for lenacapavir, an investigational, long-acting HIV-1 capsid inhibitor, was fully validated and is now under evaluation with the European Medicines Agency (“EMA”).•In June 2021, FDA granted approval of a new oral pellet formulation of Epclusa, expanding the pediatric indication to treat children as young as 3 years of age with chronic HCV. •In June 2021, we submitted a New Drug Application to FDA for lenacapavir, an investigational, long-acting agent in development for the treatment of HIV-1 in people with limited therapy options. •In March 2021, we entered into an agreement with Merck Sharp & Dohme Corp.

The increase also reflects the continued growth of Biktarvy in all geographies and the continued uptake of Trodelvy, Cell Therapy and chronic hepatitis B virus (“HBV”) and HDV products. The increases were partially offset by the decrease in Truvada and Atripla sales in the United States, as expected, primarily due to the continued generic competition following the October 2020 loss of exclusivity in the United States. Net income attributable to Gilead was $6.2 billion or $4.93 diluted earnings per share in 2021, compared to $123 million or $0.10 diluted earnings per share in 2020. The increase was primarily due to lower acquired in-process research and development (“IPR&D”) charges, revenue growth and lower unrealized losses from our equity investments, partially offset by a $1.25 billion charge for a settlement related to bictegravir litigation, and a charge of $625 million related to the Arcus collaboration opt-in. Our acquired IPR&D expenses in 2020 were $5.9 billion primarily related to our acquisition of Forty Seven as well as collaborations and other investments that we entered into during the year with Arcus, Pionyr Immunotherapeutics, Inc. (“Pionyr”), Tango Therapeutics, Inc. (“Tango”), Tizona Therapeutics, Inc. (“Tizona”) and Jounce Therapeutics, Inc. (“Jounce”).Strategy and Outlook 2022Our purpose is to deliver life-changing medications to patients in need through scientific breakthroughs, innovation and strong operational execution. Our strategic ambitions are to (i) bring 10+ transformative therapies to patients by 2030; (ii) be the biotech employer and partner of choice; and (iii) deliver shareholder value in a sustainable and responsible manner. Our strategic priorities reflect how we will deliver those ambitions: (i) expand internal and external innovation; (ii) strengthen portfolio strategy and decision making; (iii) increase patient benefit and access; and (iv) continue to evolve our culture. 35In 2022, we will continue to focus on executing our strategy to expand and diversify our commercial portfolio and clinical pipelines across our three therapeutic focus areas: virology, oncology and inflammation. Specifically, we plan to significantly increase clinical development studies across our novel oncology portfolio while maintaining our leadership in antiviral medications through our work in HIV, hepatitis, the COVID-19 pandemic and emerging viruses. Our collaboration with Arcus provides additional opportunities for us to further develop the foundation for a more sustainable and diversified business. Beyond expanding our products and pipeline, we also continue to focus on our employees, the evolution of our culture and our efforts to promote racial equity and social justice. Additionally, we expect to maintain a rigorous focus on disciplined expense management.While, the COVID-19 pandemic continues to impact our business and broader market dynamics, we expect revenue growth of between 2 – 4% in 2022 product sales, excluding Veklury, as compared to 2021. Our HIV product sales will continue to recover from the COVID-19 pandemic and demonstrate year-over-year growth, as the financial impact of the Truvada and Atripla loss of exclusivity will be largely behind us starting in the second quarter of 2022. We also expect our oncology businesses, including Cell Therapy and Trodelvy, to contribute to our growth.Veklury sales are generated in a highly dynamic and complex global environment, which continues to evolve. As a result, Veklury sales are subject to significant volatility and uncertainty. Future product demand will depend on the nature of the COVID-19 pandemic, including duration, infection rates, hospitalizations, and availability and adoption of alternative therapies and vaccines. While we anticipate a year-over-year decline in Veklury product sales, we expect Veklury to continue to play a key role in the pandemic and contribute meaningfully to our revenue in 2022, more heavily weighted towards the beginning of the year. Our ability to deliver on our strategy is subject to a number of uncertainties, including, but not limited to, the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic, which remains unpredictable; the uncertainty regarding the amount and timing of future Veklury sales; the continuation of an uncertain global macroeconomic environment; our ability to realize the potential benefits of our acquisitions, collaborations or licensing arrangements; our ability to initiate, progress or complete clinical trials within currently anticipated timeframes, including as a result of any current or future holds on clinical trials; the possibility of unfavorable results from new and ongoing clinical trials; our ability to submit new drug applications for new product candidates or expanded indications in the currently anticipated timelines; our ability to receive regulatory approvals in a timely manner or at all; market share and price erosion caused by the introduction of generics; loss of exclusivity of our products; higher than anticipated effects of the loss of exclusivity from Truvada and Atripla; slower than anticipated growth in Biktarvy, Trodelvy, Vemlidy and Cell Therapy products; inaccuracies in our patient start estimates; additional pricing pressures from payers and competitors; an increase in discounts, chargebacks and rebates due to ongoing contracts and future negotiations with commercial and government payers; potential government actions that could have the effect of lowering prices; a larger-than anticipated shift in payer mix to a more highly discounted payer segment; and volatility in foreign currency exchange rates.RESULTS OF OPERATIONSRevenuesThe following table summarizes the period-over-period changes in our revenues:Year Ended December 31, 2021Year Ended December 31, 2020(in millions, except percentages)U.S.EuropeOther InternationalTotalU.S.EuropeOther InternationalTotalChangeProduct sales:HIV$12,828 $2,366 $1,121 $16,315 $13,651 $2,287 $1,000 $16,938 (4)%Veklury3,640 1,095 830 5,565 2,026 607 178 2,811 98 %HCV1,018 421 442 1,881 1,088 414 562 2,064 (9)%HBV/HDV397 104 468 969 380 71 409 860 13 %Cell Therapy542 293 36 871 396 201 10 607 43 %Trodelvy370 10 — 380 49 — — 49 NMOther381 389 257 1,027 551 314 161 1,026 — %Total product sales19,176 4,678 3,154 27,008 18,141 3,894 2,320 24,355 11 %Royalty, contract and other revenues91 196 10 297 76 241 17 334 (11)%Total revenues$19,267 $4,874 $3,164 $27,305 $18,217 $4,135 $2,337 $24,689 11 %________________________________NM - Not Meaningful36Product SalesHIVHIV product sales decreased by 4% to $16.3 billion in 2021, compared to $16.9 billion in 2020, due to the anticipated decline in sales volume of our Truvada (emtricitabine (“FTC”) and tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (“TDF”))-based products driven by the continued generic competition following the October 2020 loss of exclusivity of Truvada and Atripla in the United States. Truvada and Atripla product sales were $1.3 billion lower in 2021, compared to 2020. The decrease was also impacted by lower sales of Genvoya driven by decrease in volume worldwide primarily due to patients switching to Biktarvy. These declines were partially offset by an increase in Biktarvy product sales worldwide driven by higher demand, higher net average selling price driven by favorable changes in estimates of government rebates and discounts in the United States. We expect that our HIV business will continue to recover from the COVID-19 pandemic in 2022. We also expect the impact of the Truvada and Atripla loss of exclusivity will be largely behind us starting in the second quarter of 2022.VekluryVeklury product sales were $5.6 billion in 2021, compared to $2.8 billion in 2020. Veklury became commercially available in the third quarter of 2020, resulting in a partial year of sales in 2020. The increase was also attributable to higher hospital demand worldwide. Sales of Veklury are generally affected by COVID-19 related rates of infections, hospitalizations and vaccinations as well as the availability, uptake and effectiveness of alternative treatments for COVID-19. As a result, future sales of Veklury are difficult to predict.HCVHCV product sales decreased by 9% to $1.9 billion in 2021, compared to $2.1 billion in 2020, primarily due to lower demand driven by fewer patient starts worldwide due to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. The slight increase in HCV sales in Europe in 2021 was due to a favorable change in estimate of government rebates, which offset the revenue decrease associated with lower demand.HBV / HDVHBV and HDV product sales increased by 13% to $969 million in 2021, compared to $860 million in 2020, primarily due to higher Vemlidy product sales due to higher demand in all geographies, partially offset by lower Viread product sales in Other international locations. Hepcludex sales in 2021 were $37 million as launch activities continued across Europe following our first quarter 2021 acquisition of MYR.Cell TherapyCell Therapy product sales, which include Yescarta and Tecartus, increased by 43% to $871 million in 2021, compared to $607 million in 2020. The growth was primarily due to the July 2020 launch of Tecartus in the United States for the treatment of adult patients with relapsed or refractory mantle cell lymphoma (“MCL”) and the December 2020 launch of Tecartus for MCL in Europe, resulting in partial year of sales in 2020. The increase was also driven by continued higher demand for Yescarta worldwide for LBCL and volume growth related to approval of Yescarta for FL in the United States in 2021.TrodelvyTrodelvy product sales increased to $380 million in 2021, compared to $49 million in 2020. We obtained Trodelvy through the fourth quarter 2020 acquisition of Immunomedics, resulting in a partial year of sales in 2020. In addition, 2021 revenues include continued uptake of Trodelvy following the full regulatory approval for metastatic TNBC in the United States and Europe and accelerated approval for metastatic UC in the United States.Other Product SalesOther product sales, which include AmBisome, Cayston, Jyseleca, Letairis, Ranexa and Zydelig, were $1.0 billion in 2021 and remained flat as compared to 2020. AmBisome sales volume increased due to higher demand in geographies outside the United States. The increase was mostly offset by lower Letairis sales in the United States, as anticipated, due to continued generic competition following the loss of exclusivity in 2019.Gross-to-Net DeductionsWe record product sales net of estimated government and other rebates and chargebacks, cash discounts for prompt payment, distributor fees, sales returns and other related costs. These deductions totaled $14.4 billion, or 35% of gross product sales in 2021, compared to $15.3 billion, or 39% of gross product sales in 2020. The reduction is driven by changes in product mix, primarily due to higher Veklury sales in 2021. Of the $14.4 billion in 2021, $12.6 billion, or 30% of gross product sales, was related to government and other rebates and chargebacks and $1.8 billion was related to cash discounts for prompt payment, distributor fees, sales returns and other related costs.37Foreign Currency Exchange ImpactOf our total product sales, 29% and 26% were generated outside the United States in 2021 and 2020, respectively. We generally face exposure to movements in foreign currency exchange rates, primarily in the Euro. We use foreign currency exchange contracts to hedge a portion of our foreign currency exposures. Foreign currency exchange, net of hedges, had a favorable impact on our total product sales of $141 million in 2021, based on a comparison using foreign currency exchange rates from 2020, largely driven by Euro-based product sales.38The following table summarizes the period-over-period changes in our product sales: Year Ended December 31, 2021Year Ended December 31, 2020(in millions, except percentages)U.S.EuropeOther InternationalTotalU.S.EuropeOther InternationalTotalChangeHIV ProductsDescovy (FTC/TAF) Based ProductsBiktarvy$7,049 $969 $606 $8,624 $6,095 $735 $429 $7,259 19 %Descovy1,397 164 139 1,700 1,526 197 138 1,861 (9)%Genvoya2,267 391 221 2,879 2,605 490 243 3,338 (14)%Odefsey1,076 440 52 1,568 1,172 450 50 1,672 (6)%Revenue share - Symtuza(1)355 165 11 531 331 149 8 488 9 %Total Descovy (FTC/TAF) Based Products12,144 2,129 1,029 15,302 11,729 2,021 868 14,618 5 %Truvada (FTC/TDF) Based ProductsAtripla121 12 12 145 307 21 21 349 (58)%Complera/Eviplera102 142 14 258 89 159 21 269 (4)%Stribild132 43 14 189 125 54 17 196 (4)%Truvada314 22 35 371 1,376 27 45 1,448 (74)%Total Truvada (FTC/TDF) Based Products669 219 75 963 1,897 261 104 2,262 (57)%Other HIV(2)15 18 17 50 25 5 28 58 (14)%Total HIV12,828 2,366 1,121 16,315 13,651 2,287 1,000 16,938 (4)%Veklury3,640 1,095 830 5,565 2,026 607 178 2,811 98 %HCV ProductsLedipasvir/Sofosbuvir(3)84 31 97 212 92 29 151 272 (22)%Sofosbuvir/Velpatasvir(4)815 316 331 1,462 864 337 398 1,599 (9)%Other HCV(5)119 74 14 207 132 48 13 193 7 %Total HCV1,018 421 442 1,881 1,088 414 562 2,064 (9)%HBV/HDV ProductsVemlidy384 34 396 814 356 29 272 657 24 %Viread11 28 72 111 14 34 137 185 (40)%Other HBV/HDV(6)2 42 — 44 10 8 — 18 NMTotal HBV/HDV397 104 468 969 380 71 409 860 13 %Cell Therapy ProductsTecartus136 40 — 176 34 10 — 44 NMYescarta406 253 36 695 362 191 10 563 23 %Total Cell Therapy 542 293 36 871 396 201 10 607 43 %Trodelvy370 10 — 380 49 — — 49 NMOther ProductsAmBisome39 274 227 540 61 230 145 436 24 %Letairis206 — — 206 314 — — 314 (34)%Ranexa10 — — 10 9 — — 9 11 %Zydelig26 35 1 62 31 39 2 72 (14)%Other(7)100 80 29 209 136 45 14 195 7 %Total Other 381 389 257 1,027 551 314 161 1,026 — %Total product sales19,176 4,678 3,154 27,008 $18,141 $3,894 $2,320 $24,355 11 %_______________________________NM - Not Meaningful(1) Represents our revenue from cobicistat (“C”), emtricitabine FTC and tenofovir alafenamide (“TAF”) in Symtuza (darunavir/C/FTC/TAF), a fixed dose combination product commercialized by Janssen Sciences Ireland Unlimited Company.(2) Includes Emtriva and Tybost.(3) Amounts consist of sales of Harvoni and the authorized generic version of Harvoni sold by our separate subsidiary, Asegua Therapeutics LLC.(4) Amounts consist of sales of Epclusa and the authorized generic version of Epclusa sold by our separate subsidiary, Asegua Therapeutics LLC.(5) Includes Vosevi and Sovaldi.(6) Includes Hepcludex and Hepsera.(7) Includes Cayston and Jyseleca.39Costs and ExpensesThe following table summarizes the period-over-period changes in our costs and expenses: (In millions, except percentages)20212020ChangeCost of goods sold$6,601 $4,572 44 %Product gross margin75.6 %81.2 %-560 bpsResearch and development (“R&D”) expenses$5,363 $5,039 6 %Acquired IPR&D expenses$177 $5,856 (97)%Selling, general and administrative (“SG&A”) expenses$5,246 $5,151 2 %Product Gross MarginIn 2021, product gross margin decreased to 75.6% as compared to 81.2% in 2020, primarily due to a $1.25 billion charge for a settlement related to bictegravir litigation as well as an increase of $848 million in acquisition-related expenses from amortization of finite-lived intangible assets and recognition of inventory step-up charges primarily driven by our acquisitions of Immunomedics and MYR. Product gross margin was also impacted by higher inventory write-down charges and changes in product mix. The increases were partially offset by lower royalty expenses due to lower sales of products containing emtricitabine and elvitegravir and the reversal of a previously recorded $175 million litigation accrual following a favorable court decision related to axicabtagene ciloleucel.Research and Development ExpensesR&D expenses consist primarily of clinical studies performed by contract research organizations, materials and supplies, payments under collaborative and other arrangements including milestone payments, licenses and fees, expense reimbursements to the collaboration partners, personnel costs including salaries, benefits and stock-based compensation expense, and overhead allocations consisting of various support and infrastructure costs.We manage our R&D expenses by identifying the R&D activities we anticipate will be performed during a given period and then prioritizing efforts based on scientific data, probability of technical and regulatory successful development, market potential, available human and capital resources and other considerations. We continually review our R&D projects based on unmet medical need and, as necessary, reallocate resources among our internal R&D portfolio and external opportunities that we believe will best support the long-term growth of our business.In 2021, R&D expenses increased by $324 million compared to 2020, primarily due to the Arcus collaboration opt-in charge of $625 million, as well as higher investments in Trodelvy and magrolimab clinical activities. These increases were partially offset by (i) a decline of approximately $200 million in external expenses related to wind-down or completion of certain remdesivir clinical studies, (ii) $190 million (€160 million) charge recorded in 2020 in connection with the agreement to amend the existing arrangement with Galapagos for the commercialization and development of Jyseleca, and (iii) lower stock-based compensation expense. R&D expenses for 2020 included accelerated stock-based compensation expenses of $166 million related to our acquisitions of Immunomedics and Forty Seven.Acquired In-Process Research and Development ExpensesAcquired IPR&D expenses reflect IPR&D impairments as well as the initial costs of externally developed IPR&D projects, acquired directly in a transaction other than a business combination, that do not have an alternative future use, including upfront payments related to various collaborations and the initial costs of rights to IPR&D projects. Acquired IPR&D expenses of $177 million in 2021 were related to licensing, collaboration, investment and other arrangements we entered into during the year. Acquired IPR&D expenses of $5.9 billion in 2020 were primarily related to our acquisition of Forty Seven as well as collaborations and other investments we entered into during the year with Arcus, Pionyr, Tango, Tizona and Jounce.Selling, General and Administrative Expenses SG&A expenses relate to sales and marketing, finance, human resources, legal and other administrative activities, including information technology investments. SG&A expenses consist primarily of personnel costs, facilities and overhead costs, outside marketing, advertising and legal expenses and other general and administrative costs. SG&A expenses also include the Branded Prescription Drug (“BPD”) fee. In the United States, we, along with other pharmaceutical manufacturers of branded drug products, are required to pay a portion of the BPD fee, which is estimated based on select government sales during the prior year as a percentage of total industry government sales. 40In 2021, SG&A expenses increased by $95 million compared to 2020, primarily due to an expense of $212 million related to the donation of certain equity securities at fair value to the Gilead Foundation, a California nonprofit organization (the “Foundation”), and increased commercial activities, including higher promotional and marketing activities primarily driven by Trodelvy. SG&A expenses for 2020 included accelerated stock-based compensation expense of $204 million related to our acquisitions of Immunomedics and Forty Seven, and a charge of $97 million related to a U.S. Department of Justice investigation, which was settled in the third quarter of 2020.Interest Expense and Other Income (Expense), NetThe following table summarizes the period-over-period changes in our Interest expense and Other income (expense), net:(in millions, except percentages)20212020ChangeInterest expense$(1,001)$(984)2 %Other income (expense), net$(639)$(1,418)(55)%Interest expense for 2021 increased by $17 million, or 2%, compared to 2020, primarily due to an increase in borrowing related to the fourth quarter 2020 acquisition of Immunomedics, partially offset by lower interest expense due to debt maturities and repayments.The changes in Other income (expense), net for 2021, compared to 2020, primarily reflects lower unrealized losses from fair value adjustments of our investments in equity securities largely driven by our investment in Galapagos, partially offset by lower interest income. Changes in the fair value of equity securities resulted in net unrealized losses of $610 million and $1.7 billion for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively.Income Taxes The following table summarizes the period-over-period changes in our Income tax (expense) benefit:(in millions, except percentages)20212020Income before income taxes$8,278 $1,669 Income tax expense$(2,077)$(1,580)Effective tax rate25.1 %94.7 %Our effective tax rate decreased in 2021, compared to 2020, primarily due to a $4.5 billion acquired IPR&D charge recorded in connection with our acquisition of Forty Seven and $511 million of certain other acquired IPR&D charges in 2020 that were non-deductible for tax purposes.LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCESOur cash, cash equivalents, and marketable debt securities were $7.8 billion and $7.9 billion as of December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively.Cash FlowsThe following table summarizes our cash flow activities:(in millions)20212020Net cash provided by (used in): Operating activities$11,384 $8,168 Investing activities$(3,131)$(14,615)Financing activities$(8,877)$770 Operating ActivitiesCash provided by operating activities represents the cash receipts and disbursements related to all of our activities other than investing and financing activities. Operating cash flow is derived by adjusting our net income for non-cash items and changes in operating assets and liabilities. Cash provided by operating activities increased by $3.2 billion to $11.4 billion in 2021 compared to 2020. The increase was primarily due to revenue growth from sales of Veklury as well as higher collection of receivables in 2021.41Investing ActivitiesCash used in investing activities primarily consists of purchases, sales and maturities of our marketable debt securities, capital expenditures, acquisitions, including IPR&D, net of cash acquired, purchases of equity securities and other investments. Cash used in investing activities was $3.1 billion in 2021 compared to $14.6 billion in 2020. The decrease in cash used in investing activities was primarily due to a decrease in cash outflows related to acquisitions, including IPR&D, net of cash acquired. We made a $1.2 billion payment in the first quarter of 2021 for our acquisition of MYR as compared to the $4.7 billion and $20.6 billion payments made in 2020 related to our acquisitions of Forty Seven and Immunomedics, respectively. The decrease was partially offset by net cash generated by investing activities in 2020 related to proceeds from sales and maturities of marketable debt securities used to partially fund these acquisitions. Financing ActivitiesCash used in financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2021 was $8.9 billion, compared to cash provided by financing activities of $770 million in 2020. In 2021, we utilized cash for $4.75 billion of debt repayments, $3.6 billion of dividend payments and $546 million of common stock repurchases. In 2020, we obtained $8.2 billion in proceeds from debt financing, net of issuance costs, to fund our fourth quarter 2020 acquisition of Immunomedics, partially offset by cash utilized for $3.4 billion of dividend payments, $2.5 billion of debt repayments and $1.6 billion of common stock repurchases. Debt and Credit FacilitiesA summary of our borrowings under various financing arrangements is included in Note 12. Debt and Credit Facilities of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. We may choose to repay certain of our long-term debt obligations prior to maturity dates based on our assessment of current and long-term liquidity and capital requirements.Senior Unsecured Notes and Term Loan In 2021, we repaid $4.75 billion of debt, consisting of $3.75 billion senior unsecured notes and $1.0 billion on our senior unsecured term loan facility. We repaid $1.0 billion of senior unsecured notes due April 2021 in the first quarter of 2021 and $1.25 billion of senior unsecured notes due December 2021 in the third quarter of 2021. Additionally, we repaid $500 million of senior unsecured notes due upon maturity in September 2021. In October 2021, we exercised our option to call $500 million of senior unsecured floating rate notes and $500 million of 0.75% senior unsecured notes, both having a final maturity date of September 2023. These two early repayments totaling $1.0 billion principal amount were made in the fourth quarter of 2021. In December 2021, we exercised our option to call $500 million of senior unsecured notes having a final maturity of March 2022. The notes were repaid in February 2022. No new debt was issued in 2021. We are required to comply with certain covenants under our note indentures governing our senior unsecured notes. As of December 31, 2021 and 2020, we were not in violation of any covenants.Liability Related to Future RoyaltiesIn connection with our acquisition of Immunomedics, we assumed a liability related to a funding arrangement, which was originally entered into by Immunomedics and RPI Finance Trust prior to our acquisition of Immunomedics. The liability related to future royalties was primarily included in Long-term debt, net on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. See Note 6. Acquisitions of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information.Credit FacilityIn June 2020, we terminated our $2.5 billion five-year revolving credit facility maturing in May 2021 (the “2016 Revolving Credit Facility”) and entered into a new $2.5 billion five-year revolving credit facility maturing in June 2025 (the “2020 Revolving Credit Facility”). The 2020 Revolving Credit Facility can be used for working capital requirements and for general corporate purposes, including, without limitation, acquisitions. As of December 31, 2021 and 2020, there were no amounts outstanding under the 2020 Revolving Credit Facility. The 2020 Revolving Credit Facility contains customary representations, warranties, affirmative and negative covenants and events of default. As of December 31, 2021, we were in compliance with all covenants.Capital Return ProgramThe details of our Stock Repurchase Programs and Dividends are included in Note 15. Stockholders’ Equity of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.Stock Repurchase ProgramsIn the first quarter of 2016, our Board of Directors authorized a $12.0 billion stock repurchase program (the “2016 Program”), under which repurchases may be made in the open market or in privately negotiated transactions. We started repurchases under the 2016 Program in April 2016.42In the first quarter of 2020, our Board of Directors authorized a new $5.0 billion stock repurchase program (the “2020 Program”), which will commence upon the completion of the 2016 Program. Purchases under the 2020 Program may be made in the open market or in privately negotiated transactions.We purchased 8 million and 22 million shares of our common stock under the 2016 Program for $546 million and $1.6 billion in 2021 and 2020, respectively. As of December 31, 2021, the remaining authorized repurchase amount from both programs was $6.3 billion.DividendsWe declared and paid quarterly cash dividends for an aggregate amount of $3.6 billion or $2.84 per share of our common stock and $3.4 billion or $2.72 per share of our common stock in 2021 and 2020, respectively.On February 1, 2022, we announced that our Board of Directors declared a quarterly cash dividend increase of 2.8% from $0.71 to $0.73 per share of our common stock, with a payment date of March 30, 2022 to all stockholders of record as of the close of business on March 15, 2022. Future dividends are subject to declaration by our Board of Directors.Capital ResourcesWe believe our existing capital resources, supplemented by cash flows generated from our operations, will be adequate to satisfy our capital needs for the foreseeable future. Our future capital requirements will depend on many factors, including but not limited to the following:•the commercial performance of our current and future products;•the progress and scope of our R&D efforts, including preclinical studies and clinical trials;•the cost, timing and outcome of regulatory reviews;•the expansion of our sales and marketing capabilities;•the possibility of acquiring additional manufacturing capabilities or office facilities;•the possibility of acquiring other companies or new products;•debt service requirements;•the establishment of additional collaborative relationships with other companies; and•costs associated with the defense, settlement and adverse results of government investigations and litigation.We may in the future require additional funding, which could be in the form of proceeds from equity or debt financings. If such funding is required, we cannot guarantee that it will be available to us on favorable terms, if at all. Material Cash RequirementsWe continually evaluate our liquidity and capital resources, including our access to external capital to ensure that we can adequately and efficiently finance our operations. As of December 31, 2021, our material cash requirements consisted primarily of the repayment of outstanding borrowings, the remaining obligations for the one-time repatriation transition tax from the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, our settlement related to bictegravir litigation, purchases of inventory, operating leases obligations, capital expenditures and milestone and other payments related to our collaborative agreements. See Notes 11. Collaborations and Other Arrangements, 12. Debt and Credit Facilities, 13. Leases, 14. Commitments and Contingencies and 18. Income Taxes of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information. We anticipate our cash requirements related to capital expenditures will increase in 2022 as compared to the prior year as we work to expand our site infrastructure and capabilities. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES, ESTIMATES AND JUDGMENTSThe discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based on our Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, which have been prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses and related disclosures. On an ongoing basis, we evaluate and base our estimates on historical experience and on various other market specific and other relevant assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ significantly from these estimates. We believe the following critical accounting policies reflect the more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our Consolidated Financial Statements. 43Government and Other Rebates and Chargebacks Revenues from product sales are recognized net of estimated government and other rebates and chargebacks, cash discounts for prompt payment, distributor fees, sales return provisions and other related deductions. These deductions to product sales are referred to as gross-to-net deductions and are estimated and recorded in the period in which the related product sales occur. Revenues from product sales, net of these deductions, are recorded only to the extent a significant reversal of the amount of cumulative revenue recognized is not probable of occurring when the uncertainty associated with gross-to-net deductions is subsequently resolved.Government and other rebates and chargebacks are subject to a complex estimation process, which requires significant judgment by management in part due to the lag between the date of the product sales and the date the related rebates or chargeback claims are settled. Government and other rebates and chargebacks include amounts payable to payers and healthcare providers under various programs, and may vary by product, by payer and by individual payer plans. For qualified programs that can purchase our products through wholesalers or other distributors at a lower contractual price, the wholesalers or distributors charge back to us the difference between their acquisition cost and the lower contractual price. Rebates and chargebacks are estimated primarily based on product sales, and expected payer mix and discount rates, which require significant estimates and judgment. Additionally, in developing our estimates of government and other rebates and chargebacks, we consider the following: •historical and estimated payer mix;•statutory discount requirements and contractual terms;•historical claims experience and processing time lags;•estimated patient population;•known market events or trends; •market research;•channel inventory data obtained from our major U.S. wholesalers; and•other pertinent internal or external information.The following table summarizes the consolidated activities and ending balances in our government and other rebates and chargebacks accounts:(in millions)Balance at Beginning of YearDecrease/(Increase) to Product SalesPaymentsBalance at End of YearYear ended December 31, 2021: Activity related to 2021 sales$— $13,211 $(9,714)$3,497 Activity related to sales prior to 20214,012 (617)(2,977)418 Total$4,012 $12,594 $(12,691)$3,915 Year ended December 31, 2020: Activity related to 2020 sales$— $13,199 $(9,500)$3,699 Activity related to sales prior to 20204,108 (235)(3,560)313 Total$4,108 $12,964 $(13,060)$4,012 Product sales in 2021 include the impact of $617 million for changes in estimates related to our 2020 product sales, primarily in the United States. In 2020, we had assumed higher rebate claims from government payer segments resulting in part from the COVID-19 pandemic and its anticipated impacts, which did not materialize.We assess and update our estimates each reporting period to reflect actual claims and other current information. We believe the methodology that we use to estimate our government and other rebates and chargebacks is reasonable and appropriate given the current facts and circumstances. However, actual results may differ significantly from our estimates. Historically, our actual government and other rebates and chargebacks claimed for prior periods have varied by less than 5% from our estimates. Government and other chargebacks that are payable to our direct customers are classified as reductions of Accounts receivable in our Consolidated Balance Sheets and totaled $671 million and $552 million as of December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. See Note 10. Other Financial Information of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information. Government and other rebates that are payable to third party payers and healthcare providers are generally recorded in Accrued government and other rebates on our Consolidated Balance Sheets and totaled $3.2 billion and $3.5 billion as of December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively.44Acquisitions and Valuation of IntangiblesWe make certain judgments to determine whether transactions should be accounted for as acquisitions of assets or as business combinations. If it is determined that substantially all of the fair value of gross assets acquired in a transaction is concentrated in a single asset (or a group of similar assets), the transaction is treated as an acquisition of assets. We evaluate the inputs, processes, and outputs associated with the acquired set of activities and assets. If the assets in a transaction include an input and a substantive process that together significantly contribute to the ability to create outputs, the transaction is treated as an acquisition of a business.We account for business combinations using the acquisition method of accounting, which requires that assets acquired and liabilities assumed generally be recorded at their fair values as of the acquisition date. Excess of consideration over the fair value of net assets acquired is recorded as goodwill. Estimating fair value requires us to make significant judgments and assumptions. We perform impairment testing of goodwill annually or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that it is more likely than not that the asset is impaired.In transactions accounted for as acquisitions of assets, no goodwill is recorded and contingent consideration, such as payments upon achievement of various developmental, regulatory and commercial milestones, generally is not recognized at the acquisition date. In an asset acquisition, upfront payments allocated to IPR&D projects at the acquisition date are expensed unless there is an alternative future use. In addition, product development milestones are expensed upon achievement. Valuation of Intangible Assets We have acquired, and expect to continue to acquire, intangible assets through asset acquisitions or business combinations. The identifiable intangible assets are measured at their respective fair values as of the acquisition date. Intangible assets acquired through business combinations are subject to potential adjustments within the measurement period, which may be up to one year from the acquisition date. The fair values of the intangible assets are generally determined using a probability-weighted income approach that discounts expected future cash flows to present value. The estimated net cash flows are discounted using a discount rate that is based on the estimated weighted-average cost of capital for companies with profiles similar to our profile and represents the rate that market participants would use to value the intangible assets. The discounted cash flow models used in valuing these intangible assets require the use of significant estimates and assumptions including but not limited to:•identification of product candidates with sufficient substance requiring separate recognition;•estimates of projected future cash flows including revenues and operating profits related to the products or product candidates;•the probability of technical and regulatory success for unapproved product candidates considering their stages of development;•the time and resources needed to complete the development and approval of product candidates;•appropriate discount rate;•the life of the potential commercialized products and associated risks, including the inherent difficulties and uncertainties in developing a product candidate such as obtaining FDA and other regulatory approvals; and•risks related to the viability of and potential alternative treatments in any future target markets.We believe the fair values used to record intangible assets acquired are based upon reasonable estimates and assumptions given the facts and circumstances as of the related valuation dates. Impairment and Amortization of Intangible AssetsIntangible assets related to IPR&D projects acquired in a business combination are capitalized as indefinite-lived intangible assets until the completion or abandonment of the associated R&D efforts. During the period the assets are considered indefinite-lived, they are not amortized. When development is successfully completed, which generally occurs when regulatory approval is obtained, the associated assets are deemed finite-lived and amortized over their respective estimated useful lives beginning at that point in time primarily on a straight-line basis. Indefinite-lived intangible assets, composed of IPR&D projects acquired in a business combination that lack regulatory approval at the time of acquisition, are tested for impairment annually, whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that it is more likely than not that the assets are impaired and upon regulatory approval. Estimates of fair value result from a complex series of judgments about future events and uncertainties and make assumptions at a point in time (acquisition date or subsequent impairment assessment date). Changes in estimates and assumptions, including the timing of product launch, pricing reductions, failure to obtain anticipated regulatory approval, deterioration in U.S. and global financial markets or other unanticipated events and circumstances, may decrease the projected cash flows or increase the discount rate and could potentially result in an impairment charge.45 The eventual realized value of the acquired IPR&D project may vary from its fair value at the date of acquisition. If the carrying value of an intangible asset exceeds its estimated fair value, an impairment charge is recorded to write down the intangible asset to its estimated fair value. For example, in 2019, we recognized an $800 million impairment charge related to IPR&D projects primarily for the treatment of indolent B-cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma due to changes in estimated market opportunities. A high rate of failure is inherent in the discovery and development of new products. Intangible assets are also periodically reviewed for changes in facts or circumstances resulting in a reduction to the estimated useful life of the asset, requiring the acceleration of amortization.See Note 9. Goodwill and Intangible Assets of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information.Legal ContingenciesWe are a party to various legal actions. The most significant of these are described in Note 14. Commitments and Contingencies of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. It is not possible to determine the outcome of these matters. We recognize accruals for such actions to the extent that we conclude that a loss is both probable and reasonably estimable. We accrue for the best estimate of a loss within a range; however, if no estimate in the range is better than any other, then we accrue the minimum amount in the range. If we determine that a material loss is reasonably possible, we disclose the possible loss or range of loss, or that the amount of loss cannot be estimated at this time.Significant judgment is required in both the determination of probability and the determination as to whether an exposure is reasonably estimable. Because of the inherent uncertainty and unpredictability related to these matters, accruals are based on what we believe to be the best information available at the time of our assessment, including the legal facts and circumstances of the case, status of the proceedings, applicable law and the views of legal counsel. Upon the final resolution of such matters, it is possible that there may be a loss in excess of the amount recorded, and such amounts could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, cash flows or financial position. We periodically reassess these matters when additional information becomes available and adjust our estimates and assumptions when facts and circumstances indicate the need for any changes. In the fourth quarter of 2021, we recorded an accrual of $1.25 billion in Accrued and other current liabilities on our Consolidated Balance Sheets for the settlement related to bictegravir litigation. See Note 14. Commitments and Contingencies of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information. Income TaxesWe estimate our income tax provision, including deferred tax assets and liabilities, based on significant management judgment. We evaluate the realization of our deferred tax assets each reporting period. We record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets to the amounts that are more likely than not to be realized. We consider future taxable income, ongoing tax planning strategies and our historical financial performance in assessing the need for a valuation allowance. If we expect to realize deferred tax assets for which we have previously recorded a valuation allowance, we will reduce the valuation allowance in the period in which such determination is first made. We are subject to income taxes in the United States and various foreign jurisdictions, including Ireland. Due to economic and political conditions, various countries are actively considering or have made changes to existing tax laws. We cannot predict the form or timing of potential legislative changes that could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations. In addition, significant judgment is required in determining our worldwide provision for income taxes.We recognize the tax benefit from an uncertain tax position only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained upon examination by tax authorities based on the technical merits of the position. The tax benefit recognized in the Consolidated Financial Statements for a particular tax position is based on the largest benefit that is more likely than not to be realized. The amount of unrecognized tax benefits (“UTB”) is adjusted as appropriate for changes in facts and circumstances, such as significant amendments to existing tax law, new regulations or interpretations by tax authorities, new information obtained during a tax examination or resolution of an examination. We recognize both accrued interest and penalties, where appropriate, related to UTB in Income tax (expense) benefit on our Consolidated Statements of Income. RECENT ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTSThere have been no new accounting pronouncements issued nor adopted during the year ended December 31, 2021 that are of significance to us.46ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISKWe are exposed to market risks that may result from changes in foreign currency exchange rates, interest rates, credit risks and market prices. To reduce certain of these risks, we enter into various types of foreign currency or interest rate derivative hedging transactions, follow investment guidelines and monitor outstanding receivables as part of our risk management program.Foreign Currency Exchange Risk We have operations in more than 35 countries worldwide. As a result, our financial results could be significantly affected by factors such as changes in foreign currency exchange rates or weak economic conditions in the foreign markets in which we distribute our products. Our operating results are exposed to changes in foreign currency exchange rates between the U.S. dollar and various foreign currencies, the most significant of which is the Euro. When the U.S. dollar strengthens against these currencies, the relative value of sales made in the respective foreign currency decreases. Conversely, when the U.S. dollar weakens against these currencies, the relative value of such sales increase. Overall, we are a net receiver of foreign currencies and, therefore, we benefit from a weaker U.S. dollar and are adversely affected by a stronger U.S. dollar. Approximately 26% of our product sales were denominated in foreign currencies during 2021. To partially mitigate the impact of changes in currency exchange rates on net cash flows from our foreign currency denominated sales, we may enter into foreign currency exchange forward or option contracts. We also hedge certain monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies, which reduces but does not eliminate our exposure to currency fluctuations between the date a transaction is recorded and the date that cash is collected or paid. In general, the market risks of these contracts are offset by corresponding gains and losses on the transactions being hedged. As of December 31, 2021 and 2020, we had open foreign currency forward contracts with notional amounts of $2.9 billion and $2.4 billion, respectively. A hypothetical 10% adverse movement in foreign currency exchange rates compared with the U.S. dollar relative to exchange rates as of December 31, 2021 and 2020 would have resulted in a reduction in fair value of these contracts of approximately $333 million and $249 million, respectively, and if realized, would have negatively affected earnings over the remaining life of the contracts. The analysis does not consider the impact that hypothetical changes in foreign currency exchange rates would have on anticipated transactions that these foreign currency sensitive instruments were designed to offset.Interest Rate Risk Our portfolio of available-for-sale debt securities and our senior unsecured notes create an exposure to interest rate risk. With respect to our investment portfolio, we adhere to an investment policy that requires us to limit amounts invested in securities based on credit rating, maturity, industry group and investment type and issuer, except for securities issued by the U.S. government. The goals of our investment policy, in order of priority, are as follows: • safety and preservation of principal and diversification of risk; • liquidity of investments sufficient to meet cash flow requirements; and • a competitive after-tax rate of return. The following table summarizes the expected maturities and average interest rates of our interest-generating assets and interest-bearing liabilities as of December 31, 2021: Expected Maturity Total Fair Value(in millions, except percentages)20222023202420252026ThereafterTotalAssets Available-for-sale debt securities$1,188 $599 $643 $37 $7 $23 $2,497 $2,497 Average interest rate0.46 %0.61 %0.60 %1.09 %0.57 %0.60 % Liabilities Senior unsecured fixed rate notes, including current portion(1)$1,500 $2,250 $1,750 $1,750 $2,750 $15,750 $25,750 $28,599 Average interest rate2.82 %1.33 %3.70 %3.50 %3.65 %3.84 % _______________________________(1) Amounts represent principal balances. In addition to the senior unsecured fixed rate notes, we have a $2.5 billion five-year revolving credit facility that matures in June 2025. There were no amounts outstanding under the five-year revolving credit facility as of December 31, 2021. See Note 12. Debt and Credit Facilities of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information. 47Market Price Risk We hold shares of common stock of certain publicly traded biotechnology companies primarily in connection with license and collaboration agreements. These equity securities are measured at fair value with any changes in fair value recognized in earnings. The fair value of these equity securities was approximately $1.8 billion and $2.4 billion as of December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. Changes in fair value of these equity securities are impacted by the volatility of the stock market and changes in general economic conditions, among other factors. A hypothetical 20% increase or decrease in the stock prices of these equity securities would have increased or decreased their fair value as of December 31, 2021 and 2020 by approximately $364 million and $478 million, respectively.48",2023-12-30 19:04:07.471606

Management OverviewStrategy and OutlookGilead Sciences, Inc. (“Gilead,” “we,” “our” or “us”) is a biopharmaceutical company that has pursued and achieved breakthroughs in medicine for more than three decades, with the goal of creating a healthier world for all people. We are committed to advancing innovative medicines to prevent and treat life-threatening diseases, including HIV, viral hepatitis and cancer. We operate in more than 35 countries worldwide, with headquarters in Foster City, California. Since 2019, our strategic ambitions have been to (i) bring 10+ transformative therapies to patients by 2030; (ii) be the biotech employer and partner of choice; and (iii) deliver shareholder value in a sustainable and responsible manner. Our strategic priorities for 2023 and beyond, reflecting how we plan to deliver those ambitions, are: (i) maximize near-term revenue growth; (ii) maximize impact of long-active HIV; (iii) expand and deliver on oncology programs; (iv) champion an environment of inclusion and employee growth; and (v) remove barriers to speed in execution. We plan to provide consistent execution on a portfolio with quality, depth and breadth, including continued growth in our leading HIV portfolio, which is poised to shape the long-acting market following our first lenacapavir approvals, as well as strong commercial performance and clinical momentum for our fast-growing oncology business.Key Business UpdatesDuring 2022, we continued to advance our portfolio, receiving approvals across various therapeutic areas, indications and geographies. We ended the year with Sunlenca receiving its first approval in the U.S. for heavily-treatment experienced individuals, following the first European market approval by the European Commission (“EC”). This is the first twice-yearly, subcutaneous HIV medicine to be approved. We also continued to broaden therapies available in oncology, receiving approvals for additional indications of Yescarta and Tecartus, and the 2023 approval of Trodelvy for the treatment of adult patients with unresectable locally advanced or metastatic hormone receptor-positive, human epidermal growth factor receptor 2-negative (“HR+/HER2-”) breast cancer who have received endocrine-based therapy and at least two additional systemic therapies in the metastatic setting.In terms of capital resources, we continued to invest in our business and research and development (“R&D”) pipeline through acquisitions and collaborations. We also continued to provide shareholder returns in the form of dividends and share repurchases.The following highlights are taken from press releases recently issued.

The decrease was primarily due to the following items net of their related tax effect: a partial in-process research and development (“IPR&D”) impairment charge of $2.7 billion during the three months ended March 31, 2022 related to assets we acquired from Immunomedics, Inc. (“Immunomedics”) in 2020, a $406 million charge related to the termination of the Trodelvy collaboration agreement with Everest and higher R&D expenses, partially offset by a $1.25 billion charge for a settlement related to bictegravir litigation in the fourth quarter of 2021 that did not repeat in 2022.Results of OperationsRevenuesThe following table summarizes the period-over-period changes in our Total revenues:Year Ended December 31, 2022Year Ended December 31, 2021(in millions, except percentages)U.S.EuropeOther InternationalTotalU.S.EuropeOther InternationalTotalChangeProduct sales:HIV$13,820 $2,219 $1,155 $17,194 $12,828 $2,366 $1,121 $16,315 5 %Veklury1,575 702 1,628 3,905 3,640 1,095 830 5,565 (30)%HCV1,005 413 392 1,810 1,018 421 442 1,881 (4)%HBV/HDV435 112 441 988 397 104 468 969 2 %Cell Therapy968 430 60 1,459 542 293 36 871 68 %Trodelvy525 143 12 680 370 10 — 380 79 %Other388 323 235 946 381 389 257 1,027 (8)%Total product sales18,716 4,342 3,924 26,982 19,176 4,678 3,154 27,008 — %Royalty, contract and other revenues168 127 4 299 91 196 10 297 1 %Total revenues$18,884 $4,469 $3,928 $27,281 $19,267 $4,874 $3,164 $27,305 — %________________________________See Note 2. Revenues of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further disaggregation of revenue by product.HIVHIV product sales increased by 5% to $17.2 billion in 2022, compared to 2021, primarily due to continued higher demand for Biktarvy worldwide and favorable pricing dynamics, partially offset by the impact of the loss of exclusivity for Truvada in the U.S., channel inventory dynamics and unfavorable foreign currency exchange impact. Part of our favorable pricing dynamics resulted from shifts in channel mix, and we expect channel mix to remain similar in 2023.36VekluryVeklury product sales decreased by 30% to $3.9 billion in 2022, compared to 2021, primarily due to lower demand driven by reduced hospitalization rates in the U.S. and Europe, partially offset by higher demand in Other International. Sales of Veklury generally reflect COVID-19 related rates and severity of infections and hospitalizations, as well as the availability, uptake and effectiveness of vaccinations and alternative treatments for COVID-19. As a result, future sales of Veklury are difficult to predict and may vary significantly from one period to the next.HCVHCV product sales decreased by 4% to $1.8 billion in 2022, compared to 2021, primarily due to unfavorable foreign currency exchange impact, fewer patient starts and unfavorable pricing dynamics.HBV / HDVHBV and HDV product sales increased by 2% to $988 million in 2022, compared to 2021, primarily due to higher demand for Vemlidy and the continued adoption of Hepcludex in Europe.Cell TherapyCell therapy product sales, which include Yescarta and Tecartus, increased by 68% to $1.5 billion in 2022, compared to 2021, primarily due to higher demand for Yescarta in R/R LBCL in the U.S. and Europe, as well as for Tecartus in R/R ALL and mantle cell lymphoma.TrodelvyTrodelvy product sales increased by 79% to $680 million in 2022, compared to 2021, primarily due to the continued adoption in metastatic triple-negative breast cancer in the U.S. and Europe.OtherOther product sales decreased by 8% to $946 million in 2022, as compared to 2021, primarily due to lower demand for AmBisome and loss of exclusivity for Letairis.Gross-to-Net DeductionsThe following table summarizes the period-over-period changes in gross-to-net deductions:(in millions, except percentages)20222021ChangeGross product sales$41,564 $41,381 — %Gross-to-net deductions:Rebates and chargebacks$12,622 $12,594 — %Sales returns, discounts and other$1,960 $1,779 10 %Total gross-to-net deductions$14,582 $14,373 1 %% of gross product sales35 %35 %Net product sales$26,982 $27,008 — %Foreign Currency Exchange ImpactWe generally face exposure to movements in foreign currency exchange rates, primarily in the Euro. We use foreign currency exchange contracts to hedge a portion of our foreign currency exposures. Of our total product sales, 31% and 29% were generated outside the U.S. in 2022 and 2021, respectively. Foreign currency exchange, net of hedges, had an unfavorable impact on our total product sales of $608 million in 2022, based on a comparison using foreign currency exchange rates from 2021.37Costs and ExpensesThe following table summarizes the period-over-period changes in our costs and expenses: (in millions, except percentages)20222021ChangeCost of goods sold$5,657 $6,601 (14)%Product gross margin79.0 %75.6 %347 bpsResearch and development expenses$4,977 $4,601 8 %Acquired in-process research and development expenses$944 $939 1 %In-process research and development impairment$2,700 $— NMSelling, general and administrative expenses$5,673 $5,246 8 %________________________________NM - Not MeaningfulProduct Gross MarginProduct gross margin increased to 79.0% in 2022 as compared to 75.6% in 2021, primarily driven by a $1.25 billion charge for a settlement related to bictegravir litigation in the fourth quarter of 2021 that did not repeat in 2022. The increase was partially offset by higher royalty expenses driven by Biktarvy royalties, the reversal of a $175 million litigation reserve in the third quarter of 2021 that did not repeat in 2022, and changes in product mix.Research and Development ExpensesResearch and development expenses increased by $376 million in 2022 compared to 2021, primarily due to higher clinical development spend related mostly to Trodelvy and the Arcus Biosciences, Inc. (“Arcus”) collaboration, as well as inflationary increases.Acquired In-Process Research and Development ExpensesAcquired in-process research and development expenses of $944 million in 2022 were primarily related to a $389 million charge associated with our acquisition of MiroBio, a $315 million charge associated with the Dragonfly collaboration, an $82 million charge associated with the Jounce collaboration and acquisition of GS-1811, and a $60 million charge associated with the MacroGenics collaboration. Acquired in-process research and development expenses of $939 million in 2021 were primarily related to a $625 million charge associated with an option exercised under the Arcus collaboration. See Note 6. Acquisitions and Note 10. Collaborations and Other Arrangements of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information.In-Process Research and Development ImpairmentIn connection with our acquisition of Immunomedics in 2020, we allocated a portion of the purchase price to acquired IPR&D intangible assets. Approximately $8.8 billion was assigned to IPR&D intangible assets related to Trodelvy for treatment of patients with HR+/HER2- breast cancer. In March 2022, we received data from the Phase 3 TROPiCS-02 study evaluating Trodelvy in patients with HR+/HER2- mBC who have received prior endocrine therapy, CDK4/6 inhibitors and two to four lines of chemotherapy (“third-line plus patients”). Based on our evaluation of the study results, and in connection with the preparation of the financial statements for the first quarter, we updated our estimate of the fair value of our HR+/HER2- IPR&D intangible asset to $6.1 billion as of March 31, 2022. Our estimate of fair value used a probability weighted income approach that discounts expected future cash flows to the present value. The expected cash flows included cash flows from HR+/HER2- mBC for third-line plus patients and patients in earlier lines of therapy which are the subject of separate clinical studies. Our revised discounted cash flows were lower primarily due to a delay in launch timing for third-line plus patients which caused a decrease in our market share assumptions based on the expected competitive environment. There were no changes in our plans or assumptions related to our estimated cash flows for patients in the earlier lines of therapy. We determined the revised estimated fair value was below the carrying value of the asset and, as a result, we recognized a partial impairment charge of $2.7 billion in In-process research and development impairment on our Consolidated Statements of Income during the three months ended March 31, 2022. The remaining balance of the HR+/HER2- IPR&D intangible asset at the time of the assessment related to cash flows from earlier lines of therapy, where we have Phase 3 pivotal studies in development, in addition to the revised cash flows related to the third-line plus patient setting. If future events result in adverse changes in the key assumptions used in determining fair value, including the timing of product launches, information on the competitive landscape of treatments in this indication, changes to the probability of technical or regulatory success, failure to obtain anticipated regulatory approval or discount rate, among others, additional impairments may be recorded and could be material to our financial statements. No other IPR&D impairment charges were recorded in 2022 or 2021.38Selling, General and Administrative ExpensesSelling, general and administrative expenses increased by $427 million in 2022 compared to 2021, primarily due to a $406 million charge associated with the termination of the Trodelvy license collaboration agreement with Everest, which had provided Everest with broad commercialization and development rights to Trodelvy in certain Asia territories. We terminated the existing agreement and reacquired the Trodelvy rights in these territories. Other spending increases in 2022 included increased promotional and marketing investing, mostly in Trodelvy and cell therapy, as well as higher corporate activities and inflationary increases, slightly offset by a decrease in donations to the Gilead Foundation in 2022 as compared to 2021.Interest Expense and Other Income (Expense), NetThe following table summarizes the period-over-period changes in our Interest expense and Other income (expense), net:(in millions, except percentages)20222021ChangeInterest expense$(935)$(1,001)(7)%Other income (expense), net$(581)$(639)(9)%Interest expense decreased by $66 million in 2022 compared to 2021, primarily due to lower outstanding debt balances.The changes in Other income (expense), net for 2022, compared to 2021, primarily reflects higher interest income due to rising interest rates, partially offset by higher net unrealized losses from equity securities.Income TaxesThe following table summarizes the period-over-period changes in our Income tax expense:(in millions, except percentages)20222021ChangeIncome before income taxes$5,814 $8,278 $(2,464)Income tax expense$(1,248)$(2,077)$829 Effective tax rate21.5 %25.1 %(3.6)%Our effective tax rate decreased in 2022, compared to 2021, primarily due to a beneficial change in jurisdictional mix of income and lower state taxes.Liquidity and Capital ResourcesWe continually evaluate our liquidity and capital resources, including our access to external capital, to ensure that we can adequately and efficiently finance our operations.LiquidityCash, cash equivalents, and marketable debt securities were $7.6 billion and $7.8 billion as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. Cash and cash equivalents increased by $74 million from December 31, 2021 to December 31, 2022. The following table summarizes our cash flow activities:(in millions)20222021Net cash provided by (used in): Operating activities$9,072 $11,384 Investing activities$(2,466)$(3,131)Financing activities$(6,469)$(8,877)Effect of exchange rate changes on cash and cash equivalents$(63)$(35)Operating ActivitiesNet cash provided by operating activities is derived by adjusting our net income for non-cash items and changes in operating assets and liabilities. Net cash provided by operating activities was $9.1 billion in 2022, compared to $11.4 billion in 2021. The decrease was primarily due to the $1.25 billion payment made in the first quarter of 2022 in connection with the legal settlement related to bictegravir litigation as well as higher income tax payments made and higher operating expenses in 2022.Investing ActivitiesNet cash used in investing activities was $2.5 billion in 2022, compared to $3.1 billion in 2021. The decrease was primarily due to lower net purchases of marketable debt and equity securities, partially offset by higher capital expenditures and other acquisitions.39Financing ActivitiesNet cash used in financing activities was $6.5 billion in 2022, compared to $8.9 billion in 2021. In 2022, we utilized cash for $1.5 billion of debt repayments, $3.7 billion of dividend payments and $1.4 billion of common stock repurchases. In 2021, we utilized cash for $4.75 billion of debt repayments, $3.6 billion of dividend payments, and $546 million of common stock repurchases.Capital ResourcesWe believe our existing capital resources, including cash and cash equivalents, marketable debt securities and our revolving credit facility, supplemented by cash flows generated from our operations, will be adequate to satisfy our capital needs for the foreseeable future.As of December 31, 2022, our material cash requirements consisted primarily of the repayment of outstanding borrowings, income tax payments, including the remaining obligations for the one-time repatriation transition tax from the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, purchases of inventory, operating lease obligations, capital expenditures and milestone and other payments related to our collaborative agreements. See Notes 6. Acquisitions, 10. Collaborations and Other Arrangements, 11. Debt and Credit Facilities, 12. Leases, 13. Commitments and Contingencies and 17. Income Taxes of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information. We enter into certain unconditional purchase obligations, capital expenditure projects and other commitments in the normal course of business. There have been no changes to these commitments during the year that would have a material impact on the company’s ability to meet either short-term or long-term cash requirements. Our future capital requirements will depend on many factors, including but not limited to the following:•the commercial performance of our current and future products;•the progress and scope of our R&D efforts, including preclinical studies and clinical trials;•the cost, timing and outcome of regulatory reviews;•the expansion of our sales and marketing capabilities;•the possibility of acquiring additional manufacturing capabilities or office facilities;•the possibility of acquiring other companies or new products;•debt service requirements;•future dividends subject to declaration by our Board of Directors;•the establishment of additional collaborative relationships with other companies; and•costs associated with the defense, settlement and adverse results of government investigations and litigation.We may in the future require additional funding, which could be in the form of proceeds from equity or debt financings. If such funding is required, we cannot guarantee that it will be available to us on favorable terms, if at all. We may choose to repay certain of our long-term debt obligations prior to maturity dates based on our assessment of current and long-term liquidity and capital requirementsCritical Accounting EstimatesSee Note 1. Organization and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for information about our significant accounting policies and how estimates are involved in the preparation of our financial statements. We believe the following reflect the critical accounting estimates used in the preparation of our Consolidated Financial Statements.Rebates and Chargebacks Rebates and chargebacks are determined using a complex estimation process and are subject to uncertainty in part due to the lag between the date of the product sales and the date the related rebates or chargeback claims are settled. In developing our estimates of rebates and chargebacks, we consider the following: •product sales, including product mix and pricing;•historical and estimated payer mix;•statutory discount requirements and contractual terms;•historical claims experience and processing time lags;•estimated patient population;•known market events or trends; 40•market research;•channel inventory data obtained from our major U.S. wholesalers; and•other pertinent internal or external information.The following table summarizes the consolidated activities and ending balances in our rebates and chargebacks accounts, including adjustments made relating to previous years’ sales as a result of changes in estimates:(in millions)Balance at Beginning of YearDecrease/(Increase) to Product SalesPaymentsBalance at End of YearYear ended December 31, 2022: Activity related to 2022 sales$— $13,040 $(9,442)$3,598 Activity related to sales prior to 20223,915 (418)(3,067)430 Total$3,915 $12,622 $(12,509)$4,028 Year ended December 31, 2021: Activity related to 2021 sales$— $13,211 $(9,714)$3,497 Activity related to sales prior to 20214,012 (617)(2,977)418 Total$4,012 $12,594 $(12,691)$3,915 Our net product sales in 2022 include the impact of $418 million for changes in rebate and chargeback estimates related to sales prior to 2022. Historically, our actual rebates and chargebacks claimed for prior periods have varied by less than 5% from our estimates. Valuation of Intangible AssetsDetermining the fair values of intangible assets, whether as part of a business combination or impairment assessment, involves the use of a probability-weighted income approach that discounts expected future cash flows to present value and requires the use of critical estimated inputs, including:•identification of product candidates with sufficient substance requiring separate recognition;•estimates of projected future cash flows, including revenues and operating profits related to the products or product candidates, which, for example, include significant inputs such as addressable patient population, treatment duration and projected market share;•the probability of technical and regulatory success for unapproved product candidates considering their stages of development;•the time and resources needed to complete the development and approval of product candidates;•an appropriate discount rate based on the estimated weighted-average cost of capital for companies with profiles similar to our profile, representing the rate that market participants would use to value the intangible assets;•the life of the potential commercialized products and associated risks, including the inherent difficulties and uncertainties in developing a product candidate such as obtaining FDA and other regulatory approvals; and•risks related to the viability of and potential alternative treatments in any future target markets.These estimates are subject to uncertainty due to the high rate of failure inherent in the discovery and development of new products; delays that can occur in development, approval and product launch processes; unanticipated decisions made by regulatory agencies; advent of competing products; unexpected changes in U.S. and global financial markets and other unanticipated events and circumstances. If future events result in adverse changes in the critical assumptions used in determining fair value, impairment charges on our intangible assets may be recorded and could be material to our financial statements. For example, in 2022, we recognized a $2.7 billion impairment charge related to our HR+/HER2- IPR&D intangible asset related to an expected delay in launch timing which caused a decrease in our market share assumptions based on the expected competitive environment.Legal ContingenciesWe are a party to various legal actions. Certain significant matters are described in Note 13. Commitments and Contingencies of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. 41Critical inputs to the accruals recorded and disclosures provided in relation to these matters include the probability of a certain outcome of the case, the determination as to whether an exposure is reasonably estimable and the amount of potential exposure. These inputs are subject to uncertainty due to changes in the legal facts and circumstances of the case, status of the proceedings, applicable law, the views of legal counsel and the views of any judges or jury involved in the case. Upon the final resolution of such matters, it is possible that there may be a loss in excess of the amount recorded, and such amounts could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, cash flows or financial position. We periodically reassess these matters when additional information becomes available and adjust our estimates and assumptions when facts and circumstances indicate the need for any changes. For example, in the fourth quarter of 2021, we recorded an accrual of $1.25 billion in Other current liabilities on our Consolidated Balance Sheets for the settlement related to bictegravir litigation.Income TaxesWe are subject to income taxes in the U.S. and various foreign jurisdictions, including Ireland. Critical inputs in determining our provision for income taxes and related tax balances include forecasts of our future income and expenses, potential tax planning strategies and determination of the probability of certain tax positions being sustained upon examination by tax authorities. These inputs are subject to uncertainty due to potential changes in facts and circumstances, economic and political conditions, changes to existing tax laws and new regulations or interpretations by tax authorities. Changes in these conditions could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations and financial position.42ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISKWe are exposed to market risks that may result from changes in foreign currency exchange rates, interest rates and credit, and equity prices. To reduce certain of these risks, we enter into various types of foreign currency derivative hedging transactions, follow investment guidelines and monitor outstanding receivables as part of our risk management program. We may also enter into other transactions, such as interest rate derivative hedges, as needed.Foreign Currency Exchange Rate Risk We have operations in more than 35 countries worldwide. As a result, our financial results could be significantly affected by factors such as changes in foreign currency exchange rates or weak economic conditions in the foreign markets in which we distribute our products. Our operating results are exposed to changes in foreign currency exchange rates between the U.S. dollar and various foreign currencies, the most significant of which is the Euro. When the U.S. dollar strengthens against these currencies, the relative value of sales made in the respective foreign currency decreases. Conversely, when the U.S. dollar weakens against these currencies, the relative value of such sales increases. Overall, we are a net receiver of foreign currencies and, therefore, we benefit from a weaker U.S. dollar and are adversely affected by a stronger U.S. dollar. Approximately 29% of our product sales were denominated in foreign currencies during 2022. To partially mitigate the impact of changes in currency exchange rates on net cash flows from our foreign currency denominated sales, we enter into foreign currency exchange forward contracts. We also hedge certain monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies, which reduces but does not eliminate our exposure to currency fluctuations between the date a transaction is recorded and the date that cash is collected or paid. In general, the market risks of these contracts are offset by corresponding gains and losses on the transactions being hedged. As of December 31, 2022 and 2021, we had open foreign currency forward contracts with notional amounts of $3.0 billion and $2.9 billion, respectively. A hypothetical 10% adverse movement in foreign currency exchange rates compared with the U.S. dollar relative to exchange rates as of December 31, 2022 and 2021 would have resulted in a reduction in fair value of these contracts of approximately $299 million and $333 million, respectively, and if realized, would have negatively affected earnings over the remaining life of the contracts. The analysis does not consider the impact that hypothetical changes in foreign currency exchange rates would have on anticipated transactions that these foreign currency sensitive instruments were designed to offset.Interest Rate and Credit Risk Our portfolio of available-for-sale debt securities and our senior unsecured notes create an exposure to interest rate and credit risk. With respect to our investment portfolio, we adhere to an investment policy that requires us to limit amounts invested in securities based on credit rating, maturity, industry group and investment type and issuer, except for securities issued by the U.S. government. The goals of our investment policy, in order of priority, are as follows: • safety and preservation of principal and diversification of risk; • liquidity of investments sufficient to meet cash flow requirements; and • a competitive after-tax rate of return. The following table summarizes the expected maturities and average interest rates of our interest-generating assets and interest-bearing liabilities as of December 31, 2022: Expected MaturityTotal Fair Value(in millions, except percentages)20232024202520262027ThereafterTotalAssetsAvailable-for-sale debt securities$1,048 $830 $382 $19 $4 $9 $2,293 $2,293 Average interest rate2.55 %3.41 %3.83 %5.09 %2.42 %2.07 %LiabilitiesSenior unsecured fixed rate notes, including current portion(1)$2,250 $1,750 $1,750 $2,750 $2,000 $13,750 $24,250 $21,872 Average interest rate1.33 %3.70 %3.50 %3.65 %2.29 %4.07 %_______________________________(1) Amounts represent principal balances. In addition to the senior unsecured fixed rate notes, we have a $2.5 billion five-year revolving credit facility that matures in June 2025. There were no amounts outstanding under the five-year revolving credit facility as of December 31, 2022. See Note 11. Debt and Credit Facilities of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information. 43Equity Price Risk We hold shares of common stock of certain publicly traded biotechnology companies primarily in connection with license and collaboration agreements. These equity securities are measured at fair value with any changes in fair value recognized in earnings. The fair value of these equity securities was approximately $1.2 billion and $1.8 billion as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. Changes in fair value of these equity securities are impacted by the volatility of the stock market and changes in general economic conditions, among other factors. A hypothetical 20% increase or decrease in the stock prices of these equity securities would have increased or decreased their fair value as of December 31, 2022 and 2021 by approximately $239 million and $364 million, respectively.44",2023-12-30 19:04:11.333537

The Form 8-K includes an unaudited pro forma condensed consolidated balance sheet as of September 30, 2001 presented as if the transaction had occurred as of that date and unaudited pro forma condensed consolidated statements of operations for the year ended December 31, 2000 and the nine months ended September 30, 2001, presented as if the transaction had occurred January 1, 2000 and January 1, 2001, respectively. 63 GILEAD SCIENCES, INC. CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Years ended December 31, 2001, 2000 and 1999 CONTENTS Report of Independent Auditors 65 Report of Independent Accountants 66 Audited Consolidated Financial Statements: Consolidated Balance Sheets 67 Consolidated Statements of Operations 68 Consolidated Statement of Stockholders' Equity 69 Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows 70 Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements 72 64 REPORT OF ERNST & YOUNG LLP, INDEPENDENT AUDITORS The Board of Directors and Stockholders Gilead Sciences, Inc. We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Gilead Sciences, Inc. and subsidiaries as of December 31, 2001 and 2000, and the related consolidated statements of operations, stockholders' equity, and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2001. Our audits also included the financial statement schedule listed in Item 14(a) of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. These financial statements and schedule are the responsibility of the management of Gilead Sciences, Inc. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements and schedule based on our audits. We did not audit the financial statements of Proligo L.L.C., a limited liability company, the investment in which is reflected in the accompanying consolidated financial statements using the equity method of accounting. The investment in Proligo L.L.C. represents 1.0% of consolidated total assets at December 31, 2000, and the Company's equity in the net loss of Proligo L.L.C. is $2,858,000 and $4,656,000 in 2000 and 1999, respectively. The 2000 and 1999 financial statements of Proligo L.L.C. have been audited by other auditors whose report has been furnished to us; insofar as our opinion on the 2000 and 1999 consolidated financial statements relates to data included for Proligo L.L.C., it is based solely on their report. We conducted our audits in accordance with auditing standards generally accepted in the United States. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits and the report of other auditors provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. In our opinion, based on our audits and the report of other auditors, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the consolidated financial position of Gilead Sciences, Inc. and subsidiaries at December 31, 2001 and 2000, and the consolidated results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2001, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. Also in our opinion, the financial statement schedule referred to above, when considered in relation to the basic financial statements taken as a whole, presents fairly, in all material respects, the information set forth therein. As discussed in Notes 2 and 3 to the consolidated financial statements, effective January 1, 2001, the Company changed its method of accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities, and, effective January 1, 2000, changed its method of accounting for non-refundable up-front fees received in connection with collaboration agreements. ERNST & YOUNG LLP Palo Alto, California January 25, 2002, except as to the paragraph titled ""Stock Split"" of Note 1, as to which the date is March 8, 2002 65 REPORT OF INDEPENDENT ACCOUNTANTS To the Board of Directors and Members of Proligo LLC: In our opinion, the accompanying consolidated balance sheets and the related consolidated statements of operations, of members' equity and of cash flows present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Proligo LLC and its subsidiaries at December 31, 2000 and November 30, 1999 and 1998, and the results of their operations and their cash flows for the thirteen-months ended December 31, 2000, the year ended November 30, 1999, and the period August 15, 1998 to November 30, 1998, respectively, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's management; our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on our audits. We conducted our audits of these statements in accordance with auditing standards generally accepted in the United States of America, which require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, and evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP Broomfield, Colorado January 12, 2001 66 GILEAD SCIENCES, INC.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS DECEMBER 31, 2001 1. ORGANIZATION AND SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES Overview Gilead was incorporated in Delaware on June 22, 1987. We are an independent biopharmaceutical company focused on the discovery, development and commercialization of antivirals, antibacterials and antifungals to treat life-threatening infectious diseases. We are a multinational company, with revenues from five approved products and operations in ten countries. Currently, we market Viread for the treatment of HIV infection, AmBisome, an antifungal agent, DaunoXome, a drug approved for the treatment of Kaposi's Sarcoma, and Vistide for the treatment of cytomegalovirus (CMV) retinitis. Hoffmann-La Roche Inc. markets Tamiflu for the treatment of influenza, under a collaborative agreement with Gilead. We are seeking to add to our existing portfolio of products through our clinical development programs, internal discovery programs and an active product acquisition and in-licensing strategy. Our internal discovery activities include identification of new molecular targets, target screening and medicinal chemistry. In addition, we are currently developing products to treat hepatitis B virus and bacterial infections. We also have expertise in liposomal drug delivery technology that we use to develop drugs that are safer, easier for patients to tolerate and more effective. As more fully described in Note 5, on July 29, 1999, Gilead entered into a business combination (the Merger) with NeXstar Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (NeXstar). The business combination was accounted for as a pooling of interests and the historical consolidated financial statements of Gilead for all years prior to the business combination have been restated to include the financial position, results of operations and cash flows of NeXstar. No material adjustments were necessary to conform the accounting policies of the two companies. Costs of the Merger were charged to operations in 1999. The accompanying consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and its wholly and majority-owned subsidiaries. Significant intercompany transactions have been eliminated. Certain prior period amounts have been reclassified to be consistent with the current presentation. Stock Split On February 22, 2001 and on March 8, 2002, Gilead completed two-for-one stock splits, effected in the form of a stock dividend, to stockholders of record as of February 2, 2001 and February 14, 2002, respectively. Accordingly, all share and per share amounts for all periods presented have been restated to reflect both of these splits. Changes in Accounting Principles Gilead adopted Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) Nos. 133 and 138, collectively referred to as SFAS 133, Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities, in the first quarter of 2001. The change was accounted for as a change in accounting principle. See Note 3, ""Derivative Financial Instruments."" Effective in the first quarter of 2000, Gilead adopted the SEC's Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 101 (SAB 101), Revenue Recognition in Financial Statements, and the change was also accounted for as a change in accounting principle. See Note 2. Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, and related disclosure of assets 72 and liabilities. On an on-going basis, we evaluate our estimates, including those related to revenue recognition, bad debts, inventories, accrued clinical and preclinical expenses, and contingencies. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other market specific assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ significantly from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. Revenue Recognition Product sales revenue is recognized upon passage of legal title of the inventory and satisfaction of all of the Company's performance obligations. The Company does not provide its customers with a general right of product return. However, the Company will accept returns of product that has expired or is deemed to be damaged or defective when delivered. Provisions are made for doubtful accounts, estimated product returns, cash discounts and government discounts and rebates. Contract revenue for research and development is recorded as earned based on the performance requirements of the contract. Nonrefundable contract fees for which no further performance obligations exist, and there is no continuing involvement by Gilead, are recognized on the earlier of when the payments are received or when collection is assured. Revenue from non-refundable up-front license fees where we continue involvement through development collaboration or an obligation to supply product, is recognized as the manufacturing obligation is fulfilled or ratably over the development period or the period of the manufacturing obligation, as appropriate. Revenue associated with substantive performance milestones is recognized based upon the achievement of the milestones, as defined in the respective agreements. Revenue under research and development cost reimbursement contracts is recognized as the related costs are incurred. Advance payments received in excess of amounts earned are classified as deferred revenue. Royalty revenue from sales of AmBisome is recognized in the month following that in which the corresponding sales occur. Royalty revenue from sales of Vistide and Tamiflu is recognized when received, which is the quarter following the quarter in which the corresponding sales occur. Research and Development Costs Major components of R&D expenses consist of personnel costs, including salaries and benefits, clinical studies performed by contract research organizations, materials and supplies, and overhead allocations consisting of various administrative and facilities related costs. Our research and development activities are also separated into three main categories: research, clinical development and pharmaceutical development. Research costs typically consist of preclinical and toxicology work. Clinical development costs include Phase I, II, and III clinical trials as well as expanded access programs. Pharmaceutical development costs consist of product formulation and chemical analysis. We record accruals for estimated clinical and preclinical study costs. These costs are a significant component of research and development expenses. Management accrues costs for clinical studies performed by 73 contract research organizations based on estimates that 25% to 30% of the work is for upfront costs with the remaining activity generally on a straight-line basis over the life of the individual contract or study. This estimate may or may not match the actual services performed by the organizations as determined by patient enrollment levels and related activities. We monitor patient enrollment levels and related activity to the extent possible, however, if management has underestimated activity levels associated with various studies at a given point in time, we could record significant research and development expenses in future periods. Advertising Expenses The Company expenses the costs of advertising, including promotional expenses, as incurred. Advertising expenses were $16.5 million in 2001, $8.4 million in 2000, and $7.9 million in 1999. Stock-Based Compensation In accordance with the provisions of SFAS No. 123, Accounting For Stock-Based Compensation, the Company has elected to follow Accounting Principles Board Opinion (APB) No. 25, Accounting For Stock Issued To Employees, and Interpretation No. 44 (FIN 44), Accounting for Certain Transactions Involving Stock Compensation—an Interpretation of APB Opinion No. 25 in accounting for its employee stock option plans. Under APB 25, if the exercise price of the Company's employee and director stock options equals or exceeds the fair value of the underlying stock on the date of grant, no compensation expense is recognized. See Note 14 for pro forma disclosures of stock-based compensation pursuant to SFAS 123. Per Share Computations For 2001, basic net income per common share is computed based on the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the period. Diluted net income per common share for 2001 includes the effects of approximately 12.1 million stock options and warrants, but does not include the effect of the $250.0 million 5% convertible notes which would convert to approximately 10.2 million shares, as their effect is antidilutive. For all periods presented prior to 2001, both basic and diluted loss per common share are computed based on the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the period. The convertible notes, stock options and warrants, as well as the convertible debentures that were previously outstanding, were excluded from the computation of diluted loss per share as their effect is antidilutive for the periods presented prior to 2001. All share and per share amounts for all periods presented have been restated to reflect the stock splits of February 22, 2001 and March 8, 2002. Cash and Cash Equivalents The Company considers highly liquid investments with insignificant interest rate risk and a remaining maturity of three months or less at the purchase date to be cash equivalents. Gilead may enter into overnight repurchase agreements under which it purchases securities with an obligation to resell them the following day. Securities purchased under agreements to resell are recorded at face value and reported as cash and cash equivalents. Under the Company's investment policy, it may enter into repurchase agreements (repos) with major banks and authorized dealers provided that such repos 74 are collateralized by U.S. government securities with a fair value of at least 102% of the fair value of securities sold to Gilead. Marketable Securities Management determines the appropriate classification of our marketable securities at the time of purchase and reevaluates such designation at each balance sheet date. All of the Company's marketable securities are classified as available-for-sale and carried at estimated fair values and reported in either cash equivalents or marketable securities. At December 31, 2001, cash and cash equivalents include $121.2 million of securities designated as available-for-sale ($137.6 million at December 31, 2000). Unrealized gains and losses on available-for-sale securities are excluded from earnings and reported as a separate component of stockholders' equity. Interest income includes interest, dividends, amortization of purchase premiums and discounts, and realized gains and losses on sales of securities. The cost of securities sold is based on the specific identification method. We regularly review all of our investments for other-than-temporary declines in fair value. When we determine that the decline in fair value of an investment below our accounting basis is other-than-temporary, we reduce the carrying value of the securities we hold and record a loss in the amount of any such decline. No such reductions have been required during the past three years. Concentrations of Credit Risk Gilead is subject to credit risk from its portfolio of cash equivalents and marketable securities. By policy, the Company limits amounts invested in such securities by maturity, industry group, investment type and issuer, except for securities issued by the U.S. government. Gilead is not exposed to any significant concentrations of credit risk from these financial instruments, however we do hold 924,984 shares of OSI common stock as a result of the sale of our oncology assets to OSI (see Note 4). These shares, with a fair value of $42.3 million at December 31, 2001, represent our entire portfolio of marketable equity securities. The goals of the Company's investment policy, in order of priority, are as follows: safety and preservation of principal and diversification of risk; liquidity of investments sufficient to meet cash flow requirements; and competitive after-tax rate of return. Gilead is also subject to credit risk from its accounts receivable related to product sales. A majority of the Company's trade accounts receivable arises from sales of AmBisome, primarily through sales to our European subsidiaries and export sales to our distributors in Europe. In certain countries where payments are typically slow, primarily Greece, Spain, Portugal and Italy, our accounts receivable balances are significant. In most cases, these slow payment practices reflect the pace at which governmental entities reimburse our customers. This, in turn, may increase the financial risk related to certain of our customers. Sales to customers in countries that tend to be relatively slow paying have in the past increased, and in the future may further increase, the average length of time that accounts receivable are outstanding. To date, we have experienced only modest losses with respect to the collection of our accounts receivable and believe that all past due accounts receivable, including those due from customers in these four countries, are collectible. We continually seek to improve our collection processes to ensure that we fully collect amounts due to us based on our product sales and that collections are timely. We perform credit evaluations of our customers' financial condition and 75 generally have not required collateral. To date, we have experienced only modest credit losses with respect to our accounts receivable. Inventories Inventories are recorded at the lower of cost or market, with cost determined on a first-in, first-out basis. Management periodically reviews the composition of inventory in order to identify obsolete, slow-moving or otherwise unsaleable items. If such items are observed and there are no alternate uses for the inventory, the Company will record a write-down to net realizable value in the period that the units are identified as impaired. Historically, inventory write-downs have been insignificant and consistent with management's expectations. Property, Plant and Equipment Property, plant and equipment is stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and amortization. Depreciation and amortization are recognized using the straight-line method. Estimated useful lives are as follows: Description Estimated Useful Life (in years) Building and leasehold improvements 20 Laboratory and manufacturing equipment 4-10 Office and computer equipment 2-6 Office and computer equipment includes capitalized computer software. All of the Company's capitalized software is purchased. The Company has no internally developed computer software. Leasehold improvements and capitalized leased equipment are amortized over the shorter of the lease term or the item's useful life. Other Noncurrent Assets Other noncurrent assets at December 31, 2001 includes $11.0 million of prepaid royalties paid to the Institute of Organic Chemistry and Biochemistry of the Academy of Sciences of the Czech Republic and Rega Stichting (IOCB/REGA), as discussed under the ""IOCB/REGA"" caption of Note 7. Also included in other noncurrent assets at December 31, 2001 are deferred debt issuance costs of $6.9 million, net of accumulated amortization of $1.3 million, related to the $250.0 million 5% subordinated convertible notes Gilead issued in December 2000. 76 Long-Lived Assets The carrying value of long-lived assets is reviewed on a regular basis for the existence of facts or circumstances both internally and externally that may suggest impairment. Specific potential indicators of impairment include: •a significant decrease in the fair value of an asset; •a significant change in the extent or manner in which an asset is used or a significant physical change in an asset; •a significant adverse change in legal factors or in the business climate that affects the value of an asset; •an adverse action or assessment by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration or another regulator; •an accumulation of costs significantly in excess of the amount originally expected to acquire or construct an asset; and •operating or cash flow losses combined with a history of operating or cash flow losses or a projection or forecast that demonstrates continuing losses associated with an income-producing asset. Should there be indication of impairment, the Company will confirm this by comparing the estimated future cash flows expected to result from the use of the asset and its eventual disposition to the carrying amount of the asset. In estimating these future cash flows, assets are grouped at the lowest level for which there are identifiable cash flows that are largely independent of the cash flows generated by other asset groups. If the sum of the expected future cash flows (undiscounted and without interest changes) is less than the carrying amount of the asset, an impairment loss, measured as the excess of the carrying value of the asset over its fair value, will be recognized. The cash flow estimates used in such calculations are based on management's best estimates, using appropriate and customary assumptions and projections at the time. Other Current Accrued Liabilities At December 31, 2001 and December 31, 2000, other accrued liabilities included $2.4 million of accrued litigation settlement costs. See the Legal Proceedings discussion in Note 13. Foreign Currency Translation, Transactions and Contracts Adjustments resulting from translating the financial statements of the Company's foreign subsidiaries into U.S. dollars are excluded from the determination of net income and are accumulated in a separate component of stockholders' equity. Net foreign exchange transaction losses are reported as a selling, general and administrative expense in the consolidated statements of operations. Such losses were $1.4 million in 2001, $0.5 million in 2000 and $0.5 million in 1999. The Company hedges certain of its foreign currency exposures related to outstanding trade accounts receivable and firmly committed purchase transactions with foreign exchange forward contracts. In general, these contracts do not expose the Company to market risk because gains and losses on the contracts offset gains and losses on the transactions being hedged. The Company's 77 exposure to credit risk from these contracts is a function of changes in interest and currency exchange rates and, therefore, varies over time. Gilead limits the risk that counterparties to these contracts may be unable to perform by transacting only with major U.S. banks. The Company also limits its risk of loss by entering into contracts that provide for net settlement at maturity. Therefore, the Company's overall risk of loss in the event of a counterparty default is limited to the amount of any unrecognized and unrealized gains on outstanding contracts (i.e., those contracts that have a positive fair value) at the date of default. The Company does not enter into speculative foreign currency transactions and does not write options. In accounting for hedges of accounts receivable, the Company's aggregate net foreign currency transaction gain or loss is reported as a selling, general and administrative expense. Prior to the adoption of SFAS 133 on January 1, 2001, the Company recognized the net unrealized gain or loss on outstanding forward contracts based on the difference between the contract exchange rate and the market exchange rate at each balance sheet date. With respect to hedges of firmly committed purchase transactions, unrealized gains and losses on the underlying forward contracts were deferred and reported as a component of the related transaction in the period in which it occurred. At December 31, 2001, the Company has net unrealized losses on its open foreign exchange forward contracts of $0.9 million. The Company had forward exchange contracts outstanding of $72.3 million at December 31, 2001 and $53.8 million at December 31, 2000. The contracts have maturities of one year or less with one exception. One hedge contract intended to hedge raw materials purchases in the first quarter of 2003, with a notional amount of $3.7 million and no fair value at December 31, 2001, has a maturity of 13 months. The Company presently does not hedge its net investment in any of its foreign subsidiaries. Effective January 2002, we have begun to use forward contracts to hedge a percentage of our forecasted international sales, primarily those denominated in the euro currency. See Note 3 for a further discussion of derivative financial instruments and our adoption of SFAS 133. Fair Value of Financial Instruments The Company's financial instruments consist principally of cash and cash equivalents, marketable securities, accounts receivable, certain other non-current assets, forward foreign exchange contracts, accounts payable, long-term obligations and convertible subordinated notes. Cash and cash equivalents, marketable securities and forward foreign exchange contracts that hedge accounts receivable are reported at their respective fair values on the balance sheet. Forward foreign exchange contracts that hedge firmly committed purchases are recorded at fair value, net of the related deferred gain or loss, resulting in a reported net balance of zero. Management believes the remaining financial instruments, with the exception of the convertible subordinated notes, are reported on the balance sheet at amounts that approximate current fair values. The fair value of the convertible subordinated notes at December 31, 2001 was $382.8 million and the fair value at December 31, 2000 was $211.6 million. The carrying value at the end of each period was $250 million. The fair value at December 31, 2001 was determined by obtaining a quote from a market maker for the notes. The fair value at December 31, 78 2000 was obtained by multiplying the number of shares into which the notes can be converted, by the per share market price of Gilead's common stock at December 31, 2000, plus accrued interest. Recent Accounting Pronouncements In July 2001, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued SFAS No. 141, Business Combinations (SFAS 141), and No. 142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets (SFAS 142). SFAS 141 eliminates the pooling-of-interests method of accounting for business combinations except for qualifying business combinations that were initiated prior to July 1, 2001. SFAS 141 further clarifies the criteria to recognize intangible assets separately from goodwill. The requirements of SFAS 141 are effective for any business combination accounted for by the purchase method that is completed after June 30, 2001. Under SFAS 142, goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets are no longer amortized but are reviewed annually (or more frequently if impairment indicators arise) for impairment. Separable intangible assets that are not deemed to have an indefinite life will continue to be amortized over their useful lives (but with no maximum life). The amortization provisions of SFAS 142 apply to goodwill and intangible assets acquired after June 30, 2001. As Gilead has not accounted for any business combinations under the purchase method of accounting, the adoption of SFAS 141 on July 1, 2001 did not have a material impact on the Company's financial position or results of operations and the adoption of SFAS 142 on January 1, 2002 will not have a material impact on the Company's financial position or results of operations. In August 2001, the FASB issued SFAS 144, Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets. SFAS 144 establishes a single accounting model for assets to be disposed of by sale whether previously held and used or newly acquired. SFAS 144 retains the presentation of discontinued operations in the income statement, but broadens the presentation to include a component of an entity. SFAS 144 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2001 and the interim periods within. The adoption of SFAS 144 on January 1, 2002 will not have a material impact on the Company's financial position or results of operations. 2. CUMULATIVE CHANGE IN ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLE In December 1999, the Securities and Exchange Commission issued Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 101 (SAB 101), Revenue Recognition in Financial Statements. Among other things, SAB 101 describes the SEC Staff's position on the recognition of certain nonrefundable up-front fees received in connection with collaboration agreements. The Company previously recognized nonrefundable technology access fees received in connection with collaboration agreements as revenue when received or when collectibility was probable, and when the technology had been transferred. Effective January 1, 2000, Gilead changed its method of accounting for these fees to recognize them as the related manufacturing obligation is fulfilled or on a straight-line basis over the term of the related research and development collaboration, manufacturing or supply arrangement, as appropriate, as this method best matches the effort provided. Management believes the change in accounting principle is preferable based on guidance provided in SAB 101. The cumulative effect of the change in accounting principle was recorded in the fourth quarter of 2000, retroactively effective as of January 1, 2000, as deferred revenue that will be recognized as contract revenue over the remaining term of the research and development, manufacturing or supply arrangements, as appropriate. For the year ended December 31, 2000, the net impact of the change in 79 accounting principle was to increase the net loss by $10.7 million, or $0.06 per share. The loss consists of a $13.7 million cumulative effect of the change as of January 1, 2000, net of $2.9 million of related deferred revenue that was recognized as contract revenue during the year 2000. An additional $3.5 million of contract revenue was recognized in 2001 and the remainder of the $7.3 million related deferred revenue balance as of December 31, 2001, is expected to be recognized as revenue in fiscal years 2002 through 2012. 3. DERIVATIVE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS On January 1, 2001, Gilead adopted SFAS 133. The standard requires that Gilead recognize all derivatives as either assets or liabilities measured at fair value. If the derivative is designated as, and meets the definition of, a fair value hedge, the changes in the fair value of the derivative and of the hedged item attributable to the hedged risk are recognized in earnings. If the derivative is designated as, and meets the definition of, a cash flow hedge, the effective portions of changes in the fair value of the derivative are recorded in other comprehensive income and are recognized in the income statement when the hedged item affects earnings. Ineffective portions of changes in the fair value of cash flow hedges are recognized in earnings immediately. SFAS 133 also classifies warrants to purchase capital stock of a non-public company, which include a net exercise feature as derivatives, and as such upon adoption are to be recorded in the balance sheet at fair value with an offsetting amount recorded in the results of operations. Subsequent changes in the fair value of the warrants are required to be remeasured at each balance sheet date, with changes in the fair value of the warrants recorded in results of operations. Gilead sells product and purchases raw materials internationally in both US dollars and local currency. Forecasted and actual foreign currency risks are hedged with forward currency contracts, generally with maturities of 12 months or less. These derivative instruments are employed to eliminate or minimize certain foreign currency exposures that can be confidently identified and quantified. Forward contracts hedging non-functional currency assets and liabilities are not SFAS 133 designated hedges and changes in fair value are recognized immediately in earnings. In accordance with SFAS 133, hedges related to anticipated foreign currency purchases of raw materials designated and documented at the inception of the respective hedge are designated as cash flow hedges and evaluated for effectiveness quarterly. As the terms of the forward contract and the underlying transaction are matched at inception, forward contract effectiveness is calculated by comparing the fair value of the contract to the change in the forward value of the underlying hedged item, with the effective portion of the gain or loss on the derivative instrument reported as a component of other comprehensive income in stockholders' equity and reclassified into earnings in the same period or periods during which the hedged transaction affects earnings. Upon adoption of SFAS 133, we recorded a fair value of $0.6 million related to forward contracts previously not reflected in the balance sheet and recognized a cumulative transition adjustment to other comprehensive income of $0.6 million for the effective component of the hedge. Substantially all values reported in other comprehensive income at December 31, 2001 will be reclassified to earnings within 12 months. Any residual changes in fair value of the instruments or other ineffectiveness are recognized immediately in selling, general and administrative expense. Ineffectiveness during 2001 was not significant. Gilead holds warrants to purchase stock in two non-public companies. These warrants have net exercise features and under SFAS 133 are classified as a derivative instruments. Upon adoption, Gilead 80 recorded the fair value of one of these warrants at $1.1M with an offsetting adjustment to cumulative change in accounting principle. During the year ended 2001, a $1.4 million loss on hedging contracts has been recognized in the income statement and a $0.6 million reduction in the fair value of derivatives has been recognized in other comprehensive income. At December 31, 2001, the fair value of derivatives recognized in other comprehensive income is not material. 4. SALE OF ONCOLOGY ASSETS On December 21, 2001, Gilead completed the sale of its oncology assets, pipeline of clinical candidates in oncology and all related intellectual property, as well as our Boulder, Colorado operations, including clinical research and drug development operations, infrastructure and facilities, to OSI Pharmaceuticals, Inc (OSI). The three clinical development candidates sold to OSI are: NX 211 (liposomal lurtotecan), GS 7836 (a nucleoside analogue) and GS 7904L (a liposomal thymidylate synthase inhibitor). As consideration, Gilead received $130.0 million in cash and 924,984 shares of OSI common stock valued at approximately $38.8 million as of December 21, 2001. The number of shares issued to Gilead was determined by dividing $40.0 million by the average closing sale price of OSI common stock for the 5 days preceding December 21, 2001. We are also entitled to additional payments from OSI of up to $30.0 million in either cash or a combination of cash and OSI common stock if and when OSI reaches certain development milestones for NX 211, the most advanced of the oncology product candidates sold to OSI. Based upon the December 21, 2001 net book value of the oncology assets sold of $5.0 million, transaction costs of $3.2 million, and $2.8 million related to the acceleration of approximately 78,000 options to purchase Gilead common stock, the Company realized a pretax gain of $157.8 million in the fourth quarter of 2001. The carrying value of the transferred assets relates primarily to certain property and equipment. OSI assumed all of Gilead's oncology-related clinical and preclinical obligations, as well as various lease obligations. Under a related manufacturing agreement, we will produce for OSI liposomal formulations of NX 211 and GS 7904L, the two liposomal products sold to OSI, at our manufacturing facility in San Dimas, CA. 5. ACQUISITION OF NEXSTAR On July 29, 1999, the Company acquired all of the outstanding common stock of NeXstar Pharmaceuticals under an agreement dated as of February 28, 1999. As a result, NeXstar became a wholly owned subsidiary of Gilead. In connection with the Merger, Gilead issued a total of 44.8 million shares of Gilead common stock to NeXstar's stockholders as consideration for all shares of common stock of NeXstar. In addition, holders of options and warrants outstanding at the time of the merger to purchase an aggregate of approximately 2.2 million shares of NeXstar common stock would receive, upon exercise of such options and warrants, the same fraction of a share of Gilead common stock. Holders of $80.0 million principal amount of 6.25% convertible subordinated debentures of NeXstar received the right to convert the debentures into approximately 7.2 million shares of Gilead common stock. The Merger qualified as a tax-free reorganization and was accounted for as a pooling of interests. 81 The table below presents the separate 1999 results of operations for Gilead and NeXstar for the periods prior to the merger and combined results after the merger (in thousands): Gilead NeXstar Merger-related adjustments Total Year ended December 31, 1999 Revenues $ 24,659 $ 144,320 $ — $ 168,979 Net income (loss) (73,534 ) 25,351 (18,303 )(a) (66,486 ) (a)Merger-related costs (b)Adjustment required to conform accounting policy. NeXstar's policy was to capitalize certain patent and trademark costs, while it was Gilead's policy to charge such items to selling, general and administrative expense in the period incurred. The accompanying financial statements have been restated for all periods such that all patent and trademark costs are expensed as incurred. As a result of its merger with NeXstar, the Company incurred merger-related costs consisting of transaction costs (primarily professional fees, filing fees, printing costs and other related charges), employee severance costs and the write-down of certain NeXstar assets that would not be used in continuing operations. The following table shows the details of the merger-related costs and accruals at December 31, 1999 (in thousands): Charged to Expense Through December 31, 1999 Utilized December 31, 1999 Accrual Balance Merger transaction costs $ 12,214 $ 12,196 $ 18 Employee severance 5,309 2,821 2,488 Write-down of NeXstar assets 536 N/A N/A Other 244 244 — Total $ 18,303 $ 15,261 $ 2,506 All employees for which severance costs were accrued had been terminated as of December 31, 1999. Substantially all remaining accrued severance costs were paid to former employees by December 31, 2000. All merger transaction costs were utilized by December 31, 2000. 82 6.

None of the estimated maturities of the Company's asset-backed securities exceed three years. Marketable equity securities, consisting of OSI common stock, are expected to be available for sale during the first half of 2002. 83 7. COLLABORATIVE ARRANGEMENTS AND CONTRACTS Cubist Pharmaceuticals In January 2001, Gilead entered into an agreement with Cubist Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (Cubist) relating to Cubist's antibacterial compound daptomycin, including Cidecin™, an intravenous formulation of the compound that is currently in Phase III clinical trials for treatment of bacterial infections. Under the terms of the agreement, Gilead paid Cubist an upfront license fee of $13.0 million and received exclusive commercial rights to the compound in sixteen European countries (Gilead's territory) as well as the right to develop the compound for commercialization in this territory. Research and development expense has been charged for $10.6 million of the $13.0 million payment. The $2.4 million balance is included in other noncurrent assets at December 31, 2001 because if, prior to January 2002, Gilead terminated its rights under the agreement with respect to a preclinical oral formulation of daptomycin being developed by Cubist, or if Cubist discontinued development of that oral formulation, Gilead would have been entitled to receive a refund of this amount from Cubist. Subsequent to January 2002, this refundable amount is reduced ratably on a monthly basis over a four-year period and is being amortized to research and development expense. Cubist will continue to be responsible for worldwide clinical development of Cidecin and the preclinical oral formulation. Gilead will be responsible for both regulatory filings and marketing and selling of the product within Gilead's territory. Gilead also agreed to make additional payments to Cubist of up to $30.7 million if certain clinical and regulatory milestones related to Cidecin and the oral formulation are reached. Through 2001, three of these milestones had been met and Gilead paid $5.5 million related to those milestones. These payments have been recorded as research and development expense. Additionally, if Cidecin is successfully commercialized in Gilead's territory, Gilead will pay Cubist a royalty on net sales of the product. Archemix In October 2001, we entered into an agreement with Archemix Corporation relating to our SELEX technology. Under this agreement, we gave Archemix the exclusive rights to the SELEX process, including therapeutic and other commercial applications to the extent not already licensed under pre-existing agreements. Archemix paid to us $9.0 million in 2001 and is required to pay us $8.5 million in 2002. As required by our license agreement with the University Technology Corporation, we paid 5% of the $9.0 million payment to, and will pay 5% of the $8.5 million payment to, the University Technology Corporation. We also received a warrant to purchase 350,000 shares of Archemix common stock, the value of which is not material. As required by our license agreement with the University Technology Corporation, we transferred 5% of this warrant to the University Technology Corporation. EyeTech In March 2000, Gilead entered into an agreement with EyeTech Pharmaceuticals, Inc. relating to Gilead's proprietary aptamer EYE001. Currently in early clinical trials, EYE001 is an inhibitor of vascular endothelial growth factor, or VEGF, which is known to play a role in the development of certain ophthalmic diseases. Under the terms of the agreement, EyeTech received worldwide rights to all therapeutic uses of EYE001, and, if the product is successfully commercialized, EyeTech will pay Gilead royalties on worldwide sales of the product. EyeTech also will be responsible for all research 84 and development costs. Gilead will provide clinical supplies of the product to EyeTech through March 2001. Gilead received a $7.0 million up-front licensing fee from EyeTech in April 2000, which was recognized as revenue ratably over the one-year supply agreement period. Accordingly, $5.2 million of the license fee was recorded as contract revenue under the agreement in 2000, and the remainder of the license fee was recognized as revenue in 2001. Gilead is also entitled to additional cash payments from EyeTech of up to $25.0 million if and when EyeTech reaches certain EYE001 development milestones. Additionally, Gilead received a warrant to purchase 791,667 shares of EyeTech series B convertible preferred stock, exercisable at a price of $6.00 per share, the price at which the stock was issued to other investors. See Note 3 for a description of the accounting treatment of the warrant. Fujisawa The Company's rights to market AmBisome are subject to an agreement between the Company and Fujisawa Healthcare, Inc., as successor to Fujisawa USA, Inc. (Fujisawa). Under the terms of the Fujisawa agreement, as amended, Fujisawa and the Company co-promote AmBisome in the United States, Fujisawa has sole marketing rights to AmBisome in Canada and the Company has exclusive marketing rights to AmBisome in the rest of the world, provided the Company pays royalties to Fujisawa in connection with sales in most significant Asian markets, including Japan. In connection with U.S. sales, Fujisawa purchases AmBisome from the Company at cost. For sales in Canada, Fujisawa purchases AmBisome at cost plus a specified percentage. Fujisawa collects all payments from the sale of AmBisome in the United States and Canada. The Company receives 20% of Fujisawa's gross profits from the sale of AmBisome in the United States. Gross profits include a deduction for cost of goods sold, giving the Company a current effective royalty rate of approximately 17% of Fujisawa's net sales of AmBisome in the United States. In connection with the agreement between the Company and Fujisawa, Gilead recorded royalty revenue of $17.1 million in 2001, $13.5 million in 2000 and $8.3 million in 1999. Sumitomo In September 1996, the Company and Sumitomo Pharmaceuticals Co., Ltd. (Sumitomo) entered into an agreement (Sumitomo License) pursuant to which Sumitomo agreed to develop and market AmBisome in Japan. Under the terms of the Sumitomo License, Sumitomo paid the Company an initial $7.0 million licensing fee (less withholding taxes of $0.7 million) in October 1996 and a $3.0 million milestone payment (less withholding taxes of $0.3 million) in March 1998. Sumitomo also is required to make additional payments to the Company if certain clinical and commercial milestones are met and to pay the Company royalties on all Japanese AmBisome sales. Under the Sumitomo License, Gilead is obligated to provide a certain quantity of AmBisome to Sumitomo at no charge. AmBisome is not yet approved for marketing in Japan. Subsequent to the cumulative effect of the change in accounting principle that was recorded effective in the first quarter of 2000 resulting from the adoption of SAB 101, Gilead is recognizing the initial license fee over the remaining free supply arrangement period, which is currently expected to be over the next five years. The net impact of the change in accounting principle for the Sumitomo License was to increase the net loss in 2000 by $3.4 million. The cumulative effect of the change in accounting principle was a charge of $5.0 million. Contract revenue of $1.6 million related to the initial 85 licensing fee from Sumitomo was recognized as contract revenue in 2000 and $2.8 million was recognized as contract revenue in 2001. The remaining $0.6 million of related deferred revenue at December 31, 2001 will be recognized as contract revenue over the remaining free supply obligation period. Hoffmann-La Roche In September 1996, Gilead entered into a collaboration agreement with F. Hoffmann-La Roche Ltd. and Hoffmann-La Roche Inc. (collectively, Roche) to develop and commercialize therapies to treat and prevent viral influenza (the Roche Agreement). Under the Roche Agreement, Roche received exclusive worldwide rights to Gilead's proprietary influenza neuraminidase inhibitors. Prior to 1999, Roche made license fee and developmental milestone payments totaling $16.3 million. During 1999, Gilead recognized a total of $12.8 million of additional milestone payments due to the commencement of certain clinical trials in Japan, the filing of an application to market Tamiflu in the European Union, and the filing and subsequent approval to market Tamiflu in the United States. During 2000, Gilead recognized $9.6 million of contract revenue from milestone payments from Roche related to Tamiflu milestones achieved during the year. The milestones included filing for regulatory approval in Japan for treatment of influenza, the Japanese approval of the application, the filing for U.S. regulatory approval for the prevention of influenza, and the receipt of such approval in the U.S. In 2001, we recognized a $2.0 million milestone payment for the filing of an application to market Tamiflu as a prophylaxis in the European Union. Subsequent to the cumulative effect of the change in accounting principle that was recorded effective in the first quarter of 2000 resulting from the adoption of SAB 101, Gilead recognized the initial license fee over the remaining research and development period, which ended in the first quarter of 2000. The net impact of the change in accounting for the initial license fee was zero. The cumulative effect of the change in accounting principle related to the Roche license fee was a $0.7 million charge to results of operations, which was offset by additional contract revenue of $0.7 million also recognized in the first quarter of 2000. There is no remaining deferred revenue related to the Roche initial license fee as of December 31, 2001. As of December 31, 2001, Gilead is entitled to additional cash payments from Roche of up to $9.6 million upon Roche achieving additional developmental and regulatory milestones. In addition, Roche is required to pay Gilead royalties on net product sales. Gilead began receiving royalties from Roche's sales of Tamiflu in the first quarter of 2000. We recorded a total of $4.5 million of Tamiflu royalties in the year 2001 and $9.6 million of royalties in 2000. No Tamiflu royalties were recorded in 1999. The Company recognizes royalty revenue from Roche in the quarter following the quarter in which the related Tamiflu sales occur. Under the Roche Agreement, Roche also reimburses the Company for its related R&D costs under the program by funding such costs quarterly and generally in advance, based on an annual budget. Reimbursements are included in contract revenue as the Company incurs the related R&D costs. Amounts incurred by the Company in excess of amounts funded may also be reimbursed, subject to Roche's approval. In this event, revenue is not recognized until such approval has been obtained. Conversely, if amounts funded by Roche exceed the Company's related R&D costs, the Company may be required to repay such excess funding to Roche. The Company recorded contract revenue for R&D 86 reimbursements related to the Roche Agreement of approximately $0.1 million in 2001, $0.9 million in 2000 and $2.1 million in 1999. R&D costs related to the Roche Agreement approximate the reimbursement revenue in each year presented and are included in R&D expenses. Pharmacia In August 1996, the Company and Pharmacia Corporation (Pharmacia) entered into a License and Supply Agreement (Pharmacia Agreement) to market Vistide in all countries outside the United States. Under the terms of the Pharmacia Agreement, Pharmacia paid Gilead an initial license fee of $10.0 million. Subsequent to the cumulative effect of the change in accounting principle recorded effective in the first quarter of 2000, Gilead is recognizing the initial license fee on a straight-line basis over the supply arrangement period, which is sixteen years from the agreement date. The net impact of the change in accounting principle for the Pharmacia Agreement was to increase the net loss in 2000 by $7.3 million. The cumulative effect of the change in accounting principle related to the initial license fee from Pharmacia was a $7.9 million charge to results of operations, and additional contract revenue of $0.6 million was recognized in 2000 subsequent to the accounting change. The remaining $7.3 million of related deferred revenue is expected to be recognized on a straight-line basis as contract revenue over the remaining supply period, or twelve years beginning January 2001. During the second quarter of 1997, Vistide was approved for marketing in the European Union by the European Commission, which triggered an additional cash milestone payment of $10.0 million by Pharmacia to the Company. Also as a result of achieving this milestone, in the second quarter of 1997, Pharmacia purchased 1,133,786 shares of Series B Convertible Preferred Stock for approximately $40.0 million, or $35.28 per share. The preferred stock automatically converted into 4,535,144 shares of common stock in 1999. For additional information about the preferred stock, see Note 14. Under the terms of the Pharmacia Agreement and related agreements covering expanded access programs for Vistide outside of the United States, Gilead is responsible for maintaining the cidofovir patent portfolio and for supplying to Pharmacia bulk cidofovir used to manufacture the finished Vistide product. Gilead is entitled to receive a royalty based upon Pharmacia's sales of Vistide. Gilead receives a portion of the royalty upon shipping either bulk drug substance or Vistide to Pharmacia, and the remainder upon Pharmacia's sale of Vistide to third parties. Any royalties that Gilead receives before the product is sold to third parties are recorded as deferred revenue until such third-party sales occur. At December 31, 2001, the Company has recorded on its balance sheet approximately $3.1 million of such deferred revenue ($2.2 million at December 31, 2000). The Company recognized royalty revenue from sales of Vistide outside of the United States by Pharmacia of $1.4 million in 2001, $1.5 million in 2000 and $2.0 million in 1999. 87 Somalogic In November 1999, Gilead and Somalogic, Inc. (Somalogic) entered into an agreement whereby Gilead assigned to Somalogic under a sole and exclusive license, certain intellectual property related to the SELEX process for diagnostic purposes, including patents and patent applications. Under the terms of the agreement, Somalogic was required to pay Gilead a total of $2.5 million in two nonrefundable installments. The first $1.5 million was paid in November 1999 and was included in contract revenue for the year ended December 31, 1999. The remaining $1.0 million, which was reported as deferred revenue at December 31, 1999, was received and recorded as contract revenue in 2000. Gilead has no ongoing research or funding obligations under the agreement. Schering A.G. In 1993, the Company entered into a collaborative research agreement (Schering Research Agreement) and license agreement (Schering License Agreement) with Schering A.G. Under the Schering Research Agreement, Schering A.G. has funded research at Gilead for the discovery and development of aptamers as in vivo diagnostic agents. The level of funding under this agreement varied annually, from a high of $2.4 million to $0.3 million received and recorded as contract revenue in 1999. The Schering Research Agreement expired in 1999 and the Company does not expect to receive any additional payments thereunder. Under the Schering License Agreement, Schering A.G. has the right to develop and commercialize aptamers as in vivo diagnostic agents or radiotherapeutics discovered and developed under the Schering Research Agreement. Schering A.G. is required to make milestone and royalty payments to the Company upon commercialization and sale of any products developed under the collaboration with the Company. The milestone payments for any one product total $6.0 million and are triggered by the filing of an Investigational New Drug application, the initiation of Phase III clinical trials, the filing of an NDA and approval of a product for commercial sale. The Schering License Agreement, which was still in effect as of December 31, 2001, permits the Company to develop and commercialize aptamers discovered under the Schering Research Agreement outside the field of in vivo diagnostic agents or radiotherapeutics, subject to royalty payments to Schering A.G. GlaxoSmithKline In December 2000, Gilead entered into an agreement with Glaxo Wellcome, now GlaxoSmithKline (Glaxo) giving Gilead the rights to GS 7904L, a novel anti-tumor compound. Gilead was developing GS 7904L in a liposome and was evaluating it in preclinical studies. Under the agreement, Gilead had exclusive worldwide rights to develop and commercialize GS 7904L for all indications other than malaria. Gilead paid Glaxo an upfront fee that was included in R&D expense in 2000. In December 2001, this compound was assigned to OSI as part of the sale of oncology assets. In May 1998, Gilead entered into a three-part collaboration with Glaxo in which (a) Glaxo received a non-exclusive right to use Gilead's proprietary SELEX process for target validation; (b) Gilead received exclusive rights (subject to Glaxo's right to elect to participate in such activities) to develop and commercialize NX 211, a liposomal formulation of Glaxo's proprietary topoisomerase I inhibitor (lurtotecan); and (c) Glaxo acquired 1,457,028 shares of Gilead common stock for 88 $10.0 million in a private offering. In December 2000, the collaboration and license agreement was modified. Under the revised terms of agreement, Glaxo waived its right to participate in the development and commercialization of NX 211 and its right to receive royalties, giving Gilead exclusive rights to the compound. In December 2001, this compound was also assigned to OSI as part of the sale of oncology assets. IOCB/REGA In 1991 and 1992, Gilead entered into agreements with the Institute of Organic Chemistry and Biochemistry of the Academy of Sciences of the Czech Republic and Rega Stichting (IOCB/REGA) relating to certain nucleotide compounds discovered at these two institutions. Under the agreements, Gilead received the exclusive right to manufacture, use and sell these nucleotide compounds, and Gilead is obligated to pay IOCB/REGA a percentage of net revenues received from sales of products containing the compounds, subject to minimum royalty payments. The products covered by the agreement include Vistide, adefovir dipivoxil and Viread, but exclude Tamiflu. Gilead currently makes quarterly payments to IOCB/REGA based on a percentage of Vistide and Viread sales. If marketing approval is received from the FDA for adefovir dipivoxil, Gilead would be obligated to pay additional amounts to IOCB/REGA upon future sales of this product. In December 2000, the agreements with IOCB/REGA were amended to provide for a reduced royalty rate on future sales of adefovir dipivoxil or Viread, in return for an upfront payment from Gilead of $11.0 million upon signing the agreement. This payment was recorded as a long-term prepaid royalty and is classified in other noncurrent assets on the balance sheet at December 31, 2001. It is being recognized as royalty expense over the expected commercial life of Viread and will be recognized as royalty expense over the expected commercial life of adefovir dipivoxil when and if FDA approval is obtained and sales of the product commence. Amortization of the $11.0 million payment was not significant through December 31, 2001. Southern Research Institute In December 2000, Gilead entered into an agreement with Southern Research Institute giving Gilead worldwide rights to develop and commercialize GS 7836, an anti-tumor compound that Gilead was evaluating in preclinical studies. Under the terms of the agreement, Gilead paid Southern Research Institute an upfront fee, which was included in research and development expense in 2000. In December 2001, this compound was assigned to OSI as part of the sale of oncology assets. 8.

INVESTMENT IN AND SALE OF UNCONSOLIDATED AFFILIATE In July 1998, the Company established Proligo L.L.C., a Delaware limited liability company (Proligo), as a wholly owned subsidiary and transferred all of the assets of the NeXstar Technology Products division to Proligo. Proligo supplies nucleic acid and peptide synthesis products to the pharmaceutical and biopharmaceutical industry for sale and use as laboratory research reagents and in therapeutic and diagnostic products. On August 15, 1998, the Company sold a 51% interest (Interest) in Proligo to SKW Americas, Inc. (SKW). As payment for the Interest, the Company received $15.0 million in cash and a 49% interest in PerSeptive Biosystems GmbH, a company in Hamburg, Germany (Hamburg Company), which specializes in the manufacture of nucleoside phosphoramidite monomers. The 49% interest in the Hamburg Company had a fair market value of approximately $5.5 million. In addition, SKW agreed to pay the Company $3.0 million in guaranteed payments (discounted at 8.5% for gain recognition purposes) and up to $20.5 million in performance-based milestones over the next four years. Gilead received the full $3.0 million of guaranteed payments from SKW over the past three years. In 1999, Gilead also received a performance-based milestone payment of $1.0 million that was included in contract revenue. As part of the original transaction, the Company contributed $4.9 million and its 49% interest in the Hamburg Company to Proligo. The Company recorded a $22.1 million gain in connection with this sale in 1998. SKW contributed $5.1 million and the remaining 51% interest in the Hamburg Company to Proligo. Also in connection with this transaction, the Company and Proligo agreed that Proligo would manufacture oligonucleotides required by the Company at cost plus a fixed percentage. The Company purchased oligonucleotides from Proligo for a total of $0.5 million up through 2000. No purchases were made in 2001. The purchases up through 2000 were charged to R&D expense. In January 2000 and October 1999, Gilead made two additional cash investments in Proligo for a total of $5.0 million to maintain its 49% ownership interest in Proligo. Gilead had no commitments to provide additional funding to Proligo beyond January 2000. The Company accounted for its investment in Proligo using the equity method of accounting. The net book value of its investment was $6.9 million at December 31, 2000 and is reported in other 90 noncurrent assets on the Company's consolidated balance sheet. In 2001, Gilead recorded $2.1 million as equity in the loss of Proligo prior to the date of the sale. In 2000, we recognized $2.9 million equity in Proligo's net loss, representing our 49% share of Proligo's loss for the thirteen-month period ended December 31, 2000. During the fourth quarter of 2000, Proligo changed its fiscal year end to December 31 from November 30. In 1999, Gilead recorded $4.7 million equity in the loss of Proligo for Proligo's fiscal year ended November 31, 1999. During 2001, Gilead sold its 49% interest in Proligo to Degussa Corporation for $14.3 million in cash. The proceeds, net of Gilead's investment in Proligo, are reflected as an $8.8 million gain on the sale of unconsolidated affiliate. 11. LONG-TERM OBLIGATIONS Long-term obligations consist of the following (in thousands): December 31, 2001 2000 Capital lease obligations: monthly installments; interest rates ranging from 7.98% to 21.02% $ 1,466 $ 3,512 Fixed rate debt: monthly installments through 2003; secured by equipment; interest rates ranging from 11.49% to 11.90% 415 1,760 Total long-term obligations 1,881 5,272 Less current portion (1,492 ) (3,034 ) Long-term obligations due after one year $ 389 $ 2,238 Maturities of long-term obligations, including capital lease obligations, are as follows (in thousands): Year 2002 $ 1,616 2003 236 2004 106 2005 74 2006 74 Thereafter 12 2,118 Less amount representing interest (237 ) Total $ 1,881 The terms of the various debt agreements require the Company to comply with certain financial and operating covenants. At December 31, 2001, the Company was in compliance with all such covenants. 91 12. CONVERTIBLE SUBORDINATED NOTES AND DEBENTURES On December 13, 2000, Gilead issued $250 million of 5% convertible subordinated notes due December 15, 2007 in a private offering to J.P. Morgan & Co., Lehman Brothers and Morgan Stanley Dean Whitter, which resold the notes to private institutional investors. The notes are convertible into a total of up to 10,178,116 shares of Gilead common stock at $24.5625 per share. The $24.5625 conversion price is higher than Gilead's common stock price on the note's issue date. The notes are redeemable in whole or in part, at the option of the Company, at any time on or after December 20, 2003, at specified redemption prices plus accrued interest. Debt issuance costs of $8.2 million incurred in connection with the issuance of the notes were recorded as other noncurrent assets, and are being amortized to interest expense on a straight-line basis over the contractual term of the notes. During the third quarter of 1997, Gilead issued $80.0 million of 6.25% convertible subordinated debentures due 2004 in a private offering to SBC Warburg Inc. and Oppenheimer & Co., Inc., which resold the debentures to a group of private investors. The debentures were issued pursuant to an indenture and were convertible into a total of up to 7,179,376 shares of Gilead common stock at $11.14 per share. The debentures were redeemable in whole or in part, at the option of the Company, at any time on or after August 10, 2000, at specified redemption prices plus accrued interest. Gilead called the debentures for redemption on August 15, 2000 at a cash price of $1,030 per $1,000 principal amount of debentures outstanding, plus accrued interest, which was the redemption price provided for in the original debenture indenture. The entire $79.5 million in principal amount of the debentures outstanding at that time was converted into 7,135,156 newly issued shares of Gilead common stock prior to August 15, 2000. Deferred debt issuance costs of $1.6 million that related to the debentures were charged to additional paid in capital in connection with the conversion of the debentures into common stock. 13. COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES Leases Arrangements The Company has entered into various long-term noncancelable operating leases for facilities in Foster City and San Dimas, California. The leases expire on various dates in 2003 and 2006. Each of the leases has two five-year renewal options, with the exception of one lease in Foster City that expires in 2003 and contains no renewal options. The Company has operating leases for sales, marketing and administrative facilities in Europe and Australia with various terms, and miscellaneous equipment leases. Rent expense net of sublease income under the Company's operating leases totaled approximately $12.0 million in 2001, $8.6 million in 2000 and $7.9 million in 1999. The Company has entered into capital leases to finance equipment purchases and facilities improvements. Title to assets acquired under lease lines of credit resides with the lessor. The Company has the option to purchase the assets at the end of the lease terms at fair market value. The leases have remaining terms of up to three years. At December 31, 2001, no additional amounts were available under these agreements. 92 Aggregate noncancelable future minimum rental payments under operating and capital leases, net of aggregate future minimum rentals to be received by the Company under noncancelable subleases, are as follows (in thousands): Years ending December 31, Operating Leases, Net of Noncancelable Subleases Capital Leases 2002 $ 10,347 $ 1,291 2003 10,115 111 2004 6,986 106 2005 7,202 74 2006 4,069 74 Thereafter 1,276 12 $ 39,995 1,668 Less amount representing interest (202 ) Total capital lease obligations 1,466 Less current portion (1,197 ) Capital lease obligations due after one year $ 269 At December 31, 2001, the Company has placed $0.5 million in a bank escrow deposit to secure aggregate future payments due under one of its facilities leases. Contingent Liability Gilead has subleased certain of its facilities, primarily in California, through 2003. If any of the sublessees default on their obligations under these subleases, the Company would be primarily liable to the original lessor. The total amount due under these leases as of December 31, 2001 is $1.4 million. Line of Credit Through April 2001, we maintained a $10.0 million unsecured line of credit that bears interest at a floating rate with a major financial institution. Under the terms of the line of credit, we were required to maintain certain financial ratios and there were limitations on our ability to incur additional debt or to engage in certain significant transactions. The line of credit, which included a foreign exchange facility, expired in April 2001. We renewed the foreign exchange facility, but did not renew the line of credit. There are no required financial ratios or limitations on debt or other transactions under the foreign exchange facility. Legal Proceedings On August 11, 1997, the Company and Elan Corporation, plc (Elan, the successor company to The Liposome Company, Inc.) reached a settlement (Settlement Agreement) in which both companies agreed to dismiss all legal proceedings involving AmBisome, Gilead's liposomal formulation of amphotericin B. In the Settlement Agreement, Elan granted the Company immunity from suit in connection with the worldwide production and sales of AmBisome and a worldwide right to use two of 93 their patents. Under the terms of the Settlement Agreement, Gilead made an initial payment to Elan of $1.8 million and was required to make payments beginning in 1998 based on AmBisome sales over the next several years. Because the payments are subject to certain minimum and maximum amounts, the Company recorded accounting charges in 1997 of $11.8 million, of which $10.0 million represented the net present value of all future minimum payments and $1.8 million represented the initial cash payment. Beginning in 1998, Gilead records an expense each quarter based on the difference between all future minimum payments and the expense recorded in 1997. In addition, beginning in 1998, the Company is recognizing as cost of goods sold the difference between the minimum and maximum payments, if any. Gilead does not expect the difference between its future minimum and maximum payments to Elan to be material. The Company is involved from time to time in legal proceedings arising in the ordinary course of its business. In the opinion of management, none of these matters is expected to have a material adverse effect on the financial position or operations of the Company based on factors currently known to management. 14. STOCKHOLDERS' EQUITY Stock Split On February 22, 2001 and on March 8, 2002, Gilead completed two-for-one stock splits, effected in the form of a stock dividend, to stockholders of record as of February 2, 2001 and February 14, 2002, respectively. Accordingly, all share and per share amounts for all periods presented have been restated to reflect both of these splits. Preferred Stock The Company has 5,000,000 shares of authorized preferred stock issuable in series. The Company's Board of Directors (Board) is authorized to determine the designation, powers, preferences and rights of any such series. The Company has reserved 400,000 shares of preferred stock for potential issuance under the Preferred Share Purchase Rights Plan. In June 1997, the Company issued 1,133,786 shares of Series B Convertible Preferred Stock (Preferred Stock) to Pharmacia for approximately $40.0 million, or $35.28 per share. On July 15, 1999, the average of the closing price of Gilead's common stock for the thirty days then ended was $12.45. This event triggered the automatic conversion of the Preferred Stock owned by Pharmacia into the Company's common stock. Accordingly, the Preferred Stock converted into 4,535,144 shares of common stock at a price of $8.82 per share on July 16, 1999. There was no preferred stock outstanding as of December 31, 2001. Employee Stock Purchase Plan Under Gilead's Employee Stock Purchase Plan (ESPP), employees can purchase shares of Gilead common stock based on a percentage of their compensation. The purchase price per share must equal at least the lower of 85 percent of the market value on the date offered or the date purchased. A total of 6,320,000 shares of common stock have been reserved for issuance under the ESPP. As of 94 December 31, 2001, 4,300,708 shares of the total shares reserved had been issued under the ESPP (3,932,732 shares as of December 31, 2000). Stock Option Plans In December 1987, Gilead adopted the 1987 Incentive Stock Option Plan and the Supplemental Stock Option Plan for issuance of common stock to employees, consultants and scientific advisors. In April 1991, the Board approved the granting of certain additional nonqualified stock options with terms and conditions substantially similar to those granted under the 1987 Supplemental Stock Option Plan. None of the options described above had exercise prices that were less than the fair value of the underlying stock on the date of grant. The options vest over five years pursuant to a formula determined by the Board and expire after ten years. No shares are available for grant of future options under any of these plans. In November 1991, Gilead adopted the 1991 Stock Option Plan (1991 Plan) for issuance of common stock to employees and consultants. Options issued under the 1991 Plan shall, at the discretion of the Board, be either incentive stock options or nonqualified stock options. In May 1998, the 1991 Plan was amended such that the exercise price of all stock options must be at least equal to the fair value of Gilead's common stock on the date of grant. The options vest over five years pursuant to a formula determined by the Board and expire after ten years. In May 2001 the stockholders approved an Amendment to the 1991 Plan that increased the total number of authorized shares under the plan from 43,000,000 to 47,000,000. At December 31, 2001, there were 11,911,158 shares available for grant of future options under the 1991 Plan. In November 1995, Gilead adopted the 1995 Non-Employee Directors' Stock Option Plan (Directors' Plan) for issuance of common stock to non-employee Directors pursuant to a predetermined formula. The exercise price of options granted under the Directors' Plan must be at least equal to the fair value of Gilead's common stock on the date of grant. The options vest over five years from the date of grant in quarterly five percent installments and expire after ten years. At December 31, 2001, there were 463,200 shares available for grant of future options under the Directors' Plan. Stock plans assumed by Gilead in the merger with NeXstar include the 1988 Stock Option Plan (1988 Plan), the 1993 Incentive Stock Plan, and the 1995 Director Option Plan (collectively, NeXstar Plans). Options pursuant to the 1988 Stock Option Plan and the 1993 Incentive Stock Plan that were issued and outstanding as of July 29, 1999 have been converted into options to purchase Gilead common stock as a result of the Merger and remain subject to their original terms and conditions. No shares are available for grant of future options under any of the NeXstar Plans. NeXstar's 1988 Plan allows certain option holders to execute cashless exercises of options. In a cashless exercise transaction, the option holder specifies how many shares will be exercised and the Company issues the specified number of shares, less the number that would be required to cover the exercise price based on the fair value of the stock on the exercise date. During 2001, 2000 and 1999, several option holders performed cashless exercises. As a result, such option awards are considered to be variable and, therefore, the Company recognized compensation expense of $0.6 million in 2001, $0.5 million in 2000 and $2.3 million in 1999. Of the 2001 amount, $0.5 million relates to exercised 95 options and the remaining $0.1 million relates to options that remain outstanding under the 1988 Plan at December 31, 2001. The following table summarizes activity under all Gilead and NeXstar stock option plans for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2001. All option grants presented in the table had exercise prices not less than the fair value of the underlying stock on the grant date (shares in thousands): Year ended December 31, 2001 2000 1999 Shares Weighted Average Exercise Price Shares Weighted Average Exercise Price Shares Weighted average Exercise Price Outstanding, beginning of year 21,672 $ 11.09 22,524 $ 8.34 22,624 $ 6.10 Granted 6,708 21.11 6,064 17.19 6,676 13.71 Forfeited (2,596 ) 16.10 (2,208 ) 10.99 (1,484 ) 8.40 Exercised (4,098 ) 7.58 (4,708 ) 5.79 (5,292 ) 5.38 Outstanding, end of year 21,686 $ 14.26 21,672 $ 11.09 22,524 $ 8.34 Exercisable, end of year 9,022 $ 9.62 8,452 $ 7.31 9,104 $ 5.64 Weighted average fair value of options granted $ 14.29 $ 11.25 $ 8.38 The following is a summary of Gilead options outstanding and options exercisable at December 31, 2001 (options in thousands): Options Outstanding Options Exercisable Range of Exercise Prices Options Outstanding Weighted Average Remaining Contractual Life in Years Weighted Average Exercise Price Options Exercisable Weighted Average Exercise price $1.94-$6.81 4,804 5.01 $ 5.46 3,606 $ 5.25 $6.94-$14.16 4,952 5.99 $ 10.53 3,118 $ 9.59 $14.60-$14.81 5,778 8.33 $ 14.72 1,310 $ 14.65 $15.02-$34.33 6,152 8.96 $ 23.69 988 $ 19.00 Total 21,686 7.24 $ 14.26 9,022 $ 9.62 96 14. STOCKHOLDERS' EQUITY Pro Forma Disclosures The table below presents the combined net income (loss) and basic and diluted net income (loss) per common share if compensation cost for the Gilead and NeXstar stock option plans and the ESPP had been determined based on the estimated fair value of awards under those plans on the grant or purchase date. Year Ended December 31, 2001 2000 1999 Pro forma net income (loss) (in thousands) $ 2,190 $ (91,775 ) $ (93,816 ) Pro forma net income (loss) per common share—basic $ 0.01 $ (0.50 ) $ (0.55 ) Pro forma net income (loss) per common share—diluted $ 0.01 $ (0.50 ) $ (0.55 ) Fair values of awards granted under the stock option plans and ESPP were estimated at grant or purchase dates using a Black-Scholes option pricing model. The Company used the multiple option approach and the following assumptions: Year Ended December 31, 2001 2000 1999 Expected life in years (from vesting date): Stock options 1.95 1.88 1.86 ESPP 1.29 1.45 1.21 Discount rate: Stock options 4.6 % 6.3 % 5.6 % ESPP 4.7 % 5.5 % 5.0 % Volatility 83 % 84 % 67 % Expected dividend yield 0 % 0 % 0 % The weighted average estimated fair value of ESPP shares purchased was $11.57 for 2001, $6.06 for 2000 and $4.06 for 1999. Preferred Share Purchase Rights Plan In November 1994, the Company adopted a Preferred Share Purchase Rights Plan. The plan provides for the distribution of a preferred stock purchase right as a dividend for each share of Gilead common stock. The purchase rights are not currently exercisable. Under certain conditions involving an acquisition or proposed acquisition by any person or group of 15% or more of the Company's common stock, the purchase rights permit the holders (other than the 15% holder) to purchase Gilead common stock at a 50% discount from the market price at that time, upon payment of a specified exercise price per purchase right. In addition, in the event of certain business combinations, the purchase rights permit the purchase of the common stock of an acquirer at a 50% discount from the market price at that time. Under certain conditions, the purchase rights may be redeemed by the Board in whole, but not in part, at a price of $.0025 per purchase right. The purchase rights have no voting privileges and are attached to and automatically trade with Gilead common stock. 97 In October 1999, the Board of Directors approved an amendment to the purchase rights plan. The amendment provided, among other things, for an increase in the exercise price of a right under the plan from $15 to $100 and an extension of the term of the plan from November 21, 2004 to October 20, 2009. Acceleration of Stock Options In December 2001, we completed the sale of our oncology assets to OSI. As part of this transaction, we accelerated approximately 78,000 options to purchase Gilead common stock with a value of $2.8 million. See Note 4 for further discussion. 15.

The state net operating loss carryforwards will expire at various dates from 2002 through 2011, if not utilized. In addition, the Company had federal and state tax credit carryforwards of approximately $27.2 million and $15.3 million respectively, which expire in the years 2003 through 2021. Utilization of net operating losses and credits may be subject to an annual limitation due to ownership change limitations provided in the Internal Revenue Code and similar state provisions. This annual limitation may result in the expiration of the net operating losses and credits before utilization. 100 17. INCOME TAXES (Continued) Deferred income taxes reflect the net tax effects of temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for income tax purposes. Significant components of the Company's deferred tax assets and liabilities as of December 31, 2001 and 2000 are as follows (in thousands): December 31, 2001 2000 Net operating loss carryforwards $ 142,400 $ 166,500 Research and other credits 37,300 35,400 Capitalized R&D for California 14,400 17,100 Other, net 18,600 9,600 Total deferred tax assets 212,700 228,600 Valuation allowance (212,700 ) (228,600 ) Net deferred tax assets recognized $ — $ — The valuation allowance decreased by $15.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2001, and increased by $34.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2000. Approximately $33.8 million of the valuation allowance at December 31, 2001 relates to the tax benefits of stock option deductions, which will be credited to additional paid-in capital when realized. 18. RETIREMENT SAVINGS PLAN As of December 31, 2001, the Company maintains one retirement savings plan under which eligible employees may defer compensation for income tax purposes under Section 401(k) of the Internal Revenue Code. Prior to January 1, 2001, Gilead maintained two separate retirement savings plans. One plan primarily covered former NeXstar employees (NeXstar Plan), and the other plan primarily covered Gilead's remaining eligible employees (Gilead Plan). Under the NeXstar Plan, employee contributions could not exceed 15% of eligible annual compensation. In addition, the NeXstar Plan included a Company match of 50% of employee contributions up to a maximum of 6% of contributions up to an annual maximum Company match of $2,500. At December 31, 2000, approximately $0.6 million, representing 13,857 shares of Gilead common stock, was held by the NeXstar Plan in trust for plan participants. Effective January 2001, the NeXstar Plan was terminated and combined with the Gilead Plan. The shares of Gilead common stock held by the NeXstar Plan were subsequently liquidated and the proceeds were deposited into the various other investment options available under the Gilead plan. Under the Gilead Plan, employees may contribute up to 15% of their eligible annual compensation. Effective January 1, 2000, Gilead began making matching contributions under the Gilead Plan. The Company contributes up to 50% of an employee's first 6% of contributions up to an annual maximum Company match of $2,500. The Company's total matching contribution for the Gilead Plan was $1.2 million in 2001, a combined $0.9 million in 2000 for both plans and $0.5 million in 1999 for the NeXstar Plan. 101 19. RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS Through December 31, 2000, the Chairman of Gilead's Board of Directors was a senior advisor to an investment fund that owns a controlling interest in PharmaResearch Corporation, a contract research organization that performs services in connection with clinical studies. Gilead's payments to PharmaResearch Corporation were $10.2 million in 2000 and $6.7 million in 1999. 20.

882095,GILD,"GILEAD SCIENCES, INC.",2004,"ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Executive Summary We are a biopharmaceutical company that discovers, develops and commercializes therapeutics to advance the care of patients suffering from life-threatening diseases. We are a multinational company, with revenues from six approved products and marketing operations in ten countries. We focus our research and clinical programs on anti-infectives. Currently, we market Viread (tenofovir disoproxil fumarate) and Emtriva (emtricitabine) for the treatment of HIV infection; Hepsera (adefovir dipivoxil) for the treatment of chronic hepatitis B infection; AmBisome (amphotericin B liposome for injection), an antifungal agent; and Vistide (cidofovir injection) for the treatment of CMV retinitis. Roche markets Tamiflu (oseltamivir phosphate) for the treatment of influenza, under a royalty paying collaborative agreement with us. In December 2003, we made the decision to discontinue selling DaunoXome (daunorubicin citrate liposome injection), a drug approved for the treatment of Kaposi’s Sarcoma. We are seeking to add to our existing portfolio of products through our internal discovery and clinical development programs and through an 35 active product acquisition and in-licensing strategy, such as our acquisition of the assets of Triangle Pharmaceuticals, Inc. completed in January 2003. Our internal discovery activities include identification of new molecular targets, target screening and medicinal chemistry. In addition, we are currently developing clinical stage products to treat HIV infection and chronic hepatitis B. Our operating results for 2003 in comparison to 2002 were characterized by solid growth in our key HIV drug, Viread and represent our second consecutive year of significant increases in total product revenues. Based on independent third party data, Viread has become one of the most widely prescribed antiretrovirals in its class of drugs, achieving more new and total prescriptions than competing drugs in the nucleotide/nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NRTI) market. As a result of the growth of Viread sales, higher than expected AmBisome sales and controlled spending, we have generated positive cash flow from operations for each of the last two years, with an increase to $234.6 million in 2003 from $74.4 million in 2002, or 215% year over year growth. We expect our HIV drug sales to grow in the near term, although we expect it to be at a slower rate than we have experienced in the past two years. Enabling this growth is the increasing importance of once-daily regimens in prescribing HIV medications. The availability of both Viread and Emtriva (acquired from Triangle) now provide physicians the ability to construct once-daily regimens. Operating results for 2003 were impacted by the acquisition of all of the assets of Triangle in January 2003. We completed this acquisition to expand our antiviral pipeline. Triangle was a development stage company with a particular focus on potential therapies for HIV, including AIDS, and the hepatitis B virus (HBV). The aggregate purchase price was $525.2 million, including cash paid of $463.1 million for the outstanding stock, the fair value of stock options assumed of $41.3 million, estimated direct transaction costs of $14.2 million and employee related costs of $6.6 million. Approximately $488.6 million of the purchase price was allocated to in-process research and development and represented the fair value of Triangle’s incomplete research and development programs that had not yet reached technological feasibility and had no alternative future use as of the acquisition date. As a result of this transaction and the related in-process research and development charge, our operating loss for 2003 was $158.7 million versus operating income of $81.0 million in 2002. This acquisition was important to us not only for the compounds we acquired, but also for the opportunity it provided us to create a co-formulation of Viread and Emtriva into a single pill that can be dosed once a day. If successful, we expect this co-formulated product to further grow our HIV franchise. See Note 3 to the consolidated financial statements for further information on the Triangle acquisition. In December 2001, we completed the sale of our oncology assets to OSI Pharmaceuticals, Inc. in a transaction valued at up to $200.0 million in cash and OSI stock. This transaction has allowed us to focus on and continue to strengthen our core expertise in infectious diseases. See Note 6 to the consolidated financial statements for further information. Certain prior period amounts have been reclassified to conform to the current presentation. Forward-Looking Statements and Risk Factors The following discussion contains forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. Please read “Risk Factors that Affect Gilead” in Part I for factors that could cause or contribute to material differences between these forward-looking statements and actual results. The “Risk Factors” discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes included elsewhere in this report. 36 Critical Accounting Policies, Estimates and Judgments This discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is based upon our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, and related disclosures. On an on-going basis, we evaluate our estimates, including those related to revenue recognition, bad debts, inventories, accrued clinical and preclinical expenses, income taxes and contingencies. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other market-specific assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results, however, may differ significantly from these estimates. We believe the following critical accounting policies reflect the more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements: · We record estimated reductions to revenue for expected returns of expired products, government rebate programs, such as Medicaid reimbursements, and customer incentives, such as cash discounts for prompt payment. Estimates for government rebate programs and cash discounts are based on contractual terms, historical utilization rates and expectations regarding future utilization rates for these programs. Estimates for product returns, including new products, are based on an on-going analysis of industry and historical return patterns. This includes monitoring the feedback that we receive from our sales force regarding customer use and satisfaction, the purchase of third-party data to assist us in monitoring channel inventory levels and subsequent prescriptions as well as, for new products, a review of our other long shelf life products we have sold through the same or similar channels. Further, we monitor the activities and clinical trials of our key competitors and assess the potential impact on our future sales and return expectations where necessary. Expected returns for our marketed drugs are generally low because the shelf life for these products ranges from 24 months for Viread up to 36 months for AmBisome in the U.S. If conditions become more competitive for any of the markets served by our drugs or if other circumstances change, we may take actions to increase our product return estimates or we may offer additional customer incentives. This would result in an incremental reduction of future revenue at the time the return estimate is changed or incentives are offered. For example, between 2002 and 2003, we increased our reserve for government discounts on Viread sales by more than 3% as a result of our review of historical utilization rates and the impact of a 2003 mid-year price increase for Viread. We could see similar increases in the future based on our continued reviews of utilization rates and any potential U.S. price increases for Viread. · We also maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments. This allowance is based on our analysis of several factors including, but not limited to, historical payment patterns of our customers and individual customer circumstances, an analysis of days sales outstanding by customer and geographic region, and a review of the local economic environment and its potential impact on the government funding and reimbursement practices. If the financial condition of our customers or the economic environment in which they operate were to deteriorate, resulting in an inability to make payments, additional allowances may be required. Our allowance for doubtful accounts balance as a percentage of total accounts receivable did not materially change from December 31, 2002 to December 31, 2003. We believe that the allowance for doubtful accounts is adequate to cover anticipated losses under current conditions; however, significant deterioration in any of the above factors, especially with respect to the government funding and reimbursement practices in the European market, could materially change these expectations and result in an increase to our allowance for doubtful accounts. 37 · We write down our inventory based on historical review of the quantity of raw material bad batches experienced in a given year and expectations of production and inventory levels. We also perform quality control reviews of our individual raw material batches. We generally do not maintain inventory reserves based on estimated obsolescence or risk of competition primarily because the shelf life of the products is long. However, if our current assumptions about future production or inventory levels, demand and competition were to change and if actual market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management, additional inventory reserves may be required which could negatively impact our product gross margins. · We record accruals for estimated clinical and preclinical study costs. Most of our clinical and preclinical studies are performed by third party contract research organizations (CROs). These costs are a significant component of research and development expenses. During 2003, 2002, and 2001, we incurred $15.0 million, $23.9 million and $33.6 million, respectively, of CRO costs. We accrue costs for clinical studies performed by CROs on a straight-line basis over the term of the service period and adjust our estimates, if required, based upon our on-going review of the level of effort actually incurred by the CRO. Initially we estimate that the work performed under the contracts occurs ratably over the periods to the expected milestone, event or total contract completion date. The expected completion dates are estimated based upon the terms of the contracts and past experience with similar contracts. These estimates may or may not match the actual services performed by the organizations as determined by patient enrollment levels and other measures of activities specified in the contract. As a result, we validate our accruals quarterly through written vendor confirmations and detailed reviews of the activities performed under each contract. Based upon the results of these validation processes, we assess the appropriateness of our accruals and make any adjustments we deem necessary so that our expenses reflect the actual effort incurred by the CROs. Generally, a significant portion of the total costs are associated with start up activities for the trial and patient enrollment. Gilead extensively outsources its clinical trial activities and usually performs only a small portion of the start-up activities in-house. As a result, CROs typically perform most of the total start-up activities for our trials, including document preparation, site identification, screening and preparation, pre-study visits, training, and program management. On a budgeted basis, these costs are typically 25% to 30% of the total contract value. On an actual basis, this percentage range is significantly wider as many of our contracts are either expanded or contracted in scope compared to the original budget while the start-up costs for the particular trial do not change significantly. Start-up costs usually occur within a few months after the contract has been established and are milestone or event driven in nature. The remaining activities and related costs, such as patient monitoring and administration, generally occur ratably throughout the life of the individual contract or study. Most contracts are negotiated as fixed price and can vary in length between six months for a single dose Phase 1 study and up to two years or more for a more complex Phase 3 study. The average length of contract for 2002 and 2003 has been at the upper end of this range in order to provide long term safety and efficacy data to support the commercial launches of Viread, Hepsera and Emtriva. Through December 31, 2003, we have not understated or overstated activity levels for any particular study such that a material adjustment was required. All of our material CRO contracts are terminable by us upon written notice and Gilead is generally only liable for actual effort expended by the CRO at any point in time during the contract, regardless of payment status. Amounts paid in advance of services being performed will be refunded if a contract is terminated. However, if management does not receive complete and accurate information from our vendors or has underestimated activity levels associated with a study at a given point in time, we would have to record additional and potentially significant research and development expenses in future periods. · We develop our income tax provision including deferred tax assets and liabilities based on significant management judgment. We record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax 38 assets to the amount that is likely to be realized. We consider future taxable income, ongoing tax planning strategies and our historical financial performance in assessing the need for a valuation allowance. If it were determined that we would be able to realize certain deferred tax assets related to the valuation allowance, an adjustment to the deferred tax asset would increase income in the period in which such determination was made. Such an adjustment was made in the fourth quarter of 2003 when we determined that it was more likely than not that certain of our deferred tax assets will be realized and therefore released the related valuation allowance. This resulted in an income tax benefit of approximately $111.6 milion. Likewise, if we determine that we would not be able to realize all or part of our deferred tax asset in the future, an adjustment to the deferred tax asset would be charged to income in the period in which such determination was made. We evaluate the realizibility of our deferred tax assets on a quarterly basis. Our future effective tax rate may be affected by such factors as changes in tax laws or rates, changes in interpretation to these laws and overall changes in future levels of earnings and research and development and capital spending. Management has discussed the development and selection of these critical accounting policies with the Audit Committee of Gilead’s Board of Directors and the Audit Committee has reviewed the disclosure presented above relating to them. Results of Operations Total revenues We had total revenue of $867.9 million in 2003, $466.8 million in 2002 and $233.8 million in 2001. Included in total revenue are net product sales, royalty revenue and contract revenue, including revenue from research & development (R&D) and manufacturing collaborations. Product sales consisted of the following (in thousands): Product sales 2003 Change 2002 Change 2001 Viread $ 566,478 151 % $ 225,815 1349 % $ 15,586 AmBisome 198,350 7 % 185,669 13 % 164,533 Other 71,513 477 % 12,395 14 % 10,851 Total product sales $ 836,341 97 % $ 423,879 122 % $ 190,970 Product sales increased 97% in 2003 compared to 2002 primarily due to significant increases in sales of Viread for HIV, which was approved for sale in the U.S. in October 2001 and the European Union in February 2002 and has since become an antiretroviral therapy widely prescribed by physicians. A significant percentage of our product sales continue to be denominated in foreign currencies. Prior to 2002, we did not hedge our exposure to the impact of fluctuating foreign exchange rates on forecasted sales. In January 2002, we began to use forward contracts to hedge a percentage of our forecasted international sales, primarily those denominated in the Euro currency. This reduces, but does not eliminate, fluctuations in sales due to changes in foreign currency exchange rates. Losses on these revenue hedges reduced product revenues by $2.8 million in 2003 and $1.0 million in 2002. Sales of Viread were 68% of total product sales in 2003, compared to 53% of total product sales in 2002 and 8% of total product sales in 2001. Of the Viread sales in 2003, $355.9 million were U.S. sales, an increase of 113% versus 2002, and $210.6 million were international sales, an increase of 258% versus 2002. With the continued market expansion of Viread, we expect Viread sales in 2004 to grow approximately 25% to 30% and be in the range of $700 million to $750 million. 39 During 2003, we experienced significant fluctuations in U.S. distribution channel inventory levels due to speculative purchasing by the major wholesalers. As a result, we experienced increased quarter to quarter sales volatility from these purchasing patterns. While we have enacted certain policies to reduce this type of purchasing and are in discussions with our key wholesalers, we expect to continue to experience sales volatility for the foreseeable future. Prior to 2002, our revenues were primarily derived from sales of AmBisome, which represented 44% of total product sales in 2002 and 86% of total product sales in 2001. AmBisome sales in 2003 were $21.7 million higher due to the favorable currency environment compared to 2002. On a volume basis, AmBisome sales in Europe decreased by 5% compared to 2002 due to increasing competition. Excluding the impact of foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar, AmBisome sales grew 9% for 2002 over 2001. The increase in sales in 2002 compared to 2001 was primarily due to volume sales increases in Europe, which offset declining sales in the U.S. With the expected increase in competition, we expect AmBisome sales for 2004 to be lower than 2003 and in the range of $160 million to $180 million. Royalty Revenue We recorded royalty revenue of $25.2 million in 2003, compared with $20.4 million in 2002 and $23.0 million in 2001. During this three-year period, the most significant source of royalty revenue was from sales of AmBisome in the U.S. by Fujisawa under a co-promotion arrangement with us. Royalty revenue from Fujisawa was $12.5 million in 2003, compared with $15.7 million in 2002 and $17.1 million in 2001. We also recorded royalty revenue of $12.0 million in 2003, $3.4 million in 2002 and $4.5 million in 2001 related to sales of Tamiflu. We began recognizing royalties from Tamiflu in the first quarter of 2000. In June 2002, Roche received European regulatory approval of Tamiflu for the treatment of influenza in adults and children and prevention in adolescents and adults. As it is difficult to estimate third party product sales, we record royalty revenue one quarter in arrears. Due to this lag in reporting, the royalties related to the severe flu epidemic in the U.S. in the fourth quarter of 2003 will be recorded in the first quarter of 2004. Contract Revenue Total contract revenue was $6.3 million in 2003, compared with $22.5 million in 2002 and $19.8 million in 2001. In 2002 and 2001 a primary source of contract revenue was our licensing of the SELEX process patent estate to Archemix, which, due to collectibility concerns, we recognized as the cash was received. This provided contract revenue of $8.1 million in 2002 and $8.6 million in 2001. In 2002, Roche made milestone payments of $8.0 million for the European prophylaxis and treatment approvals of Tamiflu, and in 2001 made a $2.0 million milestone payment relating to the development of Tamiflu under an R&D collaboration agreement. As of December 31, 2003, we are entitled to additional milestone payments of up to $1.6 million upon Roche achieving certain developmental and regulatory milestones. In April 2002, Gilead and GSK entered into a licensing agreement providing GSK the rights to commercialize Hepsera, our antiviral for the treatment of chronic hepatitis B, in Asia, Latin America and certain other territories. Under the agreement, Gilead retained rights to Hepsera in the U.S., Canada, Eastern and Western Europe, Australia and New Zealand. GSK received exclusive rights to develop Hepsera solely for the treatment of chronic hepatitis B in all of its territories, the most significant of which include China, Korea, Japan and Taiwan. GSK paid us an up-front licensing fee of $10.0 million and, may pay up to an additional $30.0 million upon achievement by GSK of certain regulatory, development and commercial milestones. Of this $30.0 million, $2.0 million was received for the U.S. approval of Hepsera in September 2002 and $2.0 million was received for the Canadian approval of Hepsera in August 2003. GSK also will pay us a royalty on net sales, if any, of Hepsera in the GSK territories. GSK will have full 40 responsibility for development and commercialization of Hepsera in GSK’s territories. The $10.0 million up-front fee and $4.0 million of approval milestone fees have been recorded as deferred revenue with a total of $0.9 million and $0.5 million being recognized as contract revenue in 2003 and 2002, respectively. The $12.6 million balance of deferred revenue at December 31, 2003 will be amortized into contract revenue over the period of our remaining obligations under the agreement, approximately 12 years. In December 2001, we completed the sale of our oncology assets to OSI. To date, we have received $130.0 million in cash and $38.8 million in OSI stock from this sale. Under this agreement, we are entitled to additional payments from OSI of up to $30.0 million in either cash or a combination of cash and OSI stock if and when OSI reaches certain development milestones for NX 211, the most advanced of the oncology product candidates sold to OSI. Under a related manufacturing agreement, we will produce NX 211 and GS 7904L, the two liposomal products included in the sale at our manufacturing facility in San Dimas, California. In 2003 and 2002, we recognized $1.1 million and $3.3 million, respectively, of contract revenue under this manufacturing agreement. In October 2001, we entered into an agreement with Archemix Corporation relating to our SELEX technology. Under this agreement, we gave Archemix exclusive rights to the SELEX process, including therapeutic and other commercial applications to the extent not already licensed under pre-existing agreements. Archemix paid to us $8.5 million in 2002 and $9.0 million in 2001 and recorded the net amounts of $8.1 million and $8.6 million as contract revenue in 2002 and 2001, respectively. As required by our license agreement with ULEHI, we paid 5% of the $8.5 million and $9.0 million payments to ULEHI. We also received a warrant to purchase 350,000 shares of Archemix common stock, the value of which is not material. As required by our license agreement with ULEHI, we transferred 5% of this warrant to ULEHI at that time. We have since transferred the remainder of the warrant to ULEHI. In March 2000, we entered into an agreement with EyeTech Pharmaceuticals, Inc. relating to our proprietary aptamer EYE001, currently known as Macugen. Currently in Phase 3 clinical trials, Macugen is an inhibitor of vascular endothelial growth factor, or VEGF, which is known to play a role in the development of certain ophthalmic diseases. Under the terms of the agreement, EyeTech received worldwide rights to all therapeutic uses of Macugen, and, if the product is successfully commercialized, EyeTech will pay us royalties on worldwide sales of the product. EyeTech also will be responsible for all research and development costs. We provided clinical supplies of the product to EyeTech through March 2001. We received a $7.0 million up-front licensing fee from EyeTech in April 2000, which has been recognized as revenue ratably over the one-year supply agreement period. Accordingly, $5.2 million of the license fee was recorded as contract revenue in 2000, and $1.8 million was recognized as revenue in 2001. We are also entitled to additional cash payments from EyeTech of up to $25.0 million if and when EyeTech reaches certain Macugen development milestones. Additionally, we received a warrant to purchase 791,667 shares of EyeTech series B convertible preferred stock, exercisable at a price of $6.00 per share, the price at which the stock was issued to other investors. In January 2004, EyeTech completed its initial public offering. We intend to exercise our warrant for shares of common stock and sell the shares subject to a 180-day lock-up period. The fair value of the warrant has been adjusted in the first quarter of 2004 as a result of the EyeTech public offering. Cost of Goods Sold The following table indicates cost of goods sold (in thousands): 2003 Change 2002 Change 2001 Cost of goods sold $ 112,691 62 % $ 69,724 59 % $ 43,764 Substantially all of the increase from each year to year period can be attributed to increases in the volume of Viread sold, as this product was launched in the U.S. late in the third quarter of 2001. 41 Gross Margins Product gross margins were 86.5% in 2003, compared with 83.6% in 2002 and 77.1% in 2001. The improvement from 2002 to 2003 and 2001 to 2002 is primarily driven by product mix as Viread, a higher margin product, contributed more significantly to net product sales in each succeeding year. Movements in foreign currency exchange rates also impact gross margins as we price our products in the currency of the country into which the products are sold while a significant majority of our manufacturing costs are in U.S. Dollars. For example, an increase in the value of these foreign currencies relative to the U.S. Dollar will positively impact gross margins since our manufacturing costs will remain approximately the same while our revenues after being translated into U.S. Dollars, will increase. In 2003 and 2002, gross margins were positively impacted by the weakening U.S. dollar while in 2001, gross margins were negatively impacted by these factors. Since 2002, forward contracts have been used to hedge a percentage of our forecasted international sales, which can reduce the impact that changes in foreign currency exchange rates have on our gross margins. Except for the potential impact of unpredictable and uncontrollable changes in exchange rates relative to the U.S. Dollar and the mix of product sales between Viread, Hepsera and AmBisome, we expect gross margins in 2004 to remain relatively stable compared to 2003. Research and Development Expenses In 2003, R&D expenses were 31% of total costs and expenses, excluding purchased in-process research and development expense. In total, R&D expenses were $164.9 million in 2003, compared with $134.8 million in 2002 and $185.6 million in 2001. The major components of R&D expenses consist of personnel costs, including salaries and benefits, clinical studies performed by contract research organizations, materials and supplies, and overhead allocations consisting of various support and facilities related costs. Our R&D activities are also separated into three main categories: research, clinical development and pharmaceutical development. Research costs typically consist of preclinical and toxicology work. Clinical development costs include Phase 1, 2, and 3 clinical trials as well as expanded access programs. Pharmaceutical development costs consist of product formulation and chemical analysis. The following table breaks down research and development expenses into these major components (in thousands): 2003 Change 2002 Change 2001 Research $ 37,497 35 % $ 27,856 (9 )% $ 30,535 Clinical development 90,547 10 % 82,261 (23 )% 107,229 Pharmaceutical development 36,829 49 % 24,641 (3 )% 25,392 Oncology (divested) — — — — 22,397 Total $ 164,873 22 % $ 134,758 (27 )% $ 185,553 The $30.1 million increase in R&D spending in 2003 versus 2002 was attributable to increased headcount and the clinical trials associated with the development of Emtriva and the co-formulation of Viread and Emtriva. In addition, during 2003, we settled a contractual dispute with a vendor that resulted in reimbursement to us of $13.2 million that was recorded to research and development expense. We expect R&D expenses in 2004 to be approximately $200 million to $220 million, or approximately 20% to 30% higher than 2003 expenses, due primarily to costs associated with the development of the fixed-dose combination of Viread and Emtriva. The $50.8 million decrease in R&D spending in 2002 compared to 2001 was primarily due to the reduction in expenses associated with the clinical program for Viread, which was approved by the FDA for sale in the U.S. in October 2001, and the elimination of expenses associated with our oncology program as 42 a result of the sale of that program to OSI in December 2001. Additionally, in 2001 we recognized as expense $10.6 million of a $13.0 million up-front license fee paid to Cubist Pharmaceuticals related to the European licensing agreement for daptomycin, also known as Cidecin, signed in January 2001. Upon termination of this agreement in September 2002, we recorded $2.0 million of R&D expense, which represented the remaining unamortized asset related to the preclinical oral formulation of daptomycin. Industry reports indicate that a biopharmaceutical company generally takes 10 to 15 years (an average of 12 years) to research, develop and bring to market a new prescription medicine in the U.S. These averages are generally consistent with the projects that we develop internally, although our recent product development timelines have been on a more accelerated basis. Drug development in the U.S. is a process that includes several steps defined by the FDA. The process begins with the filing of an IND, which, if successful, allows opportunity for clinical study of the potential new medicine. Clinical development typically involves three phases of study: Phase 1, 2, and 3, and generally accounts for an average of seven years of a drug’s total development time. The most significant costs associated with clinical development are the Phase 3 trials as they tend to be the longest and largest studies conducted during the drug development process. We currently have products in development that are in Phase 3 studies. The successful development of our products is highly uncertain. Completion dates and R&D expenses can vary significantly for each product and are difficult to predict. Even after successful development and FDA approval of a product, we undertake additional studies to try and expand the product’s label and market potential. For a more complete discussion of the risks and uncertainties associated with completing the development of products, see the “Risk Factors That Affect Gilead” section of Item I above. Selling, General and Administrative Expenses The following table highlights selling, general and administrative expenses (in thousands): 2003 Change 2002 Change 2001 Selling, general and administrative $ 250,157 38 % $ 181,301 45 % $ 125,141 The increase in expenses in 2003 compared to 2002 is primarily due to our global sales and marketing efforts, including the expansion of our U.S. and European sales forces and increased infrastructure investments required to support the growth of our business. The increase in expenses in 2002 compared to 2001 is primarily due to our global sales and marketing efforts, including the expansion of our U.S. and European sales forces to support the commercial launches of Viread and Hepsera. In 2004, we expect SG&A expenses to be approximately $310 million to $330 million, or 25% to 30% higher than 2003 levels, primarily due to the increase in marketing activities associated with the continued promotion of Viread, Emtriva, Hepsera and AmBisome. In-process Research and Development In connection with the acquisition of the net assets of Triangle completed in January 2003, we recorded in-process research and development expenses of $488.6 million in the first quarter of 2003. The charge was due to Triangle’s incomplete research and development programs that had not yet reached technological feasibility and had no alternative future use as of the acquisition date. The remaining efforts for completion of Triangle’s research and development projects primarily consist of clinical trials, the cost, length and success of which are extremely difficult to predict. Numerous risks and uncertainties exist that could prevent completion of development, including the ability to enroll patients in clinical trials, the possibility of unfavorable results of our clinical trials, and the risk of failing to obtain FDA and other regulatory body approvals. Feedback from regulatory authorities or results from 43 clinical trials might require modifications or delays in later stage clinical trials or additional trials to be performed. We cannot be certain that emtricitabine for the treatment of chronic hepatitis B, purchased from Triangle, will be approved in the U.S. or the European Union or whether marketing approvals will have significant limitations on its use. We have terminated our rights with respect to the other potential products that we acquired with the acquisition of Triangle. We also do not yet have approval of the fixed-dose combination product containing tenofovir DF and emtricitabine. Future discussions with regulatory agencies will determine the amount of data needed and timelines for review, which may differ materially from current projections. The acquired products under development may never be successfully commercialized. Emtriva, for example, is a product with many similarities to other existing products. As a result, it may be difficult to successfully penetrate the market and to achieve significant revenues. In addition, emtricitabine for the treatment of chronic hepatitis B faces significant uncertainties associated with pricing, efficacy, and the cost to produce that may not be successfully resolved. As a result, we may make a strategic decision to discontinue development of this product, as we did with clevudine and amdoxovir, if we believe commercialization will be difficult relative to other opportunities in our pipeline. If these programs cannot be completed on a timely basis or at all, then our prospects for future revenue growth would be adversely impacted. The value of the acquired in-process research and development was determined by estimating the related future net cash flows between 2003 and 2020 using a present value risk adjusted discount rate of 15.75%. This discount rate is a significant assumption and is based on our estimated weighted average cost of capital adjusted upward for the risks associated with the projects acquired. The projected cash flows from the acquired projects were based on estimates of revenues and operating profits related to the projects considering the stage of development of each potential product acquired, the time and resources needed to complete the development and approval of each product, the life of each potential commercialized product and associated risks including the inherent difficulties and uncertainties in developing a drug compound including obtaining FDA and other regulatory approvals, and risks related to the viability of and potential alternative treatments in any future target markets. Asset Impairment During 2003, we recorded an asset impairment charge of $10.2 million on certain of our long-lived assets, primarily leasehold improvements, manufacturing and laboratory equipment. This non-cash charge was driven by the decision in December 2003 to terminate our liposomal research and development activities in San Dimas and discontinue the DaunoXome product line. The impairment was based on our analysis of the undiscounted cash flows to be generated from the affected assets as compared to their carrying value. As the carrying value exceeded the related estimated undiscounted cash flows, we wrote the carrying value of the long-lived assets down to their estimated fair value. Gain on Sale of Oncology Assets In December 2001, we completed the sale of our oncology assets, pipeline of clinical stage oncology products and related intellectual property, as well as our Boulder, Colorado operations, including clinical research and drug development personnel, infrastructure and facilities, to OSI. The pipeline of clinical candidates includes NX 211 (liposomal lurtotecan), GS 7836 (a nucleoside analogue) and GS 7904L (a liposomal thymidylate synthase inhibitor). On the closing date, we received $130.0 million in cash and OSI common stock valued at approximately $38.8 million. We recorded a non-operating gain of $157.8 million and income taxes of $3.3 million in the fourth quarter of 2001 as a result of this transaction. Loss on Sale of Marketable Securities In July 2002, we sold all of our remaining shares of OSI common stock for approximately $22.0 million. These shares were partial consideration for the sale of our oncology assets to OSI in 44 December 2001, at which time they were recorded at a fair market value of approximately $38.0 million. In connection with the sale of these remaining shares, we recognized a non-operating loss of approximately $16.0 million in the year ended December 31, 2002. Gain on Sale of Unconsolidated Affiliate In August 2001, we sold our 49 percent interest in Proligo L.L.C. (Proligo) to Degussa Corporation for $14.3 million in cash. Proligo was a joint venture between us and SKW Americas, Inc. focused on the manufacturing of oligonucleotides. SKW Americas, a subsidiary of Degussa Corporation, held the remaining 51 percent of Proligo. The proceeds, net of our investment in Proligo, are reflected as an $8.8 million gain on the sale of unconsolidated affiliate in 2001. Interest and Other Income, net We recorded interest and other income of $13.0 million in 2003, compared with $22.3 million in 2002 and $25.6 million in 2001. The decrease in 2003 compared to 2002 is attributable to the significant decline in interest rates and a lower average cash balance due to the acquisition of the net assets of Triangle and the purchase of our Foster City campus, partially offset by positive cash flow from operations. The decrease in 2002 compared to 2001 is attributable to the significant decline in interest rates, partially offset by a higher average cash balance due to positive cash flow from operations and to the proceeds from the sale of the oncology assets to OSI. Interest income in 2004 will depend principally upon prevailing interest rates, over which we have no control and the level of our cash, cash equivalent and marketable securities balances. Interest Expense We incurred interest expense of $21.9 million in 2003, compared with $13.9 million in 2002 and $14.0 million in 2001. The significant increase in 2003 over 2002 is due to the full year of interest on our $345.0 million 2% convertible senior notes, issued in December 2002. Interest expense for 2002 and 2001 consisted primarily of interest on the $250.0 million 5.0% convertible subordinated notes, which were converted to common stock in December 2003. We expect interest expense in 2004 to decrease as compared with 2003 primarily due to the redemption of the $250.0 million 5% convertible subordinated notes in December 2003. Provision for (Benefit from) Income Taxes Our provision for (benefit from) income taxes was ($95.5) million, $1.3 million and $4.1 million in 2003, 2002 and 2001, respectively. The benefit in 2003 includes the reversal of our valuation allowance against certain of our deferred tax assets. In December of 2003, we concluded that it was more likely than not that we would realize a portion of the benefit related to our deferred tax assets. Accordingly, we reduced the valuation allowance against the assets and recorded a tax benefit of $111.6 million. The recognition of these deferred tax assets has no impact on our current period cash flows. The recognition of these deferred tax assets increased reported earnings per share due to the resulting benefit recorded in the statement of operations from the reduction in our valuation allowance. Partially offsetting the tax benefit recorded is income tax expense associated with income earned by our foreign subsidiaries, foreign losses at lower rates and the non-tax deductibility of the purchased in-process research and development charge. We had significant net operating losses reducing our U.S. liability. Excluding the benefit relating to the reversal of our valuation allowance, and the write off of purchased in-process research and development, our effective tax rate for 2003 was 5%. For 2004, we expect our effective tax rate to be in the 32% to 35% range for the full year, reflecting a more normalized tax rate going forward. 45 The income tax expense in 2002 and 2001 was primarily associated with income earned by our foreign subsidiaries as we had significant net operating losses, which reduced our U.S. tax liability. The significant increases in income tax expense in 2001 resulted principally from the gain on the sale of our oncology assets to OSI, for which we recorded approximately $3.3 million of federal and state alternative minimum taxes. The provision for 2002 was reduced by a change in the U.S. income tax law. This law allowed net operating loss carryforward deductions to offset 100% of alternative minimum taxable income, resulting in a reduction of U.S. income tax recorded in the previous years of $1.3 million. Equity in Loss of Unconsolidated Affiliate In 2001, we recorded $2.1 million as our equity in the loss of our unconsolidated affiliate, Proligo. We sold our 49 percent interest in August 2001. Cumulative Effect of Change in Accounting Principle In 2001, we adopted SFAS 133, Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities, which resulted in a cumulative effect of change in accounting principle of $1.1 million. See Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion. Liquidity and Capital Resources Cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities totaled $707.0 million at December 31, 2003, down from $942.4 million at December 31, 2002. The decrease of $235.4 million was primarily due to the acquisition of Triangle, for which the net cash impact was $375.5 million, and the purchase of our Foster City campus for $123.0 million. Other major sources and uses of cash included net cash provided by operations of $234.6 million and proceeds from issuances of stock under employee stock plans of $83.8 million, partially offset by additional capital expenditures of $38.6 million. Working capital at December 31, 2003 was $1,080.0 million compared to $1,078.9 million at December 31, 2002. Significant changes in working capital during 2003 included a $97.1 million increase in accounts receivable, a $46.5 million increase in inventory and a $197.6 million increase in current deferred tax assets. The accounts receivable increase was primarily due to increased sales of Viread in the U.S. and Europe. The $46.5 million increase in inventory was primarily due to an increase in the purchase of raw materials and the production of Viread inventory to meet increasing sales demand. The $197.6 million increase in current deferred tax assets was due to the reversal of the valuation allowance against certain of our net deferred tax assets. The $6.1 million increase in accounts payable is primarily due to increases in our raw material purchases in support of Viread sales growth. Significant changes in current liabilities during 2003 included a $44.5 million increase in accrued liabilities. The significant components of the $44.5 million increase in accrued liabilities, exclusive of the assumed liabilities associated with the acquisition of the net assets of Triangle, consist of a $44.2 million increase in other accrued liabilities and a $6.2 million increase in accrued compensation and employee benefits, partially offset by a $5.9 million decrease in accrued clinical and preclinical expenses. The $44.2 million increase in other accrued liabilities is primarily due to Medicaid rebate obligations associated with higher sales of Viread, an increase in our income taxes payable and an increase in the recorded liability associated with the fair value of our forward currency contracts. The $6.2 million increase in accrued compensation is primarily due to increased bonus accruals and the expansion of our sales force. The $5.9 million decrease in accrued clinical and preclinical expenses is primarily due to decreasing activity associated with the clinical trial programs for Viread and Hepsera. In addition to the purchase of our Foster City campus, we made capital expenditures of $38.6 million in 2003, compared to $17.6 million in 2002 and $26.3 million in 2001. These expenditures were primarily for facilities improvements to accommodate our growth, as well as for laboratory and manufacturing 46 equipment. Capital expenditures related to research and development were between 50% and 60% of the $38.6 million spent in 2003, 20% to 25% of the $17.6 million spent in 2002 and 50% to 60% of the $26.3 million spent in 2001. We expect our capital spending for 2004 to be $55.0 million to $65.0 million due to increased infrastructure needs and higher R&D spending associated with the pilot plant we are constructing at our Foster City facilities. In December 2002, we issued $345.0 million of 2% convertible senior notes due December 15, 2007 in a private offering. The notes are currently convertible into a total of up to 7,340,425 shares of Gilead common stock at $47.00 per share. The $47.00 conversion price was higher than Gilead’s common stock price at the notes’ issuance date. The notes are redeemable in whole or in part, at our option, at any time on or after June 19, 2004, at specified redemption prices plus accrued interest. Debt issuance costs of $8.4 million incurred in connection with the issuance of the notes were recorded as other noncurrent assets, and are being amortized to interest expense on a straight-line basis over the contractual term of the notes. In December 2000, we issued $250.0 million of 5% convertible subordinated notes due December 15, 2007 in a private offering. The notes were convertible into a total of up to 10,178,116 shares of Gilead common stock at $24.5625 per share. The $24.5625 conversion price was higher than Gilead’s common stock price at the notes’ issuance date. Gilead called the $250.0 million 5% convertible subordinated notes for redemption in November 2003 and converted them to Gilead common stock in December 2003. Upon the conversion, the $4.6 million remaining balance of the related debt issuance costs was reclassified to additional paid in capital. We believe that our existing capital resources, supplemented by cash generated from our operations, will be adequate to satisfy our capital needs for the foreseeable future. Our future capital requirements will depend on many factors, including: · the commercial performance of our current and future products, · the progress and scope of our research and development efforts, including preclinical studies, and clinical trials, · the cost, timing and outcome of regulatory reviews, · the expansion of our sales and marketing capabilities, · administrative expenses, · the costs associated with our no-profit Global Access program for least developed nations, · the possibility of acquiring manufacturing capabilities or office facilities, · the possibility of acquiring other companies or new products, and · the establishment of additional collaborative relationships with other companies. We may in the future require additional funding, which could be in the form of proceeds from equity or debt financings, such as from our universal shelf registration filing in December 2003 for the potential issuance of up to $500.0 million of our securities, or additional collaborative agreements with corporate partners. If such funding is required, we cannot assure that it will be available on favorable terms, if at all. Subsidiaries and Other We have established a variety of subsidiaries in various countries for the purpose of conducting business in those locations. All of these subsidiaries are consolidated in our financial statements. We do not have any “special purpose” entities that are unconsolidated in our financial statements. We are also 47 not involved in any non-exchange traded commodity contracts accounted for at fair value. We have no commercial commitments with related parties, except for employee loans. Contractual Obligations We have contractual obligations in the form of capital and operating leases, notes payable, raw material supply arrangements and clinical research organization contracts. The following table summarizes these contractual obligations (in thousands): Payments due by period Contractual Obligations Total Less than one year 1-3 years 3-5 years More than 5 years Long-term debt obligations $ 345,000 $ — $ — $ 345,000 $ — Capital lease obligations 563 196 367 — — Operating lease obligations 55,238 7,036 25,169 12,838 10,195 Capital commitments(1) 15,700 15,700 — — — Inventory purchase obligations(2) 70,536 36,637 33,899 — — Clinical trials(3) 53,638 41,631 8,631 3,376 — Total $ 540,675 $ 101,200 $ 68,066 $ 361,214 $ 10,195 (1) At December 31, 2003, we had firm capital project commitments of approximately $15.7 million, related to our chemical development pilot plant currently under construction at our Foster City facility. Our budgeted capital expenditures for 2004 are significantly higher and we anticipate increasing our capital spending in future years. (2) At December 31, 2003, we had firm commitments to purchase inventory-related materials. The amounts disclosed only represent minimum purchase requirements. Actual purchases may differ significantly from these amounts. (3) At December 31, 2003, we had several clinical studies in various clinical trial phases. Our most significant expenditures are to contract research organizations. Although most contracts are cancelable, we generally have not cancelled contracts. These amounts reflect commitments based on existing contracts and do not reflect any future modifications to existing contracts and anticipated or potential new contracts. Recent Accounting Pronouncements In January 2003, the FASB issued FASB Interpretation No. 46 (FIN 46), Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities, an Interpretation of ARB No. 51. FIN 46 requires certain variable interest entities to be consolidated by the primary beneficiary of the entity if the equity investors in the entity do not have the characteristics of a controlling financial interest or do not have sufficient equity at risk for the entity to finance its activities without additional subordinated financial support from other parties. FIN 46 is effective immediately for all new variable interest entities created or acquired after January 31, 2003. We did not create or acquire any new variable interest entities after January 31, 2003. For variable interest entities created or acquired prior to February 1, 2003, the provisions of FIN 46, as amended, must be applied at the end of the first interim or annual period ending after March 15, 2003. The adoption of FIN 46 did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements. 48 ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK Foreign Currency Exchange Risk Our operations include manufacturing and sales activities in the U.S. as well as sales activities in Europe and Australia. As a result, our financial results could be significantly affected by factors such as changes in foreign currency exchange rates or weak economic conditions in the foreign markets in which we distribute our products. Our operating results are exposed to changes in exchange rates between the U.S. dollar and various foreign currencies, the most significant of which are the Euro, the British pound and the Australian dollar. When the U.S. dollar strengthens against these currencies, the relative value of sales made in the respective foreign currency decreases. Conversely, when the U.S. dollar weakens, the relative amounts of such sales increase. Overall, we are a net receiver of foreign currencies and, therefore, benefit from a weaker U.S. dollar and are adversely affected by a stronger U.S. dollar relative to those foreign currencies in which we transact significant amounts of business. To mitigate the impact of changes in currency exchange rates on cash flows from our foreign currency sales transactions, we enter into foreign exchange forward contracts to hedge our foreign currency-denominated accounts receivable. Additionally, to mitigate the impact of currency rate fluctuations on our cash outflows for certain foreign currency-denominated raw materials purchases, we enter into foreign exchange forward contracts to hedge our foreign currency-denominated accounts payable. A significant percentage of our product sales is denominated in foreign currencies. Increases in the value of the U.S. dollar against these foreign currencies in the past have reduced, and in the future may reduce, our U.S. dollar return on these sales and negatively impact our financial condition. Prior to 2002, we did not hedge our exposure to the impact of fluctuating foreign exchange rates on forecasted sales. In January 2002, we began to use forward contracts to hedge a percentage of our forecasted international sales, primarily those denominated in the Euro currency. The following table summarizes the notional amounts, average currency exchange rates and fair values of our open foreign exchange forward contracts at December 31, 2003. All contracts have maturities of one year or less. Average rates are stated in terms of the amount of foreign currency per U.S. dollar. Fair values represent estimated settlement amounts at December 31, 2003 (notional amounts and fair values in U.S. dollars in thousands): Currency Notional Amount Average Rate Fair Value December 31, 2003 British Pound $ 43,441 0.7111 $ (61 ) Euro 361,574 0.8335 (14,479 ) The total notional amount of $405.0 million and fair value of ($14.5) million on our open foreign exchange forward contracts at December 31, 2003 compares with a total notional amount of $53.5 million and fair value of ($1.1) million on our open foreign exchange forward contracts at December 31, 2002. The significant increase in outstanding contracts from 2002 to 2003 can be attributed to our decision to expand the time horizon that we include from three months to twelve months when hedging our forecasted international sales. This decision was made due to the growth in our international business and the increasing fluctuations in exchange rates, primarily the Euro. Interest Rate Risk Our portfolio of available-for-sale investment securities and our fixed-rate liabilities create an exposure to interest rate risk. With respect to the investment portfolio, we adhere to an investment policy that requires us to limit amounts invested in securities based on duration, industry group, investment type 49 and issuer, except for securities issued by the U.S. government. The goals of our investment policy, in order of priority, are as follows: · Safety and preservation of principal and diversification of risk; · Liquidity of investments sufficient to meet cash flow requirements; and · Competitive after-tax rate of return. The following table summarizes the expected maturities and average interest rates of our interest-bearing assets and fixed-rate liabilities at December 31, 2003 (dollars in thousands). Years ending December 31, Fair ValueDecember 31, 2004 2005 2006 2007 2008 Thereafter Total 2003 Assets Available-for-sale securities $ 543,119 $ 76,104 $ 9,016 — — — $ 628,239 $ 628,239 Average interest rate 1.5 % 1.7 % 1.3 % Liabilities Long-term obligations, including current portion(1) $ 7,232 $ 4,217 $ 10,610 $ 10,709 $ 10,289 $ 12,744 $ 55,801 $ 55,801 Average interest rate 13.5 % 13.8 % 14.3 % 20.7 % Convertible senior debentures — — — $ 345,000 — — $ 345,000 $ 472,650 Interest rate 2.0 % (1) Long-term obligations consist of capital leases and operating leases (net of noncancelable subleases). The interest portion of payments due is included. International Credit Risk Our accounts receivable balance at December 31, 2003 was $235.2 million compared to $125.0 million at December 31, 2002. The growth was primarily due to higher product sales for Viread in the U.S. and Europe. In certain countries where payments are typically slow, primarily Greece, Spain, Portugal and Italy, our accounts receivable balances are significant. In most cases, these slow payment practices reflect the pace at which governmental entities reimburse our customers. This, in turn, may increase the financial risk related to certain of our customers. Sales to customers in countries that tend to be relatively slow paying have in the past increased, and in the future may further increase, the average length of time that accounts receivable are outstanding. At December 31, 2003, our past due accounts receivable for Greece, Spain, Portugal and Italy totaled approximately $102.7 million, of which approximately $59.0 million was more than 120 days past due. At December 31, 2002, past due receivables for these countries were $49.7 million, of which approximately $26.6 million was more than 120 days past due. To date, we have not experienced significant losses with respect to the collection of our accounts receivable and we believe that all accounts receivable balances as reflected on the consolidated balance sheet, including those due from customers in these four countries, are collectible. We perform credit evaluations of our customer’s financial condition and generally have not required collateral. 50",2023-12-30 19:04:10.954032

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Executive Summary Our operating results for 2004 marked another year of growth with total revenues reaching $1.32 billion and higher ending cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities of $1.25 billion, driven in large part by operating cash flows of $511.4 million for the year. Although several factors contributed to our improved financial performance over 2003, two important drivers were the continued growth experienced by our HIV products portfolio (which is comprised of Viread, Emtriva and Truvada), as well as the maintenance of AmBisome revenues amidst increasing competition. Given increased international sales and a favorable foreign currency environment in Europe, Viread sales increased 38% year over year and comprised 63% of 2004 total product sales. In August 2004, we launched Truvada, which is the co-formulation of Viread and Emtriva, in the United States. We began launching Truvada in the European Union following regulatory approval in February 2005. Over time, depending on the treatment regimens prescribed by physicians, we expect to see Truvada sales partially replace product sales of Viread and Emtriva. To further increase our future sales of HIV products, we entered into a joint venture collaboration agreement with BMS in December 2004 to develop and commercialize the fixed-dose combination of Gilead’s Truvada and BMS’ Sustiva in the United States. Understanding the importance of having a clear view of our wholesalers’ channel inventory, we signed inventory management agreements with our three major U.S. wholesalers in 2004. In keeping with our strategy of active product acquisition and in-licensing, we rounded out 2004 by entering into collaboration agreements in the area of HCV. Our operating results for 2003 were impacted by the acquisition of all of the assets of Triangle in January 2003. We completed this acquisition to expand our antiviral pipeline. Triangle was a development stage company with a particular focus on potential therapies for HIV, including AIDS, and HBV. The aggregate purchase price was $525.2 million and included cash paid of $463.1 million, the fair value of stock options assumed of $41.3 million, direct transaction costs of $14.2 million and employee related costs of $6.6 million. Approximately $488.6 million of the consideration paid was allocated to purchased in-process research and development and represented the fair value of Triangle’s incomplete research and development programs that had not yet reached technological feasibility and had no alternative future use as of the acquisition date. As a result of this transaction and the related purchased in-process research and development charge, our operating loss for 2003 was $158.7 million. This acquisition was important to us not only for the compounds we acquired, but also for the opportunity it provided us to create Truvada, our co-formulation of Viread and Emtriva, into a single pill that can be dosed once a day. See Note 3 to the consolidated financial statements for further information on the Triangle acquisition. On September 3, 2004, Gilead completed a two-for-one stock split, effected in the form of a stock dividend, to stockholders of record as of August 12, 2004. Accordingly, all share and per share amounts for all periods presented have been restated to reflect this stock split. In addition, certain prior year amounts have also been reclassified to conform to the current year presentation. Management’s discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes included elsewhere in this report. Forward-Looking Statements and Risk Factors The following discussion contains forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. The “Risk Factors” discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes included elsewhere in this report. 28 Critical Accounting Policies, Estimates and Judgments This discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is based upon our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, and related disclosures. On an on-going basis, we evaluate our estimates, including those related to revenue recognition, allowance for doubtful accounts, inventories, clinical trial accruals and our tax provision. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other market-specific assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results, however, may differ significantly from these estimates. We believe the following critical accounting policies reflect the more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements: Revenue Recognition We recognize revenue from product sales when there is persuasive evidence an arrangement exists, delivery to the customer has occurred, the price is fixed or determinable and collectibility is reasonably assured. We record estimated reductions to revenue for expected returns of expired products, distributor fees, government rebate programs, such as Medicaid reimbursements and customer incentives, such as cash discounts for prompt payment. Estimates for distributor fees are based on contractually determined fixed percentages of sales. Estimates for government rebate programs and cash discounts are based on contractual terms, historical utilization rates and expectations regarding future utilization rates for these programs. Estimates for product returns, including new products, are based on an on-going analysis of industry and historical return patterns. This includes monitoring the feedback that we receive from our sales force regarding customer use and satisfaction, reviewing inventory data available to us through our U.S. wholesaler inventory management agreements to assist us in monitoring channel inventory levels, the purchase of third-party data to monitor prescriptions as well as, for new products, a review of our other long shelf life products we have sold through the same or similar channels. Further, we monitor the activities and clinical trials of our key competitors and assess the potential impact on our future sales and return expectations where necessary. Expected returns for our marketed drugs are generally low because the shelf life for these products ranges from 24 months for Truvada and up to 36 months for AmBisome and Viread in the United States. If conditions become more competitive for any of the markets served by our drugs or if other circumstances change, we may take actions to increase our product return estimates or we may offer additional customer incentives. This would result in an incremental reduction of future revenue at the time the return estimate is changed or new incentives are offered. Contract revenue for research and development is recorded as performance occurs and the earnings process is completed based on the performance requirements of the contract. Nonrefundable contract fees for which no further performance obligations exist, and where there is no continuing involvement by Gilead, are recognized on the earlier of when the payments are received or when collection is reasonably assured. Revenue from non-refundable up-front license fees and milestone payments where we continue to have involvement such as through a development collaboration or an obligation to supply product is recognized as performance occurs and our obligations are completed. In accordance with the specific terms of Gilead’s obligations under these types of arrangements, revenue is recognized as the manufacturing obligation is fulfilled or ratably over the development period. Revenue associated with substantive at-risk milestones is recognized based upon the achievement of the milestones as defined in the 29 respective agreements. Advance payments received in excess of amounts earned are classified as deferred revenue. Allowance for Doubtful Accounts We also maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments. This allowance is based on our analysis of several factors including, but not limited to, contractual payment terms, historical payment patterns of our customers and individual customer circumstances, an analysis of days sales outstanding by customer and geographic region, and a review of the local economic environment and its potential impact on government funding and reimbursement practices. If the financial condition of our customers or the economic environment in which they operate were to deteriorate, resulting in an inability to make payments, additional allowances may be required. Our allowance for doubtful accounts balance as a percentage of total accounts receivable did not materially change from December 31, 2003 to December 31, 2004. We believe that the allowance for doubtful accounts is adequate to cover anticipated losses under current conditions; however, significant deterioration in any of the above factors, especially with respect to the government funding and reimbursement practices in the European market could materially change these expectations and result in an increase to our allowance for doubtful accounts. Inventories We write down our inventory based on historical review of the quantity of bad batches experienced during the manufacturing process and expectations of production and inventory levels. We also perform quality control reviews of our individual raw material batches. We generally do not record inventory write-offs based on estimated obsolescence or risk of competition primarily because the shelf life of our products is long. However, if our current assumptions about future production or inventory levels, demand or competition were to change or if actual market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management, inventory write-downs may be required which could negatively impact our product gross margins and results of operations. Clinical Trial Accruals We record accruals for estimated clinical and preclinical study costs. Most of our clinical and preclinical studies are performed by third party contract research organizations (CROs). These costs are a significant component of research and development expenses. During 2004, 2003 and 2002, we incurred $24.7 million, $15.0 million and $23.9 million, respectively, of CRO costs. We accrue costs for clinical studies performed by CROs on a straight-line basis over the term of the service period and adjust our estimates, if required, based upon our on-going review of the level of effort actually incurred by the CRO. Initially we estimate that the work performed under the contracts occurs ratably over the periods to the expected milestone, event or total contract completion date. The expected completion dates are estimated based upon the terms of the contracts and past experience with similar contracts. These estimates may or may not match the actual services performed by the organizations as determined by patient enrollment levels and other measures of activities specified in the contract. As a result, we validate our accruals quarterly through written vendor confirmations and detailed reviews of the activities performed for our significant contracts. Based upon the results of these validation processes, we assess the appropriateness of our accruals and make any adjustments we deem necessary to ensure that our expenses reflect the actual effort incurred by the CROs. Generally, a significant portion of the total costs are associated with start up activities for the trial and patient enrollment. Gilead extensively outsources its clinical trial activities and usually performs only a small portion of the start-up activities in-house. As a result, CROs typically perform most of the total start-up activities for our trials, including document preparation, site identification, screening and preparation, pre-study visits, training and program management. On a 30 budgeted basis, these costs are typically 20% to 30% of the total contract value. On an actual basis, this percentage range is significantly wider as many of our contracts are either expanded or reduced in scope compared to the original budget while the start-up costs for the particular trial do not change significantly. Start-up costs usually occur within a few months after the contract has been established and are milestone or event driven in nature. The remaining activities and related costs, such as patient monitoring and administration, generally occur ratably throughout the life of the individual contract or study. Most contracts are negotiated as fixed unit prices and can vary in length between six months for a single dose Phase 1 study and up to two years or more for a more complex Phase 3 study. The average length of contract in 2004, 2003 and 2002 has been at the upper end of this range in order to provide long term safety and efficacy data to support the commercial launches of Viread, Truvada, Hepsera and Emtriva. Through December 31, 2004, differences between actual and estimated activity levels for any particular study were not significant enough to require a material adjustment. All of our material CRO contracts are terminable by us upon written notice and Gilead is generally only liable for actual effort expended by the CRO at any point in time during the contract, regardless of payment status. Amounts paid in advance of services being performed will be refunded if a contract is terminated. However, if management does not receive complete and accurate information from our vendors or has underestimated activity levels associated with a study at a given point in time, we would have to record additional and potentially significant research and development expenses in future periods. Tax Provision We develop our income tax provision including deferred tax assets and liabilities, based on significant management judgment. We evaluate the realizibility of our deferred tax assets on a quarterly basis. We record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets to the amounts that are likely to be realized. We consider future taxable income, ongoing tax planning strategies and our historical financial performance in assessing the need for a valuation allowance. If we expect to realize deferred tax assets for which we have previously recorded a valuation allowance, we would reduce the valuation allowance in the period in which such determination is first made. Such an adjustment was made in the fourth quarter of 2003 and 2004 when we determined that it was more likely than not that certain of our deferred tax assets would be realized, and therefore, we released the related valuation allowance. This resulted in an income tax benefit for 2003 and 2004 of approximately $111.6 million and $14.2 million, respectively. Similarly, if we determine that we would not be able to realize all or part of our deferred tax assets for which we have no valuation allowance, we would increase the valuation allowance in the period in which such determination is first made. Our future effective income tax rate may be affected by such factors as changes in tax laws or rates, changes in the interpretation of these laws, the impact of accounting for employee stock options beginning in the second half of 2005, and overall changes in future levels of earnings and research and development and capital spending. Management has discussed the development and selection of these critical accounting policies with the Audit Committee of Gilead’s Board of Directors and the Audit Committee has reviewed the disclosure presented above relating to them. Results of Operations Total Revenues We had total revenue of $1.32 billion in 2004, $867.9 million in 2003 and $466.8 million in 2002. Included in total revenue are product sales, royalty revenue and contract revenue includes revenue earned from research and development (R&D) and manufacturing collaborations. 31 Product Sales Product sales consisted of the following (in thousands): 2004 Change 2003 Change 2002 Viread $ 782,915 38 % $ 566,478 151 % $ 225,815 Emtriva 57,600 475 % 10,021 — — Truvada 67,865 — — — — Total HIV products 908,380 58 % 576,499 155 % 225,815 AmBisome 211,688 7 % 198,350 7 % 185,669 Other 122,156 99 % 61,492 396 % 12,395 Total product sales $ 1,242,224 49 % $ 836,341 97 % $ 423,879 Product sales increased 49% in 2004 compared to 2003 and 97% in 2003 compared to 2002, due primarily to the increase in the volume of sales within our HIV products. A significant percentage of our product sales continue to be denominated in foreign currencies. We use forward contracts to hedge a percentage of our forecasted international sales, primarily those denominated in the Euro. This reduces, but does not eliminate, fluctuations in sales due to changes in foreign currency exchange rates. Losses on these revenue hedges reduced increases in product sales by $2.5 million in 2004, $2.8 million in 2003 and $1.0 million in 2002, due to fluctuations in exchange rates. However, product sales (mainly Viread and AmBisome) benefitted overall, primarily from the increases in the exchange rates for the Euro and the British Pound in comparison with the U.S. dollar: $43.7 million when comparing 2004 to 2003 and $43.6 million when comparing 2003 to 2002. Prior to 2004, we experienced significant fluctuations in U.S. distribution channel inventory levels due to speculative purchasing by the major wholesalers. As a result, we experienced increased quarter over quarter sales volatility from these purchasing patterns. In order to help alleviate these fluctuations, in July 2004, we entered into inventory management agreements (IMAs) with AmerisourceBergen Drug Corporation, Cardinal Health, Inc. and McKesson Corporation, three major pharmaceutical wholesalers that distribute more than 90 percent of the portfolio of products that we sell in the United States. These agreements were implemented to limit speculative buying and to help ensure that wholesaler purchasing is more consistent with customer demand and more predictable. Under these agreements, we agreed to pay the wholesalers a fee in exchange for product distribution and inventory management services, market research information, return goods processing assistance and counterfeit product detection services. Such fees are recorded as a reduction to product sales in the consolidated statements of operations. Additionally, under the terms of the agreements, each wholesaler has agreed not to exceed specified maximum levels of inventory on hand. As of the end of December 2004, we believe that these three major wholesalers have inventories on-hand for all Gilead products of less than one month’s supply, which is in compliance with the contractually specified levels. Viread, Emtriva and Truvada were approved for sale in the United States in October 2001, July 2003 and August 2004, respectively. Viread and Emtriva were approved for sale in the European Union in February 2002 and October 2003, respectively. Sales of Viread were 63%, 68% and 53% of total product sales in 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively. Of the Viread sales in 2004, $437.5 million were U.S. sales, an increase of 23% versus 2003, and $345.4 million were international sales, an increase of 64% versus 2003. Of the Viread sales in 2003, $355.9 million were U.S. sales, an increase of 113% versus 2002, and $210.6 million were international sales, an increase of 258% versus 2002. Since Emtriva’s introduction in July 2003, sales increased significantly from $10.0 million in 2003 to $57.6 million in 2004. Also, since August 2004 when Truvada was approved for sale in the United States, product sales have totaled $67.9 million through December 31, 2004. Total HIV product sales in 2004 were $27.4 million higher compared to 2003 due to the favorable European currency environment, the majority of which relates to 32 Viread sales. We believe that as our product sales mix changes with patients who are currently taking Viread and/or Emtriva switching to Truvada, looking at our HIV products’ sales collectively is a more relevant basis for period-over-period comparison. Sales of HIV products as a percentage of total product sales were 73%, 69% and 53% for 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively. In 2005, we expect sales from our HIV products to be $1.2 billion to $1.25 billion for the full year. Sales of AmBisome were 17%, 24% and 44% of total product sales in 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively. As our HIV and HBV product sales continue to increase, AmBisome sales are decreasing as a percentage of total product sales. Of the AmBisome sales in 2004, $11.4 million were U.S. sales, a decrease of 17% versus 2003, and $200.3 million were international sales, an increase of 9% versus 2003. Of the AmBisome sales in 2003, $13.8 million were U.S. sales, a decrease of 10% versus 2002, and $184.6 million were international sales, an increase of 8% over 2002. Reported AmBisome sales for 2004 were $16.3 million higher due to the favorable currency environment compared to 2003. On a volume basis, AmBisome sales in the United States decreased 2% from 2003 while sales volume in Europe increased slightly by 1% compared to 2003. When analyzing the decrease in U.S. sales, it is important to note that while U.S. product sales decreased 17% when comparing 2004 to 2003, volume decreased only 2%. Our discussion of U.S. AmBisome sales relates solely to our sales of AmBisome to Fujisawa which is recorded at our manufacturing cost. In 2004, due to greater manufacturing efficiencies, our per unit manufacturing cost for AmBisome decreased, thereby decreasing revenues reported for our sales to Fujisawa. Royalties that we earn on sales of AmBisome by Fujisawa are discussed below. With continuing competition, we expect AmBisome sales for 2005 to be in the range of $195 million to $205 million. Royalty Revenue We recorded royalty revenues of $63.4 million in 2004, compared with $25.2 million in 2003 and $20.4 million in 2002. During this three-year period, our most significant source of royalty revenue resulted from sales of Tamiflu by Roche and sales of AmBisome in the United States by Fujisawa under a co-promotion arrangement with us. Royalty revenues earned on sales of Tamiflu were $44.6 million, $12.0 million and $3.4 million in 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively. Royalty revenues earned on sales of AmBisome by Fujisawa were $13.0 million, $12.5 million and $15.7 million in 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively. As it is difficult to estimate third party product sales, we record royalty revenue from Roche one quarter in arrears. Due to a severe influenza epidemic in the United States in late 2003 through early 2004, our royalty revenues increased substantially during the first and second quarters of 2004. Increased awareness and discussion about the supply of influenza treatments in 2004 has further increased Roche’s sales of Tamiflu and consequently, our royalties for the third and fourth quarters of 2004. Contract Revenue Total contract revenue was $19.0 million in 2004, compared with $6.3 million in 2003 and $22.5 million in 2002. In 2004, contract revenue consisted primarily of $10.0 million in research and milestone revenue earned from Eyetech Pharmaceuticals which included $7.6 million net milestone payments earned upon the filing of new drug applications by Eyetech in Europe and the United States for Macugen (pegaptanib sodium injection). In 2003, the primary source of contract revenue consisted of $2.2 million in license fees earned in conjunction with our licensing agreement with Eyetech for Macugen. In 2002, contract revenue primarily consisted of $8.1 million due to our licensing of the SELEX process patent estate to Archemix, which, due to collectibility concerns, we recognized on a cash basis, and $8.0 million in milestone payments from Roche for the European prophylaxis and treatment approvals of Tamiflu. In December 2001, we completed the sale of our oncology assets to OSI. Under the terms our agreement, we are entitled to additional payments from OSI of up to $30.0 million in either cash or a combination of cash and OSI stock if and when OSI reaches certain development milestones for NX 211, the most advanced of the oncology product candidates sold to OSI. Under a related manufacturing 33 agreement, we produce NX 211 and GS 7904L, the two liposomal products included in the sales at our manufacturing facility in San Dimas, California. In 2004, 2003 and 2002, we recognized $1.4 million, $1.1 million and $3.3 million, respectively, of contract revenue under this manufacturing agreement. Cost of Goods Sold and Product Gross Margins The following table indicates cost of goods sold and product gross margins (in thousands): 2004 Change 2003 Change 2002 Total product sales $ 1,242,224 49 % $ 836,341 97 % $ 423,879 Cost of goods sold $ 166,587 48 % $ 112,691 62 % $ 69,724 Gross margin percentage 86.6 % 86.5 % 83.6 % Our gross margin was relatively flat from 2003 to 2004 as the positive impact of improvements in certain manufacturing processes and a favorable foreign currency environment was offset by changes in product sales mix. Comparing 2003 to 2002, gross margin improved primarily due to a change in product mix as Viread, a higher margin product, contributed more significantly to net product sales in 2003. Changes in foreign currency exchange rates impact gross margins since we price our products in the currency of the country into which the products are sold while a significant majority of our manufacturing costs are in U.S. dollars. For example, an increase in the value of these foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar will positively impact gross margins since our manufacturing costs will remain approximately the same while our revenues after being translated into U.S. dollars, will increase. Although the weakening U.S. dollar has positively impacted gross revenues and gross margins in 2004, 2003 and 2002, the full effect of the foreign currency exchange rates has been moderated by our hedging program on forecasted international sales. Except for the potential impact of unpredictable and uncontrollable changes in exchange rates relative to the U.S. dollar and the mix of product sales between our various HIV products, Hepsera and AmBisome, we expect gross margins in 2005 to be consistent with those of 2004, within the range of 85-86%. Research and Development Expenses The following table summarizes our research and development expenses into these major components (in thousands): 2004 Change 2003 Change 2002 Research $ 43,872 17 % $ 37,494 35 % $ 27,847 Clinical development 146,983 37 % 107,438 20 % 89,379 Pharmaceutical development 32,697 (11 )% 36,832 49 % 24,641 Total $ 223,552 23 % $ 181,764 28 % $ 141,867 34 The three major categories of research and development (R&D) expenses consist of personnel costs, including salaries and benefits, clinical studies performed by contract research organizations, materials and supplies, and overhead allocations consisting of various support and facilities related costs. Research costs typically consist of preclinical and toxicology work. Clinical development costs include Phase 1, 2, 3 and 4 clinical trials as well as expanded access programs. Pharmaceutical development costs consist of product formulation and chemical analysis. Prior to 2004, clinical development consisted only of clinical trial expenses for Phases 1 through 3 and Phase 4 in the United States. Phase 4 European clinical trials were included in sales, general and administrative (SG&A). During 2004, in order to better reflect the nature of the European Phase 4 clinical trials, we began recording these clinical trial expenses as research and development. In order to be consistent with the current year presentation, $16.9 million and $7.1 million of expenses were reclassified from selling, general and administrative to research and development expenses for the years ended December 31, 2003 and 2002, respectively. The $41.8 million increase in R&D expenses in 2004 over 2003 was primarily attributable to increased salaries of $10.2 million due largely to higher headcount, increased contract research organization costs of $9.7 million associated with increased clinical activities, as well as $13.0 million research and license fees paid by us in relation to hepatitis C collaboration agreements effective in the fourth quarter of 2004. The new 2004 collaborations were entered into with Achillion and Genelabs and required us to pay aggregate license fees of $13.0 million which were expensed as R&D as the underlying technology had no alternative future use. The increase in 2004 R&D activity was partially offset by a decrease in spending due to the discontinuation of our two programs, GS 9005 and GS 7340, that focused on the development of certain HIV investigational products. It is also important to note that our 2003 R&D expenses included a reimbursement to Gilead of $13.2 million from the settlement of a contractual dispute with a vendor. The $39.9 million increase in R&D spending in 2003 versus 2002 was primarily attributable to increased salaries of $14.4 million due largely to higher headcount, increased clinical supplies costs of $7.0 million and increased clinical trials costs associated with the development of Emtriva and Truvada, the co-formulation of Viread and Emtriva. Also as mentioned above, in 2003, we settled a contractual dispute with a vendor that resulted in reimbursement to us of $13.2 million that was recorded to research and development expense. In 2005, we expect R&D expenses to be approximately $240 million to $260 million. This estimated increase in expenses over 2004 levels reflects increased spending on our internal research and development efforts as well as costs associated with post-marketing studies to support our products, but excludes any expenses we may incur associated with potential collaborations or strategic acquisitions, including license and milestone fees or cost sharing arrangements, and the impact of accounting for employee stock based compensation beginning in the second half of 2005. Industry reports indicate that a biopharmaceutical company generally takes 10 to 15 years (an average of 12 years) to research, develop and bring to market a new prescription medicine in the United States. These averages are generally consistent with the projects that we undertake internally, although our recent product development timelines have been on a slightly more accelerated basis. Drug development in the United States is a process that includes several steps defined by the FDA. The process begins with the filing of an IND, which, if successful, allows opportunity for clinical study of the potential new medicine. Clinical development typically involves three phases of study: Phase 1, 2 and 3, and generally accounts for an average of seven years of a drug’s total development time. The most significant costs associated with clinical development are the Phase 3 trials as they tend to be the longest and largest studies conducted during the drug development process. We currently have products in development that are in Phase 3 studies. The successful development of our products is highly uncertain. Completion dates and R&D expenses can vary significantly for each product and are difficult to predict. Even after successful development and FDA approval of a product, we undertake additional studies to try to expand the product’s label and market potential. For a more complete discussion of the risks and uncertainties 35 associated with completing the development of products, see the “Risk Factors That Affect Gilead” section of Item I above. Selling, General and Administrative Expenses The following table highlights the year to year changes in selling, general and administrative expenses (in thousands): 2004 Change 2003 Change 2002 Selling, general and administrative $ 302,793 30 % $ 233,266 34 % $ 174,192 SG&A expenses for the year ended December 31, 2004 were $302.8 million compared to $233.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2003, which includes the reclassification of phase IV clinical trial expenses incurred in 2003 to R&D of $16.9 million. The significant increase in expenses in 2004 compared to 2003 is primarily due to increased salaries of $14.2 million due largely to higher headcount, increased consulting fees of $5.9 million related to Sarbanes-Oxley compliance and business strategy consulting, as well as increased costs of $12.6 million relating to speaker’s programs, grants and journal advertising. The remainder of the increase in SG&A expenses in 2004 compared to 2003 is due to our increased global marketing efforts and increased infrastructure required to support the growth of our business. During 2004, as part of our infrastructure investments, we implemented a reorganization of our sales and marketing functions into a newly created commercial division. In conjunction with this reorganization, we created and filled the new position of executive vice-president, commercial operations who will have responsibility over global commercial operations and strategy for our product portfolio. The increase in expenses in 2003 compared to 2002, which includes the reclassification of phase IV clinical trial expenses to R&D of $7.1 million, is primarily due to increased salaries of $13.4 million due largely to higher headcount, an increase in hedging costs of $10.6 million, increased costs of $9.0 million relating to marketing meetings and grants, as well as increased general and directors and officers insurance of $6.4 million. The remainder of the increase in SG&A expenses is due to our global sales and marketing efforts including the expansion of our U.S. and European sales forces and increased infrastructure required to support the growth of our business. In 2005, we expect SG&A expenses to be approximately $350 million to $370 million primarily due to the anticipated launch costs for Truvada in the European Union, as well as ongoing investment in our global commercial organization through hiring and promotional programs, but excludes any expenses we may incur associated with potential collaborations or strategic acquisitions and the impact of applying the new standard on the accounting for employee stock based compensation beginning in the second half of 2005. Purchased In-process Research and Development In connection with the acquisition of the net assets of Triangle completed in January 2003, we recorded purchased in-process research and development expenses of $488.6 million in the first quarter of 2003. The charge was due to Triangle’s incomplete research and development programs that had not yet reached technological feasibility and had no alternative future use as of the acquisition date. The value of the purchased in-process research and development was determined by estimating the related future net cash flows between 2003 and 2020 using a present value risk adjusted discount rate of 15.75%. This discount rate is a significant assumption and is based on our estimated weighted average cost of capital adjusted upward for the risks associated with the projects acquired. The projected cash flows from the acquired projects were based on estimates of revenues and operating profits related to the projects considering the stage of development of each potential product acquired, the time and resources needed to complete the development and approval of each product, the life of each potential commercialized product and associated risks including the inherent difficulties and uncertainties in 36 developing a drug compound including obtaining FDA and other regulatory approvals, and risks related to the viability of and potential alternative treatments in any future target markets. A summary of these programs at the acquisition date, and updated for subsequent developments through February 2005, is as follows: Program Description Status of Development Estimated Acquisition Date Fair Value (in millions) Emtricitabine for HIV A nucleoside analogue that has been shown to be an inhibitor of HIV replication in patients. Four phase 3 studies were completed prior to the acquisition date. U.S. marketing approval was received from the FDA in July 2003 for Emtriva and European Union approval received from the European Commission in October 2003. $178.8 Emtricitabine/Tenofovir DF Fixed Dose Combination for HIV Therapy A fixed-dose co-formulation of tenofovir and emtricitabine. As of the acquisition date, work had not commenced on the potential co-formulation except to the extent that work on emtricitabine as a single agent was progressing. In March 2004, applications for marketing approval were submitted in the United States and European Union and in August 2004 marketing approval in the United States was received from the FDA for Truvada, the fixed-dose co-formulation of tenofovir and emtricitabine. Marketing approval in the European Union was received in February 2005. $106.4 Amdoxovir for HIV A purine dioxolane nucleoside that may offer advantages over other marketed nucleosides because of its activity against drug resistant viruses as exhibited in patients with HIV infection. This program was in Phase 2 trials at acquisition date. In 2004, we terminated the licensing agreement with Emory University and the University of Georgia Research Foundation, Inc. and development was discontinued. $114.8 Clevudine for HBV A pyrimidine nucleoside analogue that has been shown to be an inhibitor of HBV replication in patients chronically infected with HBV. This program was in Phase 1/2 trials at acquisition date. In August 2003, the licensing agreement with Bukwang Pharm. Ind. Co., Ltd was terminated and development was discontinued. $58.8 Emtricitabine for HBV An inhibitor of HBV replication in patients chronically infected with HBV. One phase 3 trial has been completed as of December 31, 2004. $29.8 37 Asset Impairment During 2003, we recorded an asset impairment charge of $10.2 million on certain of our long-lived assets, primarily leasehold improvements, manufacturing and laboratory equipment. This non-cash charge was driven by the decision in December 2003 to terminate our liposomal research and development activities in San Dimas and discontinue the DaunoXome product line. The impairment was based on our analysis of the undiscounted cash flows to be generated from the affected assets as compared to their carrying value. As the carrying value exceeded the related estimated undiscounted cash flows, we wrote the carrying value of the long-lived assets down to their estimated fair value. In 2004, subsequent to our decision to discontinue the DaunoXome product line, we received unanticipated requests in Europe asking Gilead to reconsider selling DaunoXome. As a result of these requests, management decided to continue selling this product in certain countries and we are still evaluating our supply and sales strategy with respect to DaunoXome. In accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles, the new cost basis for the impaired assets was not adjusted for these new facts and circumstances. Gain (Loss) on Marketable Securities Pursuant to our agreement with Eyetech entered into in March 2000, we received a warrant to purchase 791,667 shares of Eyetech series B convertible preferred stock, exercisable at a price of $6.00 per share. In January 2004, Eyetech completed an initial public offering of its common stock at which time we adjusted the fair value of the warrant resulting in a gain of $20.6 million. At that time, the fair value of the warrant was estimated using the Black-Scholes valuation model with a volatility rate of 50% and a discount rate of 2.8%. At the end of the first quarter of 2004, we exercised the warrant on a net basis using shares of Eyetech common stock as consideration for the exercise price and subsequently held 646,841 shares of Eyetech common stock. In the second quarter of 2004, we sold all of the Eyetech shares we owned and realized a gain of approximately $2.3 million, which is included in interest and other income, net, for the year ended December 31, 2004. In July 2002, we sold all of our remaining shares of OSI common stock for approximately $22.0 million. These shares were partial consideration for the sale of our oncology assets to OSI in December 2001, at which time they were recorded at a fair market value of approximately $38.0 million. In connection with the sale of these remaining shares, we recognized a non-operating loss of approximately $16.0 million in the year ended December 31, 2002. Make-Whole Payment on Debt Redemption In October 2004, Gilead called for the redemption of all its outstanding 2% convertible senior notes due December 15, 2007 on November 20, 2004. The convertible senior notes were called under a provisional redemption based upon the market price of Gilead common stock exceeding certain thresholds. The aggregate principal amount outstanding of the notes was $345.0 million. The convertible senior notes were redeemable at a redemption price equal to 100% of the principal amount of the notes, plus a cash payment equal to accrued and unpaid interest to the redemption date and a cash make-whole payment equal to $60 per $1,000 principal value of the notes less interest actually paid or accrued and unpaid from the date of issuance of the notes to the redemption date. Interest on the convertible senior notes ceased to accrue on the redemption date, and the only remaining right of the holders thereafter was to receive the redemption payment, including accrued and unpaid interest to the redemption date and the make-whole payment. Alternatively, note holders could elect to convert their notes into shares of Gilead common stock at a price of $23.50 per share, or 42.55 shares of Gilead common stock per $1,000 principal amount of the notes. Holders of substantially all of the outstanding notes converted their notes into shares of Gilead’s common stock prior to the November 20, 2004 redemption date. As a result of these conversions, 14,676,952 shares of 38 common stock were issued to these note holders. In connection with the redemption, Gilead paid aggregate make-whole payments of $7.4 million to note holders. Interest and Other Income, net We recorded interest and other income of $18.9 million in 2004, compared with $13.0 million in 2003 and $22.3 million in 2002. The increase in 2004 compared to 2003 is primarily attributable to the higher cash balances and yields over the past year. The decrease in 2003 compared to 2002 is attributable to the significant decline in interest rates and a lower average cash balance due to the acquisition of the net assets of Triangle and the purchase of our Foster City campus, partially offset by positive cash flow from operations. Interest income in 2005 will depend principally upon prevailing interest rates and the level of our cash, cash equivalent and marketable securities balances. Interest Expense We incurred interest expense of $7.3 million in 2004, compared with $21.9 million in 2003 and $13.9 million in 2002. The decrease in 2004 over 2003 is primarily due to the conversion of our $250.0 million 5% convertible subordinated debt into shares of our common stock in December 2003. The only outstanding debt during most of 2004 consisted of our $345.0 million 2% convertible senior debt issued in December 2002. In November 2004, we converted our 2% convertible senior notes. The significant increase in 2003 over 2002 is due to the full year of interest on our $345.0 million 2% convertible senior notes which were issued in December 2002. Interest expense for 2003 and 2002 consisted primarily of interest on the $250.0 million 5.0% convertible subordinated notes, which were converted into shares of our common stock in December 2003. We expect interest expense in 2005 to decrease as compared with 2004 primarily due to the conversion of the $345.0 million 2% convertible senior notes in November 2004. Provision for (Benefit from) Income Taxes Our provision for (benefit from) income taxes was $207.1 million, ($95.5) million and $1.3 million in 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively. The 2004 effective income tax rate of 31.5% differs from the U.S. federal statutory rate of 35% generally due to state taxes being more than offset by the recognition of previously unbenefitted net operating losses, tax credit carryforwards and certain earnings being taxed in foreign tax rate jurisdictions with lower tax rates for which no U.S. taxes have been provided because such earnings are planned to be permanently reinvested outside the United States. The tax benefit in 2003 includes the reversal of our valuation allowance against certain of our deferred tax assets. In December of 2003, we concluded that it was more likely than not that we would realize a portion of the benefit related to our deferred tax assets. Accordingly, we reduced the valuation allowance against the assets and recorded a tax benefit of $111.6 million. The recognition of these deferred tax assets had no impact on our cash flows. Partially offsetting this tax benefit was income tax expense associated with income earned by our foreign subsidiaries, foreign losses benefitted at lower tax rates and the non-tax deductibility of purchased in-process research and development. We had significant net operating loss carryforwards which were used to reduce our U.S. tax liability. Excluding the benefit relating to the reversal of our valuation allowance, and the write off of purchased in-process research and development, our effective tax rate for 2003 was 5%. The income tax expense in 2002 was primarily associated with income earned by our foreign subsidiaries as we had significant net operating losses in the United States. The provision for 2002 was reduced by a change in the U.S. income tax law. This law allowed net operating loss carryforward deductions to offset 100% of alternative minimum taxable income, resulting in a reduction of U.S. income tax recorded in previous years of $1.3 million. 39 On October 22, 2004, the American Jobs Creation Act (“the AJCA”) was signed into law. The AJCA allows for a deduction of 85% of certain foreign earnings that are repatriated, as defined in the AJCA. We may elect to apply this provision to qualifying earnings repatriations in fiscal 2005. We have started an evaluation of the effects of the repatriation provision; however, we do not expect to be able to complete this evaluation until after Congress or the Treasury Department provide additional clarifying language on key elements of the provision. We expect to complete our evaluation of the effects of the repatriation provision within a reasonable period of time following the publication of the additional clarifying language. The range of possible amounts that we are considering for repatriation under this provision is between zero and $500 million (maximum amount allowable to us as defined in the AJCA). Currently, the related potential range of impact on income taxes cannot be reasonably estimated. Liquidity and Capital Resources Cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities totaled $1.25 billion at December 31, 2004, up from $707.0 million at December 31, 2003. In 2004, the increase of $547.0 million was primarily due to net cash provided by operations of $511.4 million and proceeds from issuances of stock under employee stock plans of $78.8 million, partially offset by capital expenditures of $51.4 million. In 2003, the cash decrease of $235.4 million from 2002 was primarily due to the acquisition of Triangle, for which the net cash impact was $375.5 million, the purchase of our Foster City campus for $123.0 million and capital expenditures of $38.6 million, partially offset by proceeds from issuance of stock under employee stock plans of $83.8 million. Working capital at December 31, 2004 was $1.60 billion compared to $1.08 billion at December 31, 2003. Significant changes in working capital during 2004 included a $144.5 million decrease in current deferred tax assets more than offset by a $118.8 million increase in accounts receivable and a $37.9 million increase in inventory. The $144.5 million decrease in current deferred tax assets was primarily due to the utilization of net operating losses and tax credit carryforwards to offset taxable income. The accounts receivable increase of $118.8 million was primarily due to increased sales of Viread in the United States and Europe and sales from our new product, Truvada, launched in the United States in the latter half of 2004. The $37.9 million increase in inventory was primarily due to an increase in the purchase of raw materials and the production of Viread and Truvada inventory to meet increasing sales demand. Current liabilities in 2004 increased by $67.6 million from 2003 primarily due to the following: a $15.0 million increase in Medicaid rebate obligations associated with higher sales of Viread; a $14.4 million increase in deferred revenue primarily due to royalties received from Roche; a $12.9 million increase in the liability associated with the fair value of our forward currency contracts as the U.S. dollar continued to weaken against European currencies; an $11.9 million increase in accounts payable primarily due to increases in our raw material purchases in support of Viread and Truvada sales growth; a $9.7 million increase for increased compensation costs and employee benefits with added headcount; and an increase of $4.1 million for distributors fees owed but not yet paid under the inventory management agreements entered into in July 2004. The increase in current liabilities was partially offset by a $4.3 million decrease in accrued clinical and preclinical expenses as a result of decreasing activity associated with the clinical trial programs for Viread and Hepsera towards the end of 2004. In 2004, we made capital expenditures of $51.4 million compared to $38.6 million in 2003 and $17.6 million in 2002. These expenditures were primarily for domestic and international facilities improvements, including approximately $26.0 million associated with the completion of our pilot plant in Foster City which will be used to develop our drug processes and prepare materials to supply clinical trials, as well as additional spending for laboratory and manufacturing equipment to accommodate our growth. Capital expenditures related to research and development were between 55% and 65% of the $51.4 million spent in 2004, 50% and 60% of the $38.6 million spent in 2003 and 20% to 25% of the $17.6 million spent 40 in 2002. We expect our capital spending for 2005 to be $55 million to $65 million due to increased infrastructure needs and higher R&D spending. We believe that our existing capital resources, supplemented by cash generated from our operations, will be adequate to satisfy our capital needs for the foreseeable future. Our future capital requirements will depend on many factors, including: · the commercial performance of our current and future products, · the progress and scope of our research and development efforts, including preclinical studies, and clinical trials, · the cost, timing and outcome of regulatory reviews, · the expansion of our sales and marketing capabilities, · administrative expenses, · the possibility of acquiring manufacturing capabilities or additional office facilities, · the possibility of acquiring other companies or new products, · the establishment of additional collaborative relationships with other companies, and · defense costs associated with, settlements of and adverse results of litigation. We may in the future require additional funding, which could be in the form of proceeds from equity or debt financings, such as from our universal shelf registration statement filed in December 2003 for the potential issuance of up to $500.0 million of our securities, or additional collaborative agreements with corporate entities. If such funding is required, we cannot assure that it will be available on favorable terms, if at all. Subsidiaries and Other We have established a variety of subsidiaries in various countries for the purpose of conducting business in those locations. All of these subsidiaries are consolidated in our financial statements. We do not have any variable interest entities that are unconsolidated in our financial statements. We are also not involved in any non-exchange traded commodity contracts accounted for at fair value. We have no commercial commitments with related parties, except for employee loans. Contractual Obligations We have contractual obligations in the form of capital and operating leases, non-cancelable raw material supply arrangements and clinical research organization contracts. The following table summarizes these contractual obligations at December 31, 2004 (in thousands): Payments due by period Contractual Obligations Total Less than one year 1-3 years 3-5 years More than 5 years Capital lease obligations $ 476 $ 221 $ 255 $ — $ — Operating lease obligations 88,630 14,160 27,009 20,615 26,846 Capital commitments(1) 1,966 1,966 — — — Inventory purchase obligations(2) 232,181 104,681 85,000 42,500 — Clinical trials(3) 34,893 22,686 7,718 4,489 — Total $ 358,146 $ 143,714 $ 119,982 $ 67,604 $ 26,846 41 (1) At December 31, 2004, we had firm capital project commitments of approximately $2.0 million relating to facilities improvement. In addition, we have budgeted significant capital expenditures for 2005, mainly due to anticipated increased infrastructure needs and higher R&D spending. We may have more capital spending in future years. (2) At December 31, 2004, we had firm commitments to purchase active pharmaceutical ingredients. The amounts disclosed only represent minimum purchase requirements. Actual purchases may differ significantly from these amounts. (3) At December 31, 2004, we had several clinical studies in various clinical trial phases. Our most significant expenditures are to contract research organizations. Although most contracts are cancelable, we generally have not cancelled contracts. These amounts reflect commitments based on existing contracts and do not reflect any future modifications to existing contracts and anticipated or potential new contracts. Recent Accounting Pronouncement In December 2004, the FASB issued SFAS No. 123 (revised 2004), Share-Based Payment (SFAS 123R), which is a revision of SFAS 123. SFAS 123R supercedes APB 25 and amends SFAS 95, Statement of Cash Flows. SFAS 123R requires all share-based payments to employees and directors, including grants of stock options, to be recognized in the statement of operations based on their fair values, beginning with the first interim or annual period after June 15, 2005, with early adoption permitted. The pro forma disclosures previously permitted under SFAS 123 no longer will be an alternative to financial statement recognition. We expect to adopt SFAS 123R in our third quarter of fiscal 2005, beginning July 1, 2005. Under SFAS 123R, we must determine the appropriate fair value model to be used for valuing share-based payments, the amortization method for compensation cost and the transition method to be used at date of adoption. The transition methods include prospective and retroactive adoption options. Under the retroactive options, prior periods may be restated either as of the beginning of the year of adoption or for all periods presented. The prospective method requires that compensation expense be recorded for all unvested stock options and restricted stock at the beginning of the first quarter of adoption of SFAS 123R, while the retroactive methods would record compensation expense for all unvested stock options and restricted stock beginning with the first period restated. We are currently evaluating the requirements of SFAS 123R as well as option valuation methodologies related to our employee and director stock options and employee stock purchase plan. Although we have not yet determined the method of adoption or the effect of adopting SFAS 123R, we expect that the adoption of SFAS 123R will have a material impact on our consolidated results of operations and earnings per share. The impact of adoption of SFAS 123R cannot be predicted at this time because it will depend on, among other things, the levels of share-based payments granted in the future, the method of adoption and the option valuation method used. SFAS 123R also requires the benefits of tax deductions in excess of recognized compensation cost to be reported as a financing cash flow, rather than as an operating cash flow as required under current literature. This requirement will reduce net operating cash flows and increase net financing cash flows in periods after adoption. While we cannot estimate what those amounts will be in the future (because they depend on, among other things, when employees and directors exercise stock options), the amount of operating cash flows recognized in prior periods related to tax deductions were $22.0 million, $132.3 million and $0.4 million in 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively. Current estimates of option values using the Black-Scholes method may not be indicative of results from valuation methodologies ultimately adopted by Gilead. 42 ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK Foreign Currency Exchange Risk Our operations include manufacturing and sales activities in the United States as well as sales activities in Europe and Australia. As a result, our financial results could be significantly affected by factors such as changes in foreign currency exchange rates or weak economic conditions in the foreign markets in which we distribute our products. Our operating results are exposed to changes in exchange rates between the U.S. dollar and various foreign currencies, the most significant of which are the Euro, the British pound and the Australian dollar. When the U.S. dollar strengthens against these currencies, the relative value of sales made in the respective foreign currency decreases. Conversely, when the U.S. dollar weakens, the relative amounts of such sales increase. Overall, we are a net receiver of foreign currencies and, therefore, benefit from a weaker U.S. dollar and are adversely affected by a stronger U.S. dollar relative to those foreign currencies in which we transact significant amounts of business. To mitigate the impact of changes in currency exchange rates on cash flows from our foreign currency sales transactions, we enter into foreign exchange forward contracts to hedge our foreign currency-denominated net monetary assets or liabilities. A significant percentage of our product sales are denominated in foreign currencies. Increases in the value of the U.S. dollar against these foreign currencies in the past have reduced, and in the future may reduce, our U.S. dollar return on these sales and negatively impact our financial condition. Prior to 2002, we did not hedge our exposure to the impact of fluctuating foreign exchange rates on forecasted sales. In January 2002, we began to use forward contracts to hedge a percentage of our forecasted international sales, primarily those denominated in the Euro currency. In recent years, due to the weakening of the U.S. dollar, foreign currency exchange fluctuations have positively impacted product sales and gross margin; however, the full impact of the favorable foreign currency environment has been moderated by the hedge contracts that we had entered into. The following table summarizes the notional amounts, average currency exchange rates and fair values of our open foreign exchange forward contracts at December 31, 2004. All contracts have maturities of one year or less. Average rates are stated in terms of the amount of foreign currency per U.S. dollar. Fair values represent estimated settlement amounts at December 31, 2004 (notional amounts and fair values in U.S. dollars in thousands): Currency Notional Amount Average Rate Fair Value December 31, 2004 British Pound $ 48,095 0.5509 $ (2,178 ) Euro 525,501 0.7716 (25,783 ) Australian Dollar 7,146 1.2972 (2 ) The total notional amount of $580.7 million and fair value of ($28.0) million on our open foreign exchange forward contracts at December 31, 2004 compares with a total notional amount of $405.0 million and fair value of ($14.5) million on our open foreign exchange forward contracts at December 31, 2003. The significant increase in outstanding contracts from 2003 to 2004 is primarily attributed to the projected increase in revenues over the forecast periods. Interest Rate Risk Our portfolio of available-for-sale investment securities and our fixed-rate liabilities create an exposure to interest rate risk. With respect to the investment portfolio, we adhere to an investment policy that requires us to limit amounts invested in securities based on duration, industry group, investment type 43 and issuer, except for securities issued by the U.S. government. The goals of our investment policy, in order of priority, are as follows: · Safety and preservation of principal and diversification of risk; · Liquidity of investments sufficient to meet cash flow requirements; and · Competitive after-tax rate of return. The following table summarizes the expected maturities and average interest rates of our fixed-rate interest-bearing assets and fixed-rate liabilities at December 31, 2004 (dollars in thousands).

The interest portion of payments due is included. International Credit Risk Our accounts receivable balance at December 31, 2004 was $371.2 million compared to $235.2 million at December 31, 2003 and $125.0 million at December 31, 2002. The growth in our accounts receivable balances was primarily due to higher product sales for Viread in the United States and Europe. In certain countries where payments are typically slow, primarily Greece, Italy, Portugal and Spain, our accounts receivable balances are significant. In most cases, these slow payment practices reflect the pace at which governmental entities reimburse our customers. This, in turn, may increase the credit risk related to certain of our customers. Sales to customers in countries that tend to be relatively slow paying have in the past increased, and in the future may further increase, the average length of time that accounts receivable are outstanding. At December 31, 2004, our past due accounts receivable for Greece, Italy, Portugal and Spain totaled approximately $166.6 million, of which approximately $100.5 million was more than 120 days past due. To date, we have not experienced significant losses with respect to the collection of our accounts receivable and we believe that substantially all our accounts receivable balances are collectible. We perform credit evaluations of our customer’s financial condition and generally have not required collateral.",2023-12-30 19:04:04.325486

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS The following Management’s Discussion and Analysis (MD&A) is intended to help the reader understand the results of operations and financial condition of Gilead. MD&A is provided as a supplement to, and should be read in conjunction with our financial statements and the accompanying notes to the financial statements. Executive Summary Gilead experienced another year of increasing revenues, profits and cash flows due to the successful launches and adoption of our drugs for the treatment of the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and the hepatitis B virus (HBV), as well as the maintenance of our product sales for AmBisome. We have been able to increase market share due to the favorable and consistent safety and efficacy profile that has been demonstrated to date on our products, including Viread, Truvada and Emtriva. The increase in market share on our HIV products helped contribute to a 53% increase in 2005 HIV product sales to $1.39 billion from 2004, while the continued adoption of Hepsera increased 2005 product sales to $186.5 million, an increase of 66% from 2004. We intend to build upon the successes of these products by continuing to engage in long-term clinical studies to differentiate our products. Additionally, within the HIV franchise, we intend to work with patients, physicians and key opinion leaders to educate them on the benefits of earlier treatment that is expected to help expand the treated-patient population. As we continue to gather positive data on the safety and efficacy of Truvada, which we launched in various European countries in 2005, we believe that the uptake of Truvada will continue to be a driving force in increasing our HIV product sales. Over the last few years, we have also focused on creating what we believe is a solid foundation for long-term growth by looking for opportunities to acquire or in-license innovative technologies or drug candidates and developing those technologies alongside our in-house initiatives. In 2005, we entered into a collaboration with Japan Tobacco Inc. (Japan Tobacco) and made advances on the Phase 1/2 clinical trial based on the HIV integrase inhibitor we licensed from them. Additionally, we demonstrated bioequivalence on a formulation of the fixed-dose combination of Truvada and Bristol-Myers Squibb Company’s (BMS) Sustiva (the triple product) as well as began dosing patients in a Phase 1 study with the HCV drug candidate we licensed from Achillion Pharmaceuticals. Internally, we made significant progress in the enrollment of two Phase 3 studies comparing the efficacy and safety of tenofovir versus Hepsera in patients with HBV. We also filed an Investigational New Drug application in December 2005 for GS 9160, one of our internal integrase clinical candidates, and initiated a Phase 1 clinical study in healthy volunteers in February 2006. We intend to sustain the long-term growth of our business by continuing to discover and commercialize new drugs in the antivirals area, especially in the HIV and hepatitis C virus (HCV) areas. We also plan on exploring other therapeutic areas with significant unmet medical needs for licensing or acquisition opportunities that fit with our core competencies and complement our long-term growth strategy. Part of our ability to grow consists of building a strong global organization. During the year, we relocated our European commercial, medical and administrative headquarters from France to the United Kingdom, thereby uniting these functions with the regulatory, safety and information technology groups already headquartered in the United Kingdom. We also made strategic expansion of our global sales and marketing activities for 2005. As our revenues continued to increase, and as we continued to see collection improvements in certain European regions over the last two years, cash and investment management continued to be an important priority. In addition to re-examining our cash and investments portfolio, investment policies and strategies, we also used our cash for various collaborative activities. During the third quarter of 2005, along with Royalty Pharma, we purchased the royalty interest owned by Emory University in emtricitabine for $525.0 million. Furthermore, in December 2005, leveraging our strong financial position and results, we entered into a $500.0 million credit facility with a syndicate of banks consisting of a $300.0 million term loan and a $200.0 million revolving credit facility. The term loan, which we used to facilitate a one-time repatriation of qualified foreign earnings under the American Jobs Creation Act (AJCA), resulted in a $25.1 million income tax benefit that we recorded in 2005. We have not yet drawn any amounts under the revolving facility but the facility will give us flexibility to use our 31 Table of Contents funds for future corporate development initiatives, including licensing opportunities and potential acquisitions, while allowing us to meet our ongoing working capital and infrastructure needs. Our focus for 2006 will be to continue building upon our current infrastructure, continuing to advance our drug candidates through the clinic and executing on our operational goals of promoting our products’ safety and efficacy data to drive higher patient adoption. We also intend to build a stronger working relationship with F. Hoffmann-La Roche Ltd (Roche) with respect to Tamiflu under our amended agreement to jointly drive more effective marketing and supply chain strategies to meet the increasing demand for Tamiflu. We will also focus significant resources in preparing for the launch of the co-formulated Truvada-Sustiva product in the United States. Moreover, we are working with Merck & Co., Inc. (Merck) and BMS on arrangements to launch the co-formulated product outside of the United States. Finally, we will continue to strengthen our global infrastructure to better support our growing employee and customer base, including expanding certain aspects of our manufacturing capabilities as well as upgrading our facilities and information systems. Critical Accounting Policies, Estimates and Judgments This discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is based on our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, and related disclosures. On an on-going basis, we evaluate our estimates, including those related to revenue recognition, allowance for doubtful accounts, inventories, prepaid royalties, clinical trial accruals and our tax provision. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other market-specific assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results, however, may differ significantly from these estimates. We believe the following critical accounting policies reflect the more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements: Revenue Recognition We recognize revenue from product sales when there is persuasive evidence an arrangement exists, delivery to the customer has occurred, the price is fixed or determinable and collectibility is reasonably assured. We record estimated reductions to revenue for expected returns of expired products, distributor fees, government rebate programs such as Medicaid reimbursements and customer incentives such as cash discounts for prompt payment. Estimates for distributor fees are based on contractually determined fixed percentages of sales. Estimates for government rebate programs and cash discounts are based on contractual terms, historical utilization rates and our expectations regarding future utilization rates for these programs. Estimates for product returns, including new products, are based on an on-going analysis of industry and historical return patterns. This includes monitoring the feedback that we receive from our sales force regarding customer use and satisfaction, reviewing inventory data available to us through our inventory management agreements with U.S. wholesalers to assist us in monitoring channel inventory levels, purchasing third-party data to monitor prescriptions as well as, for new products, comparing these products against our other products with same or similar sales channels. Further, we monitor the activities and clinical trials of our key competitors and assess the potential impact on our future sales and return expectations where necessary. Expected returns for our marketed drugs are generally low because the shelf lives for these products in the United States ranges from 24 months for Truvada and Hepsera, and up to 36 months for Viread and AmBisome. If conditions become more competitive for any of the markets served by our drugs or if other circumstances change, we may take actions to increase our product return estimates or we may offer additional customer incentives. This would result in an incremental reduction of future revenue at the time the return estimate is changed or new incentives are offered. Contract revenue for research and development (R&D) is recorded as performance occurs and the earnings process is completed based on the performance requirements of the contract. Nonrefundable contract fees for which no further performance obligations exist, and where there is no continuing involvement by Gilead, are recognized on the earlier to occur of when the payments are received or when collection is reasonably assured. 32 Table of Contents Revenues from non-refundable up-front license fees and milestone payments where we continue to have involvement such as through a development collaboration or an obligation to supply product are recognized as performance occurs and our obligations are completed. In accordance with the specific terms of Gilead’s obligations under these types of arrangements, revenues are recognized as the obligation is fulfilled or ratably over the development or manufacturing period. Revenues associated with substantive at-risk milestones are recognized based upon the achievement of the milestones as defined in the respective agreements. Advance payments received in excess of amounts earned are classified as deferred revenue. Allowance for Doubtful Accounts We also maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments. This allowance is based on our analysis of several factors including, but not limited to, contractual payment terms, historical payment patterns of our customers and individual customer circumstances, an analysis of days sales outstanding by customer and geographic region and a review of the local economic environment and its potential impact on government funding and reimbursement practices. If the financial condition of our customers or the economic environment in which they operate were to deteriorate, resulting in an inability to make payments, additional allowances may be required. Our allowance for doubtful accounts balance as a percentage of total accounts receivable did not materially change from December 31, 2004 to December 31, 2005. We believe that the allowance for doubtful accounts is adequate to cover anticipated losses under current conditions; however, significant deterioration in any of the above factors, especially with respect to the government funding and reimbursement practices in the European market could materially change these expectations and result in an increase to our allowance for doubtful accounts. Inventories We record write downs of the value of our inventory based on review of the historical quantity of bad batches experienced during the manufacturing process and expectations of production and inventory levels. We also perform quality control reviews of our individual raw material batches. We generally do not record inventory write-offs relating to estimated obsolescence or risk of competition primarily because the shelf life of our products is long. However, if our current assumptions about future production or inventory levels, demand or competition were to change or if actual market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management, additional inventory write-downs may be required, which could negatively impact our product gross margins and results of operations. Prepaid Royalties We capitalize royalties that we have prepaid at cost, specifically those related to the emtricitabine royalties we paid to Emory for the HIV indication, based on the present value of the future royalty obligation that we would expect to pay to Emory assuming certain expected levels of our product sales incorporating the emtricitabine technology. The net book value of our prepaid asset was determined using our best estimate of relevant future product sales available at the time we consummated the transaction; however, we review at least annually, the expected future performance of our products and indicators that would support a write-down in the net recoverable value of our asset. We amortize our prepaid royalties based on an effective royalty rate that we derive from forecasted HIV product sales incorporating emtricitabine. Our product sales forecasts are prepared annually and determined using our best estimates of future activity. If a previously unanticipated and significant change occurs to our sales forecasts, including the introduction of a competing product by us or one of our competitors into the same HIV market as emtricitabine, we would prospectively update the royalty rate used to amortize our prepaid royalties which may increase future royalty expense. We review our royalty rate at least annually and would adjust the rate based on any significant new facts or circumstances that may arise. Clinical Trial Accruals We record accruals for estimated clinical study costs. Most of our clinical studies are performed by third party contract research organizations (CROs). These costs are a significant component of R&D expenses. During 33 Table of Contents 2005, 2004 and 2003, we incurred CRO costs of $21.1 million, $24.7 million and $15.0 million, respectively. We accrue costs for clinical studies performed by CROs on a straight-line basis over the service periods specified in the contracts and adjust our estimates, if required, based upon our on-going review of the level of effort and costs actually incurred by the CRO. We validate our accruals quarterly with our vendors and perform detailed reviews of the activities related to our significant contracts. Based upon the results of these validation processes, we assess the appropriateness of our accruals and make any adjustments we deem necessary to ensure that our expenses reflect the actual effort incurred by the CROs. Generally, a significant portion of the total clinical trial costs are associated with start up activities for the trial and patient enrollment. Gilead extensively outsources its clinical trial activities and usually performs only a small portion of the start-up activities in-house. As a result, CROs typically perform most of the total start-up activities for our trials, including document preparation, site identification, screening and preparation, pre-study visits, training and program management. On a budgeted basis, these costs are typically 20% to 30% of the total contract value. On an actual basis, this percentage range is significantly wider as many of our contracts are either expanded or reduced in scope compared to the original budget, while start-up costs for the particular trial do not change significantly. Start-up costs usually occur within a few months after the contract has been executed and are milestone or event driven in nature. The remaining activities and related costs, such as patient monitoring and administration, generally occur ratably throughout the life of the individual contract or study. Most contracts are negotiated as fixed unit prices and can vary in length between six months for a single dose Phase 1 study and up to two years or more for a more complex Phase 3 study. The average length of contracts in 2005, 2004 and 2003 has been at the upper end of this range in order to provide long-term safety and efficacy data to support the commercial launches of Viread, Truvada, Hepsera and Emtriva. All of our material CRO contracts are terminable by us upon written notice and Gilead is generally only liable for actual effort expended by the CRO at any point in time during the contract, regardless of payment status. Amounts paid in advance of services being performed will be refunded if a contract is terminated. Through December 31, 2005, differences between actual and estimated activity levels for any particular study were not significant enough to require a material adjustment. However, if management does not receive complete and accurate information from our vendors or has underestimated activity levels associated with a study at a given point in time, we would have to record additional and potentially significant R&D expenses in future periods. Tax Provision We estimate our income tax provision, including deferred tax assets and liabilities, based on significant management judgment. We evaluate the realization of all or a portion of our deferred tax assets on a quarterly basis. We record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets to the amounts that are more likely than not to be realized. We consider future taxable income, ongoing tax planning strategies and our historical financial performance in assessing the need for a valuation allowance. If we expect to realize deferred tax assets for which we have previously recorded a valuation allowance, we would reduce the valuation allowance in the period in which such determination is first made. Such adjustments were made in the fourth quarter of 2005 and 2004 when we determined that it was more likely than not that certain of our deferred tax assets would be realized, and therefore, we released the related valuation allowance. This resulted in an income tax benefit for 2005 and 2004 of approximately $8.2 million and $14.2 million, respectively. Similarly, if we determine that we would not be able to realize all or part of our deferred tax assets for which we have no valuation allowance, we would increase the valuation allowance in the period in which such determination is first made. Our future effective income tax rate may be affected by such factors as changes in tax laws, regulations and/or rates, changing interpretation of existing laws or regulations, changes in our international organization, and changes in overall levels of income before tax. Management has discussed the development and selection of these critical accounting policies with the Audit Committee of Gilead’s Board of Directors and the Audit Committee has reviewed the disclosures presented above relating to them. 34 Table of Contents Results of Operations Total Revenues We had total revenues of $2.03 billion in 2005, $1.32 billion in 2004 and $867.9 million in 2003. Included in total revenues are product sales, royalty revenue and contract revenue including revenue earned from manufacturing collaborations. Product Sales Product sales consisted of the following (in thousands): 2005 Change 2004 Change 2003 HIV products: Viread $ 778,783 (1 )% $ 782,915 38 % $ 566,478 Truvada 567,829 737 % 67,865 — — Emtriva 47,486 (18 )% 57,600 475 % 10,021 HIV products 1,394,098 53 % 908,380 58 % 576,499 AmBisome 220,753 4 % 211,688 7 % 198,350 Hepsera 186,532 66 % 112,525 123 % 50,506 Vistide 6,629 (16 )% 7,904 4 % 7,576 DaunoXome 1,287 (25 )% 1,727 (49 )% 3,410 Total product sales $ 1,809,299 46 % $ 1,242,224 49 % $ 836,341 Total product sales increased by 46% in 2005 compared to 2004 and 49% in 2004 compared to 2003, in each case, primarily due to an increase in the volume of sales of our HIV products. A significant percentage of our product sales continue to be denominated in foreign currencies. We use forward contracts to hedge a percentage of our forecasted international sales, primarily those denominated in Euro. This reduces, but does not eliminate, fluctuations in sales due to changes in foreign currency exchange rates. HIV Products Viread, Truvada and Emtriva were approved for sale in the United States in October 2001, August 2004 and July 2003, respectively. Viread, Truvada and Emtriva were approved for sale in the European Union in February 2002, February 2005 and October 2003, respectively. Sales of Truvada commenced in the United States in the third quarter of 2004 and country-specific launches in Europe began in 2005. HIV product volume increased by 37% in 2005 compared to 2004 and by 55% in 2004 compared to 2003. HIV product volume growth in the United States were 18% and 44% in 2005 and 2004, respectively, whereas volume increases outside the United States were 71% and 77% in 2005 and 2004, respectively. • Viread Sales of Viread in 2005 remained relatively consistent with sales levels in 2004, resulting from the continued strong performance of Viread offset by the impact of patients switching from a Viread-containing regimen to one containing Truvada in countries where Truvada is available. Sales of Viread in 2004 increased by 38% compared to 2003, primarily driven by volume increases in the United States and across most European countries. • Truvada Sales of Truvada increased in the United States in 2005, the first full year of Truvada sales. Truvada patients come primarily from patients new to therapy, and secondarily, from patients switching from other regimens, including those containing Viread or Emtriva. 35 Table of Contents • Emtriva Sales of Emtriva in 2005 decreased by 18% compared to 2004, primarily driven by the impact of patients switching from an Emtriva-containing regimen to one containing Truvada in countries where Truvada is available. In 2006, we expect sales from our HIV products to be in the range of $1.675 billion to $1.750 billion. This does not include future product sales, if any, that may result should the triple product be approved for commercial sale in the United States, as we cannot predict whether the triple product will be approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA). AmBisome AmBisome product sales increased by 4% in 2005 compared to 2004, primarily driven by an increase in overall sales volume of 15%, partially offset by lower pricing in most regions outside of the United States. Product sales increased by 7% in 2004 over the prior year due primarily to higher sales volume outside of the United States and a stronger European currency, partially offset by lower pricing in many regions outside of the United States. Our discussion of U.S. AmBisome product sales relates solely to our sales of AmBisome to Astellas Pharma Inc. (Astellas), as successor to Fujisawa USA, Inc., which are recorded at our manufacturing cost. In 2004, due to greater manufacturing efficiencies, our per unit manufacturing cost for AmBisome decreased, thereby decreasing revenues reported for our sales to Astellas. Royalties that we earn on sales of AmBisome by Astellas are discussed under “Royalty Revenue” below. As a result of pricing pressures in Europe and increased competition, we expect AmBisome product sales for 2006 to be in the range of $205.0 million to $215.0 million. Hepsera Sales of Hepsera increased by 66% in 2005 compared to 2004 and by 123% in 2004 compared to 2003, primarily driven by sales volume growth in both Europe and the United States. Volume also increased with respect to our sales of Hepsera to GlaxoSmithKline (GSK). We sell Hepsera to GSK at our manufacturing cost in connection with GSK’s distribution activities in Asia. Royalties we earn on sales of Hepsera by GSK are recorded as royalty revenue. We expect Hepsera sales for 2006 to be in the range of $200.0 million to $210.0 million, which takes into account the impact of existing and potential competitor products in the United States and Europe. Royalty Revenue We recorded royalty revenues of $196.9 million in 2005, compared with $63.4 million in 2004 and $25.2 million in 2003. During this three-year period, our most significant sources of royalty revenues were from sales of Tamiflu by Roche and sales of AmBisome in the United States by Astellas. In November 2005, Gilead resolved its dispute with Roche relating to our 1996 development and license agreement and agreed to terminate the related arbitration pending between Gilead and Roche. As part of the terms of the dispute resolution, Gilead and Roche have established joint committees to oversee manufacturing, commercial and pandemic planning for the product and we have the option to co-promote Tamiflu in specialized areas in the United States. Related to the dispute resolution, Roche also paid us $80.7 million that we recognized as royalty revenue in 2005, which consisted of $18.2 million relating to disputed royalties from 2001 to 2003, $11.8 million relating to the reimbursement of the 2004 contractual cost of goods adjustment that had previously reduced our earned royalties, and $50.7 million relating to the updating of royalties payable to Gilead for the first nine months of 2005 based on current year royalty rates instead of the prior year’s effective royalty rate. Excluding the amounts received in connection with the dispute resolution, the significant year over year increase for Tamiflu royalties in 2005 was primarily due to higher royalties received from Roche for higher Tamiflu sales caused by the significant 2004/2005 flu season, particularly in Japan, and the fulfillment of orders for pandemic 36 Table of Contents readiness supplies in certain countries in 2005. Royalty revenues earned from Roche, including the amounts recognized from the dispute resolution in 2005, were $161.6 million, $44.6 million and $12.0 million for 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively. Comparing 2004 to 2003, royalty revenues earned from sales of Tamiflu by Roche also increased substantially due to a severe influenza epidemic in the United States from late 2003 through early 2004. Increased awareness and discussion about the supply of influenza treatments in 2003/2004 also increased Roche’s sales of Tamiflu and consequently, our royalties in 2004. As it is difficult to estimate third party product sales, similar to our other out-licensing arrangements other than our arrangement with Astellas, under which royalties are recorded one month in arrears, we record royalty revenue from Roche one quarter in arrears. Royalty revenue earned on sales of AmBisome by Astellas have remained consistent at $13.0 million for both 2005 and 2004, a slight increase from $12.5 million in 2003. Contract Revenue Total contract revenues were $22.2 million in 2005, compared with $19.0 million in 2004 and $6.3 million in 2003. In 2005, contract revenues consisted primarily of a $7.0 million milestone payment earned from OSI Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (OSI), as successor to Eyetech Pharmaceuticals, Inc., upon its first commercial sale of Macugen in the United States in 2005 as well as revenue earned from various contract manufacturing projects. In 2004, contract revenues consisted primarily of $10.0 million in research and milestone revenue earned from OSI, which included $7.6 million recognized upon the filing of new drug applications by OSI in Europe and the United States for Macugen. Cost of Goods Sold and Product Gross Margin The following table indicates total product sales and cost of goods sold (in thousands) and product gross margin: 2005 Change 2004 Change 2003 Total product sales $ 1,809,299 46 % $ 1,242,224 49 % $ 836,341 Cost of goods sold $ 260,326 56 % $ 166,587 48 % $ 112,691 Product gross margin 86 % 87 % 87 % Our product gross margin for 2005 was slightly lower than that for 2004 due to product mix changes as patients continue to switch from Viread, a higher margin product, to Truvada. Our product gross margin was relatively consistent from 2003 to 2004 as the positive impact of improvements in certain manufacturing processes and a favorable foreign currency environment in 2004 was offset by changes in product sales mix. As a result of Royalty Pharma and our purchase of the royalty interest owned by Emory in emtricitabine in July 2005, we capitalized $341.3 million in prepaid royalties, representing our 65% share of the $525.0 million purchase price. In the third quarter of 2005, we have begun to amortize this prepaid royalty to cost of goods sold over the remaining life of the underlying patent based on an effective royalty rate derived from our forecasted sales. We recorded royalties to Royalty Pharma based on actual emtricitabine net sales relative to Royalty Pharma’s 35% ownership interest in the underlying Emory royalty interest. Although we expect this transaction to have a favorable impact on our emtricitabine product gross margin in the long-term, the impact to our overall product gross margin in 2005 was not significant. We expect our product gross margin in 2006 to be generally consistent with that of 2005. This excludes the impact of the potential launch of the triple product as we cannot predict whether or when the triple product will be approved by the FDA. Although we expect the launch of the triple product will decrease our product gross margin percentage, there will be no impact to our net profit. This is due to the fact that as the majority owner of 37 Table of Contents our joint venture with BMS, we will consolidate 100% of the triple product revenue. However, we will earn the full product margin of the Truvada portion of the triple product but earn zero product margin on the Sustiva portion of the triple product. Research and Development Expenses The following table summarizes our R&D expenses into these major components (in thousands): 2005 Change 2004 Change 2003 Research $ 55,918 27 % $ 43,872 17 % $ 37,494 Clinical development 178,015 21 % 146,983 37 % 107,438 Pharmaceutical development 43,791 34 % 32,697 (11 )% 36,832 Total $ 277,724 24 % $ 223,552 23 % $ 181,764 R&D expenses consist primarily of personnel costs, including salaries and benefits, clinical studies performed by CROs, materials and supplies, licenses and fees and overhead allocations consisting of various support and facilities related costs. Our R&D activities are separated into three main categories: research, clinical development and pharmaceutical development. Research costs typically consist of preclinical and toxicology costs. Clinical development costs include costs for Phase 1, 2, 3 and 4 clinical trials. Pharmaceutical development costs consist of product formulation and chemical analysis costs. The $54.2 million increase in R&D expenses in 2005 compared to 2004 was primarily attributable to a $15.0 million payment made to Emory in connection with the amendment of our existing license agreement with Emory related to our obligation to develop emtricitabine for the hepatitis B indication, a $15.0 million payment made to Japan Tobacco related to the execution of our HIV integrase license agreement for GS 9137, increased salaries from additional headcount of $8.9 million and increased clinical and product development activities associated with our HCV, HBV and HIV programs. The payments made to Emory and Japan Tobacco were expensed as the underlying technology was incomplete and had no alternative future use, and in the case of Emory, no significant R&D activities are expected in the next several years. The $41.8 million increase in R&D expenses in 2004 as compared to 2003 was primarily attributable to increased salaries of $10.2 million due largely to higher headcount, $13.0 million in research and license fees paid in relation to the HCV collaboration agreements we entered into with Achillion Pharmaceuticals (Achillion) and Genelabs Technologies (Genelabs) during 2004, as well as increased CRO costs of $9.7 million associated with increased clinical activities. The payments made to Achillion and Genelabs were expensed as the underlying technology had no alternative future use. The increase in 2004 R&D expenses compared to 2003 was partially offset by a decrease in spending due to the discontinuation of our two internal programs, GS 9005 and GS 7340, that focused on the development of certain HIV investigational products. Our 2003 R&D expenses included a reimbursement to Gilead of $13.2 million from the settlement of a contractual dispute with a vendor. In 2006, we expect R&D expenses to increase over 2005 levels reflecting increased spending on our internal and collaborative R&D efforts relating to our expectation that pipeline products will progress into more advanced clinical trials, increased headcount as well as the impact of expensing share-based payments. Selling, General and Administrative Expenses The following table summarizes our SG&A expenses (in thousands): 2005 Change 2004 Change 2003 Selling, general and administrative $ 379,248 25 % $ 302,793 30 % $ 233,266 38 Table of Contents SG&A expenses for 2005 were $379.2 million, an increase of $76.5 million compared to 2004. The significant increase was primarily due to an increase in salaries of $12.8 million due largely to higher headcount, an increase in market research, speaker’s programs and symposia costs of $9.2 million, $8.4 million of severance and relocation expenses associated with the relocation of our European commercial, medical and administrative headquarters from France to the United Kingdom, an increase in medical education costs of $5.6 million, an increase in journal advertising costs of $4.6 million, as well as a general expansion of our sales and marketing activities worldwide. These increases were partially offset by a decrease in bad debt expense of $5.7 million as a result of higher collections in certain European countries. SG&A expenses in 2004 were $302.8 million compared to $233.3 million for 2003, which includes the reclassification of Phase 4 clinical trial expenses to R&D as mentioned above. The significant increase in expenses in 2004 compared to 2003 is primarily related to an increase in salaries of $14.2 million due largely to higher headcount, an increase in consulting fees of $5.9 million related to Sarbanes-Oxley compliance and business strategy consulting, as well as an increase in costs of $12.6 million relating to speaker’s programs, grants and journal advertising. The remainder of the increase in SG&A expenses in 2004 as compared to 2003 was generally due to our increased global marketing efforts and expanded infrastructure required to support the growth of our business. During 2004, as part of our infrastructure investments, we implemented a reorganization of our sales and marketing functions into a newly created commercial division. In conjunction with this reorganization, we created and filled the new position of executive vice-president, commercial operations responsible for global commercial operations and strategy for our product portfolio. In 2006, we expect SG&A expenses to increase primarily due to the anticipated costs associated with launching and supporting Truvada in various countries, costs related to our ongoing investment in our global commercial organization through hiring and promotional programs as well as the impact of expensing share-based payments. Purchased In-process Research and Development In connection with the acquisition of the net assets of Triangle Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (Triangle) completed in January 2003, we recorded purchased in-process R&D expenses of $488.6 million in the first quarter of 2003. The charge was due to Triangle’s incomplete R&D programs that had not yet reached technological feasibility and had no alternative future use as of the acquisition date. The value of the purchased in-process R&D was determined by estimating the related future net cash flows between 2003 and 2020 using a present value risk adjusted discount rate of 15.75%. This discount rate is a significant assumption and is based on our estimated weighted average cost of capital adjusted upward for the risks associated with the projects acquired. The projected cash flows from the acquired projects were based on estimates of revenues and operating profits related to the projects considering the stage of development of each potential product acquired, the time and resources needed to complete the development and approval of each product, the life of each potential commercialized product and associated risks including the inherent difficulties and uncertainties in developing a drug compound including obtaining FDA and other regulatory approvals, and risks related to the viability of and potential alternative treatments in any future target markets. 39 Table of Contents A summary of these programs at the acquisition date follows, updated for subsequent changes in status of development: Program Description Status of Development EstimatedAcquisition DateFair Value (in millions) Emtricitabine for HIV A nucleoside analogue that has been shown to be an inhibitor of HIV replication in patients. Four Phase 3 studies were completed prior to the acquisition date. U.S. marketing approval received from the FDA in July 2003 for Emtriva and European Union approval received from the European Commission in October 2003. $ 178.8 Emtricitabine/Tenofovir DF Fixed Dose Combination for HIV Therapy A fixed-dose co-formulation of tenofovir and emtricitabine. As of the acquisition date, work had not commenced on the potential co-formulation except to the extent that work on emtricitabine as a single agent was progressing. In March 2004, applications for marketing approval were submitted in the United States and European Union and in August 2004 marketing approval in the United States was received from the FDA for Truvada, the fixed-dose co-formulation of tenofovir and emtricitabine. Marketing approval in the European Union was received in February 2005 and sales commenced later during the first quarter. $ 106.4 Amdoxovir for HIV A purine dioxolane nucleoside that may offer advantages over other marketed nucleosides because of its activity against drug resistant viruses as exhibited in patients with HIV infection. This program was in Phase 2 trials at acquisition date. In 2004, we terminated the licensing agreement with Emory University and the University of Georgia Research Foundation, Inc. and development was discontinued. $ 114.8 Clevudine for HBV A pyrimidine nucleoside analogue that has been shown to be an inhibitor of HBV replication in patients chronically infected with HBV. This program was in Phase 1/2 trials at acquisition date. In August 2003, the licensing agreement with Bukwang Pharm. Ind. Co., Ltd was terminated and development was discontinued. $ 58.8 Emtricitabine for HBV An inhibitor of HBV replication in patients chronically infected with HBV. This program was in Phase 3 trials at acquisition date but was completed as of December 31, 2004. We continue to evaluate our strategy for the development of emtricitabine for the hepatitis B indication. We currently do not expect to undertake any significant R&D activities in the next several years. $ 29.8 40 Table of Contents Asset Impairment During 2003, we recorded an asset impairment charge of $10.2 million on certain of our long-lived assets, primarily leasehold improvements, manufacturing and laboratory equipment. This non-cash charge was driven by the decision in December 2003 to terminate our liposomal R&D activities in San Dimas and discontinue the DaunoXome product line. The impairment was based on our analysis of the undiscounted cash flows to be generated from the affected assets as compared to their carrying value. As the carrying value exceeded the related estimated undiscounted cash flows, we wrote the carrying value of the long-lived assets down to their estimated fair value. In 2004, subsequent to our decision to discontinue the DaunoXome product line, we received unanticipated requests in Europe asking Gilead to reconsider selling DaunoXome. As a result of these requests, management decided to continue selling this product in certain countries although we are evaluating our supply and sales strategy with respect to DaunoXome. In accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles, the new cost basis for the impaired assets was not adjusted for these new facts and circumstances. Gain on Warrant Pursuant to our agreement with Eyetech Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (Eyetech), as predecessor to OSI, that we entered into in March 2000, we received a warrant to purchase 791,667 shares of Eyetech series B convertible preferred stock, exercisable at a price of $6.00 per share. In January 2004, Eyetech completed an initial public offering of its common stock at which time we adjusted the fair value of the warrant resulting in a gain of $20.6 million. At that time, the fair value of the warrant was estimated using the Black-Scholes valuation model with a volatility rate of 50% and a discount rate of 2.8%. At the end of the first quarter of 2004, we exercised the warrant on a net basis using shares of Eyetech common stock as consideration for the exercise price and subsequently held 646,841 shares of Eyetech common stock. In the second quarter of 2004, we sold all of the Eyetech shares we owned and realized a gain of approximately $2.3 million, which is included in interest and other income, net, in 2004. Make-Whole Payment on Convertible Debt Redemption In October 2004, we called for the redemption of all our outstanding 2% convertible senior notes due December 15, 2007 on November 20, 2004. The convertible senior notes were called under a provisional redemption based upon the market price of Gilead common stock exceeding certain thresholds. The aggregate principal amount outstanding of the notes was $345.0 million. The convertible senior notes were redeemable at a redemption price equal to 100% of the principal amount of the notes, plus a cash payment equal to accrued and unpaid interest to the redemption date and a cash make-whole payment equal to $60 per $1,000 principal value of the notes less interest actually paid or accrued and unpaid from the date of issuance of the notes to the redemption date. Interest on the convertible senior notes ceased to accrue on the redemption date, and the only remaining right of the holders thereafter was to receive the redemption payment, including accrued and unpaid interest to the redemption date and the make-whole payment. Alternatively, note holders could elect to convert their notes into shares of Gilead common stock at a price of $23.50 per share, or 42.55 shares of Gilead common stock per $1,000 principal amount of the notes. Holders of substantially all of the outstanding notes converted their notes into shares of Gilead common stock prior to the November 20, 2004 redemption date. As a result of these conversions, 14,676,952 shares of common stock were issued to these note holders. In connection with the redemption, we made aggregate make-whole payments of $7.4 million to note holders. Interest and Other Income, net We recorded interest and other income, net of $47.1 million in 2005, $18.9 million in 2004 and $13.0 million in 2003. The increases in 2005 and 2004 are primarily attributable to the higher cash balances over the previous year. Interest income in 2006 will depend principally upon prevailing interest rates and the level of our cash, cash equivalent and marketable securities balances. 41 Table of Contents Interest Expense We incurred interest expense of $0.4 million in 2005, compared with $7.3 million in 2004 and $21.9 million in 2003. The decrease in 2005 over 2004 is primarily attributable to the conversion of our $345.0 million 2% convertible senior notes into shares of our common stock in November 2004. The decrease in 2004 over 2003 is primarily due to the conversion of our $250.0 million 5% convertible subordinated notes into shares of our common stock in December 2003. We expect interest expense in 2006 to increase as a result of the interest we will be paying under the $300.0 million five-year term loan that we entered into in December 2005. Minority Interest in Joint Venture The minority interest reflects BMS’s interest in the operating results of our joint venture with BMS in the United States. The operations of the joint venture commenced in 2005 with activities primarily focusing on the the triple product and achieving bioequivalence with the various co-formulations. With the achievement of a successful formulation in the fourth quarter of 2005, we expect a significant increase in activities during 2006, especially if FDA and commercial approval is obtained. Provision for (Benefit from) Income Taxes Our provision for (benefit from) income taxes was $347.9 million, $207.1 million and ($95.5) million in 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively. The 2005 effective income tax rate of 29.9% differs from the U.S. federal statutory rate of 35% due generally to the recognition of previously unbenefitted net operating losses and tax credit carryforwards, certain earnings from operations in jurisdictions with lower tax rates than the United States and in jurisdictions for which no U.S. taxes have been provided because such earnings are planned to be reinvested indefinitely outside the United States and the benefit derived from the qualifying dividend made under the American Jobs Creation Act (AJCA), partially offset by state taxes. On October 22, 2004, the AJCA was signed into law. The AJCA allows for a deduction of 85% of certain qualified foreign earnings that are repatriated, as defined in the AJCA. We elected to apply this provision to qualifying earnings that were repatriated in 2005. The earnings repatriation resulted in a one-time tax provision benefit of approximately $25.1 million, which includes the reversal of the deferred tax liability previously accrued on unremitted foreign earnings of $13.1 million at December 31, 2004. The 2004 effective income tax rate of 31.5% differs from the U.S. federal statutory rate of 35% due generally to the recognition of previously unbenefitted net operating losses and tax credit carryforwards and certain earnings from operations in jurisdictions with lower tax rates than the United States and in jurisdictions for which no U.S. taxes have been provided because such earnings are planned to be reinvested indefinitely outside the United States, partially offset by state taxes. The tax benefit in 2003 includes the reversal of our valuation allowance against certain of our deferred tax assets. In December 2003, we concluded that it was more likely than not that we would realize a portion of the benefit related to our deferred tax assets. Accordingly, we reduced the valuation allowance against the assets and recorded a tax benefit of $111.6 million. The recognition of these deferred tax assets had no impact on our cash flows. Partially offsetting our recorded tax benefit was income tax expense associated with income earned by our foreign subsidiaries, foreign losses at lower tax rates and the non-tax deductibility of purchased in-process R&D. We had significant net operating loss carryforwards that were used to reduce our U.S. tax liability. Excluding the benefit relating to the reversal of our valuation allowance and the write off of purchased in-process R&D, our effective tax rate for 2003 was 5%. 42 Table of Contents Liquidity and Capital Resources The following table summarizes our cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities, our working capital, and our statements of cash flows (in thousands): 2005 2004 2003 As of December 31: Cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities $ 2,323,885 $ 1,254,038 $ 707,000 Working capital 2,636,870 1,596,241 1,080,003 Year Ended December 31: Cash provided by (used in): Operating activities 715,080 511,378 234,607 Investing activities (691,916 ) (490,828 ) (727,345 ) Financing activities 441,896 78,659 82,091 Cash, Cash Equivalents and Marketable securities Cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities totaled $2.32 billion at December 31, 2005, an increase of 85% from December 31, 2004. Cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities totaled $1.25 billion at December 31, 2004, an increase of 77% from December 31, 2003. The increase of $1.07 billion in 2005 and $547.0 million in 2004 was primarily due to: • net cash provided by operations of $715.1 million in 2005 and $511.4 million in 2004; • proceeds from the issuance of stock under employee stock plans of $143.3 million in 2005 and $78.8 million in 2004; and • proceeds from issuance of long-term debt of $300.0 million in 2005. These increases were partially offset by capital expenditures of $46.9 million in 2005 and $51.4 million in 2004. Working Capital Working capital at December 31, 2005 was $2.64 billion compared to $1.60 billion at December 31, 2004. Significant factors that resulted in an increase in 2005 working capital were: • $1.07 billion increase in cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities; • $24.9 million increase in accounts receivable primarily due to increased sales in 2005 partially offset by improved collection activity especially in certain European countries where collections have traditionally been slower; • $80.9 million increase in inventories to meet growing demand in our HIV products and in Hepsera as well as to meet Gilead Access Program requirements; • $31.8 million increase in deferred tax assets; and • $35.1 million increase in prepaids and other current assets primarily related to the current portion of our prepaid royalties to Emory for emtricitabine. These increases were partially offset by: • $87.0 million increase in income taxes payable primarily due to higher profitability partially offset by tax benefits from employee stock plans; • $60.0 million increase reflecting the current portion of the $300.0 million term loan that we entered into in December 2005; and 43 Table of Contents • $25.4 million increase in other accrued liabilities including increases in accruals related to Medicaid rebates, royalty expenses, sales and marketing expenses and rent expenses, partially offset by the decrease in the liability associated with the fair value of our forward currency contracts as the U.S. dollar strengthened against the Euro. Working capital at December 31, 2004 was $1.60 billion compared to $1.08 billion at December 31, 2003. Significant factors that resulted in an increase in 2004 working capital were: • $547.0 million increase in cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities; • $118.8 million increase in accounts receivable primarily due to increased sales of Viread in the United States and Europe and sales from our new product, Truvada, launched in the United States in the latter half of 2004; and • $37.9 million increase in inventories primarily due to an increase in the purchase of raw materials and the production of Viread and Truvada inventory to meet increasing sales demand. The increases in the 2004 working capital were partially offset by: • $144.5 million decrease in current deferred tax assets that was primarily due to the utilization of net operating losses and tax credit carryforwards to offset taxable income; and • $67.6 million increase in current liabilities including: • $15.0 million increase in Medicaid rebate obligations; • $14.4 million increase in deferred revenue primarily due to royalties received from Roche; • $12.9 million increase in the liability associated with the fair value of our forward currency contracts as the U.S. dollar continued to weaken against the Euro; and • $11.9 million increase in accounts payable primarily due to increases in our raw material purchases in support of Viread and Truvada sales growth. Cash Provided by Operating Activities Cash provided by operating activities was primarily driven by increases in our net income, which has been and is expected to continue to be our primary recurring source of cash. The increase in cash provided by operating activities during the year ended December 31, 2005 of $715.1 million is primarily attributed to our product sales growth, increased cash collections from customers as well as payments received related to the resolution of our dispute with Roche, partially offset by the $341.3 million of prepaid royalties that we made to Emory. Cash Used in Investing Activities Cash used in investing activities primarily related to purchases, sales and maturities of available-for-sale securities and capital expenditures. We used $691.9 million of cash for investing activities during 2005, compared to $490.8 million during 2004 and $727.3 million in 2003. Increases in cash used in investing activities were primarily due to increases in cash and cash equivalents balances year over year. Net cash used in investing activities for purchases of available-for-sale securities increased in 2005 to $644.0 million, compared to $439.5 million in 2004 and $190.2 million in 2003. Cash used in investing activities was higher in 2003 compared to 2004, due to the $375.5 million we paid for the acquisition of Triangle’s net assets and the $123.0 million paid for the purchase of our Foster City facilities. Capital expenditures made in 2005 related primarily to expanding certain aspects of our manufacturing capabilities as well as upgrading our facilities. Our capital expenditures in 2004 were primarily for facilities improvements, including approximately $26.0 million associated with the completion of our pilot plant in Foster City to be used to develop our drug processes and prepare materials to supply clinical trials, as well as additional spending for laboratory and manufacturing equipment to accommodate our growth. 44 Table of Contents Cash Provided by Financing Activities Cash provided by financing activities in 2005 primarily related to proceeds from our $300.0 million term loan as well as stock option exercises and stock purchases made under our employee stock plans. We also received $143.3 million, $78.8 million and $83.8 million in 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively, relating to stock option exercises and stock purchases under our employee stock purchase plan. We believe that our existing capital resources, supplemented by cash generated from our operations, will be adequate to satisfy our capital needs for the foreseeable future. Our future capital requirements will depend on many factors, including: • the commercial performance of our current and future products; • the progress and scope of our R&D efforts, including preclinical studies and clinical trials; • the cost, timing and outcome of regulatory reviews; • the expansion of our sales and marketing capabilities; • administrative expenses; • the possibility of acquiring manufacturing capabilities or additional office facilities; • the possibility of acquiring other companies or new products; • the establishment of additional collaborative relationships with other companies; and • defense costs associated with, settlements of and adverse results of litigation. We may in the future require additional funding, which could be in the form of proceeds from equity or debt financings, such as from our universal shelf registration statement filed in December 2004 for the potential issuance of up to $500.0 million of our securities. If such funding is required, we cannot assure that it will be available on favorable terms, if at all. In December 2005, we entered into an agreement with a syndicate of banks, to provide for a five-year $500.0 million senior credit facility. The $500.0 million facility comprised an uncollateralized $300.0 million term loan and an uncollateralized $200.0 million revolving credit facility. The proceeds from the term loan were used in December 2005 to facilitate a qualified intercompany cash dividend distribution of $280.0 million from Gilead Biopharmaceutics Ireland Corporation (GBIC), a wholly-owned Irish subsidiary of Gilead, to the U.S. parent company, Gilead Sciences, Inc., as part of the repatriation of our qualified foreign earnings under the provisions of the AJCA. Under the terms of the $300.0 million term loan, the minimum principal payments to be repaid at the end of each calendar quarter, beginning March 31, 2006, are $15.0 million. As of December 31, 2005, there were no amounts outstanding under the $200.0 million revolving credit facility. The capacity of the revolving credit facility will increase to a maximum of $500.0 million as the $300.0 million term loan is repaid. We have the ability to irrevocably cancel any unutilized portion of the revolving credit facility, in whole or in part. Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements We do not have any off-balance sheet arrangements that are currently material or reasonably likely to be material to our financial position or results of operations. Contractual Obligations Our contractual obligations consist of capital and operating leases, as well as purchase obligations primarily in the form of capital commitments, purchase obligations for active pharmaceutical ingredients and inventory-related items and clinical trials contracts. The following table summarizes our enforceable and legally binding obligations, future commitments and obligations related to all contracts that we are likely to continue regardless 45 Table of Contents of the fact that they are cancelable as of December 31, 2005. The following table summarizes these contractual obligations at December 31, 2005 (in thousands): Payments due by period Contractual Obligations Total Less than oneyear 1-3 years 3-5 years More than 5years Term loan(1) $ 300,000 $ 60,000 $ 120,000 $ 120,000 $ — Capital lease obligations 898 276 622 — — Operating lease obligations 99,113 17,318 31,081 19,923 30,791 Capital commitments(2) 4,596 4,596 — — — Purchase obligations(3) 367,082 126,569 240,513 — — Clinical trials(4) 90,878 45,294 41,697 3,887 — Total $ 862,567 $ 254,053 $ 433,913 $ 143,810 $ 30,791 (1) At December 31, 2005, we had long-term debt which consists of the $300 million, 5-year term loan that we entered into in the fourth quarter of 2005. (2) At December 31, 2005, we had firm capital project commitments of approximately $4.6 million relating to facilities improvement. In addition, we have budgeted significant capital expenditures for 2006, mainly due to anticipated increased infrastructure needs and higher R&D spending. We may have more capital spending in future years. (3) At December 31, 2005, we had firm commitments to purchase active pharmaceutical ingredients and inventory-related items. The amounts disclosed only represent minimum purchase requirements. Actual purchases are expected to significantly exceed these amounts. (4) At December 31, 2005, we had several clinical studies in various clinical trial phases. Our most significant clinical trial expenditures are to CROs. Although most of our contracts with CROs are cancelable, we generally have not cancelled such contracts. These amounts reflect commitments based on existing contracts and do not reflect any future modifications to existing contracts and anticipated or potential new contracts. Recent Accounting Pronouncements In December 2004, the FASB issued SFAS No. 123 (revised 2004), Share-Based Payment (SFAS 123R), which is a revision of SFAS 123. SFAS 123R supersedes Accounting Principles Board Opinion (APB) 25 and amends SFAS No. 95, Statement of Cash Flows. SFAS 123R requires all share-based payments to employees and directors, including grants of stock options, to be recognized in the income statement based on their fair values, beginning with the first quarterly period after June 15, 2005, with early adoption permitted. On April 14, 2005, the Securities and Exchange Commission adopted a new rule that amended the compliance date for SFAS 123R such that we are allowed to adopt the new standard effective January 1, 2006. The pro forma disclosures previously permitted under SFAS 123 no longer will be an alternative to financial statement recognition under SFAS 123R. We adopted SFAS 123R on January 1, 2006. Under SFAS 123R, we must determine the appropriate fair value model and related assumptions to be used for valuing share-based payments, the amortization method for compensation cost and the transition method to be used at the date of adoption. The transition methods include modified prospective and retroactive adoption methods. The modified prospective method requires that compensation expense be recorded for all unvested stock options and restricted stock at the beginning of the first quarter of adoption of SFAS 123R, while the retroactive methods would record compensation expense for all unvested stock options and restricted stock beginning with the first period restated. We have determined that we will adopt the modified prospective method and continue to use the Black-Scholes option valuation model. Based on our preliminary analysis, we expect that the adoption of SFAS 123R will have a material impact on our income statement and earnings per share. We currently estimate the impact to be approximately $0.15 to $0.17 per diluted share for 2006. SFAS 123R also requires the benefit of tax deductions in excess of recognized compensation cost to be reported in the statement of cash flows as a financing cash flow, rather than as an operating cash flow as required under current accounting literature. This requirement will reduce net operating cash flows and increase net financing cash flows in periods after adoption. 46 Table of Contents ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK Foreign Currency Exchange Risk Our operations include manufacturing and sales activities in the United States as well as sales activities in countries outside the United States, including Europe and Australia. As a result, our financial results could be significantly affected by factors such as changes in foreign currency exchange rates or weak economic conditions in the foreign markets in which we distribute our products. Our operating results are exposed to changes in exchange rates between the U.S. dollar and various foreign currencies, the most significant of which are the Euro, the British pound and the Australian dollar. When the U.S. dollar strengthens against these currencies, the relative value of sales made in the respective foreign currency decreases. Conversely, when the U.S. dollar weakens, the relative amounts of such sales increase. Overall, we are a net receiver of foreign currencies and, therefore, benefit from a weaker U.S. dollar and are adversely affected by a stronger U.S. dollar relative to those foreign currencies in which we transact significant amounts of business. We enter into foreign exchange forward contracts to mitigate the impact of changes in currency exchange rates on cash flows from our sales denominated in foreign currency, as well as foreign currency-denominated net monetary assets and liabilities. A significant percentage of our product sales are denominated in foreign currencies. Increases in the value of the U.S. dollar against these foreign currencies in the past have reduced, and in the future may reduce, our U.S. dollar return on these sales and negatively impact our financial condition. We use forward contracts to hedge a percentage of our forecasted international sales, primarily those denominated in the Euro currency. In recent years, foreign currency exchange fluctuations have both positively and negatively impacted product sales and gross margin; however, the full impact of the foreign currency fluctuations have been moderated by our hedge program. The following table summarizes the notional amounts, average currency exchange rates and fair values of our open foreign exchange forward contracts at December 31, 2005. All contracts have maturities of one year or less. Average rates are stated in terms of the amount of foreign currency per U.S. dollar. Fair values represent estimated settlement amounts at December 31, 2005 (notional amounts and fair values in U.S. dollars in thousands): Currency Notional Amount Average Rate Fair Value British Pound $ 65,028 0.5652 $ 1,366 Euro 656,841 0.8251 9,969 Australian Dollar 10,158 1.3791 (2 ) Total $ 732,027 $ 11,333 The total notional amount of $732.0 million and fair value of $11.3 million on our open foreign exchange forward contracts at December 31, 2005 compares with a total notional amount of $580.7 million and fair value of ($28.0) million on our open foreign exchange forward contracts at December 31, 2004. The significant increase in the notional amount of outstanding contracts from 2004 to 2005 is primarily attributed to the projected increase in product sales over the forecasted periods. Interest Rate Risk Our portfolio of available-for-sale investment securities and our variable-rate liabilities create an exposure to interest rate risk. With respect to the investment portfolio, we adhere to an investment policy that requires us to limit amounts invested in securities based on duration, industry group and investment type and issuer, except for securities issued by the U.S. government. The goals of our investment policy, in order of priority, are as follows: • Safety and preservation of principal and diversification of risk; 47 Table of Contents • Liquidity of investments sufficient to meet cash flow requirements; and • Competitive after-tax rate of return. The following table summarizes the expected maturities and average interest rates of our interest-generating assets and interest-bearing liabilities at December 31, 2005 (dollars in thousands): Years ending December 31, Total FairValue atDecember 31, 2005 2006 2007 2008 2009 2010 Thereafter Assets Available-for-sale securities $ 1,179,925 $ 377,123 $ 259,111 $ 90,838 $ 235,903 — $ 2,142,900 Average interest rate 3.8 % 3.9 % 4.0 % 3.9 % 4.3 % — Liabilities Long-term debt, including current portion(1) $ 60,000 $ 60,000 $ 60,000 $ 60,000 $ 60,000 — $ 300,000 Average interest rate 5.1 % 5.0 % 5.0 % 5.1 % 5.2 % — Other long-term obligations, including current portion(2) $ 17,594 $ 16,813 $ 14,890 $ 11,348 $ 8,575 $ 30,791 $ 100,011 Average interest rate 12.5 % 9.5 % 8.0 % — — — (1) Long-term debt consists of the $300.0 million, 5-year term loan that we entered into in the fourth quarter of 2005. The average interest rates are based on implied forward rates in the yield curve at the reporting date. Under the terms of the loan, the minimum principal amount to be repaid at the end of each calendar quarter, beginning March 31, 2006, is $15.0 million. Interest is accrued at a rate of LIBOR plus a tiered contractual rate of up to 62.5 basis points. We can prepay the term loan at any time in whole or in part, together with accrued interest on the prepaid principal, without penalty or premium. Any outstanding interest or principal at December 2010 is payable on demand. (2) Other long-term obligations consist of capital leases and operating leases (net of noncancelable subleases). The interest portion of payments due is included. International Credit Risk Our accounts receivable balance at December 31, 2005 was $396.1 million compared to $371.2 million at December 31, 2004. The growth in our accounts receivable balances was primarily due to higher product sales for Viread and Truvada in the United States and Europe. In certain countries where payments are typically slow, primarily Greece, Italy, Portugal and Spain, our accounts receivable balances are significant. In most cases, these slow payment practices reflect the pace at which governmental entities reimburse our customers. This, in turn, may increase the credit risk related to certain of our customers. Sales to customers in countries that tend to be relatively slow paying have in the past increased, and in the future may further increase, the average length of time that accounts receivable are outstanding. At December 31, 2005, our past due accounts receivable for Greece, Italy, Portugal and Spain totaled $156.9 million, of which $81.0 million was more than 120 days past due based on contractual terms of the receivables. To date, we have not experienced significant losses with respect to the collection of our accounts receivable and we believe that substantially all of our accounts receivable balances are collectible. We perform credit evaluations of our customers’ financial condition and generally have not required collateral.",2023-12-30 19:04:14.796848

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS The following Management’s Discussion and Analysis (MD&A) is intended to help the reader understand our results of operations and financial condition. MD&A is provided as a supplement to, and should be read in conjunction with, our audited Consolidated Financial Statements and the accompanying notes to the financial statements and other disclosures included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K (including the disclosures under “Item 1A. Risk Factors”). Our Consolidated Financial Statements have been prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles and are presented in U.S. dollars. Executive Summary We experienced another successful year in 2006 with the achievement of several significant financial and operating milestones. Driven by the continued growth of our sales of HIV products (Truvada, Viread, Atripla and Emtriva), total product sales reached $2.59 billion during 2006, a 43% increase over 2005. Coupled with a significant increase in royalty revenue for the year, total 2006 revenues increased to $3.03 billion. Sales from our HIV products of $2.13 billion represented a 52% increase over 2005 HIV product sales, primarily driven by the continued growth of Truvada, especially in Europe. Truvada product sales comprised more than half of our total 2006 HIV product sales. The launch of Atripla, the single tablet regimen of our Truvada with Bristol Myers Squibb Company’s (BMS) Sustiva (efavirenz), in the United States in July 2006 and its successful uptake during the latter half of the year further contributed to the higher HIV product sales in 2006 over 2005. Building on the momentum established by our joint venture with BMS, in September 2006, we established a three-way joint venture with BMS and Merck & Co., Inc. (Merck), to hold the European marketing authorization for Atripla. This joint venture filed for marketing authorization with the European Medicines Agency in October 2006, under the centralized licensing procedure. If and when the marketing authorization application is finalized and approved, the joint venture will hold one marketing authorization in all member states of the European Union. Discussions among the three companies regarding agreements for manufacturing, commercialization and distribution of Atripla in the European Union are ongoing. The sales increases generated by the strong performance of Truvada and Atripla in 2006 were partially offset by a decrease in sales of Viread in 2006 from 2005 due primarily to patients switching from a Viread-containing regimen to one containing Truvada and/or Atripla in countries where Truvada and/or Atripla are available. Despite facing continued strong competitive forces worldwide, sales of AmBisome increased slightly by one percent compared to 2005. As previously anticipated, the availability of several new treatment options to patients living with hepatitis B infection has helped the HBV market expand. Hepsera product sales for 2006 increased 24% from 2005 driven primarily by sales volume growth in Europe. In addition to growth in our product sales, royalty revenue increased significantly during the year. Of the $416.5 million in royalty revenue that we recognized, $364.6 million came from royalties on the sales of Tamiflu by F. Hoffmann-La Roche Ltd (together with Hoffmann-La Roche Inc., Roche). Tamiflu royalties increased from 2005 due to strong sales of Tamiflu by Roche, including sales of Tamiflu related to pandemic planning initiatives worldwide, as well as the elimination of the contractual cost of goods adjustment that was implemented in 2005. On January 1, 2006, we adopted the provisions of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 123 (revised 2004), Share-Based Payment (SFAS 123R) and began expensing the fair value of stock-based awards. As a result, stock-based compensation expense was a significant component of the increase in our operating costs and expenses for the year ended December 31, 2006 as compared to prior years. Further discussion regarding our adoption of SFAS 123R is included in “Critical Accounting Policies, Estimates and Judgments” below. Over the last few years, we focused on creating a solid foundation for long-term growth as highlighted by the strong performance of our anti-infectives in HIV, HBV and antifungals. Our strategy for building on this foundation continues to be through opportunities to acquire or in-license and partner with innovative 40 Table of Contents technologies or drug candidates and developing those technologies alongside our in-house initiatives. In 2006, we further implemented this strategy by completing two significant acquisitions to acquire additional innovative technologies and drug candidates. On August 11, 2006, we completed the acquisition of Corus Pharma, Inc. (Corus), a privately-held development stage biopharmaceutical company based in Seattle, Washington, focused on the development and commercialization of novel drugs for respiratory and infectious diseases, for an aggregate purchase price of $415.5 million. Corus had one product candidate in late-stage clinical development, aztreonam lysine for inhalation for the treatment of patients with cystic fibrosis who have pulmonary infection with Pseudomonas aeruginosa. On November 17, 2006, we completed the acquisition of all of the outstanding shares of common stock of Myogen, Inc. (Myogen), a publicly-held biopharmaceutical company based in Westminster, Colorado that focused on the discovery, development and commercialization of small molecule therapeutics for the treatment of cardiovascular disorders, for an aggregate purchase price of $2.44 billion. Myogen had two product candidates in late-stage clinical development: ambrisentan for the treatment of patients with pulmonary arterial hypertension and darusentan for the treatment of patients with resistant hypertension. We believe our acquisitions of Corus and Myogen will provide us with an opportunity to expand into the respiratory and cardiopulmonary therapeutic areas. In the clinic, we made considerable progress on compounds and drug candidates in-licensed from our collaboration partners. In HIV, during the first quarter of 2006, we dosed the first patients in a Phase 2 clinical study of our novel integrase inhibitor for HIV, GS 9137, which we licensed from Japan Tobacco Inc. (Japan Tobacco) in 2005. In February 2007, we announced completion of a Phase 2 clinical trial and announced that the clinical study met its primary endpoint of non-inferiority in viral load reduction in HIV-positive patients. In the hepatitis area, we completed enrollment of patients into our two pivotal Phase 3 clinical studies of tenofovir disoproxil fumarate for chronic hepatitis B in the second quarter of 2006, and our collaboration partner, Achillion Pharmaceuticals, Inc., began dosing HCV-infected patients in a Phase 1/2 viral dynamics clinical study of GS 9132, a small molecule inhibitor of HCV, in the fourth quarter of 2006. In February 2007, based on preliminary data from the study, the companies decided to discontinue development of GS 9132 for HCV infection. We filed an investigational new drug application with the FDA for GS 9190, a non-nucleoside HCV polymerase inhibitor, for the potential treatment of hepatitis C and began dosing infected patients in the Phase 1 clinical study for GS 9190 during the fourth quarter of 2006. We anticipate data from our GS 9190 program in the second quarter of 2007. Although we will continue to explore new opportunities where there is significant unmet medical need as part of our long-term growth strategy, our primary focus for 2007 will be to develop our current pipeline, including those drug and product candidates from our Corus and Myogen acquisitions. Our success in 2006, both commercially and from a research and development perspective, was the product of the strong global organization and infrastructure we built over the past several years. We will continue to invest in infrastructure to facilitate continued strong growth in 2007 and beyond. In 2005, we relocated our European commercial, medical and administrative headquarters from France to the United Kingdom, thereby uniting these functions with the regulatory, safety and information technology groups already headquartered in the United Kingdom. In 2006, we undertook a strategic re-alignment of our international commercial organization to better build, manage and expand our presence in new and existing markets. During the year, we also began assessing and addressing the way in which we distribute product to the markets we serve as well as enhancing our manufacturing capabilities. With the growth in demand for our products, the increased need for timely and adequate procurement of clinical materials and our focus on continuously looking at ways in which we can manufacture more efficiently and effectively, we completed the acquisition of Raylo Chemicals Inc. (Raylo), a wholly-owned subsidiary of Germany-based specialty chemicals company Degussa AG, in November 2006 for an aggregate purchase price of $133.3 million. Located in Edmonton, Alberta, Canada, Raylo’s operations encompassed custom manufacturing of active pharmaceutical ingredient (API) and advanced intermediates for the pharmaceutical and biopharmaceutical industries. We intend to utilize the Edmonton site for process research and scale-up of our clinical development candidates, for the manufacture of our API for both investigational and commercial products, and for our chemical development activities to improve existing commercial manufacturing processes. 41 Table of Contents The cost of funding corporate development opportunities, building infrastructure and meeting daily operating needs, continued to be an area of management’s focus in 2006. Although we generated operating cash flows of $1.22 billion during 2006, we continued to explore ways of accessing cash in order to fund our corporate initiatives. In April 2006, we took advantage of favorable market and corporate conditions to issue $1.30 billion principal amount of convertible senior notes. Concurrently, we repurchased $544.9 million of our common stock under our stock repurchase program, purchased convertible note hedges at a cost of $379.1 million and sold warrants for proceeds of $235.5 million. These transactions, along with our operating cash flows, helped to fund the significant cash outlays required during the year for the Myogen, Corus and Raylo acquisitions and the $201.0 million of payments made towards the principal on our term loan. As a result, our December 31, 2006 cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities balance was $1.39 billion. We currently anticipate that our current cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities, along with our revolving credit facility that we have not yet used, will be adequate to satisfy our capital needs for the foreseeable future. Our focus for 2007 will be to continue building our infrastructure, advancing our drug candidates through the clinic and accomplishing our operational goals of promoting our products’ safety and efficacy data to drive higher patient adoption. We also intend to continue building strong working relationships with our corporate partners, such as Roche, with respect to Tamiflu, BMS and Merck, with respect to Atripla, and GlaxoSmithKline, with respect to Hepsera. Due to the number of acquisitions made during 2006, significant energy will be invested in 2007 to ensure that we successfully integrate the people, processes and systems at our Edmonton, Seattle and Westminster sites. We will also expend significant resources preparing for the launch of ambrisentan in the United States as well as the filing of a new drug application (NDA) for aztreonam lysine for inhalation in the United States. Finally, we will continue to strengthen our global infrastructure to better support our growing employee and customer base, to better facilitate our expanding manufacturing, research, development and commercial activities, and to ensure that the activities undertaken by our employees continue to be executed within a framework of high integrity. Critical Accounting Policies, Estimates and Judgments The discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based on our Consolidated Financial Statements, which have been prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, and related disclosures. On an on-going basis, we evaluate our estimates, including those related to revenue recognition, allowance for doubtful accounts, inventories, prepaid royalties, clinical trial accruals, our tax provision and stock-based compensation. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other market-specific assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results, however, may differ significantly from these estimates. We believe the following critical accounting policies reflect the more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our Consolidated Financial Statements Revenue Recognition Product Sales We recognize revenues from product sales when there is persuasive evidence an arrangement exists, delivery to the customer has occurred, the price is fixed or determinable and collectibility is reasonably assured. We record estimated reductions to revenues for government rebates such as Medicaid reimbursements, customer incentives such as cash discounts for prompt payment, distributor fees and expected returns of expired products. These estimates are deducted from gross product sales at the time such revenues are recognized. Of these reductions from gross product sales, government rebates significantly impact our reported net product sales and are based upon certain estimates that require complex and significant management judgments. 42 Table of Contents Government Rebates We estimate amounts payable by us to government-managed Medicaid programs as well as to certain other qualifying federal and state government programs for the reimbursement of portions of the retail price of prescriptions filled that are covered by these programs. Government rebates that are invoiced directly to us are recorded in other accrued liabilities in our Consolidated Balance Sheets. For qualified programs that can purchase our products through wholesalers at a lower contractual government price, the wholesalers charge back to us the difference between their acquisition cost and the lower price, which we record as allowances against accounts receivable. We estimate these sales allowances based on contractual terms, historical utilization rates, any new information regarding changes in these programs’ regulations and guidelines that would impact the amount of the actual rebates, our expectations regarding future utilization rates for these programs, and channel inventory data as obtained from our major U.S. wholesalers in accordance with our inventory management agreements. During 2006, 2005 and 2004, $272.2 million, $184.8 million and $113.0 million, respectively, representing 9%, 9% and 8% of total gross product sales, respectively, were deducted from gross product sales for government rebates. Based on the current information available to us, actual government rebates claimed for these periods have varied by less than 3% from our estimates recorded in those periods. As of December 31, 2006 and 2005, we had accrued government rebates of $65.7 million and $63.4 million, respectively, in other accrued liabilities and an allowance of $10.6 million and $7.8 million, respectively, recorded against accounts receivable. The following table summarizes the aggregate activity in these accrued government rebates allowance and accrued liabilities accounts: Balance atBeginningof Year Chargedto Expense DeductedfromAccruals Balanceat End ofYear Year ended December 31, 2006: Government rebates allowances and accrued liabilities Activity related to 2006 sales $ — $ 246,274 $ 190,258 $ 56,016 Activity related to sales prior to 2006 71,220 (4,681 ) 46,193 20,346 Total $ 71,220 $ 241,593 $ 236,451 $ 76,362 Year ended December 31, 2005: Government rebates allowances and accrued liabilities Activity related to 2005 sales $ — $ 189,507 $ 124,371 $ 65,136 Activity related to sales prior to 2005 40,507 (2,470 ) 31,953 6,084 Total $ 40,507 $ 187,037 $ 156,324 $ 71,220 Contract Revenue Contract revenue for research and development (R&D) is recorded as performance occurs and the earnings process is completed based on the performance requirements of the contract. Nonrefundable contract fees for which no further performance obligations exist, and where there is no continuing involvement by us, are recognized when the payments are received or when collection is reasonably assured. Revenue from non-refundable up-front license fees and milestone payments where we continue to have involvement, such as through a development collaboration or an obligation to supply product, is recognized as performance occurs and our obligations are completed. In accordance with the specific terms of our obligations under these types of arrangements, revenues are recognized as the obligation is fulfilled or ratably over the development or manufacturing period. Revenues associated with substantive at-risk milestones are recognized based upon the achievement of the milestones as defined in the respective agreements. Advance payments received in excess of amounts earned are classified as deferred revenue. 43 Table of Contents Allowance for Doubtful Accounts We also maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments. This allowance is based on our analysis of several factors including, but not limited to, contractual payment terms, historical payment patterns of our customers and individual customer circumstances, an analysis of days sales outstanding by customer and geographic region and a review of the local economic environment and its potential impact on government funding and reimbursement practices. If the financial condition of our customers or the economic environment in which they operate were to deteriorate, resulting in an inability to make payments, additional allowances may be required. Our allowance for doubtful accounts balance as a percentage of total accounts receivable did not materially change from December 31, 2005 to December 31, 2006. We believe that the allowance for doubtful accounts is adequate to cover anticipated losses under current conditions; however, significant deterioration in any of the above factors, especially with respect to the government funding and reimbursement practices in the European market could materially change these expectations and result in an increase to our allowance for doubtful accounts. Inventories We record write-downs in the value of our inventory based on our review of bad batches experienced during the manufacturing process as well as quality control reviews of our inventory. We generally do not record inventory write-downs relating to estimated obsolescence or risk of competition primarily because the shelf life of our products is long. However, if our current assumptions about future production or inventory levels, demand or competition were to change or if actual market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management, additional inventory write-downs may be required, which could negatively impact our product gross margins and results of operations. Prepaid Royalties We capitalize royalties that we have prepaid at cost, specifically those related to the emtricitabine royalties we paid to Emory University (Emory) for the HIV indication, based on the present value of the future royalty obligation that we would expect to pay to Emory assuming certain expected future levels of our product sales incorporating the emtricitabine technology. The present value of our future royalty obligation was derived using our weighted average cost of capital. We review quarterly the expected future sales levels of our products and any indicators that might require a write-down in the net recoverable value of our asset or a change in the estimated life of the prepaid royalty. Some potential indicators of impairment include the launch of a significant product by a competitor, significant deviations in recognized product sales compared to forecast and product safety issues and recalls. We amortize our prepaid royalties based on an effective royalty rate that we derive from forecasted HIV product sales incorporating emtricitabine. Our product sales forecasts are prepared annually and determined using our best estimates of future activity considering such factors as historical and expected future patient usage or uptake of our products, the introduction of complimentary or combination therapies or products, and future product launch plans. If a previously unanticipated and significant change occurs to our sales forecasts, including the introduction of a competing product by us or one of our competitors into the same HIV market as emtricitabine, we would prospectively update the royalty rate used to amortize our prepaid royalties which may increase future royalty expense. As of December 31, 2006, we had a prepaid royalty asset relating to the emtricitabine royalties we paid to Emory of $321.0 million. Amortization expense relating to this prepaid royalty asset was $15.1 million and $6.2 million, for the years ended December 31, 2006 and 2005, respectively. Clinical Trial Accruals We record accruals for estimated clinical study costs. Most of our clinical studies are performed by third-party contract research organizations (CROs). These costs are a significant component of R&D expenses. During 2006, 2005 and 2004, we incurred CRO costs of $30.2 million, $21.1 million and $24.7 million, respectively. We 44 Table of Contents accrue costs for clinical studies performed by CROs on a straight-line basis over the service periods specified in the contracts and adjust our estimates, if required, based upon our on-going review of the level of effort and costs actually incurred by the CRO. We validate our accruals quarterly with our vendors and perform detailed reviews of the activities related to our significant contracts. Based upon the results of these validation processes, we assess the appropriateness of our accruals and make any adjustments we deem necessary to ensure that our expenses reflect the actual effort incurred by the CROs. Generally, a significant portion of the total clinical trial costs are associated with start up activities for the trial and patient enrollment. We extensively outsource our clinical trial activities and usually perform only a small portion of the start-up activities in-house. As a result, CROs typically perform most of the total start-up activities for our trials, including document preparation, site identification, screening and preparation, pre-study visits, training and program management. On a budgeted basis, these costs are typically 20% to 30% of the total contract value. On an actual basis, this percentage range is significantly wider as many of our contracts are either expanded or reduced in scope compared to the original budget, while start-up costs for the particular trial do not change significantly. Start-up costs usually occur within a few months after the contract has been executed and are milestone or event driven in nature. The remaining activities and related costs, such as patient monitoring and administration, generally occur ratably throughout the life of the individual contract or study. Most contracts are negotiated as fixed unit prices and can vary in length between six months for a single dose Phase 1 study and up to two years or more for a more complex Phase 3 study. The average length of contracts in 2006, 2005 and 2004 has been at the upper end of this range in order to provide long-term safety and efficacy data to support the commercial launches of Truvada, Viread, Atripla, Emtriva and Hepsera. All of our material CRO contracts are terminable by us upon written notice and Gilead is generally only liable for actual effort expended by the CRO at any point in time during the contract, regardless of payment status. Amounts paid in advance of services being performed will be refunded if a contract is terminated. Through December 31, 2006, differences between actual and estimated activity levels for any particular study were not significant enough to require a material adjustment. However, if management does not receive complete and accurate information from our vendors or has underestimated activity levels associated with a study at a given point in time, we would have to record additional and potentially significant R&D expenses in future periods. Tax Provision We estimate our income tax provision, including deferred tax assets and liabilities, based on significant management judgment. We evaluate the realization of all or a portion of our deferred tax assets on a quarterly basis. We record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets to the amounts that are more likely than not to be realized. We consider future taxable income, ongoing tax planning strategies and our historical financial performance in assessing the need for a valuation allowance. As part of the purchase of Myogen in the fourth quarter of 2006, we determined that it was more likely than not that certain of our acquired deferred tax assets related to state net operating loss carryforwards would not be realized and therefore established a valuation allowance of approximately $7.1 million. If we expect to realize deferred tax assets for which we have previously recorded a valuation allowance, we would reduce the valuation allowance in the period in which such determination is first made. Such an adjustment was made in the fourth quarter of 2005 when we determined that it was more likely than not that certain of our deferred tax assets would be realized, and therefore, we released the related valuation allowance. This resulted in an income tax benefit for 2005 of approximately $8.2 million. Our future effective income tax rate may be affected by such factors as changes in tax laws, regulations or rates, changing interpretation of existing laws or regulations, the impact of accounting for stock-based compensation, changes in our international organization, and changes in overall levels of income before tax. 45 Table of Contents Our income tax returns are routinely audited by the various state and foreign tax authorities. There are differing interpretations of tax laws and regulations, and as a result significant disputes may arise with these tax authorities involving issues of the timing and amount of deductions and allocations of income among various tax jurisdictions. We periodically evaluate our exposures associated with tax filing positions. While we believe our positions comply with applicable laws, we record liabilities based upon SFAS No. 5, Accounting for Contingencies. We do not believe any such items currently pending will have a material adverse effect on our Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, although an adverse resolution of one or more of these items in any quarterly reporting period covered by our Consolidated Financial Statements could have a material impact on the results of operations for that period. Stock-based Compensation In December 2004, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued SFAS 123R, which requires that all share-based payments to employees and directors, including grants of stock options, be recognized in the statement of operations based on their fair values. SFAS 123R supersedes Accounting Principles Board Opinion No. 25, Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees (APB 25) and amends SFAS No. 95, Statement of Cash Flows. On January 1, 2006, we adopted SFAS 123R using the modified prospective method of adoption as permitted under SFAS 123R, which requires that compensation expense be recorded for all nonvested stock options and other stock-based awards as of the beginning of the first quarter of adoption. In accordance with the modified prospective method, no prior period amounts have been restated to reflect the provisions of SFAS 123R. Prior to the adoption of SFAS 123R, in accordance with the provisions of SFAS 123, we elected to follow APB 25, and FASB Interpretation No. 44, Accounting for Certain Transactions Involving Stock Compensation—an Interpretation of APB Opinion No. 25, in accounting for our employee stock-based plans. Under APB 25, if the exercise price of our employee and director stock options was equal to or greater than the fair value of the underlying stock on the date of grant, no compensation expense was recognized. However, as required by SFAS 123, the pro forma impact of expensing the fair value of our stock options and employee stock purchase plan was disclosed in the notes to our Consolidated Financial Statements. In connection with our adoption of SFAS 123R, we refined our valuation assumptions and the methodologies used to derive those assumptions; however, we elected to continue using the Black-Scholes option valuation model. The fair value of stock options granted prior to the adoption of SFAS 123R was calculated using the multiple option approach while the fair value of stock options granted beginning January 1, 2006 was calculated using the single option approach. Concurrent with our adoption of SFAS 123R, we determined that a blend of historical volatility along with implied volatility for traded options on our stock would be a better measure of market conditions and expected volatility. Previously, we used historical stock price volatility as it was the most reliable source of volatility data. We estimate the weighted-average expected life of our stock options based on historical cancellation and exercise data related to our stock options as well as the contractual term and vesting terms of the awards. We record stock-based compensation expense using a graded vesting expense attribution approach for nonvested stock options granted prior to the adoption of SFAS 123R consistent with the expense attribution approach used in our historical SFAS 123 disclosures and using a straight-line expense attribution approach for stock options granted after the adoption of SFAS 123R. We currently believe that the straight-line expense attribution approach better reflects the level of service to be provided over the vesting period of our awards. Stock-based compensation expense related to stock options is recognized net of estimated forfeitures. We estimated forfeitures based on our historical experience. As a result of the adoption of SFAS 123R, we will only recognize a benefit from stock-based compensation in additional paid-in-capital (APIC) if an incremental tax benefit is realized after all other tax attributes currently available to us have been utilized. In addition, we have elected to account for the indirect benefits of stock-based compensation on the research tax credit and the extraterritorial income deduction through the Consolidated Statement of Operations rather than through APIC. 46 Table of Contents During the year ended December 31, 2006, we recognized stock-based compensation expense of $133.8 million in operating expenses, and we capitalized $2.4 million into inventory. As of December 31, 2006, we had unrecognized stock-based compensation of $273.7 million related to nonvested stock options, which we expect to expense over an estimated weighted-average period of two years. Senior management has discussed the development, selection and disclosure of these critical accounting policies with the Audit Committee of our Board of Directors, and the Audit Committee has reviewed the disclosure presented above relating to them. Results of Operations Total Revenues We had total revenues of $3.03 billion in 2006, $2.03 billion in 2005 and $1.32 billion in 2004. Included in total revenues are product sales, royalty revenue, and contract and other revenue. Product Sales Product sales for the last three years consisted of the following (in thousands): 2006 Change 2005 Change 2004 HIV products: Truvada $ 1,194,292 110 % $ 567,829 737 % $ 67,865 Viread 689,356 (11 )% 778,783 (1 )% 782,915 Atripla 205,729 — — — — Emtriva 36,393 (23 )% 47,486 (18 )% 57,600 Total HIV products sales 2,125,770 52 % 1,394,098 53 % 908,380 Hepsera 230,531 24 % 186,532 66 % 112,525 AmBisome 223,031 1 % 220,753 4 % 211,688 Other 8,865 12 % 7,916 (18 )% 9,631 Total product sales $ 2,588,197 43 % $ 1,809,299 46 % $ 1,242,224 Total product sales increased by 43% in 2006 compared to 2005, and 46% in 2005 compared to 2004, in each case, primarily due to an increase in the volume of sales of our HIV products. A significant percentage of our product sales continue to be denominated in foreign currencies. We use forward contracts to hedge a percentage of our forecasted international sales, primarily those denominated in Euro. This reduces, but does not eliminate, fluctuations in sales due to changes in foreign currency exchange rates. HIV Products Viread, Emtriva, Truvada and Atripla were approved for sale in the United States in October 2001, July 2003, August 2004 and July 2006, respectively. Viread, Emtriva and Truvada were approved for sale in the European Union in February 2002, October 2003 and February 2005, respectively. We are currently seeking approval of Atripla for sale in the European Union. HIV product sales increased by 52% compared to 2005, and 53% in 2005 compared to 2004, primarily driven by product volume growth. We experienced steady prescription gains for our HIV product portfolio throughout 2006. During 2006, the average selling prices of our HIV products increased compared to 2005, primarily driven by higher overall selling prices of our HIV products as well as the transition of some patients in the United States from coverage under Medicaid to Medicare Part D, which reduced the amount of Medicaid claims. As a result of 47 Table of Contents this transition, we estimated that assuming all patients dually eligible under Medicaid did in fact transition to Medicare Part D, the benefit to net product sales resulting from a reduction in Medicaid claims was approximately $38 million for 2006. • Truvada Truvada sales increased by 110% in 2006 compared to 2005, primarily driven by strong sales volume growth across the major geographic regions. Truvada sales accounted for 56% and 41% of our total HIV product sales for 2006 and 2005, respectively, reflecting its strong position as the NRTI backbone of choice in the United States, as well as rapid and significant uptake in key European territories during 2006. Truvada sales increased in the United States in 2005, the first full year of Truvada sales, primarily due to patients new to therapy and secondarily, from patients switching from other regimens, including those containing Viread and/or Emtriva. • Viread Viread sales decreased by 11% in 2006 compared to 2005, primarily due to patients switching from a Viread-containing regimen to one containing Truvada in countries where Truvada is available, partially offset by sales volume increases in Latin America. Viread sales in 2005 were relatively consistent with sales levels in 2004, resulting from the continued strong performance of Viread despite the offsetting impact of patients switching from a Viread-containing regimen to one containing Truvada in countries where Truvada is available. • Atripla Atripla sales were $205.7 million in 2006. Since we consolidate 100% of Atripla product sales as we are the primary beneficiary of our joint venture with BMS, these sales included approximately $76 million relating to Sustiva. Atripla was approved for sale in the United States in July 2006 and accounted for 10% of our 2006 HIV product sales since its launch through December 31, 2006. • Emtriva Emtriva sales decreased by 23% in 2006 compared to 2005 and by 18% in 2005 compared to 2004. The decreases in both years were primarily driven by the impact of patients switching from an Emtriva-containing regimen to one containing Truvada and/or Atripla in countries where these products are available. Hepsera Hepsera sales increased by 24% in 2006 compared to 2005 and by 66% in 2005 compared to 2004, primarily driven by sales volume growth in both Europe and the United States. Hepsera sales volume also increased with respect to our sales of Hepsera to GlaxoSmithKline Inc. (GSK). We sell Hepsera to GSK at our manufacturing cost in connection with GSK’s distribution activities in Asia. Royalties earned by us on sales of Hepsera by GSK are recorded as royalty revenue. AmBisome Sales of AmBisome increased one percent in 2006 compared to 2005, and increased by four percent in 2005 compared to 2004. The increases in both comparative periods were primarily due to increased sales in the United States. AmBisome product sales in the United States relate solely to our sales of AmBisome to Astellas Pharma Inc. (Astellas) which are recorded at our manufacturing cost. Royalties that we earn on sales of AmBisome by Astellas are discussed under “Royalty Revenue” below. In both comparative periods, although AmBisome sales volume increased in the European Union, lower pricing in most regions slightly reduced the related net product sales that we recognized. In 2007, we expect our total product sales on our marketed products to continue to grow as we continue to expand our sales and marketing efforts. 48 Table of Contents Royalty Revenue The following table summarizes the period over period changes in our royalty revenue (in thousands): 2006 Change 2005 Change 2004 Royalty revenue $ 416,526 112 % $ 196,873 210 % $ 63,444 Our most significant sources of royalty revenue for 2006, 2005 and 2004 were from sales of Tamiflu by Roche and sales of AmBisome in the United States by Astellas. Royalty revenue for 2006 was $416.5 million, an increase of 112% compared to 2005, primarily driven by the recognition of Tamiflu royalties from Roche of $364.6 million in 2006. The increase in Tamiflu royalties is due to the higher Tamiflu sales recorded by Roche, including sales related to pandemic planning initiatives worldwide, as well as the elimination of a contractual cost of goods adjustment resulting from the dispute resolution in November 2005 that had historically reduced the amount of Tamiflu royalties recognized by us. We recognize royalties on Tamiflu sales by Roche the quarter following the quarter in which it is sold. Royalty revenue for 2005 was $196.9 million, an increase of 210% compared to 2004, primarily driven by the amounts received in connection with the dispute resolution discussed below, the recognition of the higher royalties received from Roche for higher Tamiflu sales caused by the significant 2004/2005 flu season, particularly in Japan, as well as the fulfillment of orders for pandemic readiness supplies in certain countries in 2005. In November 2005, we resolved our dispute with Roche relating to our 1996 development and license agreement and agreed to terminate the related arbitration pending between Roche and us. Related to the dispute resolution, Roche also paid us $80.7 million that we recognized as royalty revenue in 2005, which consisted of $18.2 million relating to disputed royalties from 2001 to 2003, $11.8 million relating to the reimbursement of the 2004 contractual cost of goods adjustment that had previously reduced our earned royalties and $50.7 million relating to the updating of royalties payable to us for the first nine months of 2005 based on the 2005 then-current royalty rates instead of the prior year’s effective royalty rate. Royalty revenue earned by us from Roche, including the amounts recognized from the dispute resolution in 2005, were $161.6 million and $44.6 million for 2005 and 2004, respectively. Royalty revenue earned on sales of AmBisome by Astellas was $12.2 million for 2006, a seven percent decrease from 2005, and was at $13.0 million for each of 2005 and 2004. Contract and Other Revenue The following table summarizes the period over period changes in our contract and other revenue (in thousands): 2006 Change 2005 Change 2004 Contract and other revenue $ 21,416 (4 )% $ 22,228 17 % $ 18,953 Contract and other revenue was $21.4 million in 2006, a decrease of 4% compared to 2005. In 2006, contract and other revenue consisted primarily of net product distribution service revenue from sales of Flolan, a $5.0 million milestone payment we received from OSI Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (OSI) related to the first commercial sale of Macugen in the European Union, revenue earned from various contract manufacturing projects as well as the amortization of previously deferred milestone revenues. In 2005, contract and other revenue consisted primarily of a $7.0 million milestone payment earned from OSI, related to its first commercial sale of Macugen in the United States in 2005, revenue earned from various contract manufacturing projects as well as the amortization of previously deferred milestone revenues. 49 Table of Contents Cost of Goods Sold and Product Gross Margin The following table summarizes the period over period changes in our product sales (in thousands) and cost of goods sold (in thousands) and product gross margin: 2006 Change 2005 Change 2004 Total product sales $ 2,588,197 43 % $ 1,809,299 46 % $ 1,242,224 Cost of goods sold $ 433,320 66 % $ 260,326 56 % $ 166,587 Product gross margin 83% 86% 87% Our product gross margin for 2006 was 83%, compared to 86% for 2005. The lower gross margin was primarily due to the launch of Atripla in the United States, $15.8 million in write-downs of inventory for our Gilead Access Program to its estimated net realizable value, as well as product mix changes as patients continue to switch from Viread, a higher margin product, to Truvada and/or Atripla, partially offset by the lower effective royalty rate resulting from our July 2005 emtricitabine royalty buyout discussed below, lower API costs and the higher average selling prices of our HIV products in the United States. Atripla product sales decreased our product gross margin, without a corresponding impact to our product gross profit. As the primary beneficiary of our joint venture with BMS, we consolidate 100% of Atripla product sales but only benefit from the product gross margin on the Truvada portion of Atripla. The Sustiva portion of Atripla product sales carries a zero product gross profit since the joint venture purchases Sustiva API from BMS at BMS’s estimated net selling price of Sustiva in the U.S. market. Our product gross margin for 2005 was 86%, compared to 87% for 2004, primarily due to product mix changes as patients switched from Viread, a higher margin product, to Truvada. Prior to July 2005, we paid royalties to Emory on worldwide net sales of product containing emtrcitabine. In July 2005, we and Royalty Pharma purchased 65% and 35%, respectively, of the royalty interest owned by Emory in exchange for the elimination of the royalty obligation. As a result of the purchase, we capitalized $341.3 million in prepaid royalties, representing our 65% share of the $525.0 million purchase price. In the third quarter of 2005, we began to amortize this prepaid royalty to cost of goods sold over the remaining life of the underlying patent based on an effective royalty rate derived from our forecasted sales of products containing emtricitabine. We recorded royalties to Royalty Pharma based on actual emtricitabine net sales relative to Royalty Pharma’s 35% ownership interest in the underlying Emory royalty interest. We expect our product gross margin in 2007 to be lower, driven by the higher mix of Atripla product sales, which include the Sustiva portion at zero product gross profit, partially offset by gross margin improvements driven by lower API costs and the continued benefit associated with our prepaid emtricitabine royalties. Research and Development Expenses The following table summarizes the period over period changes in the major components of our R&D expenses over the last three years (in thousands): 2006 Change 2005 Change 2004 Research $ 85,202 52 % $ 55,918 27 % $ 43,872 Clinical development 238,270 34 % 178,015 21 % 146,983 Pharmaceutical development 60,389 38 % 43,791 34 % 32,697 Total research and development $ 383,861 38 % $ 277,724 24 % $ 223,552 R&D expenses consist primarily of personnel costs, including salaries, benefits and stock-based compensation, clinical studies performed by CROs, materials and supplies, licenses and fees and overhead allocations consisting of various support and facilities related costs. Our R&D activities are separated into three main categories: research, clinical development and pharmaceutical development. Research costs typically consist of preclinical and toxicology costs. Clinical development costs include costs for Phase 1, 2, 3 and 4 clinical trials. Pharmaceutical development expenses consist of costs for product formulation and chemical analysis. 50 Table of Contents R&D expenses in 2006 increased by $106.1 million compared to 2005, primarily due to increased compensation and benefits of $73.9 million due largely to higher headcount and which included stock-based compensation expense of $52.2 million from our adoption of SFAS 123R on January 1, 2006, as well as increased contract service and clinical study expenses of $50.1 million relating to clinical, product development and research activities in our HIV and hepatitis programs and our newly-acquired programs in the respiratory and cardiopulmonary areas. These higher expenses were partially offset by lower milestone payments made to Japan Tobacco in 2006 compared to 2005 related to the licensing and development of our lead integrase inhibitor candidate, GS 9137, as well as a $15.0 million payment to Emory in 2005 in connection with the amendment of our license agreement with Emory related to our obligation to develop emtricitabine for the hepatitis B indication. In general, significant collaboration payments, as seen in our payments to Japan Tobacco and Emory, during a period can cause our R&D expenses to fluctuate period over period. R&D expenses in 2005 increased by $54.2 million compared to 2004, primarily due to the $15.0 million payment made to Emory mentioned above, a $15.0 million payment made to Japan Tobacco related to the execution of our HIV integrase license agreement for GS 9137, increased compensation and benefits of $8.9 million from higher headcount and increased clinical and product development activities associated with our HIV and hepatitis programs. The payments made to Emory and Japan Tobacco were expensed as the underlying technologies were incomplete and had no alternative future use, and in the case of Emory, no significant R&D activities are expected in the next several years. In 2007, we expect R&D expenses to increase over 2006 levels reflecting increased spending on our internal and collaborative R&D efforts, as well as product licensing activity relating to our expectation that our product candidates will progress into more advanced clinical trials, especially in the respiratory and cardiopulmonary areas. Selling, General and Administrative Expenses The following table summarizes the period over period changes in our selling, general and administrative (SG&A) expenses over the last three years (in thousands): 2006 Change 2005 Change 2004 Selling, general and administrative $ 573,660 50 % $ 381,283 24 % $ 307,095 SG&A expenses for 2006 increased by $192.4 million compared to 2005. Higher expenses were primarily driven by higher headcount which increased compensation and benefits by $92.0 million including stock-based compensation expense of $70.8 million from our adoption of SFAS 123R on January 1, 2006, increased expenses of $54.3 million in contract services and promotional programs relating to our business growth, business development activities and activities to prepare us for the launch of Atripla and a $7.9 million write-off of certain capital assets related to renovations at our corporate headquarter campus. In addition, beginning in 2006, we began reporting net foreign exchange transaction gains or losses as well as fair value changes on derivative instruments not designated as hedges in interest and other income, net. These amounts, which were previously reported as SG&A expenses, were reclassified to enhance the comparability of our financial statements with those of other companies. Prior year amounts, although insignificant, have been reclassified to be consistent with the current year presentation. SG&A expenses for 2005 increased by $74.2 million compared to 2004. The increase was primarily due to an increase in compensation and benefits of $12.8 million due largely to higher headcount, an increase in market research, speaker’s programs and symposia costs of $9.2 million, $8.4 million of severance and relocation expenses associated with the relocation of our European commercial, medical and administrative headquarters from France to the United Kingdom, an increase in medical education costs of $5.6 million, an increase in journal advertising costs of $4.6 million, as well as costs related to a general expansion of our sales and marketing activities worldwide. These increases were partially offset by a decrease in bad debt expense of $5.7 million as a result of higher collections activity in certain European countries. 51 Table of Contents In 2007, we expect SG&A expenses to increase primarily due to higher costs to be incurred on administrative activities and sales and marketing efforts to support our business growth, as well as on the sales force expansion planned for the anticipated ambrisentan launch in the United States, higher costs related to our ongoing investment in our global commercial organization through additional hiring and promotional programs, as well as incremental operating expenses associated with our acquisitions of Corus and Myogen. Purchased In-process Research and Development In connection with our acquisitions of Myogen and Corus, we recorded purchased in-process research and development (IPR&D) expense of $2.06 billion and $335.6 million, respectively, for the year ended December 31, 2006. The purchased IPR&D expense for Myogen represented the estimated fair value of Myogen’s incomplete research and development programs that had not yet reached technological feasibility and had no alternative future use as of the acquisition date and, therefore, was expensed upon acquisition. A summary of these research and development programs as of the acquisition date is as follows: Program Description Status of Development EstimatedAcquisition DateFair Value(in millions) Ambrisentan An orally active, non-sulfonamide, propanoic acid-class, endothelin receptor antagonist (ERA) for the treatment of pulmonary arterial hypertension. Phase 3 clinical trials were completed prior to the acquisition date. We filed an NDA with the FDA in December 2006. In February 2007, the FDA granted us priority review status for the NDA for marketing approval of ambrisentan, and established a target review date of June 2007. $ 1,413.7 Darusentan An orally active ETA-selective ERA for the treatment of resistant hypertension. In Phase 3 clinical development as of the acquisition date and the date of this filing. $ 644.5 The estimated fair value of the purchased IPR&D was determined using the income approach, which discounts expected future cash flows to present value. We estimated the related future net cash flows using a present value risk-adjusted discount rate of 14%, which is a significant assumption and is based on the estimated internal rate of return for Myogen’s operations and is comparable to the estimated weighted average cost of capital for companies with Myogen’s profile. The projected cash flows from the ambrisentan and darusentan programs were based on key assumptions such as estimates of revenues and operating profits related to the programs considering their stages of development; the time and resources needed to complete the development and approval of the related products; the life of the potential commercialized products and associated risks, including the inherent difficulties and uncertainties in developing a drug compound such as obtaining FDA and other regulatory approvals; and risks related to the viability of and potential alternative treatments in any future target markets. For the purpose of estimating the fair value of the ambrisentan program, we estimated that the program was approximately 78% complete as of the acquisition date, based on estimated time and cost to complete, as Phase 3 clinical trials had been completed. Based on this assumption, we would incur future research and development costs of approximately $35 million to $45 million from the date of acquisition through and including the year when commercialization is expected to occur. Material net cash inflows are estimated to begin in 2009 for ambrisentan, assuming the necessary regulatory approvals would be received and the product would be successfully commercialized by that date. 52 Table of Contents For the purpose of estimating the fair value of the darusentan program, we estimated that the program was approximately 35% complete as of the acquisition date, based on estimated time and cost to complete, and remaining efforts would include the completion of Phase 3 clinical development as well as preparing for and filing an NDA with the FDA. Based on this assumption, we would incur future research and development costs of approximately $130 million to $140 million from the date of acquisition through and including the year when commercialization is expected to occur. Material net cash inflows are estimated to begin in 2012 for darusentan, assuming the necessary regulatory approvals would be received and the product would be successfully commercialized by that date. The remaining efforts for completing Myogen’s IPR&D programs primarily consist of clinical trials, the cost, length and success of which are extremely difficult to predict, and obtaining necessary regulatory approvals. Numerous risks and uncertainties exist that could prevent completion of development, including the ability to enroll patients in clinical trials, the possibility of unfavorable results of our clinical trials and the risk of failing to obtain FDA and other regulatory body approvals. Feedback from regulatory authorities or results from clinical trials might require modifications to or delays in later stage clinical trials or additional trials to be performed. We cannot be certain that either ambrisentan or darusentan, purchased from Myogen, will be approved in the United States or in countries outside of the United States or whether marketing approvals will have significant limitations on its use. Future discussions with regulatory agencies will determine the amount of data needed and timelines for review, which may differ materially from current projections. The acquired product candidates under development may never be successfully commercialized. As a result, we may make a strategic decision to discontinue development of these product candidates if, for example, we believe commercialization will be difficult relative to other opportunities in our pipeline. If these programs cannot be completed on a timely basis or at all, then our prospects for future revenue growth may be adversely impacted. No assurance can be given that the underlying assumptions used to forecast the above cash flows or the timely and successful completion of the projects will materialize as estimated. For these reasons, among others, actual results may vary significantly from estimated results. The purchased IPR&D expense for Corus represented the estimated fair value of Corus’s incomplete inhaled aztreonam lysine for cystic fibrosis research and development program that had not yet reached technological feasibility and had no alternative future use as of the acquisition date and, therefore, was expensed upon acquisition. A description of this program as of the acquisition date is as follows: Program Description Status of Development EstimatedAcquisition DateFair Value(in millions) Inhaled aztreonam lysine for cystic fibrosis Aztreonam formulation for inhalation to be used against Gram-negative bacteria that cause lung infections in patients with cystic fibrosis. In Phase 3 clinical trials as of the acquisition date and the date of this filing. $ 335.6 The estimated fair value of the purchased IPR&D was determined using the income approach, which discounts expected future cash flows to present value. We estimated the related future net cash flows using a present value risk-adjusted discount rate of 16%, which is a significant assumption and is based on the estimated internal rate of return for Corus’s operations and is comparable to the estimated weighted-average cost of capital for companies with Corus’s profile. The projected cash flows from the aztreonam lysine for inhalation program were based on key assumptions such as estimates of revenues and operating profits related to the program considering its stage of development; the time and resources needed to complete the development and approval of the related product; the life of the potential commercialized product and associated risks, including the inherent difficulties and uncertainties in developing a drug compound such as obtaining FDA and other regulatory approvals; and risks related to the viability of and potential alternative treatments in any future target markets. Corus’s two other early-stage candidates were not included in the valuation of purchased IPR&D because they were early-stage programs that did not have identifiable revenues and expenses associated with them. 53 Table of Contents For the purpose of estimating the fair value of the aztreonam program, we estimated that the program was approximately 71% complete as of the acquisition date, based on estimated time and cost to complete, and remaining efforts would include the completion of Phase 3 clinical development as well as preparing for and filing an NDA with the FDA. Based on this assumption, we would incur future research and development costs of approximately $30 million to $35 million from the date of acquisition through and including the year when commercialization is expected to occur. Material net cash inflows are estimated to begin in 2009 for the aztreonam program, assuming the necessary regulatory approvals would be received and the product would be successfully commercialized by that date. The remaining efforts for completing Corus’s IPR&D program primarily consist of clinical trials, the cost, length and success of which are extremely difficult to predict, and obtaining necessary regulatory approvals. Numerous risks and uncertainties exist that could prevent completion of development, including the ability to enroll patients in clinical trials, the possibility of unfavorable results of our clinical trials, and the risk of failing to obtain FDA and other regulatory body approvals. Feedback from regulatory authorities or results from clinical trials might require modifications to or delays in later stage clinical trials or additional trials to be performed. We cannot be certain that aztreonam lysine for cystic fibrosis, purchased from Corus, will be approved in the United States or countries outside of the United States or whether marketing approvals will have significant limitations on its use. Future discussions with regulatory agencies will determine the amount of data needed and timelines for review, which may differ materially from current projections. The acquired product candidate under development may never be successfully commercialized. As a result, we may make a strategic decision to discontinue development of this product candidate if, for example, we believe commercialization will be difficult relative to other opportunities in our pipeline. If this program cannot be completed on a timely basis or at all, then our prospects for future revenue growth may be adversely impacted. No assurance can be given that the underlying assumptions used to forecast the above cash flows or the timely and successful completion of the project will materialize as estimated. For these reasons, among others, actual results may vary significantly from estimated results. Gain on Warrant Pursuant to our March 2000 agreement with Eyetech Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (Eyetech), as predecessor to OSI, we received a warrant to purchase 791,667 shares of Eyetech series B convertible preferred stock, exercisable at a price of $6.00 per share. In January 2004, Eyetech completed an initial public offering of its common stock at which time we adjusted the fair value of the warrant resulting in a gain of $20.6 million. At that time, the fair value of the warrant was estimated using the Black-Scholes valuation model with a volatility rate of 50% and a discount rate of 2.8%. At the end of the first quarter of 2004, we exercised the warrant on a net basis using shares of Eyetech common stock as consideration for the exercise price and subsequently held 646,841 shares of Eyetech common stock. In the second quarter of 2004, we sold all of the Eyetech shares we owned and realized a gain of approximately $2.3 million, which is included in interest and other income, net, in 2004. Make-Whole Payment on Convertible Debt Redemption In October 2004, we called for the redemption of all our outstanding 2% convertible senior notes due December 15, 2007. The convertible senior notes were redeemed on November 20, 2004 under a provisional redemption based upon the market price of our common stock exceeding certain thresholds. The aggregate principal amount outstanding of the notes was $345.0 million. The convertible senior notes were redeemable at a redemption price equal to 100% of the principal amount of the notes, plus a cash payment equal to accrued and unpaid interest to the redemption date and a cash make-whole payment equal to $60 per $1,000 principal value of the notes less interest actually paid or accrued and unpaid from the date of issuance of the notes to the redemption date. Interest on the convertible senior notes ceased to accrue on the redemption date, and the only remaining right of the holders thereafter was to receive the redemption payment, including accrued and unpaid interest to the redemption date and the make-whole payment. Alternatively, note holders could elect to convert their notes into shares of our common stock at a price of $23.50 per share, or 42.55 shares of our common stock per $1,000 principal amount of the notes. Holders of substantially all of the outstanding notes converted their 54 Table of Contents notes into shares of our common stock prior to the November 20, 2004 redemption date. As a result of these conversions, 14,676,952 shares of common stock were issued to these note holders. In connection with the redemption, we made aggregate make-whole payments of $7.4 million to note holders as classified within our Consolidated Statement of Operations. Interest and Other Income, Net We recorded interest and other income, net, of $134.6 million, $49.2 million and $23.2 million in 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively. These amounts included the reclassification of net foreign exchange transaction gains or losses discussed above. The increases in 2006 and 2005 were primarily attributable to the higher average cash and investment balances over the prior years. Interest income in 2007 will depend principally upon prevailing interest rates and the level of our cash, cash equivalent and marketable securities balances. Interest Expense We incurred interest expense of $20.4 million in 2006, compared to $0.4 million in 2005 and $7.3 million in 2004. In April 2006, we issued $650.0 million principal amount of convertible senior notes due 2011 (2011 Notes) and $650.0 million principal amount of convertible senior notes due 2013 (2013 Notes) (collectively, the Notes) in a private placement pursuant to Rule 144A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended. The 2011 Notes and the 2013 Notes were issued at par and bear interest rates of 0.50% and 0.625%, respectively. Debt issuance costs of $23.8 million in connection with the issuance of the Notes were recorded in other noncurrent assets and are being amortized to interest expense on a straight-line basis over the contractual terms of the Notes. The increase in interest expense in 2006 over 2005 was primarily due to interest on our term loan which we entered into in December 2005 and the interest on our 2011 and 2013 Notes. The decrease in 2005 interest expense over 2004 was primarily attributable to the conversion of our $345.0 million 2% convertible senior notes into shares of our common stock in November 2004. We expect interest expense in 2007 to decrease as we continue to make payments towards our term loan. Minority Interest in Joint Venture The minority interest in joint venture on our Consolidated Financial Statements reflects BMS’s interest in the operating results of our joint venture with BMS in the United States. As the primary beneficiary of the joint venture as determined under Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) Interpretation No. 46, Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities, we consolidate the operations of the joint venture in our Consolidated Financial Statements. The operations of the joint venture commenced in 2005 with activities primarily focusing on the co-formulation of the once-daily single tablet regimen and achieving bioequivalence with the various co-formulations. We achieved bioequivalence on a formulation of the single tablet regimen at the end of 2005, and an NDA was filed in April 2006 for the single tablet regimen. In July 2006, we received approval from FDA for the single tablet regimen in the United States, which has been given the trade name Atripla. Provision for Income Taxes Our provision for income taxes was $551.8 million, $347.9 million and $207.1 million in 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively. Included in our operating income in 2006 were pre-tax charges of $335.6 million and $2.06 billion for purchased IPR&D expenses associated with our Corus and Myogen acquisitions, respectively. The 2006 effective tax rate of (86.5)% differs from the U.S. federal statutory rate of 35% primarily due to our federal tax non-deductible purchased IPR&D expenses and state taxes, offset by tax credits and certain operating earnings from non-U.S. subsidiaries that are considered indefinitely invested outside the United States. The 2005 effective tax rate of 29.9% differs from the U.S. federal statutory rate of 35% due generally to state taxes offset by the recognition of previously unbenefitted net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards, certain operating earnings from non-U.S. subsidiaries that are considered indefinitely invested outside the United States, and the one-time benefit for qualifying dividends under the American Jobs Creation Act (AJCA). 55 Table of Contents On October 22, 2004, the AJCA was signed into law. The AJCA allows for a deduction of 85% of certain qualified foreign earnings that are repatriated, as defined in the AJCA. We elected to apply this provision to qualifying earnings that were repatriated in 2005. The earnings repatriation resulted in a one-time tax provision benefit of approximately $25.1 million which we recognized in 2005. The 2004 effective income tax rate of 31.5% differs from the U.S. federal statutory rate of 35% due generally to the recognition of previously unbenefitted net operating losses and tax credit carryforwards and certain earnings from operations in jurisdictions with lower tax rates than the United States and in jurisdictions for which no U.S. taxes have been provided because such earnings are planned to be reinvested indefinitely outside the United States, partially offset by state taxes. In June 2006, the FASB issued FASB Interpretation No. 48, Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes (FIN 48), an interpretation of SFAS No. 109, Accounting for Income Taxes (SFAS 109). FIN 48 clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in an enterprise’s financial statements in accordance with SFAS 109 by prescribing a minimum recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. FIN 48 also provides guidance on derecognition, classification, interest and penalties, accounting in interim periods, disclosure, and transition. FIN 48 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2006. We have adopted FIN 48 as of January 1, 2007, as required. Our preliminary determination of the impact of adopting this standard is in the range of $10 million to $20 million, and the actual amount will be recorded as a charge to our accumulated deficit on our Consolidated Balance Sheet upon adoption of FIN 48. Liquidity and Capital Resources The following table summarizes our cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities, our working capital, and our cash flow activity as of the end of, and for each of, the last three years (in thousands): 2006 2005 2004 As of December 31: Cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities $ 1,389,566 $ 2,311,033 $ 1,250,624 Working capital 1,664,930 2,627,045 1,596,241 Year Ended December 31: Cash provided by (used in): Operating activities 1,218,059 705,642 507,964 Investing activities (1,739,334 ) (682,478 ) (487,414 ) Financing activities 649,261 441,896 78,659 Cash, Cash Equivalents and Marketable Securities Cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities totaled $1.39 billion at December 31, 2006, a decrease of 40% from December 31, 2005. The decrease of $921.5 million in 2006 was primarily due to: • net cash paid of $2.74 billion for the acquisitions of Myogen, Raylo and Corus; and • cash of $201.0 million paid toward the principal outstanding under our term loan. These decreases were partially offset by: • net cash provided by operations of $1.22 billion in 2006; • net proceeds of $587.6 million from the issuance of the Notes and related transactions in 2006; and • proceeds from issuance of stock under employee stock plans of $167.9 million in 2006. 56 Table of Contents Cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities totaled $2.31 billion at December 31, 2005, an increase of 85% from December 31, 2004. The increase of $1.06 billion in 2005 was primarily due to: • net cash provided by operations of $705.6 million in 2005; • proceeds from our $300.0 million term loan entered into in 2005; and • proceeds from issuance of stock under employee stock plans of $143.3 million in 2005. These increases were partially offset by capital expenditures of $46.9 million in 2005. Working Capital Working capital at December 31, 2006 was $1.66 billion compared to $2.63 billion at December 31, 2005. Significant factors that resulted in the decrease in 2006 working capital were: • $1.37 billion decrease in cash, cash equivalents and short-term marketable securities, primarily due to our need to fund significant acquisition activities in 2006, as well as a decrease in our marketable securities portfolio and a decrease resulting from the classification of certain of our marketable securities to long-term securities; and • $296.1 million increase in accounts payable primarily due to the launch of Atripla in July 2006 and the related purchases of Sustiva API from BMS at BMS’s approximate market value of Sustiva in order for the joint venture to build inventory levels to supply increasing Atripla demand. These working capital decreases were partially offset by: • $347.2 million increase in inventories primarily due to the increase in Atripla inventory which included Sustiva API at BMS’s approximate market value of Sustiva; and • $213.2 million increase in accounts receivable primarily due to increased sales in 2006 and the lower receivables collections in certain European countries where collections traditionally have been slower. Working capital at December 31, 2005 was $2.63 billion compared to $1.60 billion at December 31, 2004. Significant factors that resulted in an increase in 2005 working capital were: • $1.06 billion increase in cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities; • $80.9 million increase in inventories to meet growing demand in our HIV products and Hepsera as well as to meet our Gilead Access Program requirements; • $44.5 million increase in prepaids and other current assets primarily related to the current portion of our prepaid royalties to Emory for emtricitabine; • $31.8 million increase in deferred tax assets; and • $24.9 million increase in accounts receivable primarily due to increased sales in 2005, partially offset by higher collection activity especially in certain European countries where collections traditionally have been slower. These increases were partially offset by: • $87.0 million increase in income taxes payable primarily due to higher profitability, partially offset by tax benefits from employee stock plans; • $60.0 million increase reflecting the current portion of the $300.0 million term loan that we entered into in December 2005; and • $25.4 million increase in other accrued liabilities including increases in accruals related to Medicaid rebates, royalty expenses, sales and marketing expenses, partially offset by a decrease in the liability associated with the fair value of our forward currency contracts as the U.S. dollar strengthened against the Euro. 57 Table of Contents Cash Provided by Operating Activities Cash provided by operating activities of $1.22 billion in 2006 was comprised primarily of: • $1.19 billion in net loss which was adjusted for non-cash items such as our $2.39 billion purchased IPR&D expense, stock-based compensation expense of $133.8 million and $127.6 million of tax benefits related to employee stock plans, partially offset by $95.3 million of excess tax benefits from stock option exercises; and • $286.2 million of net cash outflow related to changes in operating assets and liabilities including: • $358.2 million of increased inventories, partially offset by $264.0 million of increased accounts payable, both of which related primarily to increases in Atripla inventory as mentioned above; and • $184.4 million of increased accounts receivable due to our product sales growth and lower receivables collections in certain European countries where collections have traditionally been slower. Cash provided by operating activities of $705.6 million in 2005 was comprised primarily of: • $813.9 million of net income which was adjusted for non-cash items such as $168.5 million of tax benefits from employee stock plans; and • $253.4 million of net cash outflow related to changes in operating assets and liabilities, which included $341.3 million of prepaid royalties that we made to Emory related to emtricitabine. Cash provided by operating activities of $508.0 million in 2004 was comprised primarily of: • $449.4 million of net income which was adjusted for non-cash items such as $151.6 million of deferred income taxes primarily resulting from the utilization of net operating losses and tax credit carryforwards to offset taxable income. This was partially offset by $126.3 million of net cash outflow related to changes in operating assets and liabilities, which included $118.8 million increase in accounts receivable primarily resulting from our product sales growth. Cash Used in Investing Activities Cash used in investing activities in 2006 primarily related to purchases, sales and maturities of available-for-sale securities, our acquisitions of Myogen, Raylo and Corus, as well as capital expenditures. Cash used in investing activities in 2005 and 2004 primarily related to purchases, sales and maturities of available-for-sale securities. We used $1.74 billion of cash for investing activities during 2006, compared to $682.5 million during 2005 and $487.4 million in 2004. The increase in cash used in investing activities for 2006 was primarily the result of our acquisitions of Myogen, Raylo and Corus for a total of $2.74 billion. In 2006, net cash of $1.11 billion was provided from the sales, maturities and purchases of available-for-sale securities, compared to net cash used of $634.5 million during 2005 and $436.0 million in 2004. During 2006, we used net cash in investing activities including capital expenditures of $105.2 million and $8.7 million that we invested in non-marketable securities issued by certain of our strategic partners. Capital expenditures made in 2006, 2005 and 2004 related primarily to expanding certain aspects of our manufacturing capabilities, upgrading our facilities, as well as additional spending on computer and laboratory equipment to accommodate our continued growth. In 2006, capital expenditures also included the purchase of two buildings that we previously leased at our Foster City, California headquarters. 58 Table of Contents Cash Provided by Financing Activities In April 2006, we issued $650.0 million principal amount of convertible senior notes due 2011 and $650.0 million principal amount of convertible senior notes due 2013 (collectively, the Notes) in a private placement pursuant to Rule 144A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended. Part of the net proceeds from the Notes’ issuances of $1.28 billion, after deducting the initial purchasers’ discount and the estimated offering expenses, were used to repurchase $544.9 million of our common stock. Concurrent with the issuance of the Notes, we purchased convertible note hedges in private transactions at a cost of $379.1 million. We also sold warrants to acquire 16.9 million shares of our common stock in private transactions and received net proceeds of $235.5 million. Taken together, the convertible note hedges and warrants are intended to reduce the potential dilution upon future conversions of the Notes by effectively increasing the initial conversion price of the Notes. In total, these transactions generated net proceeds of $587.6 million for us. Cash provided by financing activities in 2006 was $649.3 million, primarily resulting from the $587.6 million of net proceeds generated from the issuance of our Notes and related transactions mentioned above. In addition, we received proceeds from employee stock option exercises of $167.9 million, as well as $95.3 million of excess tax benefits from stock option exercises. These cash inflows were partially offset by $201.0 million paid towards principal on our term loan during 2006. Cash provided by financing activities in 2005 primarily related to proceeds from our $300.0 million term loan and $143.3 million from stock option exercises and stock purchases made under our employee stock plans. Cash provided by financing activities in 2004 primarily related to the $78.8 million proceeds from stock option exercises and stock purchases under our employee stock purchase plan. Other Information As of December 31, 2006, we had an uncollateralized revolving credit facility of $401.0 million of which there were no outstanding amounts. The capacity of the revolving credit facility will continue to increase to a maximum of $500.0 million commensurate with the repayments of principal under our term loan. We believe that our existing capital resources, supplemented by cash generated from our operations, will be adequate to satisfy our capital needs for the foreseeable future. Our future capital requirements will depend on many factors, including but not limited to the following: • the commercial performance of our current and future products; • the progress and scope of our R&D efforts, including preclinical studies and clinical trials; • the cost, timing and outcome of regulatory reviews; • the expansion of our sales and marketing capabilities; • administrative expenses; • the possibility of acquiring manufacturing capabilities or additional office facilities; • the possibility of acquiring other companies or new products; • the establishment of additional collaborative relationships with other companies; and • defense costs associated with, settlements of and adverse results of litigation and government investigations. We may in the future require additional funding, which could be in the form of proceeds from equity or debt financings. If such funding is required, we cannot assure that it will be available to us on favorable terms, if at all. Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements We do not have any off-balance sheet arrangements that are currently material or reasonably likely to be material to our financial position or results of operations. 59 Table of Contents Contractual Obligations Our contractual obligations consist of debt obligations, capital and operating leases, as well as purchase obligations primarily in the form of capital commitments, purchase obligations for active pharmaceutical ingredients and inventory-related items and clinical trials contracts. The following table summarizes our significant enforceable and legally binding obligations, future commitments and obligations related to all contracts that we are likely to continue regardless of the fact that they are cancelable as of December 31, 2006 (in thousands): Contractual Obligations Payments due by period Total Less than oneyear 1-3 years 3-5 years More than 5years Convertible senior notes(1)(6) $ 1,300,000 $ — $ — $ 650,000 $ 650,000 Term loan(2)(6) 99,000 18,364 27,140 53,496 — Capital lease obligations(6) 686 383 296 7 — Operating lease obligations 96,814 20,683 31,817 18,836 25,478 Capital commitments(3) 38,562 37,358 1,204 — — Purchase obligations(4)(7) 620,425 248,366 166,359 95,106 110,594 Clinical trials(5) 116,477 58,981 45,841 11,655 — Total $ 2,271,964 $ 384,135 $ 272,657 $ 829,100 $ 786,072 (1) At December 31, 2006, we had outstanding principal of $1.30 billion on the Notes that we issued in April 2006. (2) At December 31, 2006, we had outstanding principal of $99.0 million on the $300.0 million, five-year term loan that we entered into in December 2005. (3) At December 31, 2006, we had firm capital project commitments of approximately $38.6 million primarily relating to the expansion of certain aspects of our manufacturing capabilities and upgrading our facilities. (4) At December 31, 2006, we had firm commitments to purchase active pharmaceutical ingredients and inventory-related items. The amounts disclosed only represent minimum purchase requirements. Actual purchases are expected to significantly exceed these amounts. (5) At December 31, 2006, we had several clinical studies in various clinical trial phases. Our most significant clinical trial expenditures are to CROs. Although most of our contracts with CROs are cancelable, we generally have not cancelled such contracts. These amounts reflect commitments based on existing contracts and do not reflect any future modifications to existing contracts and anticipated or potential new contracts. (6) Excludes interest related payments on convertible senior notes, term loan and capital lease obligations. (7) In addition to the above, we have committed to make potential future milestone payments to third-parties as part of licensing and development programs. Payments under these agreements generally become due and payable only upon achievement of certain developmental, regulatory and/or commercial milestones. Because the achievement of these milestones is neither probable nor reasonably estimable, such contingencies have not been recorded on our consolidated balance sheet and have not been included in the table above. Recent Accounting Pronouncements In June 2006, the FASB issued FASB Interpretation No. 48, Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes (FIN 48), an interpretation of SFAS No. 109, Accounting for Income Taxes (SFAS 109). FIN 48 clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in an enterprise’s financial statements in accordance with SFAS 109 by prescribing a minimum recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. FIN 48 also provides guidance on derecognition, classification, interest and penalties, accounting in interim periods, disclosure, and transition. FIN 48 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2006. We have adopted FIN 48 as of January 1, 2007, as required. Our preliminary determination of the impact of adopting this standard is in the range of $10 million to $20 million, and the actual amount will be recorded as a charge to our accumulated deficit on our Consolidated Balance Sheet upon adoption of FIN 48. 60 Table of Contents ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK Foreign Currency Exchange Risk Our operations include manufacturing and sales activities in the United States, Canada and Ireland as well as sales activities in countries outside the United States, including Europe and Australia. As a result, our financial results could be significantly affected by factors such as changes in foreign currency exchange rates or weak economic conditions in the foreign markets in which we distribute our products. Our operating results are exposed to changes in exchange rates between the U.S. dollar and various foreign currencies, the most significant of which are the Euro, the British pound and the Australian dollar. When the U.S. dollar strengthens against these currencies, the relative value of sales made in the respective foreign currency decreases. Conversely, when the U.S. dollar weakens, the relative amounts of such sales increase. Overall, we are a net receiver of foreign currencies and, therefore, benefit from a weaker U.S. dollar and are adversely affected by a stronger U.S. dollar relative to those foreign currencies in which we transact significant amounts of business. We enter into foreign exchange forward contracts to mitigate the impact of changes in currency exchange rates on cash flows from our sales denominated in foreign currency, as well as foreign currency-denominated net monetary assets and liabilities. A significant percentage of our product sales are denominated in foreign currencies. Increases in the value of the U.S. dollar against these foreign currencies in the past have reduced, and may in the future reduce our U.S. dollar return on these sales and negatively impact our financial condition. We use forward contracts to hedge a percentage of our forecasted international sales, primarily those denominated in the Euro currency. In recent years, foreign currency exchange fluctuations have both positively and negatively impacted product sales and gross margin; however, the full impact of the foreign currency fluctuations have been moderated by our hedge program. The following table summarizes the notional amounts, average currency exchange rates and fair values of our open foreign exchange forward contracts at December 31, 2006.

Interest Rate Risk Our portfolio of available-for-sale marketable securities and our fixed and variable-rate liabilities create an exposure to interest rate risk. With respect to our investment portfolio, we adhere to an investment policy that requires us to limit amounts invested in securities based on duration, industry group and investment type and issuer, except for securities issued by the U.S. government. The goals of our investment policy, in order of priority, are as follows: • Safety and preservation of principal and diversification of risk; • Liquidity of investments sufficient to meet cash flow requirements; and • Competitive after-tax rate of return. 61 Table of Contents The following table summarizes the expected maturities and average interest rates of our interest-generating assets and interest-bearing liabilities at December 31, 2006 (dollars in thousands): Years ending December 31, Thereafter Total FairValue atDecember 31,2006 2007 2008 2009 2010 2011 Assets Available-for-sale debt securities $ 511,696 $ 120,725 $ 122,289 $ 101,912 $ 56,933 $ — $ 913,555 Average interest rate 4.9% 4.9% 4.8% 4.6% 4.8% — Liabilities Convertible senior notes(1) $ — $ — $ — $ — $ 650,000 $ 650,000 $ 1,300,000 Average interest rate — — — — 0.5% 0.6% Term loan, including current portion(2) $ 18,364 $ 14,957 $ 12,183 $ 53,496 $ — $ — $ 99,000 Average interest rate 5.8% 5.5% 5.5% 5.6% — — Capital lease obligations, including current portion $ 383 $ 220 $ 76 $ 7 $ — $ — $ 686 Average interest rate 8.1% 8.1% 8.2% 9.0% — — (1) In April 2006, we issued $650.0 million principal amount of convertible senior notes due 2011 (2011 Notes) and $650.0 million principal amount of convertible senior notes due 2013 (2013 Notes) in a private placement pursuant to Rule 144A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended. The 2011 Notes and 2013 Notes were issued at par and bear interest rates of 0.50% and 0.625%, respectively, and may be converted subject to certain circumstances. (2) In December 2005, we entered into a $300.0 million, five-year term loan. The average interest rates are based on implied three-month LIBOR forward rates in the yield curve at December 31, 2006. We have an option to choose borrowing maturity based on a one, two, three or six-month LIBOR. Under the terms of the loan, the minimum principal amount to be repaid at the end of each calendar quarter, beginning March 31, 2006, is five percent of the outstanding amount. Interest is accrued at a rate of LIBOR plus a tiered contractual rate of up to 62.5 basis points. We can prepay the term loan at any time in whole or in part, together with accrued interest on the prepaid principal, without penalty or premium. During the year ended December 31, 2006, $201.0 million of the term loan principal was repaid. Any outstanding interest or principal at December 2010 is payable on demand. International Credit Risk Our accounts receivable balance at December 31, 2006 was $609.3 million, compared to $396.1 million at December 31, 2005. The growth in our accounts receivable balances was primarily due to higher product sales of our HIV products in the United States and Europe. In certain countries where payments are typically slow, primarily Greece, Italy, Portugal and Spain, our aggregated accounts receivable balance was significant. In most cases, these slow payment practices reflect the pace at which governmental entities reimburse our customers. This, in turn, may increase the credit risk related to certain of our customers. Sales to customers in countries that tend to be relatively slow-paying have in the past increased, and in the future may further increase, the average length of time that accounts receivable are outstanding. At December 31, 2006, our past due accounts receivable for Greece, Italy, Portugal and Spain totaled $234.3 million, of which $124.5 million was more than 120 days past due based on contractual terms of the receivables. To date, we have not experienced significant losses with respect to the collection of our accounts receivable, and we believe that substantially all of our accounts receivable balances are collectible. We perform credit evaluations of our customers’ financial condition and generally have not required collateral. 62 Table of Contents",2023-12-30 19:04:14.191458

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS The following Management’s Discussion and Analysis (MD&A) is intended to help the reader understand our results of operations and financial condition. MD&A is provided as a supplement to, and should be read in conjunction with, our audited Consolidated Financial Statements and the accompanying notes to the financial statements and other disclosures included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K (including the disclosures under “Item 1A. Risk Factors”). Our Consolidated Financial Statements have been prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles and are presented in U.S. dollars. Executive Summary This past year marked the 20th anniversary of the founding of Gilead and the achievement of many important milestones as we continued to discover, develop and commercialize innovative therapeutics in areas of unmet medical need. We grew our product sales significantly, we executed on several product approvals and launches in multiple territories, in-licensed new compounds into our research pipeline as well as made progress on product candidates already in the clinic, integrated multiple sites that were acquired in 2006 and continued to strengthen our worldwide organization and infrastructure. Our operating results for 2007 were led by product sales of $3.73 billion. HIV product sales (Truvada, Atripla, Viread and Emtriva) of $3.14 billion, which increased by 48% in 2007 over 2006, were the key driver for total product sales growth of 44% in 2007 compared to 2006. Total product sales of Truvada increased by $394.9 million (or 33%) in 2007 when compared to the prior year, despite the availability of Atripla in the United States since July 2006. Atripla product sales in 2007 increased by $697.7 million from 2006. Together, Truvada and Atripla sales comprised 67% of our total product sales in 2007. In addition to the commercial progress and success of Atripla in the United States, we and our partner, Bristol-Myers Squibb Company (BMS), expanded our Atripla collaboration to include the 27 countries that comprise the European Union, as well as Norway and Iceland. In December 2007, we received approval from the European Commission to market and sell Atripla in these European territories. We have already begun shipping Atripla to Germany, the United Kingdom and Austria, and expect to launch the product throughout the remainder of the European Union, as pricing and other sales and marketing matters are finalized and approved. If Atripla continues to comprise a larger proportion of our total product sales, we expect our product gross margin will continue to decrease. This decrease results from the inclusion of BMS’s Sustiva (efavirenz), which carries zero gross margin, in product sales and cost of goods for Atripla. Our 2007 product gross margin decreased to 79% due to the higher percentage of Atripla in our mix of product sales as compared to 2006. Hepsera product sales for 2007 increased 31% from 2006 driven primarily by sales volume growth across most major geographical regions as well as a favorable foreign currency exchange environment. AmBisome product sales for 2007 increased 18% from 2006 driven primarily by sales volume growth in Europe as well as the impact of a favorable foreign currency exchange environment. Due to the depreciation of the U.S. dollar against major European currencies in 2007, foreign currency denominated product sales experienced a net benefit from the foreign currency fluctuations after considering the impact of our hedging activities. This resulted in foreign currency having a favorable impact of approximately $71.2 million on pre-tax income in 2007 compared to 2006. In addition to the growth in our product sales, royalty revenues increased by 12% in 2007 compared to 2006. Of the $468.2 million in royalty revenues that we recognized, $414.5 million were recorded from royalties on the sales of Tamiflu by F. Hoffmann-La Roche Ltd (together with Hoffmann-La Roche Inc., Roche). Strong sales of Tamiflu by Roche, including sales of Tamiflu related to worldwide pandemic planning initiatives, contributed to the increase in our royalty revenues. Despite the higher royalties recognized in 2007, Roche recently announced that they expect to see a marked decline in Tamiflu sales related to pandemic planning. We expect this decline to significantly reduce the royalties we receive from the sale of Tamiflu which will adversely impact our 2008 financial results. 45 Table of Contents In June 2007, Letairis (ambrisentan), a product acquired in our 2006 acquisition of Myogen Inc. (Myogen), was approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the treatment of pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH). In October 2007, we filed a supplemental new drug application (NDA) with the FDA, as well as a Type II variation with the European Medicines Evaluation Agency (EMEA), for the marketing approval of Viread for the treatment of chronic hepatitis B in adults. Additionally, in November 2007, we submitted an NDA with the FDA for marketing approval of aztreonam lysine for inhalation for the treatment of pulmonary Pseudomonas aeruginosa (P. aeruginosa) infection in people with cystic fibrosis (CF). Along with the regulatory filings made in relation to Viread for hepatitis B and aztreonam lysine for inhalation for CF, we progressed the development of other compounds and drug candidates in-licensed from our collaboration partners, including: • In the HIV area, we completed a Phase 2 clinical trial of elvitegravir (GS 9137), our novel integrase inhibitor for HIV which we licensed from Japan Tobacco Inc. in 2005. Integrase inhibitors represent a new way of attacking HIV and a potential treatment alternative for patients who have developed resistance to existing classes of therapy. Pending a positive outcome of our discussions with the FDA and the EMEA concerning the design of the Phase 3 program, we anticipate dosing patients in a Phase 3 clinical study for elvitegravir in 2008. • In the hepatitis B area, we filed a supplemental NDA with the FDA, as well as a Type II variation with the EMEA, for the marketing approval of Viread for the treatment of chronic hepatitis B in adults. These applications were based on data we obtained from two key pivotal Phase 3 studies completed during the year. We anticipate decisions from the EMEA and the FDA in the second and third quarters of 2008, respectively. • In the hepatitis C area, we presented preliminary data in November 2007 on our lead compound against the hepatitis C virus, GS 9190, a non-nucleoside polymerase inhibitor. After investigating QT prolongations at certain doses, pending the FDA’s consent, we plan to reinitiate our Phase 1a/b study of GS 9190 to further define the efficacy and safety of the compound. During the year, we also entered into an exclusive license agreement with LG Life Sciences, Ltd. (LGLS) to develop and commercialize certain caspase inhibitors for the treatment of fibrotic diseases. Caspase inhibitors are showing potential as treatments for chronic hepatitis C and other diseases characterized by tissue scarring (fibrosis). The agreement granted us commercialization rights to LGLS’s investigational caspase inhibitors, including GS 9450 which is being evaluated in an ongoing Phase 2a clinical trial as a potential treatment for chronic hepatitis C and for which we anticipate data by the end of 2008. Related to this collaboration, we paid a $20.0 million up-front license fee that we recorded in research and development (R&D) expenses. • In the cardiovascular area, we plan to continue to enroll our two Phase 3 clinical studies for darusentan for the treatment of resistant hypertension and we expect to complete enrollment in 2009. In addition, Letairis for PAH was approved in the United States in June, and our partner GlaxoSmithKline Inc. (GSK), who has rights to ambrisentan in territories outside of the United States, received a positive opinion from the European Committee for Human Medicinal Products for the treatment of PAH in February 2008. If approved, GSK will market ambrisentan under the name Volibris. • In the respiratory area, we presented data from the second of the two pivotal studies of aztreonam lysine for inhalation, our inhaled antibiotic for the treatment of patients with CF who have pulmonary infection with P. aeruginosa. Along with the NDA we filed with the FDA in November 2007, we plan to submit a marketing authorization application to the EMEA in the second quarter of 2008. Also in the respiratory area, we completed a Phase 1a study in healthy volunteers for GS 9310/11, a proprietary formulation of the combination of tobramycin and fosfomycin for inhalation, and have begun enrolling patients in two Phase 1b clinical studies. Additionally, in August 2007, we entered into a research collaboration and license agreement with Parion Sciences, Inc. (Parion) to research, develop and commercialize certain epithelial sodium channel inhibitors for the treatment of pulmonary diseases. In connection with this collaboration, we paid a $5.0 million up-front license fee which we recorded as R&D expense and made a $5.0 million investment in Parion. 46 Table of Contents Taken together, these programs contributed to the increase in R&D expenses in 2007 as compared to 2006, and we expect research and clinical activity in these areas will continue to increase R&D expenses in 2008. In addition to our commercial and clinical efforts, we continued to expand our worldwide organization and infrastructure. In 2007, we integrated the sites acquired in our 2006 acquisitions of Corus Pharma, Inc. (Corus), Myogen and Raylo Chemicals Inc. In September 2007, we acquired and integrated Nycomed Limited, a Cork, Ireland based manufacturing and tableting operation. We transferred certain of our existing Dublin operations to this Nycomed facility in Cork and utilize this Cork facility for solid dose tablet manufacturing of certain of our antiviral products and product packaging activities. As part of our strategy to better build, manage and expand our presence in new and existing markets internationally, we established new subsidiaries in Turkey, Austria and Switzerland in 2007, and are in the process of establishing marketing subsidiaries in Belgium, Denmark, Finland, the Netherlands, Norway and Sweden. These initiatives, which we believe will help reduce our reliance on third-party distributors, have also contributed to the increase in our selling, general and administrative (SG&A) expenses in 2007 as we continue to increase headcount and expand our marketing and promotional activities in these countries. We will continue to see an increase in SG&A expenses in 2008 as we continue to expand internationally and launch products in new territories, including Atripla in the European territories. Our strong operating results which contributed to operating cash flows of $1.77 billion for 2007, helped fund our R&D activities, our corporate development opportunities, our worldwide infrastructure and capital requirements as well as our daily operating needs. Additionally, our strong cash position allowed us to repurchase $487.5 million of our common stock in 2007. These repurchases completed the $1 billion stock repurchase program initiated in 2006 and allowed us to initiate a $3 billion stock repurchase program in October 2007. In addition, we entered into an amended and restated credit agreement under which our credit facility was increased to $1.25 billion, thereby providing greater access to funds as future requirements arise. In 2008, we plan to further expand our international footprint, advance additional drug candidates into the clinic and launch Viread for hepatitis B and aztreonam lysine for inhalation for CF, if they are approved. Strengthening our relationships with our corporate partners continues to be a priority, especially as we and BMS continue to launch Atripla in the European territories. Finally, we plan to continue to strengthen our worldwide infrastructure to better support our growing employee and customer base, as well as to better facilitate our expanding manufacturing, research and development and commercial activities. Critical Accounting Policies, Estimates and Judgments The discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based on our Consolidated Financial Statements, which have been prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses and related disclosures. On an on-going basis, we evaluate our estimates, including those related to revenue recognition, allowance for doubtful accounts, inventories, prepaid royalties, clinical trial accruals, our tax provision and stock-based compensation. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other market-specific assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results, however, may differ significantly from these estimates. We believe the following critical accounting policies reflect the more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our Consolidated Financial Statements. 47 Table of Contents Revenue Recognition Product Sales We recognize revenues from product sales when there is persuasive evidence an arrangement exists, delivery to the customer has occurred, the price is fixed or determinable and collectibility is reasonably assured. We record estimated reductions to revenues for government rebates such as Medicaid reimbursements, customer incentives such as cash discounts for prompt payment, distributor fees and expected returns of expired products. These estimates are deducted from gross product sales at the time such revenues are recognized. Of these reductions from gross product sales, government rebates significantly impact our reported net product sales and are based upon certain estimates that require complex and significant judgment of management. Government Rebates We estimate amounts payable by us to government-managed Medicaid programs as well as to certain other qualifying federal, state and foreign government programs for the reimbursement of portions of the retail price of prescriptions filled that are covered by these programs. Government rebates that are invoiced directly to us are recorded in other accrued liabilities on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. For qualified programs that can purchase our products through wholesalers at a lower contractual government price, the wholesalers charge back to us the difference between their acquisition cost and the lower price, which we record as allowances against accounts receivable. We estimate these sales allowances based on contractual terms, historical utilization rates, any new information regarding changes in these programs’ regulations and guidelines that would impact the amount of the actual rebates, our expectations regarding future utilization rates for these programs and, for U.S. product sales, the channel inventory data as obtained from our major U.S. wholesalers in accordance with our inventory management agreements. During 2007, 2006 and 2005, government rebates of $464.4 million, $272.2 million and $184.8 million, respectively, representing 12%, 9% and 9% of total gross product sales, respectively, were deducted from gross product sales. Based on the current information available to us, actual government rebates claimed for these periods have varied by less than 3% from our estimates recorded in those periods. As of December 31, 2007 and 2006, we had accrued government rebates of $115.5 million and $65.7 million, respectively, in other accrued liabilities and an allowance of $25.3 million and $10.6 million, respectively, recorded against accounts receivable. The following table summarizes the aggregate activity in these accrued government rebates allowance and accrued liabilities accounts: Balance atBeginningof Year Chargedto Expense DeductedfromAccruals Balance atEnd ofYear Year ended December 31, 2007: Government rebates allowances and accrued liabilities Activity related to 2007 sales $ — $ 439,562 $ 310,272 $ 129,290 Activity related to sales prior to 2007 76,362 (2,753 ) 62,134 11,475 Total $ 76,362 $ 436,809 $ 372,406 $ 140,765 Year ended December 31, 2006: Government rebates allowances and accrued liabilities Activity related to 2006 sales $ — $ 246,274 $ 190,258 $ 56,016 Activity related to sales prior to 2006 71,220 (4,681 ) 46,193 20,346 Total $ 71,220 $ 241,593 $ 236,451 $ 76,362 48 Table of Contents Allowance for Doubtful Accounts We also maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments. This allowance is based on our analysis of several factors including, but not limited to, contractual payment terms, historical payment patterns of our customers and individual customer circumstances, an analysis of days sales outstanding by customer and geographic region and a review of the local economic environment and its potential impact on government funding and reimbursement practices. If the financial condition of our customers or the economic environment in which they operate were to deteriorate, resulting in an inability to make payments, additional allowances may be required. Our allowance for doubtful accounts balance as a percentage of total accounts receivable did not materially change from December 31, 2006 to December 31, 2007. We believe that the allowance for doubtful accounts is adequate to cover anticipated losses under current conditions; however, significant deterioration in any of the above factors, especially with respect to the government funding and reimbursement practices in the European market could materially change these expectations and result in an increase to our allowance for doubtful accounts. Inventories We record write-downs in the value of our inventory based on our review of bad batches experienced during the manufacturing process as well as quality control reviews of our inventory. We generally do not record inventory write-downs relating to estimated obsolescence or risk of competition primarily because the shelf life of our products is long. However, if our current assumptions about future production or inventory levels, demand or competition were to change or if actual market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management, additional inventory write-downs may be required, which could negatively impact our product gross margins and results of operations. Prepaid Royalties We capitalize royalties that we have prepaid at cost, specifically those related to the emtricitabine royalties we paid to Emory University (Emory) for the HIV indication, based on the present value of the future royalty obligation that we would expect to pay to Emory assuming certain expected future levels of our product sales incorporating emtricitabine. The present value of our future royalty obligation was derived using our weighted average cost of capital. We review quarterly the expected future sales levels of our products and any indicators that might require a write-down in the net recoverable value of our asset or a change in the estimated life of the prepaid royalty. Some potential indicators of impairment include the launch of a significant product by a competitor, significant deviations in recognized product sales compared to forecast and product safety issues and recalls. We amortize our prepaid royalties based on an effective royalty rate that we derive from forecasted HIV product sales incorporating emtricitabine. Our product sales forecasts are prepared annually and determined using our best estimates of future activity upon considering such factors as historical and expected future patient usage or uptake of our products, the introduction of complimentary or combination therapies or products and future product launch plans. If a previously unanticipated and significant change occurs to our sales forecasts, including the introduction of a competing product by us or one of our competitors into the same HIV market as emtricitabine, we would prospectively update the royalty rate used to amortize our prepaid royalties which may increase future royalty expense. As of December 31, 2007, we had a prepaid royalty asset relating to the emtricitabine royalties we paid to Emory of $306.7 million. Amortization expense relating to this prepaid royalty asset was $14.3 million, $15.1 million and $6.2 million, for the years ended December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively. Clinical Trial Accruals We record accruals for estimated clinical study costs. Most of our clinical studies are performed by third-party contract research organizations (CROs). These costs are a significant component of R&D expenses. During 2007, 2006 and 2005, we incurred CRO costs of $65.6 million, $30.2 million and $21.1 million, respectively. We 49 Table of Contents accrue costs for clinical studies performed by CROs on a straight-line basis over the service periods specified in the contracts and adjust our estimates, if required, based upon our on-going review of the level of effort and costs actually incurred by the CRO. We validate our accruals quarterly with our vendors and perform detailed reviews of the activities related to our significant contracts. Based upon the results of these validation processes, we assess the appropriateness of our accruals and make any adjustments we deem necessary to ensure that our expenses reflect the actual effort incurred by the CROs. Generally, a significant portion of the total clinical trial costs are associated with start up activities for the trial and patient enrollment. We extensively outsource our clinical trial activities and usually perform only a small portion of the start-up activities in-house. As a result, CROs typically perform most of the total start-up activities for our trials, including document preparation, site identification, screening and preparation, pre-study visits, training and program management. In general, these costs are typically 10% to 30% of the total CRO contract value. On an actual basis, this percentage range is significantly wider as many of our contracts are either expanded or reduced in scope compared to the original budget. Start-up costs usually occur within a few months after the contract has been executed and are milestone or event-driven in nature. The remaining activities and related costs, such as patient monitoring and administration, generally occur ratably throughout the life of the individual contract or study. Most contracts are negotiated as fixed per unit prices and can vary in length between three months for a single dose Phase 1 study and up to two years or more for a more complex Phase 3 clinical study. The average length of contracts in 2007, 2006 and 2005 has been at the upper end of this range in order to provide long-term safety and efficacy data to support the commercial launches of Truvada, Viread, Atripla, Emtriva, Hepsera and Letairis. All of our material CRO contracts are terminable by us upon written notice and we are generally only liable for actual effort expended by the CRO and certain non-cancelable expenses incurred at any point of termination. Amounts paid in advance relating to uncompleted services will be refunded if a contract is terminated. Some contracts may include additional termination payments that become due and payable if we terminate the contract. Such additional termination payments are only recorded if it becomes probable that a contract will be terminated. Through December 31, 2007, differences between actual and estimated activity levels for any particular study have not been material. However, if management does not receive complete and accurate information from our vendors or underestimates activity levels associated with a study at a given point in time, we would have to record additional and potentially significant R&D expenses in future periods. Tax Provision We estimate our income tax provision, including deferred tax assets and liabilities, based on significant management judgment. We evaluate the realization of all or a portion of our deferred tax assets on a quarterly basis. We record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets to the amounts that are more likely than not to be realized. We consider future taxable income, ongoing tax planning strategies and our historical financial performance in assessing the need for a valuation allowance. If we expect to realize deferred tax assets for which we have previously recorded a valuation allowance, we would reduce the valuation allowance in the period in which such determination is first made. Such an adjustment was made in 2007 and 2005 when we determined that it was more likely than not that certain of our deferred tax assets would be realized, and therefore, we released the related valuation allowance. This resulted in an income tax benefit of approximately $1.5 million and $8.2 million for 2007 and 2005, respectively. Our future effective income tax rate may be affected by such factors as changes in tax laws, regulations or rates, changing interpretation of existing laws or regulations, the impact of accounting for stock-based compensation, changes in our international organization and changes in overall levels of income before tax. In June 2006, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued FASB Interpretation No. 48, Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes (FIN 48), an interpretation of Statement of Financial Accounting 50 Table of Contents Standards (SFAS) No. 109, Accounting for Income Taxes (SFAS 109). FIN 48 clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in an enterprise’s financial statements in accordance with SFAS 109 by prescribing a minimum recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. FIN 48 also provides guidance on derecognition, classification, interest and penalties, accounting in interim periods, disclosure and transition. On January 1, 2007, we adopted FIN 48 and increased our liability for unrecognized tax benefits by $14.1 million with a corresponding charge to the opening balance of accumulated deficit, as permitted under FIN 48. In addition, we reclassified $68.4 million of unrecognized tax benefits from short-term income taxes payable and noncurrent deferred tax assets to long-term income taxes payable. As of the date of adoption, we had total federal, state and foreign unrecognized tax benefits of $86.2 million recorded primarily in long-term income taxes payable on our Consolidated Balance Sheet, including accrued liabilities related to interest of $4.0 million. Of the total unrecognized tax benefits as of January 1, 2007, $78.0 million, if recognized, would have reduced our effective tax rate in the period of recognition. As permitted under the provisions of FIN 48, we will continue to classify interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits as part of our income tax provision in our Consolidated Statements of Operations. At December 31, 2007, we had total federal, state and foreign unrecognized tax benefits of $111.7 million, including interest of $8.3 million. Of the total unrecognized tax benefits, $103.5 million, if recognized, would reduce our effective tax rate in the period of recognition. With respect to the unrecognized tax benefits, we are currently unable to make a reasonably reliable estimate as to the period of cash settlement, if any, with the respective taxing authorities. We file federal, state and foreign income tax returns in many jurisdictions in the United States and abroad. For U.S. federal and California income tax purposes, the statute of limitations remains open for all years from inception due to our utilization of net operating losses relating to prior years. Our income tax returns are audited by federal, state and foreign tax authorities. We are currently under examination by the Internal Revenue Service for the 2003 and 2004 tax years, by the Franchise Tax Board of California for the 2004 and 2005 tax years and by various other state and foreign jurisdictions. There are differing interpretations of tax laws and regulations, and as a result, significant disputes may arise with these tax authorities involving issues of the timing and amount of deductions and allocations of income among various tax jurisdictions. While we believe our positions comply with applicable laws, we periodically evaluate our exposures associated with our tax filing positions. We record liabilities related to uncertain tax positions based upon FIN 48. We do not believe any such items currently pending will have a material adverse effect on our Consolidated Financial Statements, although an adverse resolution of one or more of these items in any period could have a material impact on the results of operations for that period. Prior to the adoption of FIN 48, we recorded liabilities related to uncertain tax positions based upon SFAS No. 5, Accounting for Contingencies. Stock-based Compensation In December 2004, the FASB issued SFAS No. 123 (revised 2004), Share-Based Payment (SFAS 123R), which requires that all share-based payments to employees and directors, including grants of stock options, be recognized in the statement of operations based on their fair values. SFAS 123R supersedes Accounting Principles Board Opinion No. 25, Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees (APB 25) and amends SFAS No. 95, Statement of Cash Flows. On January 1, 2006, we adopted SFAS 123R using the modified prospective method of adoption as permitted under SFAS 123R, which requires that compensation expense be recorded for all nonvested stock options and other stock-based awards as of the beginning of the first quarter of adoption. In accordance with the modified prospective method, no prior period amounts were restated to reflect the provisions of SFAS 123R. 51 Table of Contents Prior to the adoption of SFAS 123R, in accordance with the provisions of SFAS 123, we elected to follow APB 25, and FASB Interpretation No. 44, Accounting for Certain Transactions Involving Stock Compensation—an Interpretation of APB Opinion No. 25, in accounting for our employee stock-based plans. Under APB 25, if the exercise price of our employee and director stock options was equal to or greater than the fair value of the underlying stock on the date of grant, no compensation expense was recognized. However, as required by SFAS 123, the pro forma impact of expensing the fair value of our stock options and employee stock purchase plan was disclosed in the notes to our Consolidated Financial Statements. In connection with our adoption of SFAS 123R, we refined our valuation assumptions and the methodologies used to derive those assumptions; however, we elected to continue using the Black-Scholes option valuation model. The fair value of stock options granted prior to the adoption of SFAS 123R was calculated using the multiple option approach while the fair value of stock options granted beginning January 1, 2006 was calculated using the single option approach. Concurrent with our adoption of SFAS 123R, we determined that a blend of historical volatility along with implied volatility for traded options on our stock would be a better measure of market conditions and expected volatility. Previously, we used historical stock price volatility as it was the most reliable source of volatility data. We estimate the weighted-average expected life of our stock options based on historical cancellation and exercise data related to our stock options as well as the contractual term and vesting terms of the awards. We record stock-based compensation expense using a graded vesting expense attribution approach for nonvested stock options granted prior to the adoption of SFAS 123R consistent with the expense attribution approach used in our historical SFAS 123 disclosures and using a straight-line expense attribution approach for stock options granted after the adoption of SFAS 123R. We currently believe that the straight-line expense attribution approach better reflects the level of service to be provided over the vesting period of our awards. Stock-based compensation expense related to stock options is recognized net of estimated forfeitures. We estimate forfeitures based on our historical experience. As a result of the adoption of SFAS 123R, we will only recognize a tax benefit from stock-based compensation in additional paid-in-capital (APIC) if an incremental tax benefit is realized after all other tax attributes currently available to us have been utilized. In addition, we have elected to account for the indirect benefits of stock-based compensation on the research tax credit and the extraterritorial income deduction through the Consolidated Statements of Operations rather than through APIC. During the years ended December 31, 2007 and 2006, we recognized stock-based compensation expense of $184.6 million and $133.8 million, respectively, in operating expenses, and we capitalized $9.8 million and $10.2 million, respectively, into inventory. As of December 31, 2007, we had unrecognized stock-based compensation of $389.2 million related to nonvested stock options, which we expect to expense over an estimated weighted-average period of 2.8 years. Management has discussed the development, selection and disclosure of these critical accounting policies with the Audit Committee of our Board of Directors, and the Audit Committee has reviewed the disclosure presented above relating to them. Results of Operations Total Revenues We had total revenues of $4.23 billion in 2007, $3.03 billion in 2006 and $2.03 billion in 2005. Included in total revenues were product sales, royalty revenues and contract and other revenues. 52 Table of Contents Product Sales Product sales for the last three years consisted of the following (in thousands): 2007 Change 2006 Change 2005 HIV products: Truvada $ 1,589,229 33 % $ 1,194,292 110 % $ 567,829 Atripla 903,381 339 % 205,729 — % — Viread 613,169 (11 )% 689,356 (11 )% 778,783 Emtriva 31,493 (13 )% 36,393 (23 )% 47,486 Total HIV products 3,137,272 48 % 2,125,770 52 % 1,394,098 Hepsera 302,722 31 % 230,531 24 % 186,532 AmBisome 262,571 18 % 223,031 1 % 220,753 Other 30,544 245 % 8,865 12 % 7,916 Total product sales $ 3,733,109 44 % $ 2,588,197 43 % $ 1,809,299 Total product sales increased by 44% in 2007 compared to 2006, primarily due to an increase in our total product sales volume of $1.04 billion and a favorable foreign currency exchange impact of $97.9 million. Total product sales increased by 43% in 2006 compared to 2005, primarily due to an increase in our total product sales volume of $760.5 million. A significant percentage of our product sales continued to be denominated in foreign currencies. We used forward and option contracts to hedge a percentage of our forecasted international sales, primarily those denominated in Euro. This reduced, but did not eliminate, fluctuations in sales due to changes in foreign currency exchange rates. HIV Products HIV product sales in 2007 increased by 48% compared to 2006 and by 52% in 2006 compared to 2005, primarily driven by product sales volume growth. During 2006, the average selling prices of our HIV products increased compared to 2005, primarily driven by higher overall selling prices of our HIV products as well as the transition of some patients in the United States from coverage under Medicaid to Medicare Part D which generally reimbursed at higher rates. We estimated the benefit to net product sales resulting from these transitions was approximately $38 million for 2006. • Truvada Truvada sales increased by 33% in 2007 compared to 2006 and by 110% in 2006 compared to 2005, in each case, primarily driven by strong sales volume growth in Europe as well as a favorable foreign currency exchange environment in 2007. Truvada sales accounted for 51%, 56% and 41% of our total HIV product sales for 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively. • Atripla Atripla sales increased by 339% in 2007 compared to 2006, primarily due to the first full year of Atripla sales in 2007 as well as the continued strong uptake of Atripla in the United States. We consolidate 100% of Atripla product sales because we are the primary beneficiary of our joint venture with BMS in the United States. The efavirenz portion of these Atripla sales was approximately $334.3 million and $76.0 million in 2007 and 2006, respectively. Atripla was approved for sale in the United States in July 2006 and in the European Union in December 2007. Atripla sales accounted for 29% of our total HIV product sales in 2007. Sales of Atripla in the European Union were not significant in 2007. • Viread Viread sales decreased by 11% in 2007 compared to 2006 and by 11% in 2006 compared to 2005, in each case, primarily due to lower sales volume in the United States and Europe driven by the impact of 53 Table of Contents patients switching from a Viread-containing regimen to one containing Truvada and/or Atripla in countries where Truvada and/or Atripla is available, partially offset by sales volume increases in Latin America as well as a favorable foreign currency exchange environment in 2007. The Viread sales decrease in 2007 compared to 2006 was also partially offset by a favorable foreign currency exchange environment. • Emtriva Emtriva sales decreased by 13% in 2007 compared to 2006 and 23% in 2006 compared to 2005. The decreases in both years were primarily due to overall sales volume decreases driven by the impact of patients switching from an Emtriva-containing regimen to one containing Truvada and/or Atripla in countries where these products are available. Hepsera Hepsera sales increased by 31% in 2007 compared to 2006, primarily driven by sales volume growth across all major geographical regions where the product is sold, as well as a favorable foreign currency exchange environment. Hepsera sales increased by 24% in 2006 compared to 2005 primarily driven by sales volume growth in the United States and Europe. In 2006, Hepsera sales volume also increased with respect to our sales of Hepsera to GSK. We sell Hepsera to GSK at our manufacturing cost in connection with GSK’s distribution activities in Asia and collect a royalty from GSK upon the sale of Hepsera to customers which we record as royalty revenues. AmBisome Sales of AmBisome increased 18% in 2007 compared to 2006, primarily due to sales volume growth in Europe as well as a favorable foreign currency exchange impact. Sales of AmBisome increased one percent in 2006 compared to 2005, primarily due to sales volume growth in some regions, partially offset by lower pricing in most regions. AmBisome product sales in the United States relate solely to our sales of AmBisome to Astellas Pharma Inc. which are recorded at our manufacturing cost. In 2008, we expect total product sales to continue to grow as we continue to expand our sales and marketing efforts. Royalty Revenues The following table summarizes the period over period changes in our royalty revenues (in thousands): 2007 Change 2006 Change 2005 Royalty revenues $ 468,155 12 % $ 416,526 112 % $ 196,873 Our most significant source of royalty revenues for 2007, 2006 and 2005 was from sales of Tamiflu by Roche. Royalty revenues for 2007 were $468.2 million, an increase of 12% compared to 2006, and were $416.5 million for 2006, an increase of 112% compared to 2005. The increases in both comparative periods were primarily driven by the recognition of Tamiflu royalties from Roche of $414.5 million and $364.6 million in 2007 and 2006, respectively. The increases in Tamiflu royalties for both comparative periods were due to the higher Tamiflu sales recorded by Roche, including sales related to pandemic planning initiatives worldwide. The increase in Tamiflu royalties for 2006 compared to 2005 was also due to the elimination of a contractual cost of goods adjustment resulting from the dispute resolution in November 2005 that had historically reduced the amount of Tamiflu royalties recognized by us prior to November 2005. We recognize royalties on Tamiflu sales by Roche in the quarter following the quarter in which it is sold. 54 Table of Contents In November 2005, we resolved our dispute with Roche relating to our 1996 development and license agreement and agreed to terminate the related arbitration pending between Roche and us. Related to the dispute resolution, Roche paid us $80.7 million. We recognized this payment as royalty revenue in 2005. The payment consisted of $18.2 million relating to disputed royalties from 2001 to 2003, $11.8 million relating to the reimbursement of the 2004 contractual cost of goods adjustment that had previously reduced our earned royalties and $50.7 million relating to the updating of royalties payable to us for the first nine months of 2005 based on the 2005 then-current royalty rates instead of the prior year’s effective royalty rate. Roche reported in January 2008 that it expects a significant decrease in Tamiflu sales in 2008 compared to 2007; therefore, we expect our royalty revenues for 2008 to be significantly lower compared to 2007. Cost of Goods Sold and Product Gross Margin The following table summarizes the period over period changes in our product sales (in thousands), cost of goods sold (in thousands) and product gross margin: 2007 Change 2006 Change 2005 Total product sales $ 3,733,109 44% $ 2,588,197 43% $ 1,809,299 Cost of goods sold $ 768,771 77% $ 433,320 66% $ 260,326 Product gross margin 79% 83% 86% Our product gross margin for 2007 was 79%, compared to 83% for 2006, primarily due to product mix changes, especially as Atripla, which has a lower product gross margin, comprised a larger proportion of our product sales in 2007. Our product gross margin for 2006 was 83%, compared to 86% for 2005. The lower gross margin in 2006 compared to 2005 was primarily due to the launch of Atripla in the United States, $15.8 million in write-downs of inventory for our Gilead Access Program to its estimated net realizable value, as well as product mix changes as patients continued to switch from Viread, a higher margin product, to Truvada and/or Atripla. The lower gross margin in 2006 compared to 2005 was partially offset by the lower effective royalty rate resulting from our July 2005 emtricitabine royalty buyout discussed below, lower active pharmaceutical ingredients costs and the higher average selling prices of our HIV products in the United States. Atripla product sales decreased our product gross margin, without a corresponding impact to our product gross profit. As the primary beneficiary of our joint venture with BMS in the United States, we consolidate 100% of Atripla product sales but only benefit from the product gross margin on the Truvada portion of Atripla. The efavirenz portion of Atripla product sales carries a zero product gross profit and gross margin since the joint venture purchases efavirenz from BMS at BMS’s average net selling price of efavirenz in the United States. Prior to July 2005, we paid royalties to Emory on worldwide net sales of product containing emtricitabine. In July 2005, we and Royalty Pharma purchased 65% and 35%, respectively, of the royalty interest owned by Emory in exchange for the elimination of the royalty obligation. As a result of the purchase, we capitalized $341.3 million in prepaid royalties, representing our 65% share of the $525.0 million purchase price. In the third quarter of 2005, we began to amortize this prepaid royalty to cost of goods sold over the remaining life of the underlying patent based on an effective royalty rate derived from our forecasted sales of products containing emtricitabine. We record royalties to Royalty Pharma based on actual emtricitabine net sales relative to Royalty Pharma’s 35% ownership interest in the underlying Emory royalty interest. We expect our product gross margin in 2008 to be lower compared to 2007, primarily due to a higher mix of Atripla product sales, which include the efavirenz portion of Atripla product sales at zero product gross profit, partially offset by product gross margin improvements driven by lower active pharmaceutical ingredients costs. 55 Table of Contents Research and Development Expenses The following table summarizes the period over period changes in the major components of our R&D expenses over the last three years (in thousands): 2007 Change 2006 Change 2005 Research $ 131,019 54 % $ 85,202 52 % $ 55,918 Clinical development 361,091 52 % 238,270 34 % 178,015 Pharmaceutical development 98,916 64 % 60,389 38 % 43,791 Total research and development $ 591,026 54 % $ 383,861 38 % $ 277,724 R&D expenses consist primarily of personnel costs, including salaries, benefits and stock-based compensation, clinical studies performed by CROs, materials and supplies, licenses and fees and overhead allocations consisting of various support and facilities related costs. Our R&D activities are separated into three main categories: research, clinical development and pharmaceutical development. Research costs typically consist of preclinical and toxicology costs. Clinical development costs include costs for Phase 1, 2, 3 and 4 clinical trials. Pharmaceutical development expenses consist of costs for product formulation and chemical analysis. R&D expenses in 2007 increased by $207.2 million compared to 2006, primarily due to increased compensation and benefits expenses of $65.2 million due largely to higher headcount, increased clinical study expenses of $58.6 million and increased contract service expenses of $19.6 million relating to clinical, product development and research activities in our cardiovascular programs. In addition, we paid a $20.0 million up-front license fee to LGLS and a $13.5 million license-related fee to PARI GmbH (PARI) in 2007, both of which we expensed as there was no future alternative uses for these technologies. R&D expenses in 2006 increased by $106.1 million compared to 2005, primarily due to increased compensation and benefits expenses of $73.9 million due largely to higher headcount, which included stock-based compensation expense of $52.2 million from our adoption of SFAS 123R on January 1, 2006, as well as increased contract service and clinical study expenses of $50.1 million relating to clinical, product development and research activities in our HIV and hepatitis programs and the respiratory and cardiovascular programs assumed in our acquisitions of Myogen and Corus. These higher expenses were partially offset by lower milestone payments made to Japan Tobacco, Inc. (Japan Tobacco) in 2006 compared to 2005 related to the licensing and development of elvitegravir, our lead integrase inhibitor candidate also known as GS 9137, as well as a $15.0 million payment to Emory in 2005 in connection with the amendment of our license agreement with Emory related to our obligation to develop emtricitabine for the hepatitis B indication. In general, significant collaboration payments, like those made to LGLS, PARI, Japan Tobacco and Emory, can cause our R&D expenses to fluctuate period over period. In 2008, we expect R&D expenses to increase over 2007 levels due to increased spending on our internal and collaborative R&D efforts relating to the progress of our product candidates into more advanced clinical studies as well as continuation of our clinical trials related to elvitegravir for HIV, darusentan for resistant hypertension and Viread for HBV, and the initiation of the Phase 4 program for Letairis. Selling, General and Administrative Expenses The following table summarizes the period over period changes in our SG&A expenses over the last three years (in thousands): 2007 Change 2006 Change 2005 Selling, general and administrative $ 705,741 23 % $ 573,660 50 % $ 381,283 56 Table of Contents SG&A expenses for 2007 increased by $132.1 million compared to 2006. The increase was primarily due to an increase in compensation and benefits expenses of $79.6 million due largely to higher headcount, as well as an increase in marketing and promotional expenses of $20.0 million in the antiviral and cardiovascular areas, including those related to our launch of Letairis for the treatment of PAH. SG&A expenses for 2006 increased by $192.4 million compared to 2005. Higher expenses were primarily driven by higher headcount which increased compensation and benefits by $92.0 million, including stock-based compensation expense of $70.8 million from our adoption of SFAS 123R on January 1, 2006, increased expenses of $54.3 million in contract services and promotional programs relating to our business growth, business development activities, preparation for the launch of Atripla in the United States and a $7.9 million write-off of certain capital assets related to renovations at our corporate headquarter campus. In 2008, we expect SG&A expenses to increase primarily due to higher costs to be incurred on administrative activities and sales and marketing efforts to support our business growth, as well as costs associated with anticipated launches of Atripla in the European Union, Viread for HBV in both the United States and European Union, and aztreonam lysine for inhalation for CF in the United States. Purchased In-process Research and Development Expenses In connection with our acquisitions of Myogen and Corus in 2006, we recorded purchased in-process research and development (IPR&D) expenses of $2.06 billion and $335.6 million, respectively, for the year ended December 31, 2006. The purchased IPR&D expense for Myogen represented the estimated fair value of Myogen’s incomplete R&D programs that had not yet reached technological feasibility and had no alternative future use as of the acquisition date and, therefore, was expensed upon acquisition. A summary of these programs at the acquisition date, updated for subsequent changes in status of development, is as follows: Program Description Status of Development EstimatedAcquisition DateFair Value(in millions) Ambrisentan An orally active, non-sulfonamide, propanoic acid-class, endothelin receptor antagonist (ERA) for the treatment of PAH. Phase 3 clinical trials were completed prior to the acquisition date. We filed an NDA with the FDA in December 2006 and, in June 2007, the FDA approved Letairis (ambrisentan) for the treatment of PAH in the United States. Additionally, in March 2007, the EMEA validated the marketing authorization application for ambrisentan for the treatment of PAH, filed by our collaboration partner, GSK. In February 2008, ambrisentan received a positive opinion from the European Committee for Human Medicinal Products for the treatment of PAH and will be marketed under the name Volibris by GSK upon approval. $ 1,413.7 Darusentan An orally active ETA-selective ERA for the treatment of resistant hypertension. In Phase 3 clinical development as of the acquisition date and the date of this filing. $ 644.5 57 Table of Contents The estimated fair value of the purchased IPR&D was determined using the income approach, which discounts expected future cash flows to present value. We estimated the fair value of the purchased IPR&D using a present value discount rate of 14%, which is based on the estimated internal rate of return for Myogen’s operations, is comparable to the estimated weighted average cost of capital for companies with Myogen’s profile, and represents the rate that market participants would use to value the purchased IPR&D. We compensated for the differing phases of development of ambrisentan and darusentan by probability-adjusting our estimation of the expected future cash flows associated with each program. We then determined at that time the present value of the expected future cash flows using the discount rate of 14%. The projected cash flows from the ambrisentan and darusentan programs were based on key assumptions such as estimates of revenues and operating profits related to the programs considering their stages of development; the time and resources needed to complete the development and approval of the related product candidates; the life of the potential commercialized products and associated risks, including the inherent difficulties and uncertainties in developing a drug compound such as obtaining FDA and other regulatory approvals; and risks related to the viability of and potential alternative treatments in any future target markets. For the purpose of estimating the fair value of the ambrisentan program, we estimated that the program was approximately 78% complete as of the acquisition date, based on estimated time and cost to complete, as Phase 3 clinical trials had been completed. As of the acquisition date, we estimated that we would incur future R&D costs of approximately $35 million to $45 million from the date of acquisition through and including the year when commercialization was expected to occur. Material net cash inflows were estimated to begin in 2009 for ambrisentan, assuming the necessary regulatory approvals would be received and the product would be successfully commercialized by that date. For the purpose of estimating the fair value of the darusentan program, we estimated that the program was approximately 35% complete as of the acquisition date, based on estimated time and cost to complete, and remaining efforts would include the completion of Phase 3 clinical development as well as preparing for and filing an NDA with the FDA. As of the acquisition date, we estimated that we would incur future R&D costs of approximately $130 million to $140 million from the date of acquisition through and including the year when commercialization was expected to occur. Material net cash inflows were estimated to begin in 2012 for darusentan, assuming the necessary regulatory approvals would be received and the product would be successfully commercialized by that date. The remaining efforts for completing the darusentan IPR&D program primarily consist of clinical trials, the cost, length and success of which are extremely difficult to predict, and obtaining necessary regulatory approvals. Numerous risks and uncertainties exist that could prevent completion of development, including the ability to enroll patients in clinical trials, the possibility of unfavorable results of our clinical trials and the risk of failing to obtain FDA and other regulatory body approvals. Feedback from regulatory authorities or results from clinical trials might require modifications to or delays in later stage clinical trials or additional trials to be performed. We cannot be certain that darusentan for the treatment of resistant hypertension will be approved in the United States or in countries outside of the United States or whether marketing approvals will have significant limitations on its use. Future discussions with regulatory agencies will determine the amount of data needed and timelines for review, which may differ materially from current projections. Darusentan may never be successfully commercialized. As a result, we may make a strategic decision to discontinue development of darusentan if, for example, we believe commercialization will be difficult relative to other opportunities in our pipeline. If this program cannot be completed on a timely basis or at all, then our prospects for future revenue growth may be adversely impacted. No assurance can be given that the underlying assumptions used to forecast the above cash flows or the timely and successful completion of this project will materialize as estimated. For these reasons, among others, actual results may vary significantly from estimated results. 58 Table of Contents The purchased IPR&D expense for Corus represented the estimated fair value of Corus’s incomplete inhaled aztreonam lysine for CF R&D program that had not yet reached technological feasibility and had no alternative future use as of the acquisition date and, therefore, was expensed upon acquisition. A description of this program at the acquisition date, updated for subsequent changes in status of development, is as follows: Program Description Status of Development EstimatedAcquisition DateFair Value(in millions) Inhaled aztreonam lysine for CF Aztreonam formulation for inhalation to be used against Gram-negative bacteria that cause lung infections in patients with CF. In Phase 3 clinical trials as of the acquisition date. We filed an NDA with the FDA in November 2007 and have been granted a target review date of September 2008. $ 335.6 The estimated fair value of the purchased IPR&D was determined using the income approach, which discounts expected future cash flows to present value. We estimated the fair value of the purchased IPR&D using a present value discount rate of 16%, which is based on the estimated internal rate of return for Corus’s operations, is comparable to the estimated weighted average cost of capital for companies with Corus’s profile, and represents the rate that market participants would use to value the purchased IPR&D. The projected cash flows from the aztreonam lysine for inhalation program were based on key assumptions such as estimates of revenues and operating profits related to the program considering its stage of development; the time and resources needed to complete the development and approval of the related product candidate; the life of the potential commercialized product and associated risks, including the inherent difficulties and uncertainties in developing a drug compound such as obtaining FDA and other regulatory approvals; and risks related to the viability of and potential alternative treatments in any future target markets. Corus’s two other early-stage candidates were not included in the valuation of purchased IPR&D because they were early-stage projects that did not have identifiable revenues and expenses associated with them. For the purpose of estimating the fair value of the aztreonam program, we estimated that the program was approximately 71% complete as of the acquisition date, based on estimated time and cost to complete, and remaining efforts would include the completion of Phase 3 clinical development as well as preparing for and filing an NDA with the FDA. As of the acquisition date, we estimated that we would incur future R&D costs of approximately $30 million to $35 million from the date of acquisition through and including the year when commercialization was expected to occur. Material net cash inflows were estimated to begin in 2009 for the aztreonam program, assuming the necessary regulatory approvals would be received and the product would be successfully commercialized by that date. The remaining efforts for completing Corus’s IPR&D program primarily consist of obtaining necessary regulatory approvals. Failing to obtain FDA and other regulatory body approvals is a risk that could prevent completion of development. Feedback from regulatory authorities might require modifications to or delays in later stage clinical trials or additional trials to be performed. We cannot be certain that aztreonam lysine for inhalation for the treatment of CF will be approved in the United States or in countries outside of the United States or whether marketing approvals will have significant limitations on its use. Aztreonam lysine for inhalation may never be successfully commercialized. As a result, we may make a strategic decision to discontinue development of aztreonam lysine for inhalation if, for example, we believe commercialization will be difficult relative to other opportunities in our pipeline. If this program cannot be completed on a timely basis or at all, then our prospects for future revenue growth may be adversely impacted. No assurance can be given that the underlying assumptions used to forecast the above cash flows or the timely and successful completion of the project will materialize as estimated. For these reasons, among others, actual results may vary significantly from estimated results. 59 Table of Contents Interest and Other Income, Net We recorded interest and other income, net, of $109.8 million, $134.6 million and $49.2 million in 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively. The decrease in 2007 compared to 2006 was primarily attributable to the lower average cash and investment balances over 2006, as well as the write-down of $7.0 million and $1.8 million relating to the other-than-temporary impairment of our investment in Achillion Pharmaceuticals, Inc. and the asset-backed commercial paper of a structured investment vehicle, respectively. The increase in 2006 compared to 2005 was primarily attributable to the higher average cash and investment balances over 2005. Interest Expense In April 2006, we issued $650.0 million principal amount of convertible senior notes due 2011 (2011 Notes) and $650.0 million principal amount of convertible senior notes due 2013 (2013 Notes) (collectively, the Notes) in a private placement pursuant to Rule 144A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended. The 2011 Notes and the 2013 Notes were issued at par and bear interest rates of 0.50% and 0.625%, respectively. Debt issuance costs of $23.8 million in connection with the issuance of the Notes were recorded in other noncurrent assets and are being amortized to interest expense on a straight-line basis over the contractual terms of the Notes. We incurred interest expense of $13.1 million, $20.4 million and $0.4 million in 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively. The decrease in interest expense in 2007 compared to 2006 was primarily attributable to our repayment during the first quarter of 2007 of all remaining amounts due under our term loan which we entered into in December 2005. The increase in interest expense in 2006 compared to 2005 was primarily due to interest on the term loan and the interest on our 2011 and 2013 Notes. Minority Interest The minority interest on our Consolidated Financial Statements primarily reflects BMS’s interest in the operating results of our joint venture with BMS in the United States The joint venture was formed to develop and commercialize Atripla in the United States. As the primary beneficiary of the joint venture as determined under FASB Interpretation No. 46R (As Amended), Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities, we consolidate the operations of the joint venture in our Consolidated Financial Statements. Provision for Income Taxes Our provision for income taxes was $655.0 million, $551.8 million and $347.9 million in 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively. The 2007 effective tax rate of 28.9% differs from the U.S. federal statutory rate of 35% due primarily to state taxes, offset by tax credits and certain operating earnings from non-U.S. subsidiaries that are considered indefinitely invested outside the United States. Included in our operating income in 2006 were pre-tax charges of $335.6 million and $2.06 billion for the IPR&D expenses associated with our Corus and Myogen acquisitions, respectively. We did not record any income tax benefit related to the purchased IPR&D expenses as such amounts are non-deductible. The 2006 effective tax rate of (86.5)% differs from the U.S. federal statutory rate of 35% due primarily to our federal tax non-deductible purchased IPR&D expenses and state taxes, offset by tax credits and certain operating earnings from non-U.S. subsidiaries that are considered indefinitely invested outside the United States. The 2005 effective tax rate of 29.9% differs from the U.S. federal statutory rate of 35% due generally to state taxes offset by the recognition of previously unbenefitted net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards, certain operating earnings from non-U.S. subsidiaries that are considered indefinitely invested outside the United States, and the one-time benefit for qualifying dividends under the American Jobs Creation Act (AJCA). On October 22, 2004, the AJCA was signed into law. The AJCA allowed for a deduction of 85% of certain qualified foreign earnings that were repatriated, as defined in the AJCA. We elected to apply this provision to qualifying earnings that were repatriated in 2005. The earnings repatriation resulted in a one-time tax provision benefit of approximately $25.1 million which we recognized in 2005. 60 Table of Contents In June 2006, the FASB issued FIN 48, which clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in an enterprise’s financial statements in accordance with SFAS 109 by prescribing a minimum recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. FIN 48 also provides guidance on derecognition, classification, interest and penalties, accounting in interim periods, disclosure, and transition. FIN 48 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2006. On January 1, 2007, we adopted FIN 48 and increased our liability for unrecognized tax benefits by $14.1 million with a corresponding charge to the opening balance of accumulated deficit, as permitted under FIN 48. In addition, we reclassified $68.4 million of unrecognized tax benefits from short-term income taxes payable and noncurrent deferred tax assets to long-term income taxes payable. As of the date of adoption, we had total federal, state, and foreign unrecognized tax benefits of $86.2 million recorded primarily in long-term income taxes payable on our Consolidated Balance Sheet, including accrued liabilities related to interest of $4.0 million. Of the total unrecognized tax benefits, $78.0 million, if recognized, would have reduced our effective tax rate in the period of recognition. As permitted under the provisions of FIN 48, we will continue to classify interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits as part of our income tax provision in our Consolidated Statements of Operations. As of December 31, 2007, we had total federal, state, and foreign unrecognized tax benefits of $111.7 million, including interest of $8.3 million. Of the total unrecognized tax benefits, $103.5 million, if recognized, would reduce our effective tax rate in the period of recognition. With respect to the unrecognized tax benefits, we are currently unable to make a reasonably reliable estimate as to the period of cash settlement, if any, with the respective taxing authorities. Liquidity and Capital Resources The following table summarizes our cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities, our working capital, and our cash flow activity as of the end of, and for each of, the last three years (in thousands): 2007 2006 2005 As of December 31: Cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities $ 2,722,422 $ 1,389,566 $ 2,311,033 Working capital $ 2,292,017 $ 1,664,930 $ 2,627,045 Year Ended December 31: Cash provided by (used in): Operating activities $ 1,765,490 $ 1,218,059 $ 705,642 Investing activities $ (1,302,467 ) $ (1,739,334 ) $ (682,478 ) Financing activities $ (267,386 ) $ 649,261 $ 441,896 Cash, Cash Equivalents and Marketable Securities Cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities totaled $2.72 billion at December 31, 2007, an increase of $1.33 billion or 96% from December 31, 2006. The increase of $1.33 billion was primarily attributable to: • net cash provided by operations of $1.77 billion in 2007; and • proceeds from issuance of stock under employee stock plans of $243.3 million in 2007. These increases were partially offset by: • our repurchase of $487.5 million of our common stock under our stock repurchase programs; • our repayment of all remaining amounts due under our term loan of $99.0 million; and • capital expenditures of $76.5 million relating to the expansion of our facilities to accommodate our growth. 61 Table of Contents Cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities totaled $1.39 billion at December 31, 2006, a decrease of 40% from December 31, 2005. The decrease of $921.5 million in 2006 was primarily due to: • net cash paid of $2.74 billion for the acquisitions of Myogen, Raylo and Corus; and • $201.0 million paid toward the principal outstanding under our term loan which we entered into in 2005. These decreases were partially offset by: • net cash provided by operations of $1.22 billion in 2006; • net proceeds of $587.6 million from the issuance of the Notes and related transactions in 2006; and • proceeds from the issuance of stock under employee stock plans of $167.9 million in 2006. Working Capital Working capital at December 31, 2007 was $2.29 billion compared to $1.66 billion at December 31, 2006. Significant factors that resulted in an increase in 2007 working capital were: • $235.1 million increase in cash, cash equivalents and short-term marketable securities due primarily to cash provided by operating activities and proceeds from issuances of stock under our employee stock plans, which were partially offset by our repurchase of our common stock and our repayment of the term loan and capital spending; • $215.1 million increase in prepaid taxes related to intercompany profits between Gilead and our joint venture; and • $185.8 million increase in accounts receivable primarily due to increased sales in 2007. Working capital at December 31, 2006 was $1.66 billion compared to $2.63 billion at December 31, 2005. Significant factors that resulted in the decrease in 2006 working capital were: • $1.37 billion decrease in cash, cash equivalents and short-term marketable securities, primarily due to our funding of significant acquisition activities in 2006, as well as a decrease in our marketable securities portfolio and a decrease resulting from the classification of certain of our marketable securities to long-term securities; and • $296.1 million increase in accounts payable primarily due to the launch of Atripla in July 2006 and the related purchases of efavirenz from BMS at BMS’s approximate market value of efavirenz in order for the joint venture to build inventory levels to supply increasing Atripla demand. These working capital decreases were partially offset by: • $347.2 million increase in inventories, primarily due to the increase in Atripla inventory which included efavirenz purchased from BMS at BMS’s approximate market value of efavirenz; and • $213.2 million increase in accounts receivable, primarily due to increased sales in 2006 and the lower collections of receivables in certain European countries where collections traditionally have been slower. Cash Provided by Operating Activities Cash provided by operating activities of $1.77 billion in 2007 was comprised primarily of $1.62 billion in net income which was adjusted for non-cash items such as $184.6 million of stock-based compensation expense, $133.1 million of deferred income taxes and $110.7 million of tax benefits related to employee stock plans and $76.3 million of excess tax benefits from stock option exercises. This was partially offset by a $236.0 million net cash outflow related to changes in operating assets and liabilities. 62 Table of Contents Cash provided by operating activities of $1.22 billion in 2006 was comprised primarily of $1.19 billion in net loss which was adjusted for non-cash items such as our $2.39 billion purchased IPR&D expense, stock-based compensation expense of $133.8 million and $127.6 million of tax benefits related to employee stock plans and $95.3 million of excess tax benefits from stock option exercises. This was partially offset by a $225.1 million net cash outflow related to changes in operating assets and liabilities. Cash provided by operating activities of $705.6 million in 2005 was comprised primarily of $813.9 million of net income which was adjusted for non-cash items such as $168.5 million of tax benefits from employee stock plans. This was partially offset by a $251.1 million net cash outflow related to changes in operating assets and liabilities, which included $341.3 million of prepaid royalties that we made to Emory related to emtricitabine. Cash Used in Investing Activities Cash used in investing activities in 2007 primarily related to purchases, sales and maturities of available-for-sale securities, capital expenditures and our acquisition of Nycomed Limited. Cash used in investing activities in 2006 primarily related to purchases, sales and maturities of available-for-sale securities, our acquisitions of Myogen, Raylo Chemicals Inc. (Raylo) and Corus, as well as capital expenditures. Cash used in investing activities in 2005 primarily related to purchases, sales and maturities of available-for-sale securities. We used $1.30 billion of cash for investing activities in 2007 compared to $1.74 billion in 2006, a decrease of $436.9 million. The decrease was primarily due to our acquisitions of Myogen, Raylo and Corus for a total of $2.74 billion in 2006, as well as more cash used in the purchases, sales and maturities of marketable securities activities during 2007 compared to 2006. We used $1.74 billion of cash for investing activities during 2006, compared to $682.5 million in 2005, an increase of $1.06 billion. The increase was primarily due to our acquisitions of Myogen, Raylo and Corus for a total of $2.74 billion in 2006 as discussed above, as well as more cash provided from the purchases, sales and maturities of marketable securities activities during 2006 compared to 2005. Capital expenditures made in 2007, 2006 and 2005 related primarily to the expansion of our manufacturing capabilities, upgrades to our facilities, as well as spending on computer and laboratory equipment to accommodate our business growth. In 2007, capital expenditures also included the construction of a new building at our Foster City, California headquarters. In 2006, capital expenditures also included the purchase of two buildings that we previously leased as well as construction costs of the new building at our Foster City, California headquarters. As of December 31, 2007, we had capital expenditure commitments of $17.7 million, and we expect to fulfill such commitments from funds generated from our operating cash flows. Cash Provided by (Used in) Financing Activities Cash used in financing activities in 2007 was $267.4 million, primarily resulting from the $487.5 million used to repurchase our common stock under our stock repurchase programs, $99.0 million used to pay off all remaining amounts due on our term loan, partially offset by the proceeds from issuance of stock under employee stock plans of $243.3 million, as well as $76.3 million of excess tax benefits from stock option exercises. Cash provided by financing activities in 2006 was $649.3 million, primarily resulting from the $587.6 million of net proceeds generated from the issuance of our Notes and related transactions. In addition, we received proceeds from the issuance of stock under employee stock plans of $167.9 million, as well as $95.3 million of excess tax benefits from employee stock option exercises. These cash inflows were partially offset by $201.0 million paid towards principal on our term loan during 2006. Cash provided by financing activities in 2005 primarily related to proceeds from our $300.0 million term loan and proceeds from the issuance of stock under employee stock plans of $143.3 million. 63 Table of Contents Other Information In December 2007, we, along with our wholly-owned subsidiary, Gilead Biopharmaceutics Ireland Corporation (GBIC), entered into an amended and restated credit agreement, which superseded the existing revolving credit agreement, with a syndicate of banks to increase the credit facility to $1.25 billion. The amended and restated credit agreement also includes a sub-facility for swing-line loans and letters of credit. Under the terms of the amended and restated credit agreement, we may borrow initially up to an aggregate of $1.25 billion in revolving credit loans. Loans under the amended and restated credit agreement bear interest at either (i) LIBOR plus a margin ranging from 20 basis points to 32 basis points or (ii) the base rate, as defined in the amended and restated credit agreement. We can prepay any outstanding borrowings at any time in whole or in part without penalty or premium, and any outstanding interest or principal would be due and payable in December 2012. In connection with the amended and restated credit agreement, we entered into a parent guaranty agreement under which we guaranteed the obligations of GBIC under the amended and restated credit agreement. We expect to use the proceeds of any loans under the amended and restated credit agreement for working capital requirements and general corporate purposes. As of December 31, 2007, we had a $1.5 million letter of credit outstanding under the amended and restated credit agreement. In August 2007, as a result of a review of the terms under our existing corporate aircraft leases and upon consideration of the various alternatives available to us upon their expiration, we entered into agreements to purchase three aircraft to be constructed for delivery in 2010 and 2013. The aggregate purchase price under the purchase agreements was $94.2 million. As of December 31, 2007, we had made deposits totaling $4.7 million which has been recorded in other noncurrent assets on our Consolidated Balance Sheet. Future deposits due under the terms of the purchase agreements are as follows: $2.6 million in 2008, $21.2 million in 2009, $28.5 million in 2010, $4.1 million in 2011, $20.7 million in 2012, and $12.4 million in 2013. We have the option to terminate the purchase agreements, subject to a maximum payment of 7.5% of the fully-equipped price of the aircraft. We believe that our existing capital resources, supplemented by cash generated from our operations, will be adequate to satisfy our capital needs for the foreseeable future. Our future capital requirements will depend on many factors, including but not limited to the following: • the commercial performance of our current and future products; • the progress and scope of our R&D efforts, including preclinical studies and clinical trials; • the cost, timing and outcome of regulatory reviews; • the expansion of our sales and marketing capabilities; • administrative expenses; • the possibility of acquiring additional manufacturing capabilities or office facilities; • the possibility of acquiring other companies or new products; • the establishment of additional collaborative relationships with other companies; and • costs associated with the defense, settlement and adverse results of litigation and government investigations. We may in the future require additional funding, which could be in the form of proceeds from equity or debt financings. If such funding is required, we cannot assure that it will be available to us on favorable terms, if at all. Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements We do not have any off-balance sheet arrangements that are currently material or reasonably likely to be material to our consolidated financial position or results of operations. 64 Table of Contents Contractual Obligations Our contractual obligations consist of debt obligations, capital and operating leases, as well as purchase obligations primarily in the form of capital commitments, purchase obligations for active pharmaceutical ingredients and inventory-related items and clinical trials contracts. The following table summarizes our significant enforceable and legally binding obligations, future commitments and obligations related to all contracts that we are likely to continue regardless of the fact that they are cancelable as of December 31, 2007 (in thousands): Payments due by Period Contractual Obligations Total Less than oneyear 1-3 years 3-5 years More than 5years Convertible senior notes(1) $ 1,300,000 $ — $ — $ 650,000 $ 650,000 Capital lease obligations 621 286 259 76 — Operating lease obligations 121,037 26,080 40,394 23,767 30,796 Capital commitments(2) 17,702 17,106 596 — — Purchase obligations(3)(5) 715,207 274,396 259,581 139,648 41,582 Clinical trials(4) 268,002 130,272 122,924 14,806 — Total $ 2,422,569 $ 448,140 $ 423,754 $ 828,297 $ 722,378 (1) At December 31, 2007, we had outstanding principal of $1.30 billion on the Notes that we issued in April 2006. (2) At December 31, 2007, we had firm capital project commitments of approximately $17.7 million primarily relating to the expansion of certain aspects of our manufacturing capabilities and the upgrading of our facilities. (3) At December 31, 2007, we had firm purchase commitments related to active pharmaceutical ingredients and certain inventory-related activities. The amounts related to active pharmaceutical ingredients only represent minimum purchase requirements. Actual purchases are expected to significantly exceed these amounts. (4) At December 31, 2007, we had several clinical studies in various clinical trial phases. Our most significant clinical trial expenditures are to CROs. Although most of our contracts with CROs are cancelable, we generally have not cancelled such contracts. These amounts reflect commitments based on existing contracts and do not reflect any future modifications to, or termination of, existing contracts and anticipated or potential new contracts. (5) In addition to the above, we have committed to make potential future milestone payments to third parties as part of licensing and development programs. Payments under these agreements generally become due and payable only upon achievement of certain developmental, regulatory and/or commercial milestones. Because the achievement of these milestones is neither probable nor reasonably estimable, such contingencies have not been recorded on our Consolidated Balance Sheet and have not been included in the table above. (6) With respect to our total gross unrecognized tax benefit liabilities of $115.1 million as of December 31, 2007, we are unable to make a reasonably reliable estimate of the period of cash settlement, if any, with the respective taxing authorities. Such amounts were included in long-term income taxes payable on our Consolidated Balance Sheet, and have not been included in the table above. Recent Accounting Pronouncements In December 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 141(revised 2007), Business Combinations (SFAS 141R). SFAS 141R establishes principles and requirements for recognizing and measuring assets acquired, liabilities assumed and any noncontrolling interest in the acquiree in a business combination. SFAS 141R also provides guidance for recognizing and measuring goodwill acquired in a business combination, and requires the acquirer to disclose information it needs to evaluate and understand the financial effect of the business combination. As SFAS 141R is effective for business combination transactions for which the acquisition date is on or after December 15, 2008, we do not know whether SFAS 141R will have a material impact to our prospective Consolidated Financial Statements. 65 Table of Contents In December 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 160, Noncontrolling Interest in Consolidated Financial Statements, an amendment of Accounting Research Bulletin No. 51, Consolidated Financial Statements (SFAS 160). SFAS 160 establishes accounting and reporting standards for ownership interests in subsidiaries held by parties other than the parent, the amount of consolidated net income (loss) attributable to the parent and to the noncontrolling interest, changes in a parent’s ownership interest and the valuation of retained noncontrolling equity investments when a subsidiary is deconsolidated. SFAS 160 also establishes reporting requirements that identify and distinguish between the interest of the parent and the interest of the noncontrolling owners. SFAS 160 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2008. We are currently evaluating the effect the adoption of SFAS 160 will have on our Consolidated Financial Statements. ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK Foreign Currency Exchange Risk Our operations include manufacturing and sales activities in the United States, Canada and Ireland as well as sales activities in countries outside the United States, including Europe and Australia. As a result, our financial results could be significantly affected by factors such as changes in foreign currency exchange rates or weak economic conditions in the foreign markets in which we distribute our products. Our operating results are exposed to changes in foreign currency exchange rates between the U.S. dollar and various foreign currencies, the most significant of which are the Euro, the British pound and the Australian dollar. When the U.S. dollar strengthens against these currencies, the relative value of sales made in the respective foreign currency decreases. Conversely, when the U.S. dollar weakens against these currencies, the relative amounts of such sales increase. Overall, we are a net receiver of foreign currencies and, therefore, benefit from a weaker U.S. dollar and are adversely affected by a stronger U.S. dollar relative to those foreign currencies in which we transact significant amounts of business. A significant percentage of our product sales are denominated in foreign currencies. We enter into foreign exchange forward contracts and foreign exchange option contracts to partially mitigate the impact of changes in currency exchange rates on cash flows from our sales denominated in foreign currencies. We also hedge a portion of our accounts receivable balances denominated in foreign currencies, which reduces but does not eliminate our exposure to currency fluctuations between the date a sale is recorded and the date that cash is collected. In general, the market risks of these contracts are offset by corresponding gains and losses on the transactions being hedged. In recent years, foreign currency exchange fluctuations have primarily had a positive impact to product sales and gross margin; however, the full impact of the foreign currency fluctuations have been moderated by our hedge program. 66 Table of Contents The following table summarizes the notional amounts, average currency exchange rates and fair values of our open foreign exchange forward and option contracts at December 31, 2007. All contracts have maturities of 18 months or less. Average rates are stated in terms of the amount of U.S. dollars per foreign currency. Fair values represent estimated settlement amounts at December 31, 2007 (notional amounts and fair values in U.S. dollars in thousands): Foreign Exchange Forward Contracts Currency NotionalAmount Weighted AverageSettlement Price Fair Value British Pound $ 80,435 1.98 $ (78 ) Euro 979,683 1.43 (23,263 ) Australian Dollar 43,555 0.85 (986 ) Total $ 1,103,673 $ (24,327 ) Foreign Exchange Option Contracts Currency NotionalAmount Weighted AverageStrike Price Fair Value British Pound $ 92,183 2.00 $ 4,124 Euro 397,457 1.39 7,585 Australian Dollar 21,097 0.86 1,116 Total $ 510,737 $ 12,825 Total Foreign Exchange Forward and Option Contracts $ 1,614,410 $ (11,502 ) The total notional amount of $1.61 billion and total fair value relating to our liabilities of $11.5 million on our open foreign exchange forward and option contracts at December 31, 2007 compares with a total notional amount of $1.12 billion and a total fair value relating to our liabilities of $7.1 million on our open foreign exchange forward contracts at December 31, 2006. Interest Rate Risk Our portfolio of available-for-sale marketable securities and our fixed and variable-rate liabilities create an exposure to interest rate risk. With respect to our investment portfolio, we adhere to an investment policy that requires us to limit amounts invested in securities based on duration, industry group and investment type and issuer, except for securities issued by the U.S. government. The goals of our investment policy, in order of priority, are as follows: • safety and preservation of principal and diversification of risk; • liquidity of investments sufficient to meet cash flow requirements; and • competitive after-tax rate of return. 67 Table of Contents The following table summarizes the expected maturities and average interest rates of our interest-generating assets and interest-bearing liabilities at December 31, 2007 (dollars in thousands): Years ending December 31, Total FairValue atDecember 31,2007 2008 2009 2010 2011 2012 Thereafter Assets Available-for-sale debt securities $ 750,740 $ 407,480 $ 251,277 $ 431,126 $ 143,225 $ - $ 1,983,848 Average interest rate 4.5% 4.1% 4.3% 4.1% 3.9% Liabilities Convertible senior notes(1) $ - $ - $ - $ 650,000 $ - $ 650,000 $ 1,300,000 Average interest rate 0.5% 0.6% Capital lease obligations, including current portion $ 286 $ 159 $ 100 $ 57 $ 19 $ - $ 621 Average interest rate 7.2% 6.3% 5.3% 3.0% 3.0% (1) In April 2006, we issued $650.0 million principal amount of convertible senior notes due 2011 (2011 Notes) and $650.0 million principal amount of convertible senior notes due 2013 (2013 Notes) in a private placement pursuant to Rule 144A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended. The 2011 Notes and 2013 Notes were issued at par and bear interest rates of 0.50% and 0.625%, respectively, and may be converted subject to certain circumstances. Credit Risk In February 2008, we began observing the failed auctions for auction rate securities whose underlying assets are comprised of student loans. As of December 31, 2007, we held approximately $157.7 million of auction rate securities within our available-for-sale long-term marketable securities of which $145.1 million were securities whose underlying assets were comprised of student loans. Our auction rate securities comprised approximately 5% of our total cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities as of December 31, 2007. Most of our auction rate securities, including those subject to the failed auctions, are currently rated AAA, consistent with the high quality rating required by our investment policy. We believe that given our cash and marketable securities position, our expected operating cash flows as well as access to funds through our credit facility, we are able to hold the securities until there is a recovery in the auction market and the related securities, which may be at final maturity. Our accounts receivable balance at December 31, 2007 was $795.1 million, compared to $609.3 million at December 31, 2006. The growth in our accounts receivable balances was primarily due to higher product sales of our HIV products in the United States and Europe. In certain countries where payments are typically slow, primarily Greece, Italy, Portugal and Spain, our aggregated accounts receivable balance was significant. In most cases, these slow payment practices reflect the pace at which governmental entities reimburse our customers. This, in turn, may increase the credit risk related to certain of our customers. Sales to customers in countries that tend to be relatively slow-paying have in the past increased, and in the future may further increase, the average length of time that accounts receivable are outstanding. At December 31, 2007, our past due accounts receivable for Greece, Italy, Portugal and Spain totaled $286.3 million, of which $147.6 million was more than 120 days past due. To date, we have not experienced significant losses with respect to the collection of our accounts receivable, and we believe that substantially all of our accounts receivable balances are collectible. We perform credit evaluations of our customers’ financial condition and generally have not required collateral. 68 Table of Contents",2023-12-30 19:04:13.899116

Business Highlights During 2008, we made significant progress in various areas of our business. We grew our product sales significantly, executed on product approvals and product launches in multiple territories, made progress on moving our product candidates forward and continued to strengthen our worldwide organization and infrastructure to support our expanded international footprint and business activities. Our commercial achievements for the year included the continued rollout of Atripla in the European Union (EU), driving growth of Atripla and Truvada in the United States and Canada, launching Viread for hepatitis B in the EU and the United States, making gains in the PAH market with Letairis, as well as continuing the expansion of our sales and marketing infrastructure, including the establishment of new international marketing subsidiaries. During the year, we received marketing authorization for Viread for the treatment of chronic hepatitis B in adults in all 27 member states of the European Union, Turkey, New Zealand, Australia, the United States and Canada. Along with the marketing approvals we received in 2008, we made significant advances on the compounds and product candidates in our research and development (R&D) pipeline, including: • In the HIV area, we received positive feedback from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) during the latter part of the year, regarding our development plans for elvitegravir, our novel integrase inhibitor for HIV which we licensed from Japan Tobacco Inc. in 2005; GS 9350, our pharmacoenhancer that is in development as a boosting agent for certain HIV medicines; and our single 44 Table of Contents tablet fixed dose regimen of elvitegravir, GS 9350 and Truvada. The FDA agreed with our proposal to simultaneously develop these three product candidates, allowing us to eventually support three separate new drug application (NDA) filings with four Phase 3 clinical studies: one study for elvitegravir, two studies for the single tablet fixed dose regimen mentioned above, and one study for GS 9350. As a result of this proposal, we will be combining the second of our two previously planned Phase 3 studies for elvitegravir with the first Phase 3 elvitegravir study which we began dosing in the third quarter of 2008. • In hepatitis C, we completed dosing of patients in the continuation of the Phase 1b study of GS 9190, a non-nucleoside polymerase inhibitor, and began enrolling the Phase 2 study in patients infected with the hepatitis C virus. During the year, we completed our Phase 2a study of GS 9450, the caspase inhibitor we licensed from LG Life Sciences in 2007, and expect to initiate the Phase 2b study in the second quarter of 2009 to evaluate the longer term safety and efficacy of GS 9450. We are enrolling patients with nonalcoholic steadohepatitis in a Phase 2a study of GS 9450 to evaluate its safety and effect on liver enzymes and anticipate having data from this study before the end of 2009. • In the cardiovascular area, we completed enrollment of one of our two Phase 3 studies for darusentan for the treatment of resistant hypertension and we anticipate having data from this study in the second quarter of 2009. We continued to enroll patients in our second Phase 3 study for darusentan, and we anticipate completing the enrollment before the end of 2009 with data available in early 2010. We are developing cicletanine for PAH and expect to initiate a Phase 2 clinical trial examining both once daily and twice daily dosing in early 2009. We are also preparing to initiate a Phase 3 study of ambrisentan in patients with pulmonary hypertension in idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis in the second quarter of 2009. • In the respiratory area, we submitted an NDA for aztreonam for inhalation solution for the treatment of cystic fibrosis (CF) to the FDA in November 2007. In September 2008, we received a complete response letter from the FDA informing us that the FDA will not approve our NDA for aztreonam for inhalation for the treatment of CF and requesting an additional Phase 3 clinical study. In November 2008, we filed a request for a formal dispute resolution with the FDA. In February 2009, in response to our appeal, the FDA notified us that it is reiterating its position that we will need to conduct another clinical study of aztreonam for inhalation solution before we can resubmit our NDA. We have also submitted a marketing authorization application (MAA) in the EU and received notice of acceptance and priority review by Health Canada for approval in Canada. We are still awaiting responses from the respective regulatory bodies. Also in the respiratory area, we began enrolling patients with non-CF bronchietasis in a Phase 2 study evaluating aztreonam for inhalation solution for this indication; we initiated a Phase 1 study in the fourth quarter of 2008 to evaluate the safety and tolerability of GS 9411, a novel epithelial sodium channel blocker designed to increase airway hydration for the treatment of pulmonary disease; and in the fourth quarter of 2008, we also initiated a Phase 2 study evaluating the safety and efficacy of GS 9310/11, an inhaled co-formulation of fosfomycin and tobramycin, for bacterial infections associated with CF. Financial Highlights Our operating results for the year were led by total product sales of $5.08 billion. Antiviral product sales (Truvada, Atripla, Viread, Hepsera and Emtriva) increased 36% to $4.67 billion in 2008 from $3.44 billion in 2007, and were the key drivers for total product sales growth of 36% for 2008 as compared to 2007. With the continued uptake of Atripla in the United States and product launches in Europe, Atripla contributed $1.57 billion, or 34%, to our total 2008 antiviral product sales. The growth of Atripla product sales and its increased proportion to overall product sales caused total product gross margin to decrease as expected to 78% in 2008 from 79% in 2007, due primarily to the efavirenz component of Atripla sales at zero gross margin. Truvada product sales for 2008 comprised $2.11 billion, or 45% of our total 2008 antiviral product sales. Truvada product sales for 2008 increased 33% from 2007 primarily due to continued sales volume growth as well as a favorable foreign currency exchange impact. Foreign currency fluctuations in 2008 had a favorable impact of approximately $148.2 million on total revenues and $92.6 million on pre-tax income when compared to 2007. 45 Table of Contents Royalty revenues that we recognized from our collaborations with corporate partners were $218.2 million in 2008, a decrease of 53% from royalty revenues of $468.2 million in 2007. The decrease in royalty revenues was due primarily to decreased Tamiflu sales by Roche related to pandemic planning initiatives worldwide. Operating expenses which include R&D, selling, general and administrative (SG&A) and purchased in-process research and development (IPR&D) expenses increased $233.2 million in 2008, or 18%, compared to 2007, reflecting the increased research and clinical study activity in our development pipeline, our expanded commercial activities worldwide, as well as the higher headcount, infrastructure and technology-related costs required to support the continued growth of our business. In 2008, we continued to be very focused on cost control and operating margins and will continue to do so in 2009. Our operating margin is impacted by the efavirenz component of a growing Atripla revenue stream and a declining trend for Tamiflu royalties. Cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities increased by $517.2 million during the year, driven primarily by our operating cash flows of $2.20 billion. Our strong cash position allowed us to complete two accelerated share repurchase transactions as well as make significant common stock repurchases from the open market under the $3.00 billion stock repurchase program authorized by our Board of Directors (Board) in October 2007, which expires in December 2010. During 2008, we repurchased a total of $1.97 billion under our stock repurchase program, or approximately 39.2 million shares. As of December 31, 2008, the remaining authorized amount of stock repurchases that may be made under the Board authorized stock repurchase program was $998.1 million. In light of the volatility and developments in the financial markets, we continued to review our cash equivalents and marketable securities carefully as well as invest prudently in 2008. Safety and preservation of principal and diversification of risk, as well as liquidity of investments sufficient to meet cash flow requirements, continued to be of primary importance to our investment goals. This approach helped protect us from the significant risks in the credit markets in 2008 while allowing us to meet our operating cash flow requirements and execute on other opportunities such as our share repurchases. 2009 Outlook We anticipate that the high level of productivity and financial performance experienced in 2008 will continue in 2009. Our operating objectives include the expansion of our commercial markets, both from a franchise perspective as well as leveraging the new international marketing subsidiaries that we have established in the last two years, reaching our significant R&D development timelines, continuing to strengthen our pipeline with internally developed and/or externally in-licensed or purchased opportunities and strengthening our key alliances. From a commercial standpoint, a number of internal and external initiatives may help promote the continued growth of our franchises. In the HIV area, we should be favorably impacted by the presentation of important data sets at upcoming medical conferences, continued testing and screening initiatives, and recent changes in HIV treatment guidelines. In the area of hepatitis B, a broad platform of educational activities concentrated in Asian American communities, highlighting the need to screen, diagnose and link patients to care, will help support Viread for HBV. In the United States, since the launch of Viread for HBV in August 2008, our hepatitis sales and medical affairs teams have concentrated their efforts solely on promotion of Viread. In the cardiovascular area, we will continue to build our presence within the PAH community and to support the growth of Letairis in 2009. We are mindful that conditions in our current macroeconomic environment could affect our ability to achieve our goals. Some of the factors that could affect our business include: the volatility in foreign currency exchange rates, government pricing pressures in both the United States and internationally, as well as changes in the financial health and/or practices of our significant business partners and customers. Although we have not yet seen significant changes, we will continue to monitor the credit and foreign currency exchange markets, 46 Table of Contents developments in health care reform and legislation as well as the practices of our suppliers, manufacturers, corporate partners and customers, and will adjust our business processes as needed to mitigate these risks to our business. The successes we experienced in 2008 have helped us maintain and build a financially sound business model that we believe will allow us to continue to expand our commercial, collaborative and R&D activities, and maintain the infrastructure to ensure quality and compliance in all areas of our business. As we continue to grow our business and achieve greater operational leverage, we remain focused on profitable revenue growth and prudent expense management that we believe will enable solid execution of our operating objectives for 2009. Critical Accounting Policies, Estimates and Judgments The discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based on our Consolidated Financial Statements, which have been prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses and related disclosures. On an ongoing basis, we evaluate our estimates, including those related to revenue recognition, allowance for doubtful accounts, prepaid royalties, clinical trial accruals, our tax provision and stock-based compensation. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other market specific assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results, however, may differ significantly from these estimates. We believe the following critical accounting policies reflect the more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our Consolidated Financial Statements. Revenue Recognition Product Sales We recognize revenues from product sales when there is persuasive evidence that an arrangement exists, delivery to the customer has occurred, the price is fixed or determinable and collectibility is reasonably assured. We record estimated reductions to revenues for government rebates such as Medicaid reimbursements, customer incentives such as cash discounts for prompt payment, distributor fees and expected returns of expired products. These estimates are deducted from gross product sales at the time such revenues are recognized. Of these reductions from gross product sales, government rebates significantly impact our reported net product sales and are based upon certain estimates that require complex and significant judgment by management. Government Rebates We estimate amounts payable by us to government managed Medicaid programs as well as to certain other qualifying federal, state and foreign government programs for the reimbursement of portions of the retail price of prescriptions filled that are covered by these programs. Government rebates that are invoiced directly to us are recorded in other accrued liabilities on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. For qualified programs that can purchase our products through wholesalers at a lower contractual government price, the wholesalers charge back to us the difference between their acquisition cost and the lower price, which we record as allowances against accounts receivable. Although we may pay rebates in countries outside of the United States, to date, payments made to foreign governments have not represented a significant portion of our total government rebates. For government programs in the United States, we estimate these sales allowances based on contractual terms, historical utilization rates, new information regarding changes in these programs’ regulations and guidelines that would impact the amount of the actual rebates, our expectations regarding future utilization rates for these programs and, for U.S. product sales, channel inventory data obtained from our major U.S. wholesalers in accordance with our inventory management agreements. During 2008, 2007 and 2006, U.S government rebates 47 Table of Contents of $625.0 million, $423.3 million and $232.5 million, respectively, representing 10%, 10% and 8% of total gross product sales, respectively, were deducted from gross product sales. Based on the current information available to us, actual government rebates claimed for these periods have varied by less than 3% from our estimates recorded in those periods. As of December 31, 2008 and 2007, we had accrued U.S. government rebates of $173.4 million and $114.1 million, respectively, in other accrued liabilities and an allowance of $32.8 million and $25.3 million, respectively, recorded against accounts receivable. The following table summarizes the aggregate activity in our U.S. government rebates allowance and accrued liabilities accounts: Balance atBeginningof Year Chargedto Expense DeductedfromAccruals Balance atEnd ofYear Year ended December 31, 2008: Government rebates allowances and accrued liabilities Activity related to 2008 sales $ — $ 627,935 $ 424,298 $ 203,637 Activity related to sales prior to 2008 139,370 (2,965 ) 133,769 2,636 Total $ 139,370 $ 624,970 $ 558,067 $ 206,273 Year ended December 31, 2007: Government rebates allowances and accrued liabilities Activity related to 2007 sales $ — $ 426,084 $ 298,189 $ 127,895 Activity related to sales prior to 2007 75,663 (2,753 ) 61,435 11,475 Total $ 75,663 $ 423,331 $ 359,624 $ 139,370 Allowance for Doubtful Accounts We also maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments. This allowance is based on our analysis of several factors including, but not limited to, contractual payment terms, historical payment patterns of our customers and individual customer circumstances, an analysis of days sales outstanding by customer and geographic region and a review of the local economic environment and its potential impact on government funding and reimbursement practices. If the financial condition of our customers or the economic environment in which they operate were to deteriorate, resulting in an inability to make payments, additional allowances may be required. Our allowance for doubtful accounts balance as a percentage of total accounts receivable did not materially change from December 31, 2007 to December 31, 2008. We believe that the allowance for doubtful accounts is adequate to cover anticipated losses under current conditions; however, significant deterioration in any of the above factors, especially with respect to the government funding and reimbursement practices in the European market could materially change these expectations and may result in an increase to our allowance for doubtful accounts. Prepaid Royalties We capitalize royalties that we have prepaid at cost, specifically those related to the emtricitabine royalties we paid to Emory University (Emory) for the HIV indication, based on the present value of the future royalty obligation that we would expect to pay to Emory assuming certain expected future levels of our product sales incorporating emtricitabine. The present value of our future royalty obligation was derived using our weighted-average cost of capital. We review quarterly the expected future sales levels of our products and any indicators that might require a write-down in the net recoverable value of our asset or a change in the estimated life of the prepaid royalty. Some potential indicators of impairment include the launch of a significant product by a competitor, significant deviations in recognized product sales compared to forecast and product safety issues and recalls. 48 Table of Contents We amortize our prepaid royalties based on an effective royalty rate that we derive from forecasted HIV product sales incorporating emtricitabine. Our product sales forecasts are prepared annually and determined using our best estimates of future activity upon considering such factors as historical and expected future patient usage or uptake of our products, the introduction of complimentary or combination therapies or products and future product launch plans. If a previously unanticipated and significant change occurs to our sales forecasts, including the introduction of a competing product by us or one of our competitors in the same HIV market as emtricitabine, we will prospectively update the royalty rate used to amortize our prepaid royalties which may increase future royalty expense. As of December 31, 2008, we had a prepaid royalty asset relating to the emtricitabine royalties we paid to Emory of $275.0 million. Amortization expense relating to this prepaid royalty asset was $31.8 million, $14.3 million and $15.1 million, for the years ended December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively. Clinical Trial Accruals We record accruals for estimated clinical study costs. Most of our clinical studies are performed by third party contract research organizations (CROs). These costs are a significant component of R&D expenses. During 2008, 2007 and 2006, we incurred CRO costs of $111.8 million, $65.6 million and $30.2 million, respectively. We accrue costs for clinical studies performed by CROs on a straight-line basis over the service periods specified in the contracts and adjust our estimates, if required, based upon our ongoing review of the level of effort and costs actually incurred by the CROs. We validate our accruals quarterly with our vendors and perform detailed reviews of the activities related to our significant contracts. Based upon the results of these validation processes, we assess the appropriateness of our accruals and make any adjustments we deem necessary to ensure that our expenses reflect the actual effort incurred by the CROs. Generally, a significant portion of the total clinical trial costs is associated with start up activities for the trial and patient enrollment. We extensively outsource our clinical trial activities and usually perform only a small portion of the start-up activities in-house. As a result, CROs typically perform most of the total start-up activities for our trials, including document preparation, site identification, screening and preparation, pre-study visits, training and program management. Start-up costs usually occur within a few months after the contract has been executed and are milestone or event driven in nature. The remaining clinical activities and related costs, such as patient monitoring and administration, generally occur ratably throughout the life of the individual contract or study. Most contracts are negotiated as fixed per unit prices and can vary in length between three months for a single dose Phase 1 clinical study and up to two years or more for a more complex Phase 3 clinical study. The average length of contracts in 2008, 2007 and 2006 has been at the upper end of this range in order to provide long-term safety and efficacy data to support the commercial launches of Truvada, Atripla, Viread, Hepsera, Emtriva and Letairis. All of our material CRO contracts are terminable by us upon written notice and we are generally only liable for actual effort expended by the CRO and certain non-cancelable expenses incurred at any point of termination. Amounts paid in advance relating to uncompleted services will be refunded to us if a contract is terminated. Some contracts may include additional termination payments that become due and payable if we terminate the contract. Such additional termination payments are only recorded if it becomes probable that a contract will be terminated. Through December 31, 2008, differences between actual and estimated activity levels for any particular study have not been material. However, if management does not receive complete and accurate information from our vendors or underestimates activity levels associated with a study at a given point in time, we may have to record additional and potentially significant R&D expenses in future periods. Tax Provision We estimate our income tax provision, including deferred tax assets and liabilities, based on significant management judgment. We evaluate the realization of all or a portion of our deferred tax assets on a quarterly basis. We record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets to the amounts that are more likely than not to be realized. We consider future taxable income, ongoing tax planning strategies and our historical financial performance in assessing the need for a valuation allowance. 49 Table of Contents If we expect to realize deferred tax assets for which we have previously recorded a valuation allowance, we will reduce the valuation allowance in the period in which such determination is first made. Such an adjustment was made in 2008 and 2007 when we determined that it was more likely than not that certain of our deferred tax assets would be realized, and therefore, we released the related valuation allowance. This resulted in a credit to goodwill of approximately $8.0 million for 2008 and an income tax benefit of approximately $15.5 million and $1.5 million for 2008 and 2007, respectively. Our future effective income tax rate may be affected by such factors as changes in tax laws, regulations or rates, changing interpretation of existing laws or regulations, the impact of accounting for stock-based compensation, changes in our international organization and changes in overall levels of income before tax. In June 2006, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued FASB Interpretation No. 48, Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes (FIN 48), an interpretation of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 109, Accounting for Income Taxes (SFAS 109). FIN 48 clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in an enterprise’s financial statements in accordance with SFAS 109 by prescribing a minimum recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. FIN 48 also provides guidance on derecognition, classification, interest and penalties, accounting in interim periods, disclosure and transition. FIN 48 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2006. On January 1, 2007, we adopted FIN 48 and increased our liability for unrecognized tax benefits by $14.1 million with a corresponding charge to the opening balance of accumulated deficit, as permitted under FIN 48. In addition, we reclassified $68.4 million of unrecognized tax benefits from short-term income taxes payable and noncurrent deferred tax assets to long-term income taxes payable. As of the date of adoption, we had total federal, state and foreign unrecognized tax benefits of $86.2 million recorded primarily in long-term income taxes payable on our Consolidated Balance Sheet, including accrued liabilities related to interest of $4.0 million. Of the total unrecognized tax benefits, $78.0 million, if recognized, would have reduced our effective tax rate in the period of recognition. As permitted under the provisions of FIN 48, we have continued to classify interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits as part of our income tax provision in our Consolidated Statements of Operations. At December 31, 2008 and 2007, we had total federal, state and foreign unrecognized tax benefits of $119.3 million and $111.7 million, respectively, including interest of $10.1 million and $8.3 million, respectively. Of the total unrecognized tax benefits at December 31, 2008 and 2007, $111.1 million and $103.5 million, respectively, if recognized, would reduce our effective tax rate in the period of recognition. During 2008, we reached agreement with the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) on several issues related to the examinations of our federal income tax returns for 2003 and 2004. As a result, we reduced our unrecognized tax benefits by $30.0 million. As of December 31, 2008, we believe it is reasonably possible that our unrecognized tax benefits will decrease by approximately $56.0 million in the next 12 months as we expect to have clarification from the IRS around certain of our uncertain tax positions. With respect to the remaining unrecognized tax benefits, we are currently unable to make a reasonable estimate as to the period of cash settlement, if any, with the respective taxing authorities. We file federal, state and foreign income tax returns in many jurisdictions in the United States and abroad. For U.S. federal and California income tax purposes, the statute of limitations remains open for all years from inception due to our utilization of net operating losses related to prior years. Our income tax returns are audited by federal, state and foreign tax authorities. We are currently under examination by the IRS for the 2003 and 2004 tax years and by various state and foreign jurisdictions. There are 50 Table of Contents differing interpretations of tax laws and regulations, and as a result, significant disputes may arise with these tax authorities involving issues of the timing and amount of deductions and allocations of income among various tax jurisdictions. We periodically evaluate our exposures associated with our tax filing positions. We record liabilities related to uncertain tax positions based upon FIN 48. We do not believe any of the currently pending items will have a material adverse effect on our Consolidated Financial Statements, although an adverse resolution of several or more of these items in any period could have a material impact on the results of operations for that period. Prior to the adoption of FIN 48, we recorded liabilities related to uncertain tax positions based upon SFAS No. 5, Accounting for Contingencies. Stock-based Compensation In December 2004, the FASB issued SFAS No. 123 (revised 2004), Share-Based Payment (SFAS 123R), which requires that all share-based payments to employees and directors, including grants of stock options, be recognized in the statement of operations based on their fair values. SFAS 123R supersedes Accounting Principles Board Opinion No. 25, Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees (APB 25) and amends SFAS No. 95, Statement of Cash Flows. On January 1, 2006, we adopted SFAS 123R using the modified prospective method of adoption as permitted under SFAS 123R, which requires that compensation expense be recorded for all nonvested stock options and other stock-based awards as of the beginning of the first quarter of adoption. In connection with our adoption of SFAS 123R, we refined our valuation assumptions and the methodologies used to derive those assumptions; however, we elected to continue using the Black-Scholes option valuation model. The fair value of stock options granted prior to the adoption of SFAS 123R was calculated using the multiple option approach while the fair value of stock options granted beginning January 1, 2006 was calculated using the single option approach. Concurrent with our adoption of SFAS 123R, we determined that a blend of historical volatility along with implied volatility for traded options on our stock would be a better measure of market conditions and expected volatility. Previously, we used historical stock price volatility as it was the most reliable source of volatility data. We estimate the weighted-average expected term of our stock options based on historical cancellation and exercise data related to our stock options as well as the contractual term and vesting terms of the awards. We record stock-based compensation expense using a graded vesting expense attribution approach for nonvested stock options granted prior to the adoption of SFAS 123R consistent with the expense attribution approach used for our historical SFAS 123 disclosures and use a straight-line expense attribution approach for stock options granted after the adoption of SFAS 123R. We currently believe that the straight-line expense attribution approach better reflects the level of service to be provided by our employees over the vesting period of our awards. Stock-based compensation expense related to stock options is recognized net of estimated forfeitures. We estimate forfeitures based on our historical experience. As a result of the adoption of SFAS 123R, we will only recognize a tax benefit from stock-based compensation in additional paid-in-capital (APIC) if an incremental tax benefit is realized after all other tax attributes currently available to us have been utilized. In addition, we have elected to account for the indirect benefits of stock-based compensation on the research tax credit and the extraterritorial income deduction through the Consolidated Statements of Operations rather than through APIC. During the years ended December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006, we recognized stock-based compensation expense of $153.4 million, $184.6 million and $133.8 million, respectively, in operating expenses, and we capitalized $9.9 million, $9.8 million and $10.2 million, respectively, to inventory. As of December 31, 2008, we had unrecognized stock-based compensation of $405.3 million related to nonvested stock options, which we expect to expense over an estimated weighted-average period of 2.9 years. Our management has discussed the development, selection and disclosure of these critical accounting policies with the Audit Committee of our Board of Directors, and the Audit Committee has reviewed the disclosure presented above relating to these critical accounting policies. 51 Table of Contents Results of Operations Total Revenues We had total revenues of $5.34 billion in 2008, $4.23 billion in 2007 and $3.03 billion in 2006. Included in total revenues were product sales, royalty revenues and contract and other revenues. Product Sales Product sales for the last three years consisted of the following (in thousands): 2008 Change 2007 Change 2006 Antiviral products: Truvada $ 2,106,687 33 % $ 1,589,229 33 % $ 1,194,292 Atripla 1,572,455 74 % 903,381 339 % 205,729 Viread 621,187 1 % 613,169 (11 )% 689,356 Hepsera 341,023 13 % 302,722 31 % 230,531 Emtriva 31,080 (1 )% 31,493 (13 )% 36,393 Total antiviral products 4,672,432 36 % 3,439,994 46 % 2,356,301 AmBisome 289,651 10 % 262,571 18 % 223,031 Letairis 112,855 437 % 21,020 — — Other 9,858 4 % 9,524 7 % 8,865 Total product sales $ 5,084,796 36 % $ 3,733,109 44 % $ 2,588,197 Total product sales increased by 36% in 2008 compared to 2007, due primarily to an overall increase in our antiviral product sales including the strong growth of Atripla sales as well as the continued growth of Truvada sales. Foreign currency denominated product sales experienced a net benefit from the depreciation of the U.S. dollar of approximately $148.2 million for 2008 compared to 2007. Total product sales increased by 44% in 2007 compared to 2006, due primarily to an increase in our total product sales volume of $1.04 billion and a favorable foreign currency exchange impact of $97.9 million. A significant percentage of our product sales continued to be denominated in foreign currencies. We used foreign currency forward and option contracts to hedge a percentage of our forecasted international sales, primarily those denominated in Euro. This reduced, but did not eliminate, fluctuations in sales due to changes in foreign currency exchange rates, as seen by the net benefit mentioned above. Antiviral Products Antiviral product sales in 2008 increased by 36% compared to 2007 and by 46% in 2007 compared to 2006, driven primarily by sales volume growth of Atripla and Truvada, as well as a favorable foreign currency exchange impact. • Truvada Truvada sales increased by 33% in 2008 compared to 2007 driven primarily by sales volume growth in the United States and Europe, and a favorable foreign currency exchange impact. Truvada sales increased by 33% in 2007 compared to 2006 driven primarily by strong sales volume growth in Europe as well as a favorable foreign currency exchange environment in 2007. Truvada sales accounted for 45%, 46% and 51% of our total antiviral product sales for 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively. • Atripla Atripla sales increased by 74% in 2008 compared to 2007, driven primarily by the continued uptake of Atripla in the United States, as well as launches of the product in most European countries. Atripla sales increased 339% in 2007 compared to 2006, due primarily to the first full year of Atripla sales in 52 Table of Contents 2007 as Atripla was launched in the United States in July 2006 as well as the continued strong uptake of Atripla in the United States. We consolidate 100% of Atripla product sales because we are the primary beneficiary of our joint venture with Bristol Myers-Squibb Company (BMS) in the United States. Outside of the United States, we also recognize 100% of Atripla product sales. The efavirenz portion of our Atripla sales was approximately $576.0 million, $334.3 million and $76.0 million in 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively. Atripla sales accounted for 34%, 26% and 9% of our total antiviral product sales for 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively. Sales of Atripla in the European Union were not significant in 2007 as Atripla was approved for sale in the European Union in December 2007. • Other Antiviral Products Other antiviral product sales, which include product sales of Viread, Hepsera and Emtriva, increased by 5% in 2008 compared to 2007 driven primarily by a 13% increase in Hepsera sales which benefited from a favorable foreign currency impact as well as sales volume growth in certain European countries. Other antiviral product sales decreased by 1% in 2007 compared to 2006 driven primarily by an 11% and 13% decrease in the sales of Viread and Emtriva, respectively, due to the impact of patients switching from Viread and Emtriva containing regimens to regimens containing Truvada and/or Atripla in countries where these combination products were available, partially offset by a 31% increase in Hepsera sales due primarily to sales volume growth across all major geographical regions and a favorable foreign currency exchange environment. AmBisome Sales of AmBisome increased 10% in 2008 compared to 2007, due primarily to a favorable foreign currency exchange impact and sales volume growth in certain European markets. Sales of AmBisome increased 18% in 2007 compared to 2006, due primarily to sales volume growth in Europe as well as a favorable foreign currency exchange impact. AmBisome product sales in the United States relate solely to our sales of AmBisome to Astellas Pharma Inc. which are recorded at our manufacturing cost. Letairis Sales of Letairis for the treatment of PAH increased 437% in 2008 compared to 2007, driven primarily by sales volume growth in the United States as Letairis was launched in June 2007. We expect total product sales to continue to grow in 2009 as we continue to expand our sales and marketing efforts. Royalty Revenues The following table summarizes the period over period changes in our royalty revenues (in thousands): 2008 Change 2007 Change 2006 Royalty revenues $ 218,180 (53 )% $ 468,155 12 % $ 416,526 Our most significant source of royalty revenues for 2008, 2007 and 2006 was from sales of Tamiflu by F. Hoffmann-La Roche Ltd (together with Hoffmann-La Roche Inc., Roche). Royalty revenues for 2008 were $218.2 million, a decrease of 53% compared to 2007, driven primarily by the recognition of Tamiflu royalties from Roche of $155.5 million in 2008 compared to Tamiflu royalties from Roche of $414.5 million in 2007. The lower Tamiflu royalties for 2008 was due primarily to decreased Roche sales related to pandemic planning initiatives worldwide. Royalty revenues for 2007 were $468.2 million, an increase of 12% compared to 2006, driven primarily by the recognition of higher Tamiflu royalties from Roche in 2007, compared to $364.6 million recorded in 2006. The higher Tamiflu royalties for 2007 were due to the 53 Table of Contents higher Tamiflu sales recorded by Roche, including sales related to pandemic planning initiatives worldwide during 2007. We recognize royalties on Tamiflu sales by Roche in the quarter following the quarter in which Tamiflu is sold. Cost of Goods Sold and Product Gross Margin The following table summarizes the period over period changes in our product sales (in thousands), cost of goods sold (in thousands) and product gross margin: 2008 Change 2007 Change 2006 Total product sales $ 5,084,796 36% $ 3,733,109 44% $ 2,588,197 Cost of goods sold $ 1,127,246 47% $ 768,771 77% $ 433,320 Product gross margin 78% 79% 83% Our product gross margin for 2008 was 78% compared to 79% for 2007 and 83% for 2006. The decreases in product gross margin are due primarily to the growing proportion of Atripla sales, which include the efavirenz portion at zero product gross margin and the impact of changes in the product and geographic mix of our product sales. A higher mix of Atripla product sales decreases our overall product gross margin. Although we record 100% of Atripla product sales, we only benefit from the product gross margin on the Truvada portion of Atripla sales. The efavirenz portion of Atripla sales carries a zero product gross profit and gross margin since we purchase efavirenz from BMS at BMS’s net selling price of efavirenz. We expect our product gross margin in 2009 to be lower compared to 2008, due primarily to higher expected Atripla sales. Research and Development Expenses The following table summarizes the period over period changes in the major components of our R&D expenses (in thousands): 2008 Change 2007 Change 2006 Research $ 159,148 21 % $ 131,019 54 % $ 85,202 Clinical development 449,598 25 % 361,091 52 % 238,270 Pharmaceutical development 113,022 14 % 98,916 64 % 60,389 Total research and development $ 721,768 22 % $ 591,026 54 % $ 383,861 R&D expenses consist primarily of personnel costs, including salaries, benefits and stock-based compensation, clinical studies performed by CROs, materials and supplies, license fees and overhead allocations consisting of various support and facilities related costs. Our R&D activities are separated into three main categories: research, clinical development and pharmaceutical development. Research costs typically consist of preclinical and toxicology costs. Clinical development costs include costs for Phase 1, 2, 3 and 4 clinical trials. Pharmaceutical development expenses consist of costs for product formulation and chemical analysis. R&D expenses in 2008 increased by $130.7 million or 22%, compared to 2007, due primarily to increased clinical study expenses of $75.2 million primarily in the antiviral and cardiovascular areas, as well as increased compensation and benefit expenses of $50.7 million due primarily to higher headcount. R&D expenses in 2007 increased by $207.2 million or 54%, compared to 2006, due primarily to increased compensation and benefit expenses of $65.2 million due largely to higher headcount, increased clinical study 54 Table of Contents expenses of $58.6 million and increased contract service expenses of $19.6 million relating to clinical, product development and research activities in our cardiovascular programs. In addition, we paid a $20.0 million up-front license fee to LG Life Sciences, Ltd. (LGLS) and a $13.5 million license related fee to PARI GmbH (PARI) in 2007, both of which we expensed as there were no future alternative uses for these technologies. In general, significant collaboration payments, like those made to LGLS and PARI, will cause our R&D expenses to fluctuate period over period. In 2009, we expect R&D expenses to increase over 2008 levels due to increased spending on our internal and collaborative R&D efforts as we anticipate progressing our product candidates into more advanced clinical studies as well as adding more clinical development programs to our pipeline. Selling, General and Administrative Expenses The following table summarizes the period over period changes in our SG&A expenses over the last three years (in thousands): 2008 Change 2007 Change 2006 Selling, general and administrative $ 797,344 13 % $ 705,741 23 % $ 573,660 SG&A expenses for 2008 increased by $91.6 million or 13%, compared to 2007, due primarily to increased compensation and benefit expenses of $41.6 million due largely to higher headcount, increased marketing and promotional expenses of $19.9 million to support our expanded commercial operations, increased consulting and support services expenses of $13.0 million related to the growth in our business, costs of $12.4 million associated with certain employee termination related disputes in our international operations as well as increased infrastructure and technology expenses of $11.7 million. The increase in 2008 compared to 2007 was partially offset by a decrease in stock-based compensation expense of $24.8 million due primarily to the higher expense associated with unvested stock options that we had assumed from Myogen, including accelerated stock-based compensation expenses related to certain Myogen employee terminations during 2007. SG&A expenses for 2007 increased by $132.1 million or 23%, compared to 2006. The increase was due primarily to an increase in compensation and benefits expenses of $79.6 million due largely to higher headcount, as well as an increase in marketing and promotional expenses of $20.0 million in the antiviral and cardiovascular areas, including those related to our launch of Letairis for the treatment of PAH. In 2009, we expect SG&A expenses to remain essentially consistent with 2008 SG&A expenses. We believe that our 2008 organizational and geographic expansion activities will provide the appropriate infrastructure to support our business in 2009. Purchased In-process Research and Development Expenses In connection with our acquisitions of Myogen Inc. (Myogen) and Corus Pharma, Inc. (Corus) in 2006, we recorded purchased IPR&D expenses of $2.06 billion and $335.6 million, respectively, during the year ended December 31, 2006. 55 Table of Contents The purchased IPR&D expense for Myogen represented the estimated fair value of Myogen’s incomplete R&D programs that had not yet reached technological feasibility and had no alternative future uses as of the acquisition date and, therefore, was expensed upon acquisition. A summary of these programs at the acquisition date, updated for subsequent changes in status of development, is as follows: Program Description Status of Development EstimatedAcquisition DateFair Value(in millions) Ambrisentan An orally active, non-sulfonamide, propanoic acid-class, endothelin receptor antagonist (ERA) for the treatment of PAH. Phase 3 clinical trials were completed prior to the acquisition date. We filed an NDA with the FDA in December 2006 and, in June 2007, the FDA approved Letairis for the treatment of PAH in the United States. Additionally, in March 2007, the European Medicines Agency (EMEA) validated the marketing authorization application for ambrisentan for the treatment of PAH, filed by our collaboration partner, GSK. In April 2008, the European Commission granted GSK marketing authorization for ambrisentan for the treatment of PAH, which is marketed under the name Volibris by GSK. $ 1,413.7 Darusentan An orally active ETA-selective ERA for the treatment of resistant hypertension. In Phase 3 clinical development as of the acquisition date and the date of this filing. $ 644.5 The estimated fair value of the purchased IPR&D was determined using the income approach, which discounts expected future cash flows to present value. We estimated the fair value of the purchased IPR&D using a present value discount rate of 14%, which is based on the estimated internal rate of return for Myogen’s operations, is comparable to the estimated weighted-average cost of capital for companies with Myogen’s profile, and represents the rate that market participants would use to value the purchased IPR&D. We compensated for the differing phases of development of ambrisentan and darusentan by probability-adjusting our estimation of the expected future cash flows associated with each program. We then determined at that time the present value of the expected future cash flows using the discount rate of 14%. The projected cash flows from the ambrisentan and darusentan programs were based on key assumptions such as estimates of revenues and operating profits related to the programs considering their stages of development; the time and resources needed to complete the development and approval of the related product candidates; the life of the potential commercialized products and associated risks, including the inherent difficulties and uncertainties in developing a drug compound such as obtaining FDA and other regulatory approvals; and risks related to the viability of and potential alternative treatments in any future target markets. For the purpose of estimating the fair value of the ambrisentan program, we estimated that the program was approximately 78% complete as of the acquisition date, based on estimated time and cost to complete, as Phase 3 clinical trials had been completed. As of the acquisition date, we estimated that we would incur future R&D costs of approximately $35 million to $45 million from the date of acquisition through and including the year when commercialization was expected to occur. Material net cash inflows were estimated to begin in 2009 for ambrisentan, assuming the necessary regulatory approvals would be received and the product would be successfully commercialized by that date. 56 Table of Contents For the purpose of estimating the fair value of the darusentan program, we estimated that the program was approximately 35% complete as of the acquisition date, based on estimated time and cost to complete, and remaining efforts would include the completion of Phase 3 clinical development as well as preparing for and filing an NDA with the FDA. As of the acquisition date, we estimated that we would incur future R&D costs of approximately $130 million to $140 million from the date of acquisition through and including the year when commercialization was expected to occur. Material net cash inflows were estimated to begin in 2012 for darusentan, assuming the necessary regulatory approvals would be received and the product would be successfully commercialized by that date. The remaining efforts for completing the darusentan IPR&D program consist primarily of clinical trials, the cost, length and success of which are extremely difficult to predict, and obtaining necessary regulatory approvals. Numerous risks and uncertainties exist that could prevent completion of development, including the possibility of unfavorable results of our clinical trials and the risk of failing to obtain FDA and other regulatory body approvals. Feedback from regulatory authorities or results from clinical trials might require modifications to or delays in later stage clinical trials or additional trials to be performed. We cannot be certain that darusentan for the treatment of resistant hypertension will be approved in the United States or in countries outside of the United States or whether marketing approvals will have significant limitations on its use. Future discussions with regulatory agencies will determine the amount of data needed and timelines for review, which may differ materially from current projections. Darusentan may never be successfully commercialized. As a result, we may make a strategic decision to discontinue development of darusentan if, for example, we believe commercialization will be difficult relative to other opportunities in our pipeline. If this program cannot be completed on a timely basis or at all, then our prospects for future revenue growth may be adversely impacted. No assurance can be given that the underlying assumptions used to forecast the above cash flows or the timely and successful completion of this project will materialize as estimated. For these reasons, among others, actual results may vary significantly from estimated results. The purchased IPR&D expense for Corus represented the estimated fair value of Corus’s incomplete aztreonam for inhalation solution for CF R&D program that had not yet reached technological feasibility and had no alternative future use as of the acquisition date and, therefore, was expensed upon acquisition. A description of this program at the acquisition date, updated for subsequent changes in status of development, is as follows: Program Description Status of Development EstimatedAcquisition DateFair Value(in millions) Aztreonam for inhalation solution for the treatment of CF Aztreonam formulation for inhalation to be used against Gram-negative bacteria that cause lung infections in patients with CF. In Phase 3 clinical trials as of the acquisition date. We filed an NDA with the FDA in November 2007. In September 2008, we received a complete response letter from the FDA informing us that the FDA will not approve our NDA for aztreonam for inhalation solution for the treatment of CF in its current form and requesting we conduct an additional Phase 3 clinical study. In November 2008, we filed a request for a formal dispute resolution with the FDA. In February 2009, in response to our appeal, the FDA notified us that it is reiterating its position that we will need to conduct another clinical study of aztreonam for inhalation solution before we can resubmit our NDA. We have also submitted a marketing authorization application in the European Union and received notice of acceptance and priority review by Health Canada for approval in Canada. We are still awaiting responses from the respective regulatory bodies. $ 335.6 57 Table of Contents The estimated fair value of the purchased IPR&D was determined using the income approach, which discounts expected future cash flows to present value. We estimated the fair value of the purchased IPR&D using a present value discount rate of 16%, which is based on the estimated internal rate of return for Corus’s operations, is comparable to the estimated weighted-average cost of capital for companies with Corus’s profile, and represents the rate that market participants would use to value the purchased IPR&D. The projected cash flows from the aztreonam for inhalation solution program were based on key assumptions such as estimates of revenues and operating profits related to the program considering its stage of development; the time and resources needed to complete the development and approval of the related product candidate; the life of the potential commercialized product and associated risks, including the inherent difficulties and uncertainties in developing a drug compound such as obtaining FDA and other regulatory approvals; and risks related to the viability of and potential alternative treatments in any future target markets. Corus’s two other early stage candidates were not included in the valuation of purchased IPR&D because they were early stage projects that did not have identifiable revenues and expenses associated with them. For the purpose of estimating the fair value of the aztreonam for inhalation solution program, we estimated that the program was approximately 71% complete as of the acquisition date, based on estimated time and cost to complete, and remaining efforts would include the completion of Phase 3 clinical development as well as preparing for and filing an NDA with the FDA. As of the acquisition date, we estimated that we would incur future R&D costs of approximately $30 million to $35 million from the date of acquisition through and including the year when commercialization was expected to occur. Material net cash inflows were estimated to begin in 2009 for the aztreonam for inhalation solution program, assuming the necessary regulatory approvals would be received and the product would be successfully commercialized by that date. The remaining efforts for completing Corus’s IPR&D program consist primarily of clinical trials, the cost, length and success of which are extremely difficult to predict. Numerous risks and uncertainties exist that could prevent completion of development, including the possibility of unfavorable results of our clinical trial and the risk of failing to obtain FDA and other regulatory body approvals. We cannot be certain that aztreonam for inhalation solution for the treatment of CF will be approved in the United States or in countries outside of the United States or whether marketing approvals will have significant limitations on its use. Aztreonam for inhalation solution for the treatment of CF may never be successfully commercialized. As a result, we may make a strategic decision to discontinue development of aztreonam for inhalation solution for the treatment of CF if, for example, we believe commercialization will be difficult relative to other opportunities in our pipeline. If this program cannot be completed on a timely basis or at all, then our prospects for future revenue growth may be adversely impacted. No assurance can be given that the underlying assumptions used to forecast the above cash flows or the timely and successful completion of the project will materialize as estimated. For these reasons, among others, actual results may vary significantly from estimated results. In connection with our acquisition of the cicletanine assets from Navitas Assets, LLC, we recorded purchased IPR&D expense of $10.9 million during 2008. As we do not consider the acquisition to be a material transaction, we have not made further disclosures regarding the related purchased IPR&D. Interest and Other Income, Net We recorded interest and other income, net, of $59.4 million, $109.8 million and $134.6 million in 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively. The decrease in 2008 compared to 2007 was due primarily to increased costs related to our hedging activities of $32.3 million, net foreign currency losses of $15.7 million and decreased interest income of $7.5 million due primarily to lower interest rates, partially offset by the write-downs of certain securities recorded in 2007 and which are mentioned below. The decrease in 2007 compared to 2006 was primarily attributable to the lower average cash and investment balances over 2006, as well as the write-down of $7.0 million and $1.8 million relating to the other-than-temporary impairment of our investments in Achillion Pharmaceuticals, Inc. and the asset-backed commercial paper of a structured investment vehicle, respectively. 58 Table of Contents Provision for Income Taxes Our provision for income taxes was $723.3 million, $655.0 million and $551.8 million in 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively. The 2008 effective tax rate of 26.5% differs from the U.S. federal statutory rate of 35% due primarily to tax credits, the resolution of certain tax positions with taxing authorities and certain operating earnings from non-U.S. subsidiaries that are considered indefinitely invested outside the United States, offset by state taxes. The 2007 effective tax rate of 28.9% differs from the U.S. federal statutory rate of 35% due primarily to tax credits and certain operating earnings from non-U.S. subsidiaries that are considered indefinitely invested outside the United States, offset by state taxes. Included in our operating income in 2006 were pre-tax charges of $335.6 million and $2.06 billion for the purchased IPR&D expenses associated with our Corus and Myogen acquisitions, respectively. We did not record any income tax benefit related to the purchased IPR&D expenses as such amounts are non-deductible. The 2006 effective tax rate of (86.5)% differs from the U.S. federal statutory rate of 35% due primarily to tax credits and certain operating earnings from non-U.S. subsidiaries that are considered indefinitely invested outside the United States, offset by our federal tax non-deductible purchased IPR&D expenses and state taxes. In June 2006, the FASB issued FIN 48, which clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in an enterprise’s financial statements in accordance with SFAS 109 by prescribing a minimum recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. FIN 48 also provides guidance on derecognition, classification, interest and penalties, accounting in interim periods, disclosure and transition. FIN 48 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2006. On January 1, 2007, we adopted FIN 48 and increased our liability for unrecognized tax benefits by $14.1 million with a corresponding charge to the opening balance of accumulated deficit, as permitted under FIN 48. In addition, we reclassified $68.4 million of unrecognized tax benefits from short-term income taxes payable and noncurrent deferred tax assets to long-term income taxes payable. As of the date of adoption, we had total federal, state and foreign unrecognized tax benefits of $86.2 million recorded primarily in long-term income taxes payable on our Consolidated Balance Sheet, including accrued liabilities related to interest of $4.0 million. Of the total unrecognized tax benefits, $78.0 million, if recognized, would have reduced our effective tax rate in the period of recognition. As permitted under the provisions of FIN 48, we have continued to classify interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits as part of our income tax provision in our Consolidated Statements of Operations. As of December 31, 2008 and 2007, we had total federal, state and foreign unrecognized tax benefits of $119.3 million and $111.7 million, respectively, including interest of $10.1 million and $8.3 million, respectively. Of the total unrecognized tax benefits at December 31, 2008 and 2007, $111.1 million and $103.5 million, respectively, if recognized, would reduce our effective tax rate in the period of recognition. During 2008, we reached agreement with the IRS on several issues related to the examinations of our federal income tax returns for 2003 and 2004. As a result, we reduced our unrecognized tax benefits by $30.0 million. As of December 31, 2008, we believe it is reasonably possible that our unrecognized tax benefits will decrease by approximately $56.0 million in the next 12 months as we expect to have clarification from the IRS around certain of our uncertain tax positions. With respect to the remaining unrecognized tax benefits, we are currently unable to make a reasonable estimate as to the period of cash settlement, if any, with the respective taxing authorities. 59 Table of Contents Liquidity and Capital Resources The following table summarizes our cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities, our working capital and our cash flow activities as of the end of, and for each of, the last three years (in thousands): 2008 2007 2006 As of December 31: Cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities $ 3,239,639 $ 2,722,422 $ 1,389,566 Working capital $ 3,079,289 $ 2,292,017 $ 1,664,930 Year Ended December 31: Cash provided by (used in): Operating activities $ 2,204,659 $ 1,765,398 $ 1,218,059 Investing activities $ (178,819 ) $ (1,302,467 ) $ (1,739,334 ) Financing activities $ (1,535,844 ) $ (267,299 ) $ 649,261 Cash, Cash Equivalents and Marketable Securities Cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities totaled $3.24 billion at December 31, 2008, an increase of $517.2 million or 19% from December 31, 2007. This increase was primarily attributable to: • net cash provided by operations of $2.20 billion in 2008; and • proceeds from issuances of common stock under our employee stock plans of $246.1 million in 2008. These increases were partially offset by our repurchases of $1.97 billion of our common stock under our stock repurchase program during 2008. Cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities totaled $2.72 billion at December 31, 2007, an increase of $1.33 billion or 96% from December 31, 2006. The increase of $1.33 billion was primarily attributable to: • net cash provided by operations of $1.77 billion in 2007; and • proceeds from issuances of stock under our employee stock plans of $243.4 million in 2007. These increases were partially offset by: • our repurchases of $487.5 million of our common stock under our stock repurchase programs in 2007; • our repayment of all remaining amounts due under our term loan of $99.0 million in 2007; and • capital expenditures of $76.5 million relating to the expansion of our facilities to accommodate our growth in 2007. Working Capital Working capital at December 31, 2008 was $3.08 billion, an increase of $787.3 million from December 31, 2007. This increase was primarily attributable to: • an increase of $327.9 million in inventories due primarily to the purchases of efavirenz at the estimated market value of efavirenz from BMS; • an increase of $228.3 million in accounts receivable, net, driven primarily by increased product sales; and • a $618.1 million increase in cash, cash equivalents and short-term marketable securities. These increases were partially offset by a $310.9 million increase in accounts payable due primarily to the purchases of efavirenz at the estimated market value of Sustiva from BMS. 60 Table of Contents Working capital at December 31, 2007 was $2.29 billion compared to $1.66 billion at December 31, 2006. Significant factors that resulted in an increase in working capital in 2007 were: • $235.1 million increase in cash, cash equivalents and short-term marketable securities due primarily to cash provided by operating activities and proceeds from issuances of our common stock under our employee stock plans, which were partially offset by our repurchases of our common stock under our stock repurchase program, the repayment of our term loan and capital spending; • $215.1 million increase in prepaid taxes related to intercompany profits between our U.S. parent company and our joint venture; and • $185.8 million increase in accounts receivable, net, due primarily to increased sales in 2007. Cash Provided by Operating Activities Cash provided by operating activities of $2.20 billion in 2008 primarily related to net income of $2.01 billion which was adjusted for non-cash items such as $209.5 million of tax benefits from employee stock plans and $153.4 million of stock-based compensation expense. This was partially offset by $191.9 million of excess tax benefits from stock option exercises which we reclassified to cash provided by financing activities in accordance with SFAS 123R and $66.9 million of cash outflow related to changes in operating assets and liabilities. Cash provided by operating activities of $1.77 billion in 2007 was comprised primarily of $1.62 billion in net income which was adjusted for non-cash items such as $184.6 million of stock-based compensation expense, $133.1 million of deferred income taxes and $110.7 million of tax benefits related to employee stock plans and $76.3 million of excess tax benefits from stock option exercises. This was partially offset by a $236.0 million net cash outflow related to changes in operating assets and liabilities. Cash provided by operating activities of $1.22 billion in 2006 was comprised primarily of $1.19 billion in net loss which was adjusted for non-cash items such as our $2.39 billion purchased IPR&D expense, stock-based compensation expense of $133.8 million and $127.6 million of tax benefits related to employee stock plans and $95.3 million of excess tax benefits from stock option exercises. This was partially offset by a $225.1 million net cash outflow related to changes in operating assets and liabilities. Cash Used in Investing Activities Cash used in investing activities in 2008 primarily related to purchases, sales and maturities of available-for-sale securities as well as capital expenditures. Cash used in investing activities in 2007 primarily related to purchases, sales and maturities of available-for-sale securities, capital expenditures and our acquisition of Nycomed Limited. Cash used in investing activities in 2006 primarily related to purchases, sales and maturities of available-for-sale securities, our acquisitions of Myogen, Raylo Chemicals Inc. (Raylo) and Corus, as well as capital expenditures. We used $178.8 million of cash in investing activities in 2008 compared to $1.30 billion in 2007. The decrease was due primarily to more cash being used in financing activities during 2008 compared to 2007 to fund our stock repurchases. We used $1.30 billion of cash for investing activities in 2007 compared to $1.74 billion in 2006, a decrease of $436.9 million. The decrease was due primarily to our acquisitions of Myogen, Raylo and Corus for a total of $2.74 billion in 2006, as well as more cash used in the purchases, sales and maturities of marketable securities activities during 2007 compared to 2006. Capital expenditures made in 2008, 2007 and 2006 related primarily to the expansion of our manufacturing capabilities, upgrades to our facilities and spending on computer and laboratory equipment, as well as enterprise 61 Table of Contents software, to accommodate our continued business growth. In 2007, capital expenditures also included the construction of a new building at our Foster City, California headquarters. In 2006, capital expenditures also included the purchase of two buildings that we previously leased as well as construction costs of the new building at our Foster City, California headquarters. As of December 31, 2008, we had capital expenditure commitments of $292.7 million, which included the purchase of an office building and land, as well as three aircraft to be constructed for delivery in 2010 and 2013, both of which are discussed below. We expect to fulfill such commitments from funds generated from our operating cash flows. In October 2008, we signed a purchase and sale agreement to purchase an office building and approximately 30 acres of land located in Foster City, California, for an aggregate purchase price of approximately $137.5 million. We made an initial refundable deposit of $5.0 million into escrow in October, and in January 2009, the remaining balance of $132.5 million was paid into escrow upon closing the transaction. As part of closing, the purchase and sale agreement was amended to allow for a holdback in escrow of up to $15.5 million of the purchase price, to be released depending on the outcome of certain requirements mutually agreed to at closing. In August 2007, as a result of a review of the terms under our existing corporate aircraft leases and upon consideration of the various alternatives available to us upon their expiration, we entered into agreements to purchase three aircraft to be constructed for delivery in 2010 and 2013. The aggregate purchase price under the purchase agreements was $98.6 million. As of December 31, 2008, we had made deposits totaling $7.4 million which has been recorded in other noncurrent assets on our Consolidated Balance Sheet. Future deposits due under the terms of the purchase agreements are as follows: $23.0 million in 2009, $31.1 million in 2010, $4.1 million in 2011, $20.7 million in 2012 and $12.4 million in 2013. We have the option to terminate the purchase agreements, subject to a maximum payment of 7.5% of the fully equipped price of the aircraft. Cash Provided by (Used in) Financing Activities Cash used in financing activities in 2008 was $1.54 billion, driven primarily by the $1.97 billion used to repurchase our common stock under our stock repurchase program. The cash outflows were partially offset by proceeds of $246.1 million that we received from issuances of common stock under our employee stock plans, as well as $191.9 million of excess tax benefits from stock option exercises. In October 2007, our Board authorized a program for the repurchase of our common stock in an aggregate amount of up to $3.00 billion through open market and private block transactions pursuant to Rule 10b5-1 plans, privately negotiated purchases or other means. This stock repurchase program expires in December 2010. Under this stock repurchase program, in 2008 we repurchased shares in the open market and also entered into two structured accelerated share repurchase transactions with third parties which are described below. In February 2008, we entered into an accelerated share repurchase agreement with a financial institution to repurchase $500.0 million of our common stock on an accelerated basis. Under the terms of this accelerated share repurchase agreement with the financial institution, we paid $500.0 million to the financial institution to settle the initial purchase transaction and received 9,373,548 shares of our common stock at a price of $53.34 per share. In June 2008, upon maturity of the agreement and in accordance with the share delivery provisions of the agreement, we received an additional 239,612 shares of our common stock based on the average of the daily volume weighted-average prices of our common stock during a specified period less a predetermined discount per share. As a result, the final purchase price of our common stock from this accelerated share repurchase was $52.01 per share. In October 2008, we entered into an accelerated share repurchase transaction with a financial institution to repurchase $750.0 million of our common stock on an accelerated basis. Under the terms of this accelerated share repurchase agreement with the financial institution, we paid $750.0 million to the financial institution to settle the initial purchase transaction and received 14,874,519 shares of our common stock at a price of $50.42 per share. On or before April 2009, subject to extension under certain circumstances as well as the maximum and minimum share delivery provisions of the agreement, we may receive additional shares from the financial institution depending on the average of the daily volume weighted-average prices of our common stock during a 62 Table of Contents specified period less a predetermined discount per share. After making the initial payment of $750.0 million, we are not obligated to deliver any cash or shares to the financial institution except in certain limited circumstances in which case the method of delivery (cash or shares of our common stock) would be at our discretion. As of December 31, 2008, the remaining authorized amount of stock repurchases that may be made under the stock repurchase program which expires in December 2010 was $998.1 million. Cash used in financing activities in 2007 was $267.4 million, driven primarily by the $487.5 million used to repurchase our common stock under our 2006 stock repurchase program, $99.0 million used to pay off all remaining amounts due on our term loan, partially offset by the proceeds from issuance of stock under employee stock plans of $243.3 million as well as $76.3 million of excess tax benefits from stock option exercises. Cash provided by financing activities in 2006 was $649.3 million, driven primarily by the $587.6 million of net proceeds generated from the issuance of our convertible senior notes due in 2011 (2011 Notes) and the convertible senior notes due in 2013 (2013 Notes) (collectively, the Notes) and related transactions. In addition, we received proceeds from the issuance of stock under employee stock plans of $167.9 million, as well as $95.3 million of excess tax benefits from employee stock option exercises. These cash inflows were partially offset by $201.0 million in principal repayments on our term loan during 2006. Other Information In December 2007, we, along with our wholly-owned subsidiary, Gilead Biopharmaceutics Ireland Corporation (GBIC), entered into an amended and restated credit agreement, which superseded the existing revolving credit agreement, with a syndicate of banks to increase the credit facility to $1.25 billion. The amended and restated credit agreement also includes a sub-facility for swing-line loans and letters of credit. Under the terms of the amended and restated credit agreement, we may borrow initially up to an aggregate of $1.25 billion in revolving credit loans. Loans under the amended and restated credit agreement bear interest at either (i) LIBOR plus a margin ranging from 20 basis points to 32 basis points or (ii) the base rate, as defined in the amended and restated credit agreement. We can prepay any outstanding borrowings at any time in whole or in part without penalty or premium, and any outstanding interest or principal would be due and payable in December 2012. In connection with the amended and restated credit agreement, we entered into a parent guaranty agreement under which we guaranteed the obligations of GBIC under the amended and restated credit agreement. We expect to use the proceeds of any loans under the amended and restated credit agreement for working capital requirements and general corporate purposes. As of December 31, 2008, we had a $3.7 million letter of credit outstanding under the amended and restated credit agreement. We believe that our existing capital resources, supplemented by cash generated from our operations, will be adequate to satisfy our capital needs for the foreseeable future. Our future capital requirements will depend on many factors, including but not limited to the following: • the commercial performance of our current and future products; • the progress and scope of our R&D efforts, including preclinical studies and clinical trials; • the cost, timing and outcome of regulatory reviews; • the expansion of our sales and marketing capabilities; • administrative expenses; • the possibility of acquiring additional manufacturing capabilities or office facilities; • the possibility of acquiring other companies or new products; • the establishment of additional collaborative relationships with other companies; and • costs associated with the defense, settlement and adverse results of litigation and government investigations. 63 Table of Contents We may in the future require additional funding, which could be in the form of proceeds from equity or debt financings. If such funding is required, we cannot assure that it will be available to us on favorable terms, if at all. Off Balance Sheet Arrangements We do not have any off balance sheet arrangements that are currently material or reasonably likely to be material to our consolidated financial position or results of operations. Contractual Obligations Our contractual obligations consist of debt obligations, operating leases as well as purchase obligations primarily in the form of capital commitments, purchase obligations for active pharmaceutical ingredients and inventory related items and clinical trials contracts. The following table summarizes our significant enforceable and legally binding obligations, future commitments and obligations related to all contracts that we are likely to continue regardless of the fact that certain of these obligations may be cancelable as of December 31, 2008 (in thousands): Payments due by Period Contractual Obligations Total Less than oneyear 1-3 years 3-5 years More than 5years Convertible senior notes (1) $ 1,299,854 $ — $ 649,987 $ 649,867 $ — Operating lease obligations 212,938 29,946 58,308 45,082 79,602 Capital commitments (2) 292,749 203,034 56,675 33,040 — Purchase obligations (3)(4) 1,085,104 635,578 279,337 170,189 — Clinical trials (5) 326,938 157,385 130,935 31,072 7,546 Total $ 3,217,583 $ 1,025,943 $ 1,175,242 $ 929,250 $ 87,148 (1) At December 31, 2008, we had outstanding principal of $1.30 billion on the Notes that we issued in April 2006. (2) At December 31, 2008, we had firm capital project commitments of approximately $292.7 million primarily relating to the expansion of our facilities and infrastructure as well as purchase commitments of three corporate aircraft to be constructed for delivery in 2010 and 2013. (3) At December 31, 2008, we had firm purchase commitments related to active pharmaceutical ingredients and certain inventory related items. The amounts related to active pharmaceutical ingredients only represent minimum purchase requirements. Actual purchases are expected to significantly exceed these amounts. (4) In addition to the above, we have committed to make potential future milestone payments to third parties as part of licensing and development programs. Payments under these agreements generally become due and payable only upon achievement of certain developmental, regulatory and/or commercial milestones. Because the achievement of these milestones is neither probable nor reasonably estimable, such contingencies have not been recorded on our Consolidated Balance Sheet and have not been included in the table above. (5) At December 31, 2008, we had several clinical studies in various clinical trial phases. Our most significant clinical trial expenditures are to CROs. Although most of our contracts with CROs are cancelable, we generally have not cancelled such contracts. These amounts reflect commitments based on existing contracts and do not reflect any future modifications to, or termination of, existing contracts and anticipated or potential new contracts. We had total gross unrecognized tax benefit liabilities of $138.4 million as of December 31, 2008. We believe that it is reasonably possible that our unrecognized tax benefits will decrease by approximately $66.0 million in the next 12 months as we expect to have clarification from the IRS around certain of our uncertain tax 64 Table of Contents positions. With respect to the remaining unrecognized tax benefits, we are currently unable to make a reasonable estimate as to the period of cash settlement, if any, with the respective taxing authorities. Such amounts were included in long-term income taxes payable and long-term deferred tax assets on our Consolidated Balance Sheet, and have not been included in the table above. Recent Accounting Pronouncements In June 2008, the FASB ratified EITF Issue No. 07-5, Determining Whether an Instrument (or Embedded Feature) is Indexed to an Entity’s Own Stock (EITF 07-5). EITF 07-5 provides guidance on how to determine if certain instruments (or embedded features) are considered indexed to our own stock, including instruments similar to our Notes, convertible note hedges, warrants to purchase our stock and the forward contract that we entered into as part of our accelerated share repurchase transaction in February 2008 and which was completed in June 2008 and the forward contract that we entered into as part of our accelerated share repurchase transaction in October 2008. EITF 07-5 requires companies to use a two-step approach to evaluate an instrument’s contingent exercise provisions and settlement provisions in determining whether the instrument is considered to be indexed to its own stock and exempt from the application of SFAS No. 133, Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities. Although EITF 07-5 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2008, any outstanding instrument at the date of adoption will require a retrospective application of the accounting through a cumulative effect adjustment to retained earnings upon adoption. We do not expect the adoption of EITF 07-5 to have a material impact on our consolidated financial position or results of operations. In May 2008, the FASB issued FSP APB 14-1, Accounting for Convertible Debt Instruments That May Be Settled in Cash upon Conversion (Including Partial Cash Settlement) (FSP APB 14-1). FSP APB 14-1 addresses instruments commonly referred to as Instrument C from EITF 90-19, which requires the issuer to settle the principal amount in cash and the conversion spread in cash or net shares at the issuer’s option. FSP APB 14-1 requires that issuers of these instruments account for their liability and equity components separately by bifurcating the conversion option from the debt instrument, classifying the conversion option in equity and then accreting the resulting discount on the debt as additional interest expense over the expected life of the debt. FSP APB 14-1 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2008 and interim periods within those fiscal years, and requires retrospective application to all periods presented. Early application is not permitted. We expect that the adoption of FSP APB 14-1 will have a material impact on our consolidated financial position and results of operations. Based on the requirements of FSP APB 14-1, we estimate that if FSP APB 14-1 was effective for the current and comparative periods, we would have reported additional interest expense related to our Notes of approximately $53.2 million, $50.0 million and $32.7 million during 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively. In December 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 160, Noncontrolling Interests in Consolidated Financial Statements, an amendment of Accounting Research Bulletin No. 51, Consolidated Financial Statements (SFAS 160). SFAS 160 establishes accounting and reporting standards for ownership interests in subsidiaries held by parties other than the parent, the amount of consolidated net income (loss) attributable to the parent and to the noncontrolling interests, changes in a parent’s ownership interest and the valuation of retained noncontrolling equity investments when a subsidiary is deconsolidated. SFAS 160 also establishes additional reporting requirements that identify and distinguish between the ownership interest of the parent and the interest of the noncontrolling owners. SFAS 160 is effective for interim periods and fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2008. Upon adopting SFAS 160, we plan to reclassify the noncontrolling interest, or minority interest, on our Consolidated Balance Sheets from liabilities to stockholders’ equity and to present the noncontrolling interest, or minority interest, on our Consolidated Statements of Operations as net income attributable to the noncontrolling interest, which will be a component of total consolidated net income (loss). In December 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 141 (revised 2007), Business Combinations (SFAS 141R). SFAS 141R establishes principles and requirements for recognizing and measuring assets acquired, liabilities assumed and any noncontrolling interests in the acquiree in a business combination. SFAS 141R also provides 65 Table of Contents guidance for recognizing and measuring goodwill acquired in a business combination; requires purchased IPR&D to be capitalized at fair value as intangible assets at the time of acquisition; requires acquisition-related expenses and restructuring costs to be recognized separately from the business combination; expands the definition of what constitutes a business; and requires the acquirer to disclose information that users may need to evaluate and understand the financial effect of the business combination. SFAS 141R is effective on a prospective basis and will impact business combination transactions for which the acquisition date occurs after December 15, 2008. Depending on the nature and magnitude of our future business combination transactions, SFAS 141R may have a material impact on our consolidated financial position and/or results of operations. ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK Foreign Currency Exchange Risk Our operations include manufacturing and sales activities in the United States, Canada and Ireland as well as sales activities in countries outside the United States, including Europe and Australia. As a result, our financial results could be significantly affected by factors such as changes in foreign currency exchange rates or weak economic conditions in the foreign markets in which we distribute our products. Our operating results are exposed to changes in foreign currency exchange rates between the U.S. dollar and various foreign currencies, the most significant of which is the Euro. When the U.S. dollar strengthens against these currencies, the relative value of sales made in the respective foreign currency decreases. Conversely, when the U.S. dollar weakens against these currencies, the relative amounts of such sales increase. Overall, we are a net receiver of foreign currencies and, therefore, benefit from a weaker U.S. dollar and are adversely affected by a stronger U.S. dollar relative to those foreign currencies in which we transact significant amounts of business. A significant percentage of our product sales are denominated in foreign currencies. We enter into foreign currency exchange forward contracts and foreign currency exchange option contracts to partially mitigate the impact of changes in currency exchange rates on net cash flows from our foreign currency denominated sales. We also hedge certain monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies, which reduces but does not eliminate our exposure to currency fluctuations between the date a transaction is recorded and the date that cash is collected or paid. In general, the market risks of these contracts are offset by corresponding gains and losses on the transactions being hedged. In recent years, foreign currency exchange fluctuations have primarily had a positive impact to product sales and gross margin; however, the full impact of the foreign currency fluctuations have been moderated by our hedging program. 66 Table of Contents The following table summarizes the notional amounts, weighted-average currency exchange rates and fair values of our open foreign currency exchange forward and option contracts at December 31, 2008. All contracts have maturities of 18 months or less. Weighted-average rates are stated in terms of the amount of U.S. dollars per foreign currency. Fair values represent estimated settlement amounts at December 31, 2008 (notional amounts and fair values in U.S. dollars in thousands): Foreign Currency Exchange Forward Contracts Currency NotionalAmount Weighted-AverageSettlement Price Fair Value Euro $ 1,867,814 1.45 $ 42,919 British Pound 154,339 1.69 21,575 Australian Dollar 49,241 0.73 2,767 Danish Krone 23,046 5.33 152 Norwegian Krone 10,409 7.15 (9 ) Swiss Franc 46,785 1.05 (82 ) Total $ 2,151,634 $ 67,322 Foreign Currency Exchange Option Contracts Currency NotionalAmount Weighted-AverageStrike Price Fair Value British Pound $ 42,234 2.00 $ 11,547 Euro 183,979 1.44 9,571 Australian Dollar 10,573 0.88 2,279 Total $ 236,786 $ 23,397 Total Foreign Exchange Forward and Option Contracts $ 2,388,420 $ 90,719 The total notional amount of $2.39 billion and total fair value relating to our net asset of $90.7 million on our open foreign currency exchange forward and option contracts at December 31, 2008 compares with a total notional amount of $1.61 billion and a total fair value relating to our net liability of $11.5 million on our open foreign currency exchange forward contracts at December 31, 2007. Interest Rate Risk Our portfolio of available-for-sale marketable securities and our fixed and variable rate liabilities create an exposure to interest rate risk. With respect to our investment portfolio, we adhere to an investment policy that requires us to limit amounts invested in securities based on duration, industry group and investment type and issuer, except for securities issued by the U.S. government. The goals of our investment policy, in order of priority, are as follows: • safety and preservation of principal and diversification of risk; • liquidity of investments sufficient to meet cash flow requirements; and • competitive after-tax rate of return. 67 Table of Contents The following table summarizes the expected maturities and average interest rates of our interest generating assets and interest-bearing liabilities at December 31, 2008 (dollars in thousands): Years ending December 31, Thereafter Total FairValue atDecember 31,2008 2009 2010 2011 2012 2013 Assets Available-for-sale debt securities $ 1,265,660 $ 479,908 $ 584,164 $ 68,108 $ 50,399 $ 101,796 $ 2,550,035 Average interest rate 1.9% 2.1% 2.2% 3.8% 3.8% 2.3% Liabilities Convertible senior notes (1) $ — $ — $ 649,987 $ — $ 649,867 $ — $ 1,299,854 Average interest rate 0.5% 0.6% (1) In April 2006, we issued $650.0 million principal amount of convertible senior notes due 2011 (2011 Notes) and $650.0 million principal amount of convertible senior notes due 2013 (2013 Notes) in a private placement pursuant to Rule 144A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended. The 2011 Notes and 2013 Notes were issued at par and bear interest rates of 0.50% and 0.625%, respectively, and may be converted subject to certain circumstances. Credit Risk A portion of our marketable securities are held in auction rate securities. In 2008, we began observing the failed auctions for auction rate securities whose underlying assets are comprised of student loans. As of December 31, 2008, we held approximately $122.4 million of auction rate securities within our available-for-sale long-term marketable securities whose underlying assets were comprised of student loans. Our auction rate securities comprised approximately 4% of our total cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities as of December 31, 2008. Most of our auction rate securities, including those subject to the failed auctions, are currently rated AAA, consistent with the high quality rating required by our investment policy. If auctions continue to fail for securities in which we have invested, we may be unable to liquidate some or all of our auction rate securities at par, should we need or desire to access the funds invested in those securities. However, we believe that, based on our total cash and marketable securities position, our expected operating cash flows as well as access to funds through our credit facility, we are able to hold these securities until there is a recovery in the auction market, which may be at final maturity. As a result, we do not anticipate that the current illiquidity of these auction rate securities will have a material effect on our cash requirements or working capital. In light of the volatility and developments that we have seen in the financial markets, we continued to review our cash equivalents and marketable securities carefully as well as invest prudently in 2008. We believe that maintaining the primary goals of our investment policy, safety and preservation of principal and diversification of risk, as well as liquidity of investments sufficient to meet cash flow requirements, has protected us from much of the risks in the credit markets while allowing us to continue to meet our operating cash flow requirements as well as execute on other opportunities such as our $500.0 million and $750.0 million accelerated share repurchases. Our accounts receivable balance at December 31, 2008 was $1.02 billion, compared to $795.1 million at December 31, 2007. The growth in our accounts receivable balances was due primarily to higher product sales of our antiviral products in the United States and Europe. Our European product sales to government-owned or supported customers in Greece, Italy, Portugal and Spain are subject to significant payment delays due to government funding and reimbursement practices. This has resulted and may continue to result in an increase in days sales outstanding due to the average length of time that we have accounts receivable outstanding. This, in turn, may increase the credit risk related to certain of our customers. Sales to customers in these countries in Europe that tend to pay relatively slowly have increased, and may continue to further increase, the average length of time that we have accounts receivable outstanding. At December 31, 2008, our accounts receivable for Greece, Italy, Portugal and Spain totaled $543.8 million, of which $191.0 million was more than 120 days past due. To 68 Table of Contents date, we have not experienced significant losses with respect to the collection of our accounts receivable, and we believe that substantially all of our accounts receivable balances are collectible. We perform credit evaluations of our customers’ financial condition and generally have not required collateral.",2023-12-30 19:04:11.117959

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS The following Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (MD&A) is intended to help the reader understand our results of operations and financial condition. MD&A is provided as a supplement to, and should be read in conjunction with, our audited Consolidated Financial Statements and the accompanying notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements and other disclosures included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K (including the disclosures under “Item 1A. Risk Factors”). Our Consolidated Financial Statements have been prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles and are presented in U.S. dollars. Management Overview We are a biopharmaceutical company that discovers, develops and commercializes innovative therapeutics in areas of unmet medical need. Our mission is to advance the care of patients suffering from life threatening diseases worldwide. Headquartered in Foster City, California, we have operations in North America, Europe and Australia. We market products in the HIV/AIDS, liver diseases, respiratory and cardiovascular/metabolic therapeutic areas. Our products comprise Truvada® (emtricitabine and tenofovir disoproxil fumarate), Atripla® (efavirenz 600 mg/emtricitabine 200 mg/tenofovir disoproxil fumarate 300 mg), Viread® (tenofovir disoproxil fumarate) and Emtriva® (emtricitabine) for the treatment of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection; Hepsera® (adefovir dipivoxil) and Viread for the treatment of chronic hepatitis B; AmBisome® (amphotericin B liposome for injection) for the treatment of severe fungal infections; Letairis® (ambrisentan) for the treatment of pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH); Ranexa® (ranolazine) for the treatment of chronic angina; Vistide® (cidofovir injection) for the treatment of cytomegalovirus infection and Cayston® (aztreonam for inhalation solution) as a treatment to improve respiratory symptoms in cystic fibrosis (CF) patients with Pseudomonas aeruginosa (P. aeruginosa). F. Hoffmann-La Roche Ltd (together with Hoffmann-La Roche Inc., Roche) markets Tamiflu® (oseltamivir phosphate) for the treatment and prevention of influenza under a royalty-paying collaborative agreement with us. Eyetech Inc. markets Macugen® (pegaptanib sodium injection) in the United States and Europe for the treatment of neovascular age-related macular degeneration under a royalty-paying collaborative agreement with us. GlaxoSmithKline Inc. (GSK) markets Volibris™ (ambrisentan) outside of the United States for the treatment of PAH under a royalty-paying collaborative agreement with us. Menarini International Operations Luxembourg SA markets Ranexa outside of the United States under a royalty-paying collaborative agreement with us. Astellas US LLC markets Lexiscan® (regadenoson) injection in the United States for use as a pharmacologic stress agent in radionuclide myocardial perfusion imaging (MPI) under a royalty-paying collaborative agreement with us. Business Highlights During 2009, we grew our business significantly and achieved record total revenues of $7.01 billion while strengthening our product portfolio and pipeline programs. Our commercial achievements for 2009 comprised the continued rollout of Atripla in the European Union including the launch of Atripla in France, the growth of Atripla and Truvada product sales in the United States and Canada, making gains in the PAH market with Letairis, as well as continuing the expansion of our sales and marketing infrastructure. We grew our product sales significantly and continued to strengthen our worldwide organization and infrastructure to support our expanded international footprint and business activities. In addition, we added Ranexa to our product portfolio through the acquisition of CV Therapeutics, Inc. (CV Therapeutics) in April 2009. In February 2010, we received marketing approval from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for Cayston as a treatment to improve respiratory symptoms in CF patients with P. aeruginosa. Cayston was conditionally approved in Europe and Canada in September 2009. Cayston is delivered via a specific inhalation device developed by PARI Pharma GmbH. 44 Table of Contents We also made significant advances on the compounds and product candidates in our research and development (R&D) pipeline, including: • In the HIV area, in January 2010, we announced that both of the Phase 2 clinical studies of cobicistat (formerly GS 9350), our pharmacoenhancer that is in development as a boosting agent for certain HIV medicines, and a complete single-tablet fixed-dose regimen containing elvitegravir, cobicistat and Truvada in treatment-naïve patients met their primary objectives of non-inferiority. Pending discussion with the FDA, we expect to initiate three Phase 3 studies before the middle of 2010: two studies for the single-tablet fixed-dose regimen mentioned above and one study for cobicistat. In December 2009, we completed enrollment in the Phase 3 study evaluating elvitegravir in treatment-experienced patients. In addition, in collaboration with Tibotec Pharmaceuticals (Tibotec), we are developing a new once-daily fixed-dose combination containing our Truvada and Tibotec’s investigational non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor, TMC278 (25 mg rilpivirine hydrochloride), which is currently in Phase 3 clinical trials. Subject to positive outcome of this study, we intend to submit marketing applications for the fixed-dose combination of Truvada and TMC278 in the United States and Europe during the second half of 2010. • In the liver disease area, we completed the Phase 2a studies of GS 9450, the caspase inhibitor we licensed from LG Life Sciences, Ltd. in 2007, that is in development for the treatment of hepatitis C and nonalcoholic steatohepatitis and expect to present the results in the second quarter of 2010. We are continuing the Phase 2b study of GS 9450 for the treatment of hepatitis C. We are also continuing our Phase 2 study of GS 9190, a non-nucleoside polymerase inhibitor being evaluated for the treatment of hepatitis C infection, and expect to complete the study in the second half of 2010. • In the cardiovascular and metabolic areas, we expanded our product candidate portfolio through the acquisition of CV Therapeutics. We anticipate commencing patient enrollment in a Phase 2 study of ranolazine for the treatment of diastolic heart failure in patients with preserved ejection fraction in the second quarter of 2010. We are continuing our Phase 3 study of ambrisentan in patients with pulmonary hypertension secondary to idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF). We are also collaborating with GSK to develop a clinical trial to study combination therapy versus monotherapy in a first-line treatment setting for PAH. The study, AMBITION, will evaluate first-line combination use with ambrisentan, an endothelin receptor antagonist (ERA), and tadalafil, a PDE5 inhibitor, in patients with PAH. We are continuing our Phase 2 study of cicletanine hydrochloride, an oral agent in development for the treatment of PAH. We announced plans to terminate development of darusentan for the treatment of resistant hypertension after our second Phase 3 study of the compound failed to meet its co-primary efficacy endpoints. In May 2009, we announced that our marketing authorization application for regadenoson, an investigational pharmacologic stress agent for radionuclide MPI, was validated by the European Medicines Agency (EMEA). Following validation of the marketing authorization application, the dossier is distributed to members of the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) for formal review to determine whether regadenoson is a safe and efficacious pharmacologic stress agent in humans. • In the respiratory area, we are continuing the Phase 3 study of ambrisentan for the treatment of IPF and anticipate completing enrollment of patients in this study by the end of 2010. We are continuing the Phase 2 study of GS 9310/11, an inhaled co-formulation of fosfomycin and tobramycin, for the treatment of bacterial infections associated with CF, the Phase 2 study of aztreonam for inhalation solution for the treatment of bronchiectasis and the Phase 1 study of GS 9411, an oral epithelial sodium channel blocker designed to increase airway hydration for the treatment of pulmonary disease. Acquisition of CV Therapeutics and Restructuring In April 2009, we completed the acquisition of CV Therapeutics, a publicly-held biopharmaceutical company based in Palo Alto, California, primarily focused on the discovery, development and commercialization of small molecule drugs for the treatment of cardiovascular, metabolic and pulmonary diseases. CV Therapeutics 45 Table of Contents had two marketed products as well as several product candidates in clinical development for the treatment of cardiovascular, metabolic and pulmonary diseases. We believe the acquisition will provide us with an opportunity to further expand into the cardiovascular therapeutic area. We adopted the new business combinations guidance for recognizing and measuring assets acquired, liabilities assumed and any noncontrolling interests in the acquiree and applied it to the CV Therapeutics acquisition. As a result, we recognized consideration transferred of $1.39 billion and recorded $951.2 million and $138.9 million in intangible assets relating to marketed products and in-process research and development (IPR&D) projects, respectively, which constituted a significant portion of the assets acquired from CV Therapeutics. The results of operations of CV Therapeutics beginning on April 15, 2009, the acquisition date, were included in our Consolidated Financial Statements for the year ended December 31, 2009. During the second quarter of 2009, we approved a plan to realize certain synergies between CV Therapeutics and us, re-align our cardiovascular operations and eliminate certain redundancies. The restructuring plan included consolidation and re-alignment of the cardiovascular R&D organization, our exit from certain facilities and the termination of certain contractual obligations. As a result of this restructuring plan, we recorded $26.2 million and $25.7 million in selling, general and administrative (SG&A) expenses and R&D expenses, respectively, in 2009, primarily related to employee severance, relocation and termination benefits, lease termination costs and other facilities-related expenses. We expect to incur an additional $20.2 million in 2010 bringing the total amount to be incurred in connection with the significant activities of our restructuring plan to be approximately $38.8 million for employee severance, relocation and termination benefits and $33.3 million for facilities-related expenses. Financial Highlights Our operating results for the year were led by total product sales of $6.47 billion. Antiviral product sales (Truvada, Atripla, Viread, Hepsera and Emtriva) increased 25% to $5.84 billion in 2009 from $4.67 billion in 2008, and were the key drivers for total product sales growth of 27% for 2009 as compared to 2008. With the continued uptake of Atripla in the United States and Europe, Atripla contributed $2.38 billion, or 41%, to our total 2009 antiviral product sales. The growth of Atripla product sales and its increased proportion to overall product sales caused total product gross margin to decrease to 75% in 2009 from 78% in 2008, due primarily to the efavirenz component of Atripla sales at zero gross margin. Truvada product sales for 2009 comprised $2.49 billion, or 43% of our total 2009 antiviral product sales. Truvada product sales for 2009 increased 18% from 2008 primarily due to continued sales volume growth in the United States and Europe. Foreign currency fluctuations in 2009 had an unfavorable impact of approximately $98.5 million on total revenues and $33.6 million on pre-tax income when compared to 2008. Royalty revenues that we recognized from our collaborations with corporate partners were $491.8 million in 2009, an increase of 125% from royalty revenues of $218.2 million in 2008. The increase in royalty revenues was due primarily to increased Tamiflu sales by Roche related to pandemic planning initiatives worldwide. Operating expenses increased $825.0 million in 2009, or 31%, compared to 2008, reflecting the increased research and clinical study activity in our development pipeline, our expanded commercial activities worldwide, as well as the higher headcount, infrastructure and technology-related costs required to support the continued growth of our business. Cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities increased by $665.2 million during the year, driven primarily by our operating cash flows of $3.08 billion partially offset by cash used to acquire CV Therapeutics of $1.13 billion, net of cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities acquired from CV Therapeutics of $245.4 million, and $998.5 million used to repurchase approximately 21.8 million shares of our common stock through open market purchases under the now completed $3.00 billion stock repurchase program authorized by our Board of Directors (Board) in October 2007. 46 Table of Contents 2010 Outlook Our operating objectives for 2010 include increasing the market share of our commercial products, continuing to strengthen our pipeline with internally developed and/or externally in-licensed or purchased opportunities and strengthening our key alliances. From a commercial standpoint, we have a number of internal and external initiatives intended to promote the continued growth of our franchises. In the HIV area, we expect a favorable impact from our updated Atripla label that includes data from Study 073 supporting switching patients from other HIV regimens to Atripla, revised U.S. Department of Health and Human Services treatment guidelines that recommend earlier treatment for patients with HIV and the extension of the Ryan White Treatment Act which should provide stable funding for AIDS Drug Assistance Programs in the United States through 2013. In the hepatitis B virus (HBV) area, we will continue to support educational and promotional activities focused on Asian communities, highlighting the need to screen, diagnose and link patients to care. As part of those efforts, we will have a larger hepatitis B field team in 2010 in the United States. In the cardiovascular area, we will continue in our efforts to raise awareness of Gilead in the PAH and cardiology communities and believe this will help grow revenues of Letairis and Ranexa in 2010. We are mindful that conditions in our current macroeconomic environment could affect our ability to achieve our goals. Some of the factors that could affect our business include: the potential healthcare reform in the United States, continued government pricing pressures internationally and the potential volatility in foreign currency exchange rates. We will continue to monitor these factors and will adjust our business processes to mitigate these risks to our business. The successes we experienced in 2009 have helped us maintain and build a financially sound business model that we believe will allow us to continue to further expand our commercial, collaborative and R&D activities and to maintain quality and compliance. As we continue to grow our business and achieve greater operational leverage, we remain focused on profitable revenue growth and prudent expense management that we believe will enable solid execution of our operating objectives for 2010. Critical Accounting Policies, Estimates and Judgments The discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based on our Consolidated Financial Statements, which have been prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses and related disclosures. On an ongoing basis, we evaluate our estimates, including those related to revenue recognition, intangible assets, allowance for doubtful accounts, prepaid royalties, clinical trial accruals, our tax provision and stock-based compensation. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other market specific and other relevant assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ significantly from these estimates. We believe the following critical accounting policies reflect the more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our Consolidated Financial Statements. Revenue Recognition Product Sales We recognize revenues from product sales when there is persuasive evidence that an arrangement exists, delivery to the customer has occurred, the price is fixed or determinable and collectability is reasonably assured. We record estimated reductions to revenues for government rebates such as Medicaid reimbursements, customer 47 Table of Contents incentives such as cash discounts for prompt payment, distributor fees and expected returns of expired products. These estimates are deducted from gross product sales at the time such revenues are recognized. Of these reductions from gross product sales, government rebates significantly impact our reported net product sales and are based upon certain estimates that require complex and significant judgment by management. Government Rebates We estimate reductions to our revenues for government-managed Medicaid programs as well as to certain other qualifying federal, state and foreign government programs for the reimbursement of portions of the retail price of prescriptions filled that are covered by these programs. These reductions are settled either by the company being invoiced directly or through charge-backs from our wholesalers. Government rebates that are invoiced directly to us are recorded in other accrued liabilities on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. For qualified programs that can purchase our products through wholesalers at a lower contractual government price, the wholesalers charge back to us the difference between their acquisition cost and the lower contractual government price, which we record as allowances against accounts receivable. Although we may pay rebates in countries outside of the United States, to date, payments made to foreign governments have not represented a significant portion of our total government rebates. For government programs in the United States, we estimate these sales allowances based on contractual terms, historical utilization rates, new information regarding changes in these programs’ regulations and guidelines that would impact the amount of the actual rebates, our expectations regarding future utilization rates for these programs and channel inventory data obtained from our major U.S. wholesalers in accordance with our inventory management agreements. During 2009, 2008 and 2007, U.S government rebates of $885.5 million, $625.0 million and $423.3 million, respectively, representing 12%, 10% and 10% of total gross product sales, respectively, were deducted from gross product sales. We believe that the methodology that we use to estimate our sales allowances for government price reductions is reasonable and appropriate given the current facts and circumstances. However, actual results may differ. Based on the current information available to us, actual government rebates claimed for these periods have varied by less than 3% from our estimates recorded in those periods. As of December 31, 2009 and 2008, we had accrued U.S. government rebates of $242.9 million and $173.4 million, respectively, in other accrued liabilities and an allowance of $41.8 million and $32.8 million, respectively, recorded against accounts receivable. The following table summarizes the aggregate activity in our U.S. government rebates allowance and accrued liabilities accounts: Balance atBeginningof Year Chargedto Expense DeductedfromAccruals Balance atEnd ofYear Year ended December 31, 2009: Government rebates allowances and accrued liabilities Activity related to 2009 sales $ — $ 878,593 $ 594,579 $ 284,014 Activity related to sales prior to 2009 206,273 6,902 212,547 628 Total $ 206,273 $ 885,495 $ 807,126 $ 284,642 Year ended December 31, 2008: Government rebates allowances and accrued liabilities Activity related to 2008 sales $ — $ 627,935 $ 424,298 $ 203,637 Activity related to sales prior to 2008 139,370 (2,965 ) 133,769 2,636 Total $ 139,370 $ 624,970 $ 558,067 $ 206,273 Intangible Assets In conjunction with business combinations that we have completed, we have recorded intangible assets primarily related to marketed products, IPR&D projects and goodwill as part of our recognition and measurement of assets acquired and liabilities assumed in a business combination. Identifiable intangible assets, such as those 48 Table of Contents related to marketed products or IPR&D projects, are measured at their respective fair values as of the acquisition date. We believe the fair values assigned to our acquired intangible assets are based on reasonable estimates and assumptions given the available facts and circumstances as of the acquisition dates. Discounted cash flow models are used in valuing these intangible assets, and these models require the use of significant estimates and assumptions including but not limited to: • estimates of revenues and operating profits related to the products or product candidates; • the probability of success for unapproved product candidates considering their stages of development; • the time and resources needed to complete the development and approval of product candidates; • the life of the potential commercialized products and associated risks, including the inherent difficulties and uncertainties in developing a product candidate such as obtaining FDA and other regulatory approvals; and • risks related to the viability of and potential alternative treatments in any future target markets. Goodwill represents the excess of the consideration transferred over the estimated fair values of assets acquired and liabilities assumed in a business combination. Goodwill and intangible assets determined to have indefinite useful lives are not amortized, but are required to be tested for impairment at least annually. We test goodwill and other indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment on an annual basis and in between annual tests if we become aware of any events occurring or changes in circumstances that would indicate a reduction in the fair values of the assets below their carrying amounts. As of December 31, 2009, we had $601.5 million of indefinite-lived intangible assets consisting of $462.6 million of goodwill resulting from various business combinations and $138.9 million of intangible assets related to the IPR&D projects that we acquired from CV Therapeutics. Of the $138.9 million of IPR&D intangible assets that we acquired from CV Therapeutics, $93.4 million related to GS 9667 (formerly CVT-3619), a product candidate in Phase 1 clinical studies for the treatment of hypertriglyceridemia. The remaining balance of the intangible assets related to the IPR&D projects represented various other in-process projects with no single project comprising a significant portion of the total value. The estimated fair value of the IPR&D intangible assets acquired from CV Therapeutics was determined using the income approach, which discounts expected future cash flows to present value. We estimated the fair value of these intangible assets using a present value discount rate of 9%, which is based on the estimated weighted-average cost of capital for companies with profiles substantially similar to that of CV Therapeutics. This is comparable to the estimated internal rate of return for CV Therapeutics’ operations and represents the rate that market participants would use to value the intangible assets. We compensated for the differing phases of development of each project by probability-adjusting our estimation of the expected future cash flows associated with each project. We then determined the present value of the expected future cash flows using the discount rate of 9%. The projected cash flows from the IPR&D projects were based on various estimates and assumptions including those noted above. Intangible assets with finite useful lives are amortized over their estimated useful lives and are reviewed for impairment when facts or circumstances suggest that the carrying value of these assets may not be recoverable. We are amortizing the intangible asset related to the Ranexa product, which we acquired from CV Therapeutics, over its estimated useful life using an amortization rate derived from our forecasted future product sales for Ranexa. Our product sales forecasts are prepared annually and determined using our best estimates of future activity upon considering such factors as historical and expected future patient usage or uptake of our products, the introduction of complimentary or combination therapies or products and future product launch plans. If a previously unanticipated and significant change occurs to our sales forecasts, we will prospectively update the rate used to amortize our intangible asset related to Ranexa which may increase future cost of goods sold, as that is where we record the amortization expense. We are amortizing the intangible asset related to the Lexiscan product, which we also acquired from CV Therapeutics, over its estimated useful life to cost of goods sold on a 49 Table of Contents straight-line basis. Given that current Lexiscan revenues consist of royalties received from a collaboration partner and we will have limited ongoing access and visibility into that partner’s future sales forecasts, we cannot make a reasonable estimate of the amortization rate utilizing a forecasted product sales approach. As of December 31, 2009, we had $923.3 million of net unamortized finite-lived intangible assets consisting primarily of intangible assets related to the marketed products that we acquired from CV Therapeutics. Our judgment regarding the existence of impairment indicators is based on our historical and projected future operating results, our extent or manner of use of the acquired assets, legal and regulatory factors and events, our overall business strategy and market and economic trends. If events occur in the future that cause us to conclude that impairment indicators exist and that certain intangible assets are impaired, our financial condition and results of operations may be adversely impacted. Allowance for Doubtful Accounts We also maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments. This allowance is based on our analysis of several factors including, but not limited to, contractual payment terms, historical payment patterns of our customers and individual customer circumstances, an analysis of days sales outstanding by customer and geographic region and a review of the local economic environment and its potential impact on government funding and reimbursement practices. If the financial condition of our customers or the economic environment in which they operate were to deteriorate, resulting in an inability to make payments, additional allowances may be required. Our allowance for doubtful accounts balance as a percentage of total accounts receivable did not materially change from December 31, 2008 to December 31, 2009. We believe that the allowance for doubtful accounts is adequate to cover anticipated losses under current conditions; however, significant deterioration in any of the above factors, especially with respect to the government funding and reimbursement practices in the European market could materially change these expectations and may result in an increase to our allowance for doubtful accounts. Prepaid Royalties We capitalize royalties that we have prepaid at cost, specifically those related to the emtricitabine royalties we paid to Emory University (Emory) for the HIV indication, based on the present value of the future royalty obligation that we would expect to pay to Emory assuming certain expected future levels of our product sales incorporating emtricitabine. The present value of our future royalty obligation was derived using our weighted-average cost of capital. We review periodically the expected future sales levels of our products and any indicators that might require a write-down in the net recoverable value of our asset or a change in the estimated life of the prepaid royalty. Some potential indicators of impairment include the launch of a significant product by a competitor, significant deviations in recognized product sales compared to forecast and product safety issues and recalls. We amortize our prepaid royalties based on an effective royalty rate that we derive from forecasted future HIV product sales incorporating emtricitabine. Our product sales forecasts are prepared annually and determined using our best estimates of future activity upon considering such factors as historical and expected future patient usage or uptake of our products, the introduction of complimentary or combination therapies or products and future product launch plans. If a previously unanticipated and significant change occurs to our sales forecasts, including the introduction of a competing product by us or one of our competitors in the same HIV market as emtricitabine, we will prospectively update the royalty rate used to amortize our prepaid royalties which may increase future cost of goods sold, as that is where we record the amortization expense. As of December 31, 2009 and 2008, we had a prepaid royalty asset relating to the emtricitabine royalties we paid to Emory of $245.0 million and $275.0 million, respectively. Amortization expense relating to this prepaid royalty asset was $29.9 million, $31.8 million and $14.3 million for the years ended December 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively. 50 Table of Contents Clinical Trial Accruals We record accruals for estimated clinical study costs. Most of our clinical studies are performed by third party contract research organizations (CROs). These costs are a significant component of R&D expenses. During 2009, 2008 and 2007, we incurred CRO costs of $109.9 million, $111.8 million and $65.6 million, respectively. We accrue costs for clinical studies performed by CROs over the service periods specified in the contracts and adjust our estimates, if required, based upon our ongoing review of the level of effort and costs actually incurred by the CROs. We validate our accruals quarterly with our vendors and perform detailed reviews of the activities related to our significant contracts. Based upon the results of these validation processes, we assess the appropriateness of our accruals and make any adjustments we deem necessary to ensure that our expenses reflect the actual effort incurred by the CROs. Generally, a significant portion of the total clinical trial costs is associated with start up activities for the trial and patient enrollment. We extensively outsource our clinical trial activities and usually perform only a small portion of the start-up activities in-house. As a result, CROs typically perform most of the total start-up activities for our trials, including document preparation, site identification, screening and preparation, pre-study visits, training and program management. Start-up costs usually occur within a few months after the contract has been executed and are milestone or event driven in nature. The remaining clinical activities and related costs, such as patient monitoring and administration, generally occur ratably throughout the life of the individual contract or study. Most contracts are negotiated as fixed per unit prices and can vary in length between three months for a single dose Phase 1 clinical study and up to two years or more for a more complex Phase 3 clinical study. The average length of contracts in 2009, 2008 and 2007 has been at the upper end of this range in order to provide long-term safety and efficacy data to support the commercial launches of Truvada, Atripla, Viread, Hepsera, Emtriva, Letairis and Ranexa. All of our material CRO contracts are terminable by us upon written notice and we are generally only liable for actual effort expended by the CRO and certain non-cancelable expenses incurred at any point of termination. Amounts paid in advance relating to uncompleted services will be refunded to us if a contract is terminated. Some contracts may include additional termination payments that become due and payable if we terminate the contract. Such additional termination payments are only recorded if it becomes probable that a contract will be terminated. Through December 31, 2009, differences between actual and estimated activity levels for any particular study have not been material. However, if management does not receive complete and accurate information from our vendors or underestimates activity levels associated with a study at a given point in time, we may have to record additional and potentially significant R&D expenses in future periods. Tax Provision We estimate our income tax provision, including deferred tax assets and liabilities, based on significant management judgment. We evaluate the realization of all or a portion of our deferred tax assets on a quarterly basis. We record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets to the amounts that are more likely than not to be realized. We consider future taxable income, ongoing tax planning strategies and our historical financial performance in assessing the need for a valuation allowance. If we expect to realize deferred tax assets for which we have previously recorded a valuation allowance, we will reduce the valuation allowance in the period in which such determination is first made. Such an adjustment was made in 2009 and 2008 when we determined that it was more likely than not that certain of our deferred tax assets would be realized, and therefore, we released the related valuation allowance. This resulted in a credit to goodwill of approximately $8.0 million for 2008 and an income tax benefit of approximately $14.0 million and $15.5 million for 2009 and 2008, respectively. Our future effective income tax rate may be affected by such factors as changes in tax laws, regulations or rates, changing interpretation of existing laws or regulations, the impact of accounting for stock-based compensation, changes in our international organization and changes in overall levels of income before tax. 51 Table of Contents At December 31, 2009 and 2008, we had total federal, state and foreign unrecognized tax benefits of $93.3 million and $119.3 million, respectively, including interest of $5.4 million and $10.1 million, respectively. Of the total unrecognized tax benefits, $74.7 million and $111.1 million at December 31, 2009 and 2008, respectively, if recognized, would reduce our effective tax rate in the period of recognition. In 2009, we reached agreement with the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) on several issues related to the examinations of our federal income tax returns for 2003 through 2007. We also amended our California income tax returns for 2003 through 2007 based on the resolution of certain tax positions with the IRS. As a result, we reduced our unrecognized tax benefits by $76.2 million in 2009. As of December 31, 2009, we believe it is reasonably possible that our unrecognized tax benefits will decrease by approximately $5.0 million in the next 12 months as we expect to have clarification from the IRS around certain of our uncertain tax positions. With respect to the remaining unrecognized tax benefits, we are currently unable to make a reasonable estimate as to the period of cash settlement, if any, with the respective tax authorities. We file federal, state and foreign income tax returns in many jurisdictions in the United States and abroad. For federal income tax purposes, the statute of limitations is open for 2003 and onward. For certain acquired entities, the statute of limitations is open for all years from inception due to our utilization of their net operating losses and credits carried over from prior years. For California income tax purposes, the statute of limitations remains open for all years. Our income tax returns are audited by federal, state and foreign tax authorities. We are currently under examination by the IRS for the 2005, 2006 and 2007 tax years and by various state and foreign jurisdictions. There are differing interpretations of tax laws and regulations, and as a result, significant disputes may arise with these tax authorities involving issues of the timing and amount of deductions and allocations of income among various tax jurisdictions. We periodically evaluate our exposures associated with our tax filing positions. We record liabilities related to uncertain tax positions in accordance with the guidance that clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in an enterprise’s financial statements by prescribing a minimum recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. We do not believe any such uncertain tax positions currently pending will have a material adverse effect on our Consolidated Financial Statements, although an adverse resolution of one or more of these uncertain tax positions in any period could have a material impact on the results of operations for that period. Stock-based Compensation We measure all share-based payments to employees and directors, including grants of stock options, based on their relative fair values. Fair values of awards granted under our stock option plans and Employee Stock Purchase Plan were estimated at grant or purchase dates using a Black-Scholes option valuation model. The Black-Scholes option valuation model was developed for use in estimating the fair value of traded options, which have no vesting restrictions and are fully transferable. In addition, option valuation models require the input of highly subjective assumptions, including expected stock price volatility and expected award life. Stock-based compensation is recognized as expense over the requisite service periods in our Consolidated Statements of Income using a graded vesting expense attribution approach for non-vested stock options granted prior to January 1, 2006, and using the straight-line expense attribution approach for stock options granted after our adoption of new guidance for share-based payments to employees and directors on January 1, 2006. As stock-based compensation expenses related to stock options recognized on adoption of the new guidance is based on awards ultimately expected to vest, gross expense has been reduced for estimated forfeitures. The guidance requires forfeitures to be estimated at the time of grant and revised, if necessary, in subsequent periods if actual 52 Table of Contents forfeitures differ from those estimates. We estimated forfeitures based on our historical experience. Prior to the adoption of this guidance, pro forma information that was required to be disclosed included forfeitures as they occurred. As a result of the guidance adopted on January 1, 2006, we only recognize a tax benefit from stock-based compensation in additional paid-in capital (APIC) if an incremental tax benefit is realized after all other tax attributes currently available to us have been utilized. In addition, we have elected to account for the indirect benefits of stock-based compensation on the research tax credit and the extraterritorial income deduction through our Consolidated Statements of Income rather than through APIC. During the years ended December 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007, we recognized stock-based compensation expenses of $185.8 million, $153.4 million and $184.6 million, respectively, in operating expenses, and we capitalized $11.4 million, $9.9 million and $9.8 million, respectively, to inventory. As of December 31, 2009, we had unrecognized stock-based compensation expenses of $347.4 million related to non-vested stock options, which we expect to expense over an estimated weighted-average period of 2.7 years. Our management has discussed the development, selection and disclosure of these critical accounting policies with the Audit Committee of our Board, and the Audit Committee has reviewed the disclosure presented above relating to these critical accounting policies. Results of Operations Total Revenues We had total revenues of $7.01 billion in 2009, $5.34 billion in 2008 and $4.23 billion in 2007. Included in total revenues were product sales, royalty revenues and contract and other revenues. Product Sales The following table summarizes the period over period changes in our product sales (in thousands): 2009 Change 2008 Change 2007 Antiviral products: Truvada $ 2,489,682 18 % $ 2,106,687 33 % $ 1,589,229 Atripla 2,382,113 51 % 1,572,455 74 % 903,381 Viread 667,510 7 % 621,187 1 % 613,169 Hepsera 271,595 (20 )% 341,023 13 % 302,722 Emtriva 27,974 (10 )% 31,080 (1 )% 31,493 Total antiviral products 5,838,874 25 % 4,672,432 36 % 3,439,994 AmBisome 298,597 3 % 289,651 10 % 262,571 Letairis 183,949 63 % 112,855 437 % 21,020 Ranexa 131,062 — — — — Other 16,829 71 % 9,858 4 % 9,524 Total product sales $ 6,469,311 27 % $ 5,084,796 36 % $ 3,733,109 Total product sales increased by 27% in 2009 compared to 2008 and by 36% in 2008 compared to 2007, due primarily to an overall increase in our antiviral product sales including the strong growth of Atripla sales as well as the continued growth of Truvada sales. Foreign currency denominated product sales experienced a net loss from the appreciation of the U.S. dollar of approximately $98.5 million for 2009 compared to 2008, and a net benefit from the depreciation of the U.S. dollar of approximately $148.2 million for 2008 compared to 2007. A significant percentage of our product sales continued to be denominated in foreign currencies. We used foreign currency exchange forward and option contracts to hedge a percentage of our forecasted international sales, primarily those denominated in Euro. This reduced, but did not eliminate, fluctuations in sales due to changes in foreign currency exchange rates. 53 Table of Contents Antiviral Products Antiviral product sales increased 25% in 2009 compared to 2008 and by 36% in 2008 compared to 2007, driven primarily by sales volume growth of Atripla and Truvada. The increase in 2008 compared to 2007 was also due to a favorable foreign currency exchange impact. • Truvada Truvada sales increased by 18% in 2009 compared to 2008, driven primarily by sales volume growth in the United States and Europe, partially offset by an unfavorable foreign currency exchange impact. Truvada sales increased by 33% in 2008 compared to 2007 driven primarily by sales volume growth in the United States and Europe and a favorable foreign currency exchange impact. Truvada sales accounted for 43%, 45% and 46% of our total antiviral product sales for 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively. • Atripla Atripla sales increased by 51% in 2009 compared to 2008, driven primarily by sales volume growth in the United States and Europe. The European growth benefited from the launch of Atripla in France in the second quarter of 2009. Atripla sales increased by 74% in 2008 compared to 2007, driven primarily by the continued uptake of Atripla in the United States, as well as launches of the product in most European countries. Atripla sales include the efavirenz portion at zero product gross margin. The efavirenz portion of our Atripla sales was approximately $880.7 million, $576.0 million and $334.3 million in 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively. Atripla sales accounted for 41%, 34% and 26% of our total antiviral product sales for 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively. • Other Antiviral Products Other antiviral product sales, which include product sales of Viread, Hepsera and Emtriva decreased by 3% for 2009 compared to 2008, driven primarily by sales volume decreases in Hepsera, partially offset by sales volume increases in Viread for the treatment of patients with chronic hepatitis B. Other antiviral product sales increased by 5% in 2008 compared to 2007, driven primarily by a 13% increase in Hepsera sales which benefited from a favorable foreign currency exchange impact as well as sales volume growth in certain European countries. AmBisome Sales of AmBisome increased 3% in 2009 compared to 2008, driven primarily by sales volume growth in certain European markets, partially offset by an unfavorable foreign currency exchange impact. Sales of AmBisome increased 10% in 2008 compared to 2007, driven primarily by a favorable foreign currency exchange impact and sales volume growth in certain European markets. AmBisome product sales in the United States and Canada relate solely to our sales of AmBisome to Astellas Pharma US, Inc. which are recorded at our manufacturing cost. Letairis Sales of Letairis for the treatment of PAH increased by 63% for 2009 compared to 2008, driven primarily by sales volume growth in the United States. Sales of Letairis increased 437% in 2008 compared to 2007, driven primarily by sales volume growth in the United States as Letairis was launched in June of 2007. Ranexa Sales of Ranexa were $131.1 million for the period from April 15, 2009 (the date of our acquisition of CV Therapeutics) to December 31, 2009. We expect total product sales to continue to grow in 2010 as we continue to expand our sales and marketing efforts. 54 Table of Contents Royalty Revenues The following table summarizes the period over period changes in our royalty revenues (in thousands): 2009 Change 2008 Change 2007 Royalty revenues $ 491,818 125 % $ 218,180 (53 )% $ 468,155 Our most significant source of royalty revenues for 2009, 2008 and 2007 was from sales of Tamiflu by Roche. Royalty revenues for 2009 were $491.8 million, an increase of 125% compared to 2008, driven primarily by the recognition of Tamiflu royalties from Roche of $392.7 million in 2009 compared to Tamiflu royalties from Roche of $155.5 million in 2008. The higher Tamiflu royalties for 2009 were due to increased Tamiflu sales by Roche related primarily to pandemic planning initiatives worldwide. Royalty revenues for 2008 were $218.2 million, a decrease of 53% compared to 2007, driven primarily by the recognition of Tamiflu royalties from Roche of $155.5 million in 2008 compared to Tamiflu royalties from Roche of $414.5 million in 2007. The lower Tamiflu royalties for 2008 was due primarily to decreased Roche sales related to pandemic planning initiatives worldwide. We recognize royalties on Tamiflu sales by Roche in the quarter following the quarter in which Tamiflu is sold. Cost of Goods Sold and Product Gross Margin The following table summarizes the period over period changes in our product sales (in thousands), cost of goods sold (in thousands) and product gross margin: 2009 Change 2008 Change 2007 Total product sales $ 6,469,311 27% $ 5,084,796 36% $ 3,733,109 Cost of goods sold $ 1,595,558 42% $ 1,127,246 47% $ 768,771 Product gross margin 75% 78% 79% Our product gross margin for 2009 was 75%, compared to 78% for 2008. The lower product gross margin in 2009 was due primarily to the higher proportion of Atripla sales, which include the efavirenz portion at zero product gross margin, as well as the amortization associated with the intangible assets acquired in our acquisition of CV Therapeutics. Our product gross margin for 2008 was 78% compared to 79% for 2007. The decrease in product gross margin was due primarily to the higher proportion of Atripla sales, which include the efavirenz portion at zero product gross margin, and the impact of changes in the product and geographic mix of our product sales. A higher mix of Atripla product sales decreases our overall product gross margin. Although we record 100% of Atripla product sales, we only benefit from the product gross margin on the Truvada portion of Atripla sales. The efavirenz portion of Atripla sales carries a zero product gross profit and gross margin since we purchase efavirenz from Bristol-Myers Squibb Company (BMS) at BMS’s net selling price of efavirenz. We expect our product gross margin in 2010 to be lower compared to 2009, due primarily to a higher proportion of expected Atripla sales. 55 Table of Contents Research and Development Expenses The following table summarizes the period over period changes in the major components of our R&D expenses (in thousands): 2009 Change 2008 Change 2007 Research $ 185,019 16 % $ 159,148 21 % $ 131,019 Clinical development 615,041 37 % 449,598 25 % 361,091 Pharmaceutical development 139,858 24 % 113,022 14 % 98,916 Total research and development $ 939,918 30 % $ 721,768 22 % $ 591,026 R&D expenses consist primarily of personnel costs, including salaries, benefits and stock-based compensation, clinical studies performed by CROs, materials and supplies, licenses and fees and overhead allocations consisting of various support and facilities-related costs. Our R&D activities are separated into three main categories: research, clinical development and pharmaceutical development. Research costs typically consist of preclinical and toxicology costs. Clinical development costs include costs for clinical trials. Pharmaceutical development expenses consist of costs for product formulation and chemical analysis. R&D expenses in 2009 increased by $218.2 million or 30%, compared to 2008, due primarily to increased compensation and benefits expenses of $88.8 million driven by higher headcount related to the growth of our business, the R&D expense reimbursement related to our Tibotec TMC278 collaboration of $52.4 million and increased clinical study expenses of $23.9 million. The increase in compensation and benefits expenses was also driven by severance and termination benefits associated with our restructuring activities related to our acquisition of CV Therapeutics. R&D expenses in 2008 increased by $130.7 million or 22%, compared to 2007, due primarily to increased clinical study expenses of $75.2 million primarily in the antiviral and cardiovascular areas, as well as increased compensation and benefits expenses of $50.7 million due primarily to higher headcount. In general, significant collaboration payments, like those made to Tibotec, will cause our R&D expenses to fluctuate period over period. In 2010, we expect R&D expenses to increase over 2009 levels due to increased spending on our internal and collaborative R&D efforts as we anticipate that some of our product candidates will progress into more advanced clinical studies as well as adding more clinical development programs to our pipeline. Selling, General and Administrative Expenses The following table summarizes the period over period changes in our SG&A expenses over the last three years (in thousands): 2009 Change 2008 Change 2007 Selling, general and administrative $ 946,686 19 % $ 797,344 13 % $ 705,741 SG&A expenses in 2009 increased by $149.3 million or 19%, compared to 2008, due primarily to increased compensation and benefits expenses of $75.4 million driven by higher headcount related to the growth of our business, increased contract and professional services expenses of $46.6 million driven primarily by our expanding sales and marketing activities and $5.8 million related to certain contract termination costs. The increase in compensation and benefits expenses was also driven by severance and termination benefits associated with our restructuring activities related to our acquisition of CV Therapeutics. SG&A expenses for 2008 increased by $91.6 million or 13%, compared to 2007, due primarily to increased compensation and benefits expenses of $41.6 million due largely to higher headcount, increased marketing and 56 Table of Contents promotional expenses of $19.9 million to support our expanded commercial operations, increased consulting and support services expenses of $13.0 million related to the growth in our business, and costs of $12.4 million associated with certain employee termination-related disputes in our international operations. In 2010, we expect SG&A expenses to increase over 2009 levels due to increased investment to support the growth in our HIV franchise, the full year impact of sales and marketing activities for Ranexa and the commercialization of Cayston. We believe we have the appropriate infrastructure to support the growth of our business in 2010. Purchased In-process Research and Development Expenses In connection with our acquisition of the cicletanine assets from Navitas Assets, LLC in 2008, we recorded IPR&D expense of $10.9 million during the year ended December 31, 2008. As we do not consider the acquisition to be a material purchase, we have not made further disclosures regarding the related purchased IPR&D. In connection with our acquisition of Myogen in 2006, we recorded purchased IPR&D expenses of $2.06 billion during the year ended December 31, 2006 related to the ambrisentan and darusentan IPR&D projects that we acquired. The purchased IPR&D expense represented the estimated fair value of Myogen’s incomplete R&D projects that had not yet reached technological feasibility and had no alternative future uses as of the acquisition date and, therefore, was expensed upon acquisition. With respect to ambrisentan, in June 2007, the FDA approved Letairis for the treatment of PAH in the United States. Additionally, in April 2008, the European Commission granted our collaboration partner, GSK, marketing authorization for ambrisentan for the treatment of PAH, which is marketed under the name Volibris by GSK. With respect to darusentan, in December 2009, we announced plans to terminate the development of darusentan for the treatment of resistant hypertension after our second Phase 3 study of the compound failed to meet its co-primary efficacy endpoints. In connection with our acquisition of Corus Pharma, Inc. (Corus) in 2006, we recorded purchased IPR&D expenses of $335.6 million during the year ended December 31, 2006 related to the aztreonam for inhalation solution for CF IPR&D project that we acquired. The purchased IPR&D expense represented the estimated fair value of Corus’s incomplete R&D project that had not yet reached technological feasibility and had no alternative future use as of the acquisition date and, therefore, was expensed upon acquisition. In February 2010, we received marketing approval from the FDA for Cayston as a treatment to improve respiratory symptoms in CF patients with P. aeruginosa. Cayston was conditionally approved in Europe and Canada in September 2009. Interest and Other Income, Net We recorded interest and other income, net, of $42.4 million, $59.4 million and $109.8 million in 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively. The decrease in 2009 compared to 2008 was due primarily to decreased interest income of $40.6 million driven by a reduction in the average yield of our investment portfolio as a result of lower interest rates, partially offset by an increase in net foreign currency exchange gains of $15.7 million. The decrease in 2008 compared to 2007 was due primarily to increased costs related to our hedging activities of $32.3 million, net foreign currency exchange losses of $15.7 million and decreased interest income of $7.5 million due primarily to lower interest rates, partially offset by the write-downs of certain securities recorded in 2007. Interest Expense On January 1, 2009, we adopted guidance for our convertible senior notes due in 2011 (2011 Notes) and convertible senior notes due in 2013 (2013 Notes) (collectively, the Notes) on a retrospective basis. The guidance requires us to bifurcate the conversion option from the debt instrument by classifying the conversion option in equity and then accreting the resulting discount on the debt as additional interest expense over the expected life of the debt. As a result of the retrospective adoption of this guidance, we reflected additional interest expense of 57 Table of Contents $53.1 million and $50.1 million, respectively, and a related benefit from income taxes of $20.9 million and $19.7 million, respectively, in 2008 and 2007. We recorded additional interest expense of $56.2 million and a related benefit from income taxes of $21.9 million in 2009. Our interest expense was $69.7 million, $65.2 million and $63.2 million in 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively. The increases in 2009 compared to 2008 and in 2008 compared to 2007 were due primarily to the effect of accreting the debt discount on the Notes as additional interest expense over the expected life of the debt as discussed above. Provision for Income Taxes Our provision for income taxes was $876.4 million, $702.4 million and $635.4 million in 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively. The 2009 effective tax rate of 25.0% differed from the U.S. federal statutory rate of 35% due primarily to tax credits, the resolution of certain tax positions with tax authorities and certain operating earnings from non-U.S. subsidiaries that are considered indefinitely invested outside the United States, partially offset by state taxes and the revaluation of certain state tax assets related to the integration of CV Therapeutics. We do not provide for U.S. income taxes on undistributed earnings of our foreign operations that are intended to be permanently reinvested. The 2008 effective tax rate of 26.3% differs from the U.S. federal statutory rate of 35% due primarily to tax credits, the resolution of certain tax positions with tax authorities and certain operating earnings from non-U.S. subsidiaries that are considered indefinitely invested outside the United States, partially offset by state taxes. The 2007 effective tax rate of 28.7% differs from the U.S. federal statutory rate of 35% due primarily to tax credits and certain operating earnings from non-U.S. subsidiaries that are considered indefinitely invested outside the United States, partially offset by state taxes. As of December 31, 2009 and 2008, we had total federal, state and foreign unrecognized tax benefits of $93.3 million and $119.3 million, respectively, including interest of $5.4 million and $10.1 million, respectively. Of the total unrecognized tax benefits, $74.7 million and $111.1 million at December 31, 2009 and 2008, respectively, if recognized, would reduce our effective tax rate in the period of recognition. We have continued to classify interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits as part of our income tax provision in our Consolidated Statements of Income. In 2009, we reached agreement with the IRS on several issues related to the examinations of our federal income tax returns for 2003 through 2007. We also amended our California income tax returns for 2003 through 2007 based on the resolution of certain tax positions with the IRS. As a result, we reduced our unrecognized tax benefits by $76.2 million in 2009. As of December 31, 2009, we believe it is reasonably possible that our unrecognized tax benefits will decrease by approximately $5.0 million in the next 12 months as we expect to have clarification from the IRS and other tax authorities around certain of our uncertain tax positions. With respect to the remaining unrecognized tax benefits, we are currently unable to make a reasonable estimate as to the period of cash settlement, if any, with the respective tax authorities. 58 Table of Contents Liquidity and Capital Resources The following table summarizes our cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities, our working capital and our cash flow activities as of the end of, and for each of, the last three years (in thousands): 2009 2008 2007 As of December 31: Cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities $ 3,904,846 $ 3,239,639 $ 2,722,422 Working capital $ 2,940,927 $ 3,057,416 $ 2,271,344 Year Ended December 31: Cash provided by (used in): Operating activities $ 3,080,054 $ 2,143,384 $ 1,669,082 Investing activities $ (2,215,900 ) $ (178,819 ) $ (1,302,467 ) Financing activities $ (1,051,438 ) $ (1,474,569 ) $ (170,983 ) Cash, Cash Equivalents and Marketable Securities Cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities totaled $3.90 billion at December 31, 2009, an increase of $665.2 million or 21% from December 31, 2008. This increase was primarily attributable to net cash provided by operations of $3.08 billion and proceeds from issuances of common stock under our employee stock plans of $222.7 million, partially offset by the following: • cash used to acquire CV Therapeutics of $1.13 billion, net of cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities acquired from CV Therapeutics of $245.4 million; • $998.5 million used to repurchase our common stock under our stock repurchase program; and • $305.5 million used to extinguish the convertible senior notes we assumed in our acquisition of CV Therapeutics. Cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities totaled $3.24 billion at December 31, 2008, an increase of $517.2 million or 19% from December 31, 2007. This increase was primarily attributable to: • net cash provided by operations of $2.14 billion in 2008; and • proceeds from issuances of common stock under our employee stock plans of $246.1 million in 2008. This increase from 2007 to 2008 was partially offset by our repurchases of $1.97 billion of our common stock under our stock repurchase program during 2008. Working Capital Working capital was $2.94 billion at December 31, 2009, a decrease of $116.5 million or 4% from working capital as of December 31, 2008. This decrease was primarily attributable to: • an increase of $209.3 million in accounts payable due primarily to the purchases of efavirenz at its estimated market value from BMS; and • a decrease of $133.1 million in cash, cash equivalents and short-term marketable securities since we held a higher proportion of long-term marketable securities as of December 31, 2009 compared to December 31, 2008. This decrease from 2008 to 2009 was partially offset by an increase of $366.1 million in our accounts receivable, net, driven primarily by increased product sales. 59 Table of Contents Working capital at December 31, 2008 was $3.06 billion, an increase of $786.1 million from December 31, 2007. This increase was primarily attributable to: • an increase of $327.9 million in inventories due primarily to the purchases of efavirenz at its estimated market value from BMS; • an increase of $228.3 million in accounts receivable, net, driven primarily by increased product sales; and • an increase of $618.1 million in cash, cash equivalents and short-term marketable securities. This increase from 2007 to 2008 was partially offset by a $310.9 million increase in accounts payable due primarily to the purchases of efavirenz at its estimated market value from BMS. Cash Provided by Operating Activities Cash provided by operating activities of $3.08 billion in 2009 primarily related to net income of $2.63 billion, adjusted for non-cash items such as $180.7 million of stock-based compensation expenses and $148.4 million of amortization expenses. As a result of our adoption of the guidance for our joint ventures with BMS on January 1, 2009, we reclassified the change in noncontrolling interest from cash provided by operating activities to cash used in financing activities. Cash provided by operating activities of $2.14 billion in 2008 primarily related to net income of $1.97 billion, adjusted for non-cash items such as $209.5 million of tax benefits from employee stock plans and $153.4 million of stock-based compensation expenses. This was partially offset by $191.9 million of excess tax benefits from stock option exercises which we reclassified to cash used in financing activities. Cash provided by operating activities of $1.67 billion in 2007 primarily related to net income of $1.58 billion, adjusted for non-cash items such as $184.6 million of stock-based compensation expenses, $113.4 million of deferred income taxes and $110.7 million of tax benefits related to employee stock plans. This was partially offset by a $332.4 million net cash outflow related to changes in operating assets and liabilities. Cash Used in Investing Activities Cash used in investing activities in 2009 was $2.22 billion, driven by cash used for our acquisition of CV Therapeutics of $1.25 billion (net of cash acquired), a net use of $738.0 million in purchases of marketable securities and $230.1 million of capital expenditures for the year. Capital expenditures made in 2009, 2008 and 2007 related primarily to the expansion of our manufacturing capabilities, upgrades to our facilities and spending on computer and laboratory equipment, as well as enterprise software, to accommodate our continued business growth. Capital expenditures in 2009 also included the purchase of an office building and approximately 30 acres of land located in Foster City, California. Cash used in investing activities in 2008 was $178.8 million, driven primarily by a net use of $53.0 million in purchases of marketable securities and $115.0 million of capital expenditures for the year. Cash used in investing activities in 2007 was $1.30 billion, driven primarily by a net use of $1.17 billion in purchases of marketable securities, cash used in our acquisition of Nycomed Limited of $46.4 million (net of cash acquired) and $78.6 million of capital expenditures for the year. Capital expenditures in 2007 included the construction of a new building at our Foster City, California headquarters. As of December 31, 2009, we had capital expenditure commitments of $24.8 million, which consisted primarily of enterprise software purchase commitments. We expect to fulfill such commitments from funds generated from our operating cash flows. 60 Table of Contents Cash Used in Financing Activities Cash used in financing activities in 2009 was $1.05 billion, driven primarily by the $998.5 million used to repurchase our common stock under our stock repurchase program and the $305.5 million used to extinguish the convertible senior notes assumed from the acquisition of CV Therapeutics. The cash outflows were partially offset by proceeds of $222.7 million from issuances of common stock under our employee stock plans. As a result of our adoption of the guidance for our joint ventures with BMS on January 1, 2009, we reclassified the change in noncontrolling interest from cash provided by operating activities to cash used in financing activities, as discussed above. Under our amended and restated credit agreement, we, along with our wholly-owned subsidiary, Gilead Biopharmaceutics Ireland Corporation, may borrow up to an aggregate of $1.25 billion in revolving credit loans. The credit agreement also includes a sub-facility for swing-line loans and letters of credit. Loans under the credit agreement bear interest at an interest rate of either LIBOR plus a margin ranging from 0.20 percent to 0.32 percent or the base rate, as described in the credit agreement. In April 2009, in connection with the acquisition of CV Therapeutics, we borrowed $400.0 million under the credit agreement to partially fund the acquisition and had fully repaid the amount as of December 31, 2009. The credit agreement will terminate in December 2012 and all unpaid borrowings thereunder shall be due and payable at that time. We may reduce the commitments and may prepay loans under the credit agreement in whole or in part without penalty, subject to certain conditions. As of December 31, 2009, approximately $1.25 billion was available to be drawn down under this credit agreement. Cash used in financing activities in 2008 was $1.47 billion, driven primarily by the $1.97 billion used to repurchase our common stock under our stock repurchase program. The cash outflows were partially offset by proceeds of $246.1 million that we received from issuances of common stock under our employee stock plans as well as $191.9 million of excess tax benefits from stock option exercises. In October 2007, our Board authorized a program for the repurchase of our common stock in an aggregate amount of up to $3.00 billion through open market and private block transactions pursuant to Rule 10b5-1 plans, privately negotiated purchases or other means. In 2008, under this stock repurchase program, we repurchased shares in the open market and also entered into two structured accelerated share repurchase transactions with third parties which are described below. In February and October 2008, we entered into accelerated share repurchase agreements with a financial institution to repurchase our common stock on an accelerated basis. For the February 2008 transaction, we paid $500.0 million to settle the initial purchase and received 9,373,548 shares of our common stock at a price of $53.34 per share. In June 2008, upon termination of the agreement we received an additional 239,612 shares of our common stock based on the average of the daily volume weighted-average prices of our common stock during a specified period less a predetermined discount per share. As a result, the total number of shares repurchased and retired under this accelerated share repurchase agreement was 9,613,160 shares at an average purchase price of $52.01 per share. For the October 2008 transaction, we paid $750.0 million to settle the initial purchase and received 14,874,519 shares of our common stock at a price of $50.42 per share. In March 2009, upon termination of the agreement we received an additional 1,356,337 shares of our common stock based on the average of the daily volume weighted-average prices of our common stock during a specified period less a predetermined discount per share. As a result, the total number of shares repurchased and retired under this accelerated share repurchase agreement was 16,230,856 shares at an average purchase price of $46.21 per share. As of December 31, 2009, we completed share repurchases under our $3.00 billion stock repurchase program. In January 2010, our Board authorized a new program for the repurchase of our common stock in an aggregate amount of up to $1.00 billion through open market and private block transactions pursuant to Rule 10b5-1 plans, privately negotiated purchases or other means. This stock repurchase plan will expire in January 2011. Cash used in financing activities in 2007 was $171.0 million, driven primarily by the $487.5 million used to repurchase our common stock under our stock repurchase program and $99.0 million used to pay off all 61 Table of Contents remaining amounts due on our term loan, partially offset by proceeds from issuances of common stock under our employee stock plans of $243.4 million, distributions from noncontrolling interest of $96.3 million as well as $76.3 million of excess tax benefits from stock option exercises. We believe that our existing capital resources, supplemented by cash generated from our operations, will be adequate to satisfy our capital needs for the foreseeable future. Our future capital requirements will depend on many factors, including but not limited to the following: • the commercial performance of our current and future products; • the progress and scope of our R&D efforts, including preclinical studies and clinical trials; • the cost, timing and outcome of regulatory reviews; • the expansion of our sales and marketing capabilities; • administrative expenses; • the possibility of acquiring additional manufacturing capabilities or office facilities; • the possibility of acquiring other companies or new products; • the establishment of additional collaborative relationships with other companies; and • costs associated with the defense, settlement and adverse results of litigation and government investigations. We may in the future require additional funding, which could be in the form of proceeds from equity or debt financings. If such funding is required, we cannot assure that it will be available to us on favorable terms, if at all. Off Balance Sheet Arrangements We do not have any off balance sheet arrangements. Contractual Obligations Our contractual obligations consist of debt obligations, operating leases, capital commitments, purchase obligations for active pharmaceutical ingredients and inventory-related items and clinical trials contracts. The following table summarizes our significant enforceable and legally binding obligations, future commitments and obligations related to all contracts that we are likely to continue regardless of the fact that certain of these obligations may be cancelable as of December 31, 2009 (in thousands): Contractual Obligations Payments due by Period Total Less than oneyear 1-3 years 3-5 years More than 5years Convertible senior notes(1) $ 1,299,854 $ — $ 649,987 $ 649,867 $ — Operating lease obligations 244,010 46,514 80,554 46,824 70,118 Capital commitments(2) 24,780 14,518 10,262 — — Purchase obligations(3)(4) 1,117,862 820,058 249,110 48,694 — Clinical trials(5) 201,814 95,478 76,186 26,793 3,357 Total $ 2,888,320 $ 976,568 $ 1,066,099 $ 772,178 $ 73,475 (1) At December 31, 2009, we had outstanding principal of $1.16 billion under the Notes that we issued in April 2006. (2) At December 31, 2009, we had firm capital project commitments of approximately $24.8 million primarily relating to enterprise software purchase commitments. 62 Table of Contents (3) At December 31, 2009, we had firm purchase commitments related to active pharmaceutical ingredients and certain inventory-related items. These amounts represent minimum purchase requirements and actual purchases are expected to significantly exceed these amounts. (4) In addition to the above, we have committed to make potential future milestone payments to third parties as part of licensing, collaboration and development arrangements. Payments under these agreements generally become due and payable only upon achievement of certain developmental, regulatory and/or commercial milestones. Because the achievement of these milestones is neither probable nor reasonably estimable, such contingencies have not been recorded on our Consolidated Balance Sheets and have not been included in the table above. (5) At December 31, 2009, we had several clinical studies in various clinical trial phases. Our most significant clinical trial expenditures are to CROs. Although all of our material contracts with CROs are cancelable, we historically have not cancelled such contracts. These amounts reflect commitments based on existing contracts and do not reflect any future modifications to, or terminations of, existing contracts or anticipated or potential new contracts. We had total gross unrecognized tax benefit liabilities of $116.0 million as of December 31, 2009. We believe that it is reasonably possible that our unrecognized tax benefits will decrease by approximately $5.0 million in the next 12 months as we expect to have clarification from the tax authorities around certain of our uncertain tax positions. With respect to the remaining unrecognized tax benefits, we are currently unable to make a reasonable estimate as to the period of cash settlement, if any, with the respective tax authorities. Such amounts were included in long-term income taxes payable and non current deferred tax assets on our Consolidated Balance Sheet and have not been included in the table above. Recent Accounting Pronouncements In June 2009, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued amended standards for determining whether to consolidate a variable interest entity under Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) section 810-10-25. These amended standards eliminate a mandatory quantitative approach to determine whether a variable interest gives the entity a controlling financial interest in a variable interest entity in favor of a qualitatively focused analysis, and require an ongoing reassessment of whether the entity is a primarily beneficiary. The amended standards are effective for us beginning in the first quarter of 2010. We have been consolidating our joint ventures with BMS because we are the primary beneficiary. We are still evaluating whether the revised standard will have any impact on our Consolidated Financial Statements. In October 2009, the FASB issued new standards for revenue recognition for agreements with multiple deliverables. These new standards impact the determination of when the individual deliverables included in a multiple element arrangement may be treated as separate units of accounting. Additionally, these new standards modify the manner in which the transaction consideration is allocated across the separately identified deliverables by no longer permitting the residual method of allocating arrangement consideration. These new standards are effective for us beginning in the first quarter of 2011, however early adoption is permitted. We have not yet evaluated whether these new standards will have a material impact on our Consolidated Financial Statements. ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK Foreign Currency Exchange Risk Our operations include manufacturing and sales activities in the United States, Canada and Ireland as well as sales activities in countries outside the United States, including Europe and Australia. As a result, our financial results could be significantly affected by factors such as changes in foreign currency exchange rates or weak economic conditions in the foreign markets in which we distribute our products. Our operating results are exposed to changes in foreign currency exchange rates between the U.S. dollar and various foreign currencies, 63 Table of Contents the most significant of which is the Euro. When the U.S. dollar strengthens against these currencies, the relative value of sales made in the respective foreign currency decreases. Conversely, when the U.S. dollar weakens against these currencies, the relative amounts of such sales increase. Overall, we are a net receiver of foreign currencies and, therefore, benefit from a weaker U.S. dollar and are adversely affected by a stronger U.S. dollar relative to those foreign currencies in which we transact significant amounts of business. A significant percentage of our product sales are denominated in foreign currencies. We enter into foreign currency exchange forward and option contracts to partially mitigate the impact of changes in currency exchange rates on net cash flows from our foreign currency denominated sales. We also hedge certain monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies, which reduces but does not eliminate our exposure to currency fluctuations between the date a transaction is recorded and the date that cash is collected or paid. In general, the market risks of these contracts are offset by corresponding gains and losses on the transactions being hedged. The following table summarizes the notional amounts, weighted-average currency exchange rates and fair values of our open foreign currency exchange forward contracts at December 31, 2009. We had no foreign currency exchange option contracts outstanding at December 31, 2009. All contracts have maturities of 18 months or less. Weighted-average rates are stated in terms of the amount of U.S. dollars per foreign currency. Fair values represent estimated settlement amounts at December 31, 2009 (notional amounts and fair values in U.S. dollars and in thousands): Foreign Currency Exchange Forward Contracts Currency NotionalAmount Weighted-AverageSettlement Price Fair Value Euro $ 2,728,279 1.43 $ (4,430 ) British Pound 311,293 1.60 2,305 Canadian Dollar 153,218 1.12 (11,216 ) Australian Dollar 81,632 0.84 (5,228 ) Swiss Franc 67,976 1.06 (898 ) Danish Krone 35,130 5.22 (318 ) Swedish Krone 27,097 7.38 (581 ) Norwegian Krone 18,163 6.05 (750 ) New Zealand Dollar 16,683 0.81 (366 ) Turkish Lira 6,134 1.52 (7 ) Total $ 3,445,605 $ (21,489 ) The total notional amount of $3.45 billion and total fair value relating to our net liability of $21.5 million on our open foreign currency exchange forward contracts at December 31, 2009 compares with the total notional amount of $2.39 billion and total fair value relating to our net asset of $90.7 million on our open foreign currency exchange forward and option contracts at December 31, 2008. Interest Rate Risk Our portfolio of available-for-sale marketable securities and our fixed and variable rate liabilities create an exposure to interest rate risk. With respect to our investment portfolio, we adhere to an investment policy that requires us to limit amounts invested in securities based on credit rating, maturity, industry group and investment type and issuer, except for securities issued by the U.S. government. The goals of our investment policy, in order of priority, are as follows: • safety and preservation of principal and diversification of risk; • liquidity of investments sufficient to meet cash flow requirements; and • competitive after-tax rate of return. 64 Table of Contents The following table summarizes the expected maturities and average interest rates of our interest-generating assets and interest-bearing liabilities at December 31, 2009 (dollars in thousands): Years Ending December 31, Thereafter Total Total FairValue atDecember 31,2009 2010 2011 2012 2013 2014 Assets Available-for-sale debt securities $ 442,757 $ 966,140 $ 854,743 $ 102,175 $ 23,020 $ 288,280 $ 2,677,115 $ 2,677,115 Average interest rate 0.5 % 1.1 % 1.7 % 2.4 % 3.3 % 0.9 % Liabilities Convertible senior notes(1) $ — $ 649,987 $ — $ 649,867 $ — $ — $ 1,299,854 $ 1,577,695 Average interest rate 0.5 % 0.6 % (1) In April 2006, we issued the Notes in a private placement pursuant to Rule 144A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended. The Notes were issued at par and bear interest rates of 0.50% and 0.625% for the 2011 Notes and 2013 Notes, respectively, and may be converted into shares of our common stock subject to certain circumstances. Credit Risk A portion of our marketable securities consist of auction rate securities. In 2008, we began observing the failed auctions for auction rate securities whose underlying assets are comprised of student loans. As of December 31, 2009, we held approximately $104.8 million of auction rate securities within our available-for-sale long-term marketable securities whose underlying assets were comprised of student loans. Our auction rate securities comprised approximately 3% of our total cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities as of December 31, 2009. All of our auction rate securities, including those subject to the failed auctions, are currently rated AAA, consistent with the high quality rating required by our investment policy, are supported by the federal government as part of the Federal Family Education Loan Program, and are over-collateralized. Our auction rate securities reset every seven to 35 days with maturity dates ranging from 2023 through 2041 and have annual interest rates ranging from 0.4% to 1.2%. As of December 31, 2009, our auction rate securities continued to earn interest. If auctions continue to fail for securities in which we have invested, we may be unable to liquidate some or all of our auction rate securities at par, should we need or desire to access the funds invested in those securities. However, based on our total cash and marketable securities position, our expected operating cash flows as well as access to funds through our credit facility, we believe that we will be able to hold these securities until there is a recovery in the auction market and the related securities, which may be at final maturity. As a result, we do not anticipate that the current illiquidity of these auction rate securities will have a material effect on our cash requirements or working capital. In light of the volatility and developments that we have seen in the financial markets, we continue to review our cash equivalents and marketable securities carefully and strive to invest prudently. We believe that maintaining the primary goals of our investment policy, safety and preservation of principal and diversification of risk, as well as liquidity, has protected us from many of the risks in the credit markets while allowing us to continue to meet our operating cash flow requirements as well as execute on other strategic opportunities such as the acquisition of CV Therapeutics in 2009. Our accounts receivable balance at December 31, 2009 was $1.39 billion, compared to $1.02 billion at December 31, 2008. The growth in our accounts receivable balance was due primarily to higher product sales of our antiviral products in the United States and Europe. Our European product sales to government-owned or supported customers in Greece, Italy, Portugal and Spain are subject to significant payment delays due to government funding and reimbursement practices. This has resulted and may continue to result in an increase in days sales outstanding due to the average length of time that we have accounts receivable outstanding. This, in turn, may increase the credit risk related to certain of our customers. Sales to customers in these countries in Europe that tend to pay relatively slowly have increased, and may continue to further increase. At December 31, 65 Table of Contents 2009, our accounts receivable for Greece, Italy, Portugal and Spain totaled $753.6 million, of which $289.4 million was more than 120 days past due based on contractual payment terms. To date, we have not experienced significant losses with respect to the collection of our accounts receivable and believe that our accounts receivable, net of allowances, as reflected in our Consolidated Balance Sheets, are collectible.",2023-12-30 19:04:19.493370

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS The following Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (MD&A) is intended to help the reader understand our results of operations and financial condition. MD&A is provided as a supplement to, and should be read in conjunction with, our audited Consolidated Financial Statements and the accompanying notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements and other disclosures included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K (including the disclosures under “Item 1A. Risk Factors”). Our Consolidated Financial Statements have been prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles and are presented in U.S. dollars. Management Overview We are a biopharmaceutical company that discovers, develops and commercializes innovative therapeutics in areas of unmet medical need. Our mission is to advance the care of patients suffering from life threatening diseases worldwide. Headquartered in Foster City, California, we have operations in North America, Europe and Asia Pacific. We market products in the HIV/AIDS, liver disease, respiratory and cardiovascular/metabolic therapeutic areas. Our product portfolio is comprised of Atripla® (efavirenz 600 mg/emtricitabine 200 mg/tenofovir disoproxil fumarate 300 mg), Truvada® (emtricitabine and tenofovir disoproxil fumarate), Viread® (tenofovir disoproxil fumarate) and Emtriva® (emtricitabine) for the treatment of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection; Hepsera® (adefovir dipivoxil) and Viread for the treatment of chronic hepatitis B; AmBisome® (amphotericin B liposome for injection) for the treatment of severe fungal infections; Letairis® (ambrisentan) for the treatment of pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH); Ranexa® (ranolazine) for the treatment of chronic angina; Vistide® (cidofovir injection) for the treatment of cytomegalovirus infection and Cayston® (aztreonam for inhalation solution) as a treatment to improve respiratory symptoms in cystic fibrosis (CF) patients with Pseudomonas aeruginosa (P. aeruginosa). In addition, we also sell and distribute certain products through our corporate partners under royalty-paying collaborative agreements. For example, F. Hoffmann-La Roche Ltd (together with Hoffmann-La Roche Inc., Roche) markets Tamiflu® (oseltamivir phosphate) for the treatment and prevention of influenza; GlaxoSmithKline Inc. (GSK) markets Hepsera and Viread for the treatment of chronic hepatitis B in certain territories outside of the United States; GSK also markets Volibris® (ambrisentan) outside of the United States for the treatment of PAH; Astellas Pharma US, Inc. markets AmBisome for the treatment of severe fungal infections in the United States and Canada; Astellas US LLC markets Lexiscan® (regadenoson) injection in the United States for use as a pharmacologic stress agent in radionuclide myocardial perfusion imaging; Rapidscan Pharma Solutions, Inc. markets Rapiscan (regadenoson) in certain territories outside of the United States for the inducement of pharmacological stress and/or vasodilation of the coronary vasculature strictly for purposes of diagnosing cardiovascular disease; Menarini International Operations Luxembourg SA markets Ranexa in certain territories outside of the United States for the treatment of chronic angina; and Japan Tobacco Inc. (Japan Tobacco) markets Truvada, Viread and Emtriva in Japan. Business Highlights During 2010, we grew our business significantly and achieved record total revenues of $7.95 billion while strengthening our product portfolio and pipeline programs. Our antiviral franchise, in particular Atripla and Truvada, continued to drive product sales growth both in the United States and within the big five European Union markets, which are comprised of the United Kingdom, France, Germany, Italy and Spain. Our cardiovascular franchise also delivered strong results for the year with the contributions of Letairis and Ranexa to our total revenues. Our newest product, Cayston, in the respiratory area, was well accepted in North America and certain countries of Europe, showing continued revenue growth throughout 2010. 52 Table of Contents During the year, we also made strategic decisions to advance and focus our research and development (R&D) pipeline efforts, including: • In the HIV area, in September 2010, we announced that we had submitted a Marketing Authorization Application to the European Medicines Agency for marketing approval of the single-tablet regimen of Truvada and Tibotec Pharmaceuticals’ (Tibotec) investigational non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor, TMC278 (rilpivirine hydrochloride), for the treatment of HIV-1 infection in adults. In November 2010, we announced that we had submitted a New Drug Application (NDA) to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for marketing approval of the single-tablet regimen of Truvada and Tibotec’s TMC278, for the treatment of HIV-1 infection in adults. In January 2011, we received a “refuse to file” notification from the U.S. FDA. In its communication, the FDA requested additional information with respect to the Chemistry, Manufacturing and Controls section of the NDA submission. In February 2011, we re-filed our new drug application, which included the requested information, and are awaiting the FDA’s response as to whether it is substantially complete to permit a substantive review. • Also in the HIV area, during 2010, we initiated both Phase 3 clinical studies for our investigational fixed-dose, single-tablet “Quad” regimen of elvitegravir, cobicistat (formerly GS 9350) and Truvada. The two Phase 3 studies are evaluating the single-tablet fixed-dose regimen versus a standard of care among HIV-infected treatment-naïve patients. In the second quarter of 2010, we also initiated a Phase 3 study evaluating the efficacy, safety and tolerability of cobicistat, our pharmacoenhancer that is in development as a boosting agent for certain HIV medicines and other antivirals. In September 2010, we released positive 48-week results from two of our ongoing Phase 2 clinical studies in HIV-infected patients. The first were from the study of our fixed-dose, single-tablet “Quad” regimen of elvitegravir, cobicistat and Truvada versus Atripla. The second were from the study of cobicistat-boosted atazanavir plus Truvada compared to ritonavir-boosted atazanavir plus Truvada. • In the liver disease area, our hepatitis C virus (HCV) pipeline now includes seven unique molecules spanning six therapeutic classes with different mechanisms of action. Five of these compounds are currently in clinical trials, and two are slated to enter human clinical studies in early 2011. In October 2010, we announced data from a Phase 2a study showing that our investigational compounds GS 9190 and GS 9256, used in conjunction with current standard of care therapies, produced substantial suppression of HCV within 28 days of treatment. Additionally, in October 2010, we announced new data from the open-label phase of two pivotal Phase 3 clinical trials (Studies 102 and 103) evaluating the four-year efficacy of Viread for the treatment of chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection, which show that Viread maintains antiviral suppression with no development of resistance through four years of treatment. Data also show significant “s” antigen loss, a marker of the resolution of chronic HBV infection, in HBeAg-positive patients. • Also in the liver disease area, in July 2010, John McHutchison, MD, joined Gilead as Senior Vice President, Liver Disease Therapeutics to lead the efforts to advance discovery and development programs in the liver disease area. • In the respiratory area, we announced in October 2010 that our head-to-head Phase 3 clinical trial of Cayston versus tobramycin inhalation solution (TIS) in CF patients with P. aeruginosa achieved its co-primary endpoint of superiority of Cayston to TIS for mean actual change in forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1, a measure of lung function) percent predicted across three treatment cycles (six months). Earlier in the year, in February, we received marketing approval from the FDA for Cayston as a treatment to improve respiratory symptoms in CF patients with P. aeruginosa. • In the cardiovascular and metabolic areas, in December 2010, we announced the termination of ARTEMIS-IPF, our Phase 3 study of ambrisentan in patients with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF). This decision follows an interim analysis of unblinded efficacy and safety data by the study’s Data Monitoring Committee and our review of those data, which did not show evidence of a treatment benefit in the group of patients randomized to receive ambrisentan. 53 Table of Contents During the year, we also expanded our pipeline through strategic acquisitions. We completed the acquisition of Arresto Biosciences, Inc. (Arresto) in January 2011 for $225 million plus potential future payments based on achievement of certain sales levels. Arresto was a privately-held, development-stage biotechnology company based in Palo Alto, California, focused on developing antibodies for the potential treatment of fibrotic diseases and cancer. The company’s lead product is GS 6624 (formerly AB0024), a humanized monoclonal antibody (mAb) targeting the human lysyl oxidase-like-2 (LOXL2) protein. In addition to an ongoing Phase 1 study of GS 6624 in patients with advanced solid tumors, a Phase 1 study is being conducted to evaluate GS 6624 in patients with IPF. We completed the acquisition of CGI Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (CGI) in July 2010 for up to $120 million in cash, the majority as an upfront payment and the remaining based on the achievement of certain clinical development milestones. CGI was a privately-held development stage pharmaceutical company based in Branford, Connecticut, primarily focused on small molecule chemistry and protein kinase biology. The lead preclinical compound from CGI’s library of proprietary small molecule kinase inhibitors targets spleen tyrosine kinase (Syk) and could have unique applications for the treatment of serious inflammatory diseases, including rheumatoid arthritis. Financial Highlights Our operating results for 2010 were led by total product sales of $7.39 billion, an increase of 14% over total product sales of $6.47 billion for 2009. The increase in product sales was driven primarily by our antiviral franchise (Atripla, Truvada, Viread, Hepsera and Emtriva), due mainly to the strong growth in Atripla sales. Atripla contributed $2.93 billion, or 45%, to our 2010 antiviral product sales. Atripla product sales for 2010 increased 23% from 2009 primarily due to sales volume growth in the United States and Europe. Truvada product sales for 2010 comprised $2.65 billion, or 41% of 2010 antiviral product sales. Truvada product sales for 2010 increased 6% from 2009 primarily due to sales volume growth in the United States and Europe. Foreign currency exchange had an unfavorable impact of $93.7 million and $79.8 million on our 2010 revenues and pre-tax earnings, respectively, compared to 2009. Product sales in the United States were driven primarily by our antiviral franchise but also reflected growth in sales of our cardiovascular products. Antiviral product sales in the United States increased 13% in 2010 compared to 2009, resulting from the continued growth of patient and market share in the United States. With respect to our cardiovascular franchise, Ranexa sales in the United States were $234.8 million in 2010, reflecting a continued growth in demand as Ranexa prescriptions have increased by 71% since our acquisition of CV Therapeutics, Inc. (CV Therapeutics) in April 2009. Ranexa sales were $123.1 million in 2009 for the period subsequent to our acquisition of CV Therapeutics. Furthermore, Letairis sales contributed $240.3 million to 2010 product sales in the United States, reflecting a 31% increase from 2009. Our newest product, Cayston, also contributed $47.5 million during its first year of sales in 2010, the majority of which was in the United States. Product sales in Europe were driven by antiviral product sales, which increased 9% in 2010 compared to 2009, due to continued strong growth in demand. While we saw demand growth for our products in Europe, the effect was partially offset by recent mandatory price reductions in certain European countries and foreign currency exchange impact from a strengthening U.S. dollar relative to European currencies. Royalty revenues recognized from our collaborations with corporate partners were $546.0 million for 2010, an increase of $54.2 million or 11% from royalty revenues of $491.8 million for 2009. Other royalty revenues, which include royalties from GSK for Hepsera, royalties from Astellas for Lexiscan and royalties from Japan Tobacco for Truvada, contributed to the increase in total royalty revenues, partially offset by Tamiflu royalties from Roche which decreased from $392.7 million in 2009 to $386.5 million in 2010. Our R&D and selling, general and administrative (SG&A) expenses increased by $230.7 million, or 12% for 2010 compared to 2009. The increase was due primarily to impairment charges related to in-process R&D 54 Table of Contents (IPR&D) assets acquired from CV Therapeutics, higher headcount and expenses to support our expanding commercial activities and clinical studies expenses related to increased HIV research activities, partially offset by lower R&D expense reimbursement related to our collaboration with Tibotec. We approved and communicated a plan during the second quarter of 2010 to close our research operations in Durham, North Carolina and consolidate our liver disease research activities in Foster City, California. We believe this plan will allow our employees to collaborate more effectively and further advance our programs in the liver disease area. During the year, we incurred a total of $25.0 million of restructuring expenses related to employee severance and facilities-related expenses under this plan. In December 2010, we closed our operations in Durham. We do not expect to incur any additional significant costs in connection with this plan. Financing Activity Cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities increased by $1.41 billion during 2010, driven primarily by our operating cash flows of $2.83 billion and proceeds of $2.46 billion from the issuance of convertible senior notes, net of issuance costs, partially offset by repurchases of our common stock under our stock repurchase programs. Under our current three-year, $5.00 billion stock repurchase program authorized in May 2010, we repurchased $3.02 billion of our common stock through December 31, 2010. In May 2010, we had completed the $1.00 billion stock repurchase program previously authorized in January 2010. For the year, we utilized a total of $4.02 billion of cash to repurchase and retire 109.9 million shares of our common stock at an average purchase price of $36.57 per share. Our Board authorized an additional three-year, $5.00 billion stock repurchase program in January 2011 for future repurchases of our outstanding shares of common stock which will commence upon the completion of our existing program authorized in May 2010. We intend to use the additional authorization to repurchase our shares from time to time to offset the dilution created by shares issued under employee stock plans and to repurchase shares opportunistically. We issued $2.50 billion of convertible senior notes in July 2010 in a private placement and purchased convertible note hedges as well as sold warrants for a net cost of $207.2 million. The cost of the convertible note hedges will be tax deductible over the life of the notes. The convertible note hedges and warrants are intended to reduce the potential economic dilution upon future conversions of the notes by effectively increasing our conversion prices for the notes. Our interest expense for 2010 increased by $39.3 million compared to 2009, due primarily to increased interest expense related to the notes. We have used and will continue to use the net proceeds from the issuance of the convertible notes to repurchase shares of our common stock and repay existing indebtedness. Healthcare Reform In March 2010, healthcare reform legislation was adopted in the United States. As a result, we are required to further rebate or discount products reimbursed or paid for by various public payers, including Medicaid and other entities eligible to purchase discounted products through the 340B Drug Pricing Program under the Public Health Service Act, such as AIDS Drug Assistance Programs (ADAPs). The discounts, rebates and fees in the legislation that impacted us include: • effective January 1, 2010, our minimum base rebate amount owed to Medicaid on products reimbursed by Medicaid was increased by 8%, and the discounts or rebates we owe to ADAPs and other Public Health Service entities which reimburse or purchase our products were also increased by 8%; • effective March 23, 2010, we are required to extend rebates to patients receiving our products through Medicaid managed care organizations; • effective January 1, 2011, we are required to provide a 50% discount on products sold to patients while they are in the Medicare Part D “donut hole;” and 55 Table of Contents • effective 2011, we, along with other pharmaceutical manufacturers of branded drug products, are required to pay a portion of a new industry fee (also known as the pharmaceutical excise tax), calculated based on select government sales during the 2010 calendar year as a percentage of total industry government sales. Starting in 2014, as the number of people with access to healthcare coverage is expected to increase, we could experience a positive impact on the sales of our products. Further, the expansion of healthcare coverage may decrease the reliance of patients on state ADAPs that currently rely on the availability of federal and state funding. The full impact of healthcare reform for 2010 was a reduction of approximately $200 million in U.S. net product sales. The majority of this impact began in the third quarter and continued throughout the fourth quarter of 2010 since some of the new discount and rebate requirements took two quarters to fully take effect. For 2011, excluding the impact of the new pharmaceutical excise tax, we estimate that the impact of healthcare reform on product sales will be approximately 5–6% of our U.S. net product sales. Many of the specific determinations necessary to implement the healthcare reform legislation have yet to be decided and communicated by the federal government. For example, we do not know how many or how quickly patients receiving our product under the Medicare Part D program will reach the “donut hole” or how details of the pharmaceutical excise tax will be calculated. Based on the information that we have to date, we estimate the 2011 impact of the pharmaceutical excise tax to be between $30–$50 million, which will be classified as SG&A expense. The excise tax is not tax deductible. In calculating the anticipated financial impacts of healthcare reform described above, we made several estimates and assumptions with respect to our expected payer mix and how the reforms will be implemented. 2011 Outlook Our operating objectives for 2011 include increasing the market share of our commercial products, continuing to strengthen our pipeline with internally developed and/or externally in-licensed or purchased opportunities and strengthening our key alliances. Additionally, we remain committed to returning value to our shareholders as we continue to repurchase our shares in a disciplined manner throughout the year. From an R&D standpoint, we will continue to execute on our pipeline development with a particular focus on innovative HIV single-tablet regimens for patients and progression of HCV molecules into the clinic. From a commercial standpoint, we have a number of internal and external initiatives intended to promote the continued growth of our franchises. In the HIV area, we expect to see continued positive impact from the revised U.S. Department of Health and Human Services treatment guidelines that recommend earlier treatment for patients with HIV. The extension of the Ryan White Treatment Act should provide stable funding for ADAPs in the United States through 2013. Assuming the timely resolution of the issues with the “refuse to file” notification from the FDA, we expect to launch a single-tablet regimen of Truvada and Tibotec’s TMC278 in the second half of 2011 which we expect to contribute incremental revenue to our HIV franchise. In February 2011, we re-filed our new drug application, which included the requested information, and are awaiting the FDA’s response as to whether it is substantially complete to permit a substantive review. In the hepatitis B virus (HBV) area, we will continue to support educational and promotional activities focused on U.S. Asian communities, highlighting the need to screen, diagnose and link patients to care. As part of those efforts, in 2010, we expanded our hepatitis B field team in the United States. In the cardiovascular area, we will continue in our efforts to raise awareness of Gilead in the PAH and cardiology communities and believe this will help grow revenues of Letairis and Ranexa in 2011. In cystic fibrosis, we intend to expand our field team to further grow our market share for Cayston. We are mindful that conditions in our current macroeconomic environment could affect our ability to achieve our goals. Some of the factors that could affect our business include: any future changes to healthcare 56 Table of Contents reform in the United States, a continuation or worsening of global economic conditions, patent expirations of competitive products and the launch of generic competitors, continued government pricing pressures internationally and the potential volatility in foreign currency exchange rates. We will continue to monitor these conditions and will adjust our business processes, as appropriate, to mitigate these risks to our business. The successes we experienced in 2010 have helped us maintain and build a financially sound business model that we believe will allow us to continue to further expand our commercial, collaborative and R&D activities and to maintain quality and compliance. As we continue to grow our business, we remain focused on profitable revenue growth and prudent expense management that we believe will enable solid execution of our operating objectives for 2011. Critical Accounting Policies, Estimates and Judgments The discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based on our Consolidated Financial Statements, which have been prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses and related disclosures. On an ongoing basis, we evaluate our estimates, including those related to revenue recognition, intangible assets, allowance for doubtful accounts, prepaid royalties, clinical trial accruals, our tax provision and stock-based compensation. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other market specific and other relevant assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ significantly from these estimates. We believe the following critical accounting policies reflect the more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our Consolidated Financial Statements. Revenue Recognition Product Sales We recognize revenues from product sales when there is persuasive evidence that an arrangement exists, delivery to the customer has occurred, the price is fixed or determinable and collectability is reasonably assured. We record estimated reductions to revenues for government rebates such as Medicaid reimbursements, customer incentives such as cash discounts for prompt payment, distributor fees and expected returns of expired products. These estimates are deducted from gross product sales at the time such revenues are recognized. Of these reductions from gross product sales, government rebates significantly impact our reported net product sales and are based upon certain estimates that require complex and significant judgment by management. Government Rebates We estimate reductions to our revenues for government-managed Medicaid programs as well as to certain other qualifying federal, state and foreign government programs for the reimbursement of portions of the retail price of prescriptions filled that are covered by these programs. These reductions are settled either by the company being invoiced directly or through charge-backs from our wholesalers. Government rebates that are invoiced directly to us are recorded in accrued government rebates on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. For qualified programs that can purchase our products through wholesalers at a lower contractual government price, the wholesalers charge back to us the difference between their acquisition cost and the lower contractual government price, which we record as allowances against accounts receivable. Although we may pay rebates in countries outside of the United States, to date, payments made to foreign governments have not represented a significant portion of our total government rebates. For government programs in the United States, we estimate these sales allowances based on contractual terms, historical utilization rates, new information regarding changes in these programs’ regulations and guidelines that would impact the amount of the actual rebates, our 57 Table of Contents expectations regarding future utilization rates for these programs and channel inventory data obtained from our major U.S. wholesalers in accordance with our inventory management agreements. During 2010, 2009, and 2008, U.S government rebates of $1.38 billion, $885.5 million and $625.0 million, respectively, representing 15%, 12% and 10% of total gross product sales, respectively, were deducted from gross product sales. We believe that the methodology that we use to estimate our sales allowances for government price reductions is reasonable and appropriate given the current facts and circumstances. However, actual results may differ. Based on the current information available to us, actual government rebates claimed for these periods have varied by less than 2% from our estimates recorded in those periods. As of December 31, 2010 and 2009, we had accrued U.S. government rebates of $318.3 million and $242.9 million, respectively, in accrued government rebates and had an allowance for doubtful accounts of $53.5 million and $41.8 million, respectively, recorded against accounts receivable. The following table summarizes the aggregate activity in our U.S. government rebates allowance and accrued liabilities accounts: Balance atBeginningof Year Chargedto Expense DeductedfromAccruals Balanceat End ofYear Year ended December 31, 2010: Government rebates allowances and accrued liabilities Activity related to 2010 sales $ — $ 1,383,855 $ 1,012,874 $ 370,981 Activity related to sales prior to 2010 284,642 (8,573 ) 275,267 802 Total $ 284,642 $ 1,375,282 $ 1,288,141 $ 371,783 Year ended December 31, 2009: Government rebates allowances and accrued liabilities Activity related to 2009 sales $ — $ 878,593 $ 594,579 $ 284,014 Activity related to sales prior to 2009 206,273 6,902 212,547 628 Total $ 206,273 $ 885,495 $ 807,126 $ 284,642 Intangible Assets In conjunction with business combinations that we have completed, we have recorded intangible assets primarily related to marketed products, IPR&D projects and goodwill as part of our recognition and measurement of assets acquired and liabilities assumed in a business combination. Identifiable intangible assets, such as those related to marketed products or IPR&D projects, are measured at their respective fair values as of the acquisition date. We believe the fair values assigned to our acquired intangible assets are based on reasonable estimates and assumptions given the available facts and circumstances as of the acquisition dates. Discounted cash flow models are used in valuing these intangible assets, and these models require the use of significant estimates and assumptions including but not limited to: • estimates of revenues and operating profits related to the products or product candidates; • the probability of success for unapproved product candidates considering their stages of development; • the time and resources needed to complete the development and approval of product candidates; • the life of the potential commercialized products and associated risks, including the inherent difficulties and uncertainties in developing a product candidate such as obtaining FDA and other regulatory approvals; and • risks related to the viability of and potential alternative treatments in any future target markets. Goodwill represents the excess of the consideration transferred over the estimated fair values of assets acquired and liabilities assumed in a business combination. Goodwill and intangible assets determined to have indefinite useful lives are not amortized, but are required to be tested for impairment at least annually. We test 58 Table of Contents goodwill and other indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment on an annual basis and in between annual tests if we become aware of any events occurring or changes in circumstances that would indicate a reduction in the fair values of the assets below their carrying amounts. As of December 31, 2010, we had $562.2 million of indefinite-lived intangible assets consisting of $532.7 million of goodwill resulting from various business combinations and $29.5 million of intangible assets related to the IPR&D projects that we acquired from CGI and CV Therapeutics. Intangible assets with finite useful lives are amortized over their estimated useful lives and are reviewed for impairment when facts or circumstances suggest that the carrying value of these assets may not be recoverable. We are amortizing the intangible asset related to the Ranexa product, which we acquired from CV Therapeutics, over its estimated useful life using an amortization rate derived from our forecasted future product sales for Ranexa. Our product sales forecasts are prepared annually and determined using our best estimates of future activity upon considering such factors as historical and expected future patient usage or uptake of our products, the introduction of complimentary or combination therapies or products and future product launch plans. If a previously unanticipated and significant change occurs to our sales forecasts, we will prospectively update the rate used to amortize our intangible asset related to Ranexa which may increase future cost of goods sold, as that is where we record the amortization expense. We are amortizing the intangible asset related to the Lexiscan product, which we also acquired from CV Therapeutics, over its estimated useful life to cost of goods sold on a straight-line basis. Given that current Lexiscan revenues consist of royalties received from a collaboration partner and our lack of ongoing access and visibility into that partner’s future sales forecasts, we cannot make a reasonable estimate of the amortization rate using a forecasted product sales approach. As of December 31, 2010, we had $863.4 million of net unamortized finite-lived intangible assets consisting primarily of intangible assets related to the marketed products that we acquired from CV Therapeutics. Our judgment regarding the existence of impairment indicators is based on our historical and projected future operating results, our extent or manner of use of the acquired assets, legal and regulatory factors and events, our overall business strategy and market and economic trends. If events occur in the future that cause us to conclude that impairment indicators exist and that certain intangible assets are impaired, our financial condition and results of operations may be adversely impacted. During the fourth quarter of 2010, we recorded $136.0 million of impairment charges related to certain IPR&D assets acquired from CV Therapeutics which we had no future plans to develop and which were deemed to have no future use to us or other market participants. These charges related to the GS 9667, Adentri and tecadenoson programs and were recorded in R&D expense. The majority of the impairment charge related to our GS 9667 program, a product candidate that was in Phase 1 clinical studies for the treatment of diabetes and hypertriglyceridemia, which was terminated in the fourth quarter of 2010 due to unfavorable results from pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics tests that demonstrated limited effectiveness of the compound in patients. Given these results, we do not believe it has alternative future uses for us or other market participants. Allowance for Doubtful Accounts We also maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments. This allowance is based on our analysis of several factors including, but not limited to, contractual payment terms, historical payment patterns of our customers and individual customer circumstances, an analysis of days sales outstanding by geographic region and a review of the local economic environment and its potential impact on government funding and reimbursement practices. If the financial condition of our customers or the economic environment in which they operate were to deteriorate, resulting in an inability to make payments, additional allowances may be required. Our allowance for doubtful accounts balance as a percentage of total accounts receivable did not materially change from December 31, 2009 to December 31, 2010. We believe that the allowance for doubtful accounts is adequate to cover anticipated losses under current conditions; however, significant deterioration in any of the above factors could materially change these expectations and may result in an increase to our allowance for doubtful accounts. 59 Table of Contents Prepaid Royalties We capitalize royalties that we have prepaid at cost, specifically those related to the emtricitabine royalties we paid to Emory University (Emory) for the HIV indication, based on the present value of the future royalty obligation that we would expect to pay to Emory assuming certain expected future levels of our product sales incorporating emtricitabine. The present value of our future royalty obligation was derived using our weighted-average cost of capital. We review periodically the expected future sales levels of our products and any indicators that might require a write-down in the net recoverable value of our asset or a change in the estimated life of the prepaid royalty. Some potential indicators of impairment include the launch of a significant product by a competitor, significant deviations in recognized product sales compared to forecast and product safety issues and recalls. We amortize our prepaid royalties based on an effective royalty rate that we derive from forecasted future HIV product sales incorporating emtricitabine. Our product sales forecasts are prepared annually and determined using our best estimates of future activity upon considering such factors as historical and expected future patient usage or uptake of our products, the introduction of complimentary or combination therapies or products and future product launch plans. If a previously unanticipated and significant change occurs to our sales forecasts, including the introduction of a competing product by us or one of our competitors in the same HIV market as emtricitabine, we will prospectively update the royalty rate used to amortize our prepaid royalties which may increase future cost of goods sold, as that is where we record the amortization expense. As of December 31, 2010 and 2009, we had a prepaid royalty asset relating to the emtricitabine royalties we paid to Emory of $219.5 million and $245.0 million, respectively. Amortization expense relating to this prepaid royalty asset was $25.5 million, $29.9 million and $31.8 million for the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively. Clinical Trial Accruals We record accruals for estimated clinical study costs. Most of our clinical studies are performed by third-party contract research organizations (CROs). These costs are a significant component of R&D expenses. During 2010, 2009 and 2008, we incurred CRO costs of $99.0 million, $109.9 million and $111.8 million, respectively. We accrue costs for clinical studies performed by CROs over the service periods specified in the contracts and adjust our estimates, if required, based upon our ongoing review of the level of effort and costs actually incurred by the CROs. We validate our accruals quarterly with our vendors and perform detailed reviews of the activities related to our significant contracts. Based upon the results of these validation processes, we assess the appropriateness of our accruals and make any adjustments we deem necessary to ensure that our expenses reflect the actual effort incurred by the CROs. Generally, a significant portion of the total clinical trial costs is associated with start up activities for the trial and patient enrollment. We extensively outsource our clinical trial activities and usually perform only a small portion of the start-up activities in-house. As a result, CROs typically perform most of the total start-up activities for our trials, including document preparation, site identification, screening and preparation, pre-study visits, training and program management. Start-up costs usually occur within a few months after the contract has been executed and are milestone or event driven in nature. The remaining clinical activities and related costs, such as patient monitoring and administration, generally occur ratably throughout the life of the individual contract or study. Most contracts are negotiated as fixed per unit prices and can vary in length between three months for a single dose Phase 1 clinical study and up to two years or more for a more complex Phase 3 clinical study. The average length of contracts in 2010, 2009 and 2008 has been at the upper end of this range in order to provide long-term safety and efficacy data to support the commercial launches of Atripla, Truvada, Viread, Hepsera, Emtriva, Letairis and Ranexa. All of our material CRO contracts are terminable by us upon written notice and we are generally only liable for actual effort expended by the CRO and certain non-cancelable expenses incurred at any point of termination. Amounts paid in advance relating to uncompleted services will be refunded to us if a contract is terminated. Some contracts may include additional termination payments that become due and payable if we terminate the contract. Such 60 Table of Contents additional termination payments are only recorded if it becomes probable that a contract will be terminated. Through December 31, 2010, differences between actual and estimated activity levels for any particular study have not been material. However, if management does not receive complete and accurate information from our vendors or underestimates activity levels associated with a study at a given point in time, we may have to record additional and potentially significant R&D expenses in future periods. Tax Provision We estimate our income tax provision, including deferred tax assets and liabilities, based on significant management judgment. We evaluate the realization of all or a portion of our deferred tax assets on a quarterly basis. We record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets to the amounts that are more likely than not to be realized. We consider future taxable income, ongoing tax planning strategies and our historical financial performance in assessing the need for a valuation allowance. If we expect to realize deferred tax assets for which we have previously recorded a valuation allowance, we will reduce the valuation allowance in the period in which such determination is first made. Our future effective income tax rate may be affected by such factors as changes in tax laws, regulations or rates, changing interpretation of existing laws or regulations, our portion of the non-tax deductible pharmaceutical excise tax that we will be required to pay starting in 2011 as a result of the enactment of U.S. healthcare reform legislation, the impact of accounting for stock-based compensation, changes in our international organization and changes in overall levels of income before tax. At December 31, 2010 and 2009, the total gross unrecognized tax benefits were $126.5 million and $106.5 million, respectively. Of the total unrecognized tax benefits, $106.5 million and $72.6 million at December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively, if recognized, would reduce our effective tax rate in the period of recognition. As of December 31, 2010, we believe it is reasonably possible that our unrecognized tax benefits will decrease by approximately $6.0 million in the next 12 months as we expect to have clarification from the tax authorities around certain of our uncertain tax positions. With respect to the remaining unrecognized tax benefits, we are currently unable to make a reasonable estimate as to the period of cash settlement, if any, with the respective tax authorities. We file federal, state and foreign income tax returns in many jurisdictions in the United States and abroad. For federal income tax purposes, the statute of limitations is open for 2003 and onward. For certain acquired entities, the statute of limitations is open for all years from inception due to our utilization of their net operating losses and credits carried over from prior years. For California income tax purposes, the statute of limitations remains open for 2002 and onwards. Our income tax returns are audited by federal, state and foreign tax authorities. We are currently under examination by the Internal Revenue Service for the 2005, 2006 and 2007 tax years and by various state and foreign jurisdictions. There are differing interpretations of tax laws and regulations, and as a result, significant disputes may arise with these tax authorities involving issues of the timing and amount of deductions and allocations of income among various tax jurisdictions. We periodically evaluate our exposures associated with our tax filing positions. We record liabilities related to uncertain tax positions in accordance with the guidance that clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in an enterprise’s financial statements by prescribing a minimum recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. We do not believe any such uncertain 61 Table of Contents tax positions currently pending will have a material adverse effect on our Consolidated Financial Statements, although an adverse resolution of one or more of these uncertain tax positions in any period could have a material impact on the results of operations for that period. Stock-based Compensation We measure all share-based payments to employees and directors, including grants of stock options, based on their relative fair values. Fair values of awards granted under our stock option plans and Employee Stock Purchase Plan were estimated at grant or purchase dates using a Black-Scholes option valuation model. The Black-Scholes option valuation model was developed for use in estimating the fair value of traded options, which have no vesting restrictions and are fully transferable. In addition, option valuation models require the input of highly subjective assumptions, including expected stock price volatility and expected award life. Stock-based compensation is recognized as expense over the requisite service periods in our Consolidated Statements of Income using a graded vesting expense attribution approach for unvested stock options granted prior to January 1, 2006, and using the straight-line expense attribution approach for stock options granted after our adoption of new guidance for share-based payments to employees and directors on January 1, 2006. As stock-based compensation expenses, related to stock options recognized on adoption of the new guidance, is based on awards ultimately expected to vest, gross expense has been reduced for estimated forfeitures. The guidance requires forfeitures to be estimated at the time of grant and revised, if necessary, in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates. We estimated forfeitures based on our historical experience. Prior to the adoption of this guidance, pro forma information that was required to be disclosed included forfeitures as they occurred. As a result of the guidance adopted on January 1, 2006, we only recognize a tax benefit from stock-based compensation in additional paid-in capital (APIC) if an incremental tax benefit is realized after all other tax attributes currently available to us have been utilized. In addition, we have elected to account for the indirect benefits of stock-based compensation on the research tax credit and the extraterritorial income deduction through our Consolidated Statements of Income rather than through APIC. During the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008, we recognized stock-based compensation expenses of $200.0 million, $185.8 million and $153.4 million, respectively, in operating expenses, and we capitalized $10.9 million, $11.4 million and $9.9 million, respectively, to inventory. As of December 31, 2010, we had unrecognized stock-based compensation expenses of $260.8 million related to unvested stock options, which we expect to expense over an estimated weighted-average period of 2.7 years. Our management has discussed the development, selection and disclosure of these critical accounting policies with the Audit Committee of our Board, and the Audit Committee has reviewed the disclosure presented above relating to these critical accounting policies. Results of Operations Total Revenues We had total revenues of $7.95 billion in 2010, $7.01 billion in 2009 and $5.34 billion in 2008. Included in total revenues were product sales, royalty revenues and contract and other revenues. A significant percentage of our product sales continued to be denominated in foreign currencies and we face exposure to adverse movements in foreign currency exchange rates. We used foreign currency exchange forward and option contracts to hedge a percentage of our forecasted international sales, primarily those denominated in Euro. Foreign currency exchange had an unfavorable impact of $93.7 million on our 2010 revenues compared to 2009. 62 Table of Contents Product Sales The following table summarizes the period over period changes in our product sales (in thousands): 2010 Change 2009 Change 2008 Antiviral products: Atripla $ 2,926,579 23% $ 2,382,113 51% $ 1,572,455 Truvada 2,649,908 6% 2,489,682 18% 2,106,687 Viread 732,240 10% 667,510 7% 621,187 Hepsera 200,592 (26 )% 271,595 (20 )% 341,023 Emtriva 27,679 (1 )% 27,974 (10 )% 31,080 Total antiviral products 6,536,998 12% 5,838,874 25% 4,672,432 AmBisome 305,856 2% 298,597 3% 289,651 Letairis 240,279 31% 183,949 63% 112,855 Ranexa 239,832 83% 131,062 — — Other 66,956 298% 16,829 71% 9,858 Total product sales $ 7,389,921 14% $ 6,469,311 27% $ 5,084,796 Total product sales increased by 14% in 2010 compared to 2009 and 27% in 2009 compared to 2008, due primarily to an overall increase in our antiviral product sales driven by the strong growth of Atripla sales and the continued growth of Truvada sales. The growth of our cardiovascular products, Letairis and Ranexa, also contributed to the overall increase in product sales in those periods. Antiviral Products Antiviral product sales increased by 12% in 2010 compared to 2009 and 25% in 2009 compared to 2008. • Atripla Atripla sales increased by 23% in 2010 compared to 2009, driven primarily by sales volume growth in the United States and Europe. Atripla sales increased by 51% in 2009 compared to 2008, driven primarily by sales volume growth in the United States and Europe. The European growth benefited from the launch of Atripla in France in the second quarter of 2009. Atripla sales include the efavirenz component which has a gross margin of zero. The efavirenz portion of our Atripla sales was approximately $1.07 billion, $880.7 million and $576.0 million in 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively. Atripla sales accounted for 45%, 41% and 34% of our total antiviral product sales for 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively. • Truvada Truvada sales increased by 6% in 2010 compared to 2009, driven primarily by sales volume growth in the United States and Europe. Truvada sales increased by 18% in 2009 compared to 2008, driven primarily by sales volume growth in the United States and Europe, partially offset by an unfavorable foreign currency exchange impact. Truvada sales accounted for 41%, 43% and 45% of our total antiviral product sales for 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively. • Other Antiviral Products Other antiviral product sales, which include product sales of Viread, Hepsera and Emtriva, decreased by 1% for 2010 compared to 2009 and 3% for 2009 compared to 2008, due primarily to sales volume decreases in Hepsera, partially offset by sales volume increases in Viread. AmBisome Sales of AmBisome increased by 2% in 2010 compared to 2009 and 3% in 2009 compared to 2008, driven primarily by sales volume growth in certain markets outside of the United States, partially offset by an 63 Table of Contents unfavorable foreign currency exchange impact. AmBisome product sales in the United States and Canada relate solely to our sales of AmBisome to Astellas Pharma US, Inc. which are recorded at our manufacturing cost. Letairis Sales of Letairis increased by 31% for 2010 compared to 2009 and 63% in 2009 compared to 2008, driven primarily by sales volume growth in the United States. Ranexa Sales of Ranexa increased by 83% for 2010 compared to 2009, driven primarily by sales volume growth in the United States. Ranexa sales were $239.8 million for 2010 and $131.1 million for 2009. Ranexa sales began on April 15, 2009, the date Gilead acquired CV Therapeutics. We expect total product sales to continue to grow in 2011 as we continue to expand our sales and marketing efforts to support continued opportunities for market expansion. Royalty Revenues The following table summarizes the period over period changes in our royalty revenues (in thousands): 2010 Change 2009 Change 2008 Royalty revenues $ 545,970 11% $ 491,818 125% $ 218,180 Our most significant source of royalty revenues for 2010, 2009 and 2008 was from sales of Tamiflu by Roche. We recognize royalties on Tamiflu sales by Roche in the quarter following the quarter in which Tamiflu is sold. Royalty revenues for 2010 were $546.0 million, an increase of 11% compared to 2009. Other royalty revenues, which include royalties from GSK for Hepsera, royalties from Astellas US LLC for Lexiscan and royalties from Japan Tobacco for Truvada contributed to the increase in total royalty revenues. Tamiflu royalties from Roche contributed $386.5 million to total royalty revenues in 2010 compared to $392.7 million in 2009 as pandemic planning initiatives worldwide began to decline throughout 2010. Royalty revenues for 2009 were $491.8 million, an increase of 125% compared to 2008, driven primarily by the recognition of Tamiflu royalties from Roche of $392.7 million in 2009 compared to Tamiflu royalties from Roche of $155.5 million in 2008. The higher Tamiflu royalties for 2009 were due to increased Tamiflu sales by Roche related primarily to pandemic planning initiatives worldwide. Cost of Goods Sold and Product Gross Margin The following table summarizes the period over period changes in our product sales (in thousands), cost of goods sold (in thousands) and product gross margin: 2010 Change 2009 Change 2008 Total product sales $ 7,389,921 14% $ 6,469,311 27% $ 5,084,796 Cost of goods sold $ 1,869,876 17% $ 1,595,558 42% $ 1,127,246 Product gross margin 75% 75% 78% Our product gross margin for 2010 was 75%, consistent with our product gross margin for 2009. Our product gross margin for 2009 decreased to 75% from 78% for 2008, due primarily to the higher proportion of Atripla sales, which has a gross margin of zero for the efavirenz component, as well as the amortization associated with the intangible assets acquired in our acquisition of CV Therapeutics. 64 Table of Contents We expect our product gross margin in 2011 to be lower compared to 2010, due primarily to a higher proportion of expected Atripla sales. Restructuring Expenses During the second quarter of 2010, we approved and communicated a plan to close our research operations in Durham, North Carolina and consolidate our liver disease research activities in Foster City, California. We believe this plan will allow our employees to collaborate more effectively and further advance our programs in the liver disease area. During the year, we recorded a total of $14.6 million and $10.4 million in SG&A expenses and R&D expenses, respectively, related to employee severance and facilities-related expenses under this plan. In December 2010, we closed our operations in Durham. We do not expect to incur any additional significant costs in connection with this plan. During the second quarter of 2009, we approved a plan to realize certain synergies as a result of the CV Therapeutics acquisition by re-aligning our cardiovascular operations and eliminating redundancies. In 2010, we recorded $10.6 million and $3.4 million of restructuring expenses in SG&A and R&D expenses, respectively, related to employee severance, relocation, lease termination costs and other facilities-related expenses. Total costs incurred under this plan were $36.8 million and $29.1 million in SG&A and R&D expenses, respectively. We do not expect to incur any additional costs in connection with this plan. Research and Development Expenses The following table summarizes the period over period changes in our R&D expenses (in thousands): 2010 Change 2009 Change 2008 Research and development $ 1,072,930 14% $ 939,918 30% $ 721,768 R&D expenses consist primarily of personnel costs, including salaries, benefits and stock-based compensation, clinical studies performed by contract research organizations, materials and supplies, licenses and fees, milestone payments under collaboration arrangements and overhead allocations consisting of various support and facilities-related costs. R&D expenses for 2010 increased by $133.0 million, or 14%, compared to 2009, due primarily to impairment charges of $136.0 million that we recorded related to IPR&D assets acquired from CV Therapeutics, $23.5 million of clinical studies expenses related to increased HIV research activities and $16.1 million of compensation and benefits expenses. The majority of the impairment charge related to our GS 9667 program, a product candidate that was in Phase 1 clinical studies for the treatment of diabetes and hypertriglyceridemia, which was terminated in the fourth quarter of 2010 due to unfavorable results from pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics tests that demonstrated limited effectiveness of the compound in patients. Given these results, we do not believe it has alternative future uses for us or other market participants. The increase in R&D expenses was partially offset by $37.0 million due to the timing of certain clinical studies and $30.3 million of lower R&D expense reimbursement related to our collaboration with Tibotec. R&D expenses in 2009 increased by $218.2 million, or 30%, compared to 2008, due primarily to increased compensation and benefits expenses of $88.8 million driven by higher headcount related to the growth of our business, the R&D expense reimbursement related to our collaboration with Tibotec of $52.4 million and increased clinical study expenses of $23.9 million. The increase in compensation and benefits expenses was also driven by severance and termination benefits associated with our restructuring activities related to our acquisition of CV Therapeutics. In 2011, we expect R&D expenses to increase over 2010 levels due to increased spending on our internal and collaborative R&D efforts as we anticipate that some of our product candidates will progress into more advanced clinical studies as well as adding more clinical development programs to our pipeline. 65 Table of Contents Selling, General and Administrative Expenses The following table summarizes the period over period changes in our SG&A expenses (in thousands): 2010 Change 2009 Change 2008 Selling, general and administrative $ 1,044,392 10% $ 946,686 19% $ 797,344 SG&A expenses in 2010 increased by $97.7 million or 10%, compared to 2009, due primarily to increased compensation and benefits expenses of $36.3 million as a result of higher headcount to support our expanding commercial activities, increased contract and professional services expenses of $27.3 million driven primarily by our expanding sales and marketing activities and $18.1 million related to facilities and equipment expenses. SG&A expenses in 2009 increased by $149.3 million or 19%, compared to 2008, due primarily to increased compensation and benefits expenses of $75.4 million driven by higher headcount related to the growth of our business, increased contract and professional services expenses of $46.6 million driven primarily by our expanding sales and marketing activities and $5.8 million related to certain contract termination costs. The increase in compensation and benefits expenses was also driven by severance and termination benefits associated with our restructuring activities related to our acquisition of CV Therapeutics. In 2011, we expect SG&A expenses to increase over 2010 levels due to increased investment to support the continued growth in all of our franchises. We believe we have the appropriate infrastructure to support the growth of our business in 2011. Interest and Other Income, Net We recorded interest and other income, net, of $60.3 million, $42.4 million and $59.4 million in 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively. The increase in interest and other income, net, in 2010 compared to 2009 was due primarily to decreased costs related to our hedging activities. The decrease in interest and other income, net, in 2009 compared to 2008 was due primarily to decreased interest income of $40.6 million driven by a reduction in the average yield of our investment portfolio as a result of lower interest rates, partially offset by an increase in net foreign currency exchange gains of $15.7 million. Interest Expense Our interest expense was $109.0 million, $69.7 million and $65.2 million in 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively. The increase in interest expense in 2010 compared to 2009 was due primarily to the issuance of our convertible senior notes for $2.46 billion, net of issuance costs, in July 2010. The increase in interest expense in 2009 compared to 2008 was due primarily to the effect of accreting the debt discount on our convertible notes due in 2011 and 2013 as additional interest expense over the expected life of the debt, as a result of adopting certain accounting guidance. Provision for Income Taxes Our provision for income taxes was $1.02 billion, $876.4 million and $702.4 million in 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively. The 2010 effective tax rate of 26.2% differed from the U.S. federal statutory rate of 35% due primarily to tax credits and certain operating earnings from non-U.S. subsidiaries that are considered indefinitely invested outside the United States, partially offset by state taxes. We do not provide for U.S. income taxes on undistributed earnings of our foreign operations that are intended to be permanently reinvested. The 2009 effective tax rate of 25.0% differed from the U.S. federal statutory rate of 35% due primarily to tax credits, the resolution of certain tax positions with tax authorities and certain operating earnings from non-U.S. subsidiaries that are considered indefinitely invested outside the United States, partially offset by state taxes and the revaluation of certain state tax assets related to the integration of CV Therapeutics. 66 Table of Contents The 2008 effective tax rate of 26.3% differs from the U.S. federal statutory rate of 35% due primarily to tax credits, the resolution of certain tax positions with tax authorities and certain operating earnings from non-U.S. subsidiaries that are considered indefinitely invested outside the United States, partially offset by state taxes. Liquidity and Capital Resources The following table summarizes our cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities, our working capital and our cash flow activities as of the end of, and for each of, the periods presented (in thousands): 2010 2009 2008 As of December 31: Cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities $ 5,318,071 $ 3,904,846 $ 3,239,639 Working capital $ 3,243,132 $ 2,940,927 $ 3,057,416 Year Ended December 31: Cash provided by (used in): Operating activities $ 2,833,913 $ 3,080,054 $ 2,143,384 Investing activities $ (1,937,751 ) $ (2,215,900 ) $ (178,819 ) Financing activities $ (1,338,710 ) $ (1,051,438 ) $ (1,474,569 ) Cash, Cash Equivalents and Marketable Securities Cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities totaled $5.32 billion at December 31, 2010, an increase of $1.41 billion or 36% from December 31, 2009. This increase was primarily attributable to net cash provided by operations of $2.83 billion and proceeds of $2.46 billion from the issuance of convertible senior notes, net of issuance costs, partially offset by $4.02 billion used to repurchase our common stock under our stock repurchase programs. Cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities totaled $3.90 billion at December 31, 2009, an increase of $665.2 million or 21% from December 31, 2008. This increase was primarily attributable to net cash provided by operations of $3.08 billion and proceeds from issuances of common stock under our employee stock plans of $222.7 million, partially offset by the following: • cash used to acquire CV Therapeutics of $1.13 billion, net of cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities acquired from CV Therapeutics of $245.4 million; • $998.5 million used to repurchase our common stock under our stock repurchase program; and • $305.5 million used to extinguish the convertible senior notes we assumed in our acquisition of CV Therapeutics. Working Capital Working capital was $3.24 billion at December 31, 2010, an increase of $302.2 million or 10% from working capital as of December 31, 2009. This increase was primarily attributable to: • an increase of $441.7 million in cash, cash equivalents and short-term marketable securities; 67 Table of Contents • an increase of $232.4 million in accounts receivable, net, primarily driven by increased product sales; and • an increase of $152.0 million in inventories, due primarily to the purchase of efavirenz at its estimated net selling price from Bristol-Myers Squibb Company (BMS). This increase was partially offset by an increase of $640.8 million in the current portion of convertible senior notes, net and other long-term obligations, due to the reclassification of our convertible senior notes due in 2011 to current liabilities. Working capital was $2.94 billion at December 31, 2009, a decrease of $116.5 million or 4% from working capital as of December 31, 2008. This decrease was primarily attributable to: • an increase of $209.3 million in accounts payable, due primarily to the purchase of efavirenz at its estimated net selling price from BMS; and • a decrease of $133.1 million in cash, cash equivalents and short-term marketable securities since we held a higher proportion of long-term marketable securities as of December 31, 2009 compared to December 31, 2008. This decrease from 2008 to 2009 was partially offset by an increase of $366.1 million in our accounts receivable, net, driven primarily by increased product sales. Cash Provided by Operating Activities Cash provided by operating activities of $2.83 billion in 2010 primarily related to net income of $2.89 billion, adjusted for non-cash items such as $265.5 million of depreciation and amortization expenses, $200.0 million of stock-based compensation expenses, $136.0 million of IPR&D impairment expenses and $82.1 million of tax benefits from employee stock plans, partially offset by $680.4 million of net cash outflow related to changes in operating assets and liabilities and $81.6 million of excess tax benefits from stock option exercises which we reclassified to cash used in financing activities. Cash provided by operating activities of $3.08 billion in 2009 primarily related to net income of $2.63 billion, adjusted for non-cash items such as $180.7 million of stock-based compensation expenses and $148.4 million of amortization expenses. As a result of our adoption of the guidance for our joint ventures with BMS on January 1, 2009, we reclassified the change in noncontrolling interest from cash provided by operating activities to cash used in financing activities. Cash provided by operating activities of $2.14 billion in 2008 primarily related to net income of $1.97 billion, adjusted for non-cash items such as $209.5 million of tax benefits from employee stock plans and $153.4 million of stock-based compensation expenses. This was partially offset by $191.9 million of excess tax benefits from stock option exercises which we reclassified to cash used in financing activities. Cash Used in Investing Activities Cash used in investing activities in 2010 was $1.94 billion, driven by a net use of $1.78 billion in purchases of marketable securities, $91.0 million used in our acquisition of CGI and $61.9 million of capital expenditures. Cash used in investing activities in 2009 was $2.22 billion, driven by cash used for our acquisition of CV Therapeutics of $1.25 billion (net of cash acquired), a net use of $738.0 million in purchases of marketable securities and $230.1 million of capital expenditures for the year. Capital expenditures in 2009 included the purchase of an office building and approximately 30 acres of land located in Foster City, California. Cash used in investing activities in 2008 was $178.8 million, driven primarily by a net use of $53.0 million in purchases of marketable securities and $115.0 million of capital expenditures for the year. 68 Table of Contents Cash Used in Financing Activities Cash used in financing activities in 2010 was $1.34 billion, driven primarily by the $4.02 billion used to repurchase our common stock under our stock repurchase programs and $362.6 million used to purchase note hedges related to our convertible senior notes due in 2014 and 2016. The cash outflows were partially offset by $2.46 billion in proceeds from the issuance of convertible senior notes, net of issuance costs, $155.4 million in proceeds from the sale of warrants related to our convertible senior notes and $221.2 million in proceeds from issuances of common stock under our employee stock plans. Cash used in financing activities in 2009 was $1.05 billion, driven primarily by the $998.5 million used to repurchase our common stock under our stock repurchase program and the $305.5 million used to extinguish the convertible senior notes assumed from the acquisition of CV Therapeutics. The cash outflows were partially offset by proceeds of $222.7 million from issuances of common stock under our employee stock plans. Cash used in financing activities in 2008 was $1.47 billion, driven primarily by the $1.97 billion used to repurchase our common stock under our stock repurchase program. The cash outflows were partially offset by proceeds of $246.1 million that we received from issuances of common stock under our employee stock plans as well as $191.9 million of excess tax benefits from stock option exercises. Other Information Under our current three-year, $5.00 billion stock repurchase program authorized by our Board in May 2010, we repurchased $3.02 billion of our common stock through December 31, 2010. As of December 31, 2010, the remaining authorized amount of stock repurchases that may be made under our $5.00 billion repurchase program was $1.98 billion. In May 2010, we had completed the $1.00 billion stock repurchase program previously authorized by our Board in January 2010. For the year, we utilized a total of $4.02 billion of cash to repurchase and retire 109.9 million shares of our common stock at an average purchase price of $36.57 per share. In January 2011, our Board authorized an additional three-year, $5.00 billion stock repurchase program which will commence upon the completion of our existing program authorized in May 2010. We intend to use the additional authorization to repurchase our shares from time to time to offset the dilution created by shares issued under employee stock plans and to repurchase shares opportunistically. Under our amended and restated credit agreement, we, along with our wholly-owned subsidiary, Gilead Biopharmaceutics Ireland Corporation, may borrow up to an aggregate of $1.25 billion in revolving credit loans. The credit agreement also includes a sub-facility for swing-line loans and letters of credit. During the year, we borrowed and repaid a $500.0 million loan under this revolving credit facility. Loans under the credit agreement bear interest at an interest rate of either LIBOR plus a margin ranging from 20 basis points to 32 basis points or the base rate, as described in the credit agreement. The credit agreement will terminate in December 2012 and all unpaid borrowings thereunder shall be due and payable at that time. We may reduce the commitments and may prepay loans under the credit agreement in whole or in part without penalty, subject to certain conditions. As of December 31, 2010, approximately $1.25 billion was available to be drawn down under this credit agreement. In July 2010, we issued $2.50 billion of convertible senior notes in a private placement and purchased convertible note hedges as well as sold warrants for a net cost of $207.2 million. The cost of the convertible note hedges will be tax deductible over the life of the notes. The convertible note hedges and warrants are intended to reduce the potential economic dilution upon future conversions of the notes by effectively increasing our conversion prices for the notes. We have used and will continue to use the net proceeds from the issuance of the convertible notes to repurchase shares of our common stock and repay existing indebtedness. We believe that our existing capital resources, supplemented by cash generated from our operations, will be adequate to satisfy our capital needs for the foreseeable future. Our future capital requirements will depend on many factors, including but not limited to the following: • the commercial performance of our current and future products; 69 Table of Contents • the progress and scope of our R&D efforts, including preclinical studies and clinical trials; • the cost, timing and outcome of regulatory reviews; • the expansion of our sales and marketing capabilities; • administrative expenses; • the possibility of acquiring additional manufacturing capabilities or office facilities; • the possibility of acquiring other companies or new products; • the establishment of additional collaborative relationships with other companies; and • costs associated with the defense, settlement and adverse results of litigation and government investigations. We may in the future require additional funding, which could be in the form of proceeds from equity or debt financings. If such funding is required, we cannot assure that it will be available to us on favorable terms, if at all. Off Balance Sheet Arrangements We do not have any off balance sheet arrangements. Contractual Obligations Our contractual obligations consist of debt obligations, operating leases, capital commitments, purchase obligations for active pharmaceutical ingredients and inventory-related items and clinical trials contracts. The following table summarizes our significant enforceable and legally binding obligations, future commitments and obligations related to all contracts that we are likely to continue regardless of the fact that certain of these obligations may be cancelable as of December 31, 2010 (in thousands): Payments due by Period Less than one More than 5 Contractual Obligations Total year 1-3 years 3-5 years years Convertible senior notes (1) $ 3,967,102 $ 688,486 $ 721,584 $ 1,296,876 $ 1,260,156 Operating lease obligations 211,167 45,887 67,381 40,555 57,344 Capital commitments (2) 27,323 27,323 — — — Purchase obligations (3)(4) 870,436 640,271 206,820 23,345 — Clinical trials (5) 169,245 82,560 77,821 8,864 — Total $ 5,245,273 $ 1,484,527 $ 1,073,606 $ 1,369,640 $ 1,317,500 (1) Convertible senior note obligations include future interest payments based on a fixed rate of 0.50% for notes due in 2011, 0.625% for notes due in 2013, 1.00% for notes due in 2014 and 1.625% for notes due in 2016. At December 31, 2010, the carrying value of our convertible senior notes was $3.48 billion. (2) At December 31, 2010, we had firm capital project commitments of approximately $27.3 million primarily relating to enterprise software purchase commitments and facilities improvement projects. (3) At December 31, 2010, we had firm purchase commitments related to active pharmaceutical ingredients and certain inventory-related items. These amounts include minimum purchase requirements and actual purchases are expected to significantly exceed these amounts. (4) In addition to the above, we have committed to make potential future milestone payments to third parties as part of licensing, collaboration and development arrangements. Payments under these agreements generally become due and payable only upon achievement of certain developmental, regulatory and/or commercial milestones. Because the achievement of these milestones is neither probable nor reasonably estimable, such contingencies have not been recorded on our Consolidated Balance Sheets and have not been included in the table above. 70 Table of Contents (5) At December 31, 2010, we had several clinical studies in various clinical trial phases. Our most significant clinical trial expenditures are to CROs. Although all of our material contracts with CROs are cancelable, we historically have not cancelled such contracts. These amounts reflect commitments based on existing contracts and do not reflect any future modifications to, or terminations of, existing contracts or anticipated or potential new contracts. We had total gross unrecognized tax benefit liabilities including interest and penalties of $143.7 million as of December 31, 2010. We believe that it is reasonably possible that our unrecognized tax benefits will decrease by approximately $6.0 million in the next 12 months as we expect to have clarification from the tax authorities around certain of our uncertain tax positions. With respect to the remaining unrecognized tax benefits, we are currently unable to make a reasonable estimate as to the period of cash settlement, if any, with the respective tax authorities. Such amounts were included in long-term income taxes payable and non current deferred tax assets on our Consolidated Balance Sheet and have not been included in the table above. Recent Accounting Pronouncements In October 2009, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued new standards for revenue recognition for agreements with multiple deliverables. These new standards impact the determination of when the individual deliverables included in a multiple element arrangement may be treated as separate units of accounting. Additionally, these new standards modify the manner in which the transaction consideration is allocated across the separately identified deliverables by no longer permitting the residual method of allocating arrangement consideration. These new standards are effective for us beginning in the first quarter of 2011; however, early adoption is permitted. The adoption of these standards will not have a material impact on our Consolidated Financial Statements. In December 2010, in response to the pharmaceutical excise tax mandated by healthcare reform legislation adopted in the United States, the FASB issued a new standard to address how pharmaceutical manufacturers should recognize and classify this tax in their income statements. Effective 2011, we, along with other pharmaceutical manufacturers of branded drug products, are required to pay a portion of the pharmaceutical excise tax, calculated based on select government sales for the preceding calendar year as a percentage of total industry government sales. The new standard clarifies that the pharmaceutical excise tax shall be presented as an operating expense and that the liability related to the tax shall be estimated and recorded in full upon the first qualifying sale with a corresponding deferred cost that is amortized to expense generally using a straight-line method of allocation. The new standard is effective for us beginning in the first quarter of 2011. We estimate the 2011 impact of the pharmaceutical excise tax to be between $30–$50 million, which will be classified as SG&A expense in our Consolidated Financial Statements. Also in December 2010, the FASB issued an update to its existing standard for business combinations to address the pro forma financial disclosure requirements for business combinations. The updated standard specifies that if a public entity presents comparative financial statements, the entity should disclose pro forma revenue and earnings of the combined entity as though the business combination that occurred during the current year had occurred as of the beginning of the comparable prior annual reporting period. The updated standard is effective for us beginning in the first quarter of 2011; however, early adoption is permitted. The adoption of this standard will not have a material impact on our Consolidated Financial Statements. ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK Foreign Currency Exchange Risk Our operations include manufacturing and sales activities in the United States, Canada and Ireland as well as sales activities in countries outside the United States, including Europe and Asia Pacific. As a result, our financial results could be significantly affected by factors such as changes in foreign currency exchange rates or weak economic conditions in the foreign markets in which we distribute our products. Our operating results are exposed to changes in foreign currency exchange rates between the U.S. dollar and various foreign currencies, 71 Table of Contents the most significant of which is the Euro. When the U.S. dollar strengthens against these currencies, the relative value of sales made in the respective foreign currency decreases. Conversely, when the U.S. dollar weakens against these currencies, the relative amounts of such sales increase. Overall, we are a net receiver of foreign currencies and, therefore, benefit from a weaker U.S. dollar and are adversely affected by a stronger U.S. dollar relative to those foreign currencies in which we transact significant amounts of business. A significant percentage of our product sales are denominated in foreign currencies. We enter into foreign currency exchange forward and option contracts to partially mitigate the impact of changes in currency exchange rates on net cash flows from our foreign currency denominated sales. We also hedge certain monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies, which reduces but does not eliminate our exposure to currency fluctuations between the date a transaction is recorded and the date that cash is collected or paid. In general, the market risks of these contracts are offset by corresponding gains and losses on the transactions being hedged. The following table summarizes the notional amounts, weighted-average currency exchange rates and fair values of our open foreign currency exchange forward contracts at December 31, 2010. We had no foreign currency exchange option contracts outstanding at December 31, 2010. All contracts have maturities of 18 months or less. Weighted-average rates are stated in terms of the amount of U.S. dollars per foreign currency. Fair values represent estimated settlement amounts at December 31, 2010 (notional amounts and fair values in U.S. dollars and in thousands): Foreign Currency Exchange Forward Contracts Currency NotionalAmount Weighted-AverageSettlement Price Fair Value Euro $ 2,763,277 1.33 $ 43,854 British Pound 313,380 1.55 2,133 Canadian Dollar 183,276 0.97 (5,669 ) Australian Dollar 112,145 0.95 (8,494 ) Swiss Franc 82,765 0.99 (4,935 ) Danish Krone 29,532 0.18 690 Swedish Krone 30,266 0.14 (881 ) Norwegian Krone 18,871 0.17 (272 ) New Zealand Dollar 10,035 0.74 (507 ) Turkish Lira 10,539 0.64 (11 ) Polish Zloty 435 0.33 (0 ) Total $ 3,554,521 $ 25,908 The total notional amount of $3.55 billion and total fair value relating to our net asset of $25.9 million on our open foreign currency exchange forward contracts at December 31, 2010 is comparable to the total notional amount of $3.45 billion and total fair value relating to our net liability of $21.5 million on our open foreign currency exchange forward contracts at December 31, 2009. Interest Rate Risk Our portfolio of available-for-sale marketable securities and our fixed and variable rate liabilities create an exposure to interest rate risk. With respect to our investment portfolio, we adhere to an investment policy that requires us to limit amounts invested in securities based on credit rating, maturity, industry group and investment type and issuer, except for securities issued by the U.S. government. The goals of our investment policy, in order of priority, are as follows: • safety and preservation of principal and diversification of risk; • liquidity of investments sufficient to meet cash flow requirements; and • competitive after-tax rate of return. 72 Table of Contents The following table summarizes the expected maturities and average interest rates of our interest-generating assets and interest-bearing liabilities at December 31, 2010 (dollars in thousands): Years Ending December 31, Thereafter Total Total FairValue atDecember 31,2010 2011 2012 2013 2014 2015 Assets Available-for-sale debt securities $ 1,212,945 $ 1,693,717 $ 1,231,719 $ 74,781 $ 56,436 $ 154,846 $ 4,424,444 $ 4,424,444 Average interest rate 0.4% 0.7% 1.1% 1.7% 2.7% 2.7% Liabilities Convertible senior notes (1) $ 649,987 $ — $ 649,867 $ 1,250,000 $ — $ 1,250,000 $ 3,799,854 $ 3,971,454 Average interest rate 0.50% 0.625% 1.00% 1.625% (1) In April 2006, we issued convertible senior notes due in 2011 (2011 Notes) and 2013 (2013 Notes) in a private placement pursuant to Rule 144A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended. The notes were issued at par and bear interest rates of 0.50% and 0.625% for the 2011 Notes and 2013 Notes, respectively, and may be converted into shares of our common stock subject to certain circumstances. In July 2010, we issued convertible senior notes due in 2014 (2014 Notes) and 2016 (2016 Notes) in a private placement pursuant to Rule 144A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended. The notes were issued at par and bear interest rates of 1.00% and 1.625% for the 2014 Notes and 2016 Notes, respectively, and may be converted into shares of our common stock subject to certain circumstances. Credit Risk As of December 31, 2010, we held approximately $70.8 million of auction rate securities within our available-for-sale long-term marketable securities. Our auction rate securities comprised approximately 1% of our total cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities as of December 31, 2010. In 2008, we began observing the failed auctions for our auction rate securities for which the underlying assets are comprised of student loans. Most of our auction rate securities, including those subject to the failed auctions, are currently rated AAA, consistent with the high quality rating required by our investment policy, supported by the federal government as part of the Federal Family Education Loan Program and over-collateralized. Our auction rate securities reset every seven to 14 days with maturity dates ranging from 2025 through 2040 and have annual interest rates ranging from 0.43% to 1.19%. As of December 31, 2010, our auction rate securities continued to earn interest. If auctions continue to fail for securities in which we have invested, we may be unable to liquidate some or all of our auction rate securities at par should we need or desire to access the funds invested in those securities. However, based on our total cash and marketable securities position, our expected operating cash flows as well as access to funds through our credit facility, we believe that we will be able to hold these securities until there is a recovery in the auction market and the related securities, which may be at final maturity. As a result, we do not anticipate that the current illiquidity of these auction rate securities will have a material effect on our cash requirements or working capital. In light of the volatility and developments that we have seen in the financial markets, we continue to review our cash equivalents and marketable securities carefully and strive to invest prudently. We believe that maintaining the primary goals of our investment policy, safety and preservation of principal and diversification of risk, as well as liquidity, has helped protect us from many of the risks in the credit markets while allowing us to continue to meet our operating cash flow requirements as well as execute on other strategic opportunities. We are also subject to credit risk from our accounts receivable related to our product sales. Our accounts receivable balance at December 31, 2010 was $1.62 billion, compared to $1.39 billion at December 31, 2009. The majority of our trade accounts receivable arises from product sales in the United States and Europe. To date, 73 Table of Contents we have not experienced significant losses with respect to the collection of our accounts receivable. We believe that our allowance for doubtful accounts was adequate at December 31, 2010.",2023-12-30 19:04:25.936384
882095,GILD,"GILEAD SCIENCES, INC.",2012,"ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS The following Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (MD&A) is intended to help the reader understand our results of operations and financial condition. MD&A is provided as a supplement to, and should be read in conjunction with, our audited Consolidated Financial Statements and the accompanying notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements and other disclosures included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K (including the disclosures under “Item 1A. Risk Factors”). Our Consolidated Financial Statements have been prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles and are presented in U.S. dollars. Management Overview Gilead Sciences, Inc. (Gilead, we or us), incorporated in Delaware on June 22, 1987, is a research-based biopharmaceutical company that discovers, develops and commercializes innovative medicines in areas of unmet medical need. With each new discovery and experimental drug candidate, we seek to improve the care of patients suffering from life-threatening diseases around the world. Gilead’s primary areas of focus include human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)/AIDS, liver diseases such as hepatitis B virus (HBV) and hepatitis C virus (HCV) and serious cardiovascular/metabolic and respiratory conditions. Headquartered in Foster City, California, we have operations in North America, Europe and Asia Pacific. We continue to seek to add to our existing portfolio of products through our internal discovery and clinical development programs and through a product acquisition and in-licensing strategy. Our product portfolio is comprised of Atripla®, Truvada®, Viread®, Emtriva®, Complera®/Eviplera®, Hepsera®, AmBisome®, Letairis®, Ranexa®, Cayston® and Vistide®. In addition, we also sell and distribute certain products through our corporate partners under royalty-paying collaborative agreements. For example, F. Hoffmann-La Roche Ltd (together with Hoffmann-La Roche Inc., Roche) markets Tamiflu®; GlaxoSmithKline Inc. (GSK) markets Hepsera and Viread in certain territories outside of the United States; GSK also markets Volibris® outside of the United States; Astellas Pharma US, Inc. markets AmBisome in the United States and Canada; Astellas US LLC markets Lexiscan® injection in the United States; Rapidscan Pharma Solutions, Inc. markets Rapiscan in certain territories outside of the United States; Menarini International Operations Luxembourg SA markets Ranexa in certain territories outside of the United States; and Japan Tobacco Inc. (Japan Tobacco) markets Truvada, Viread and Emtriva in Japan. Business Highlights During 2011, we continued to advance our pipeline and internal programs across our therapeutic areas. We augmented these efforts through strategic investments in acquisitions, in-licensing opportunities and collaborations. In the liver disease area, our acquisition of Pharmasset Inc. (Pharmasset) in early 2012 marks a significant opportunity to continue developing best-in-class drugs. We believe the combination of our existing internal research programs and our recent partnerships and acquisitions will drive research and development efforts and accelerate our product pipeline so that we can continue to bring innovative therapies to individuals around the world who are living with unmet medical needs. Below is a summary of our key accomplishments: • received marketing approval for and began launching Complera/Eviplera, our second single-tablet regimen for the treatment of HIV in the United States, Canada and certain countries of the European Union; • submitted new drug application (NDA) for “Quad” single-tablet regimen of elvitegravir, cobicistat, emtricitabine and tenofovir disoproxil fumarate for the treatment of HIV six weeks after the Phase 3 studies concluded; • obtained U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) agreement for a revision of the Letairis label, which subsequently changed the sales trajectory for the product; 56 Table of Contents • progressed GS-7340, an investigational nucleotide reverse transcriptase inhibitor, and completed collaborative agreements in the HIV field which set the stage for a third generation of single-tablet regimens; • accelerated our timeline to develop the first all-oral HCV regimen as a result of the Pharmasset acquisition; and • completed the Arresto Biosciences, Inc. (Arresto) and Calistoga Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (Calistoga) acquisitions and acquired the Oceanside, California facility for biologics manufacturing to support advancing clinical studies in oncology. New and Potential Product Offerings and New Drug Applications In the area of HIV, we continued efforts to expand our product offerings of single-tablet regimens with the launch of Complera/Eviplera and submission of our Quad for regulatory approval in the United States and Europe. In August 2011, we received FDA approval for Complera for the treatment of HIV-1 infection in treatment-naïve adults. Complera combines three antiretroviral medications in one daily tablet—our Truvada, a fixed-dose combination of emtricitabine and tenofovir disoproxil fumarate, and Edurant® (rilpivirine), marketed by Tibotec Pharmaceuticals (Tibotec). In November 2011, we received marketing approval for the product in Europe, where the product is marketed as Eviplera. In October 2011, we submitted a NDA to the FDA for the marketing approval of Quad for the treatment of HIV-1 infection in adults. Subsequently, the FDA accepted the NDA and has set a target review date of August 27, 2012 under the Prescription Drug User Fee Act (PDUFA). The FDA has indicated that a panel will be convened in May 2012 to provide expert advice on the application. We submitted the marketing authorisation application for Quad for the treatment of HIV-1 infection in adults to the European Medicines Agency in November 2011. In December 2011, we announced that Phase 3 clinical trials of our pharmacoenhancing or “boosting” agent cobicistat, met its 48-week primary object of non-inferiority. Cobicistat increases blood levels of certain HIV medicines to allow for one pill once-daily dosing. The study indicated that after 48 weeks of treatment, 85 percent of patients taking a regimen of cobicistat-boosted atazanavir plus Truvada achieved comparable results with patients taking ritonavir-boosted atazanavir plus Truvada. Also in December 2011, we announced Phase 3 clinical trial results showing that elvitegravir, an integrase inhibitor being evaluated for the treatment of HIV-1 infection, was non-inferior to the integrase inhibitor raltegravir after two years of therapy in treatment-experienced patients. The results of the study indicate that elvitegravir has the potential to become a new once-daily treatment option for those with HIV who have developed resistance to other therapies. Acquisitions In January 2011, we completed the acquisition of Arresto for $225 million plus potential future payments based on achievement of certain sales levels. Arresto was a privately-held, development-stage biotechnology company based in Palo Alto, California, focused on developing antibodies for the potential treatment of fibrotic diseases and cancer. The lead product from this acquisition was GS-6624, a humanized monoclonal antibody (mAb) targeting the human lysyl oxidase-like-2 (LOXL2) protein. In addition to ongoing Phase 2 studies of GS-6624 in liver fibrosis, myelofibrosis, colorectal cancer and pancreatic cancer, a Phase 1 study is being conducted to evaluate GS-6624 in patients with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis. In April 2011, we acquired Calistoga for $375 million plus potential payments of up to $225 million based on the achievement of certain milestones. Calistoga was a privately-held, biotechnology company based in Seattle, Washington, focused on the development of medicines to treat cancer and inflammatory diseases. The 57 Table of Contents portfolio of proprietary compounds from this acquisition selectively targeted isoforms of phosphoinositide-3 kinase (PI3K). Calistoga’s lead product candidate, GS-1101, was a first-in-class specific inhibitor of the PI3K delta isoform. PI3K delta is preferentially expressed in leukocytes involved in a variety of inflammatory and autoimmune diseases and hematological cancers. In November 2011, we entered into an agreement to acquire Pharmasset for $11.1 billion. The acquisition was financed with cash on hand, bank debt and senior unsecured notes. The acquisition was completed in January 2012. Pharmasset was a clinical-stage pharmaceutical company located in Princeton, New Jersey, committed to discovering, developing and commercializing novel drugs to treat viral infections. Pharmasset’s primary focus was the development of oral therapeutics for the treatment of HCV. Pharmasset’s research and development (R&D) efforts were focused on nucleoside/tide analogs, a class of compounds that act as alternative substrates for the viral polymerase, thus inhibiting viral replication. In-Licensing and Collaborations In June 2011, we entered into an agreement with Tibotec for the development and commercialization of a new fixed-dose combination product containing our cobicistat and Tibotec’s protease inhibitor Prezista® (darunavir), indicated for the treatment of HIV. Prezista is currently co-administered with ritonavir in combination with other antiretroviral agents. In October 2011, we entered into an agreement with Boehringer Ingelheim (BI) for worldwide rights for the research, development and commercialization of BI’s novel non-catalytic site integrase inhibitors for HIV. This includes the lead compound BI 224436, which has been evaluated in a Phase 1a dose-escalation study to assess bioavailability and pharmacokinetics in healthy volunteers. Also in October 2011, we entered into an agreement with GlobeImmune, Inc. for the license, development and commercialization of therapeutic vaccine products for use in conjunction with Viread and other oral therapies for the treatment of the chronic HBV infection. Also in October 2011, we entered into an agreement with Bristol-Myers Squibb Company (BMS) for the licensing, development and commercialization of a fixed-dose combination containing BMS’s protease inhibitor Reyataz® (atazanavir sulfate) and our cobicistat. We are currently studying atazanavir and cobicistat in Phase 2 and 3 studies in HIV-1 treatment-naïve patients. In November 2011, we entered into an agreement with Tibotec for the development and commercialization of a single-tablet regimen combining Tibotec’s Prezista with our Emtriva, GS-7340 and cobicistat. Financial Highlights During 2011, in spite of a challenging macroeconomic environment, we continued to grow our business and achieved total product sales of $8.10 billion for 2011, an increase of 10% over 2010. The growth in product sales was primarily driven by growth in our antiviral franchise, where sales increased 8% to $7.05 billion when compared to the prior year. Sales of other products, which are comprised primarily of AmBisome, Ranexa and Letairis reached $1.05 billion, an increase of 23% compared to the prior year. Total revenues during 2011 grew 5% to $8.39 billion. Our product sales growth was partially offset by a decline in royalty revenues from our collaborations with corporate partners, which were $268.8 million for 2011, a decrease of 51% from 2010 primarily due to lower Tamiflu royalties as pandemic planning initiatives worldwide have declined. Gross margin decreased from 75% in 2010 to 74% in 2011 primarily due to an annual selling price adjustment for the percentage share of Atripla that is paid to our partner. R&D expenses were $1.23 billion for 2011 and $1.07 billion for 2010, an increase of $156.2 million, or 15%. The increase was due primarily to costs related to clinical studies and the impact of higher headcount and 58 Table of Contents expenses associated with acquisitions, collaborations and the ongoing growth of our business. Selling, general and administrative (SG&A) expenses were $1.24 billion for 2011 and $1.04 billion for 2010, an increase of $197.6 million, or 19%. The increase was due primarily to the increased expenses associated with the ongoing growth of our business, the pharmaceutical excise tax resulting from U.S. healthcare reform and increased bad debt provision due to slower collections in certain Southern European countries. Net income for 2011 was $2.80 billion, a 3% decrease from $2.90 billion in 2010 due primarily to the investments we made in our existing clinical programs and through acquisitions, in-licensing and collaboration agreements and lower Tamiflu royalties from Roche as a result of declining pandemic planning initiatives worldwide. Our diluted earnings per share increased by 7% to $3.55 in 2011 from $3.32 in 2010, which incorporates the impact of our share repurchases throughout the year. Financing Activity Cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities increased by $4.65 billion during 2011 to a total of $9.96 billion at December 31, 2011. The primary sources of cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities during 2011 were operating cash flows of $3.64 billion and $4.66 billion in proceeds from the issuance of senior unsecured notes, of which $3.67 billion was raised in December of 2011 to partially fund the Pharmasset acquisition. Key uses of cash during the year included $2.38 billion for repurchases of our common stock under our stock repurchase programs, $650.0 million for the repayment of our convertible senior notes due in 2011 and $588.6 million for acquisition activities in 2011. During 2011, we completed our May 2010, $5.00 billion stock repurchase program and commenced share repurchases under a three-year, $5.00 billion stock repurchase program authorized by our Board of Directors in January 2011. In 2011, we spent a total of $2.38 billion of cash to repurchase and retire 59.9 million shares of our common stock at an average purchase price of $39.80 per share. Subsequent Events In January 2012, we raised $2.15 billion in bank debt to partially fund the acquisition of Pharmasset. We acquired Pharmasset for $11.1 billion through a cash tender offer and subsequent merger, which closed in January 2012. Pharmasset’s lead compound was a nucleotide analog in HCV-infected individuals across genotypes now known as GS-7977. During 2012, we expect to receive a significant amount of data from clinical trials evaluating GS-7977. On February 17, 2012, we announced that data indicates that GS-7977 with ribavirin for the treatment of genotype 1 patients with a prior “null” response to an interferon-containing regimen for 12 weeks will not be sufficient to cure their disease. We are currently conducting additional Phase 2 studies in HCV infected genotype 1 patients, including treatment-naïve patients, the results of which we expect at the end of the first quarter, in the second quarter and early in the third quarter of 2012. Outlook 2012 Our operating objectives for 2012 include increasing the market share of our commercial products, continuing to strengthen our pipeline with internally developed and/or externally in-licensed or purchased opportunities and strengthening our key alliances. From an R&D standpoint, we will continue to execute on our pipeline development with a particular focus on innovative HIV single-tablet regimens for patients, progression of our HCV molecules into and through the clinic and new initiatives in oncology and inflammation. In 2012, we expect to publicly announce additional data sets related to the development of GS-7977 for treatment of HCV that will affect the cost and duration of our development efforts for GS-7977. 59 Table of Contents From a commercial standpoint, we have a number of internal and external initiatives intended to promote the continued growth of our franchises. In the HIV area, the scientific arguments to diagnose and treat patients earlier are strong and the reasons to use single-tablet regimens are compelling both medically and practically. The extension of the Ryan White Treatment Act should provide stable funding for AIDS Drug Assistance Programs (ADAPs) in the United States through 2013. During 2012, we will continue to roll out Complera/Eviplera around the world and, subject to FDA approval of Quad, bring our third single-tablet regimen to individuals in the U.S. living with HIV. In 2011, we launched the Truvada/rilpivirine single-tablet regimen for treatment of HIV as Complera in the United States and Canada and as Eviplera in the United Kingdom and Austria. In 2012, we expect continued uptake of Complera in the United States and Canada and to launch Eviplera throughout Europe. Our Quad is being reviewed by the FDA with a PDUFA date of August 27, 2012. Assuming approval, we expect to launch the product in September 2012. We expect Quad to contribute incremental revenue to our HIV franchise. In the HBV area, we will continue to support educational and promotional activities focused on U.S. Asian communities, highlighting the need to screen, diagnose and link patients to care. In the cardiovascular area, we will continue in our efforts to raise awareness of Gilead in the pulmonary arterial hypertension and cardiology communities and believe this will help grow revenues of Letairis and Ranexa in 2012. We are mindful that conditions in the current macroeconomic environment could affect our ability to achieve our goals. Some of the factors that could affect our business include: future changes to healthcare reform in the United States, a continuation or worsening of global economic conditions, patent expirations of competitive products and the launch of generic competitors, continued government pricing pressures internationally and the potential volatility in foreign currency exchange rates. We will continue to monitor these conditions and will adjust our business processes, as appropriate, to mitigate these risks to our business. We believe the successes we experienced in 2011 have enabled us to continue to build a financially sound business model that will allow us to continue to further expand our commercial and R&D activities and to maintain quality and compliance. As we continue to grow our business, we remain focused on profitable revenue growth and prudent expense management that we believe will enable solid execution of our operating objectives for 2012. Critical Accounting Policies, Estimates and Judgments The discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based on our Consolidated Financial Statements, which have been prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses and related disclosures. On an ongoing basis, we evaluate our estimates, including those related to revenue recognition, intangible assets, allowance for doubtful accounts, prepaid royalties, clinical trial accruals, our tax provision and stock-based compensation. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other market specific and other relevant assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ significantly from these estimates. We believe the following critical accounting policies reflect the more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our Consolidated Financial Statements. 60 Table of Contents Revenue Recognition Product Sales We recognize revenues from product sales when there is persuasive evidence that an arrangement exists, delivery to the customer has occurred, the price is fixed or determinable and collectability is reasonably assured. We record estimated reductions to revenues for government rebates such as Medicaid reimbursements, customer incentives such as cash discounts for prompt payment, distributor fees and expected returns of expired products. These estimates are deducted from gross product sales at the time such revenues are recognized. Of these reductions from gross product sales, government rebates significantly impact our reported net product sales and are based upon certain estimates that require complex and significant judgment by management. Government Rebates We estimate reductions to our revenues for government-managed Medicaid programs as well as to certain other qualifying federal, state and foreign government programs for the reimbursement of portions of the retail price of prescriptions filled that are covered by these programs. These reductions are settled either by us being invoiced directly or through charge-backs from our wholesalers. Government rebates that are invoiced directly to us are recorded in accrued government rebates on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. For qualified programs that can purchase our products through wholesalers at a lower contractual government price, the wholesalers charge back to us the difference between their acquisition cost and the lower contractual government price, which we record as allowances against accounts receivable. Although we may pay rebates in countries outside of the United States, to date, payments made to foreign governments have not represented a significant portion of our total government rebates. For government programs in the United States, we estimate these sales allowances based on contractual terms, historical utilization rates, new information regarding changes in these programs’ regulations and guidelines that would impact the amount of the actual rebates, our expectations regarding future utilization rates for these programs and channel inventory data obtained from our major U.S. wholesalers in accordance with our inventory management agreements. During 2011, 2010, and 2009, U.S government rebates of $1.85 billion, $1.38 billion and $885.5 million, respectively, representing 17%, 15% and 12% of total gross product sales, respectively, were deducted from gross product sales. We believe that the methodology that we use to estimate our sales allowances for government price reductions is reasonable and appropriate given the current facts and circumstances. However, actual results may differ. Based on the current information available to us, actual government rebates claimed for these periods have varied by approximately 3% from our estimates recorded in those periods. As of December 31, 2011 and 2010, we had accrued U.S. government rebates of $494.2 million and $318.3 million, respectively, in accrued government rebates and had an allowance for government chargebacks of $72.1 million and $53.5 million, respectively, recorded against accounts receivable. The following table summarizes the aggregate activity in our U.S. government rebates allowance and accrued liabilities accounts: Balance atBeginningof Year Charged toExpense DeductedfromAccruals Balance atEnd ofYear Year ended December 31, 2011: Government rebates allowances and accrued liabilities Activity related to 2011 sales $ — $ 1,833,926 $ 1,298,281 $ 535,645 Activity related to sales prior to 2011 371,783 16,877 358,039 30,621 Total $ 371,783 $ 1,850,803 $ 1,656,320 $ 566,266 Year ended December 31, 2010: Government rebates allowances and accrued liabilities Activity related to 2010 sales $ — $ 1,383,855 $ 1,012,874 $ 370,981 Activity related to sales prior to 2010 284,642 (8,573 ) 275,267 802 Total $ 284,642 $ 1,375,282 $ 1,288,141 $ 371,783 61 Table of Contents Intangible Assets In conjunction with business combinations that we have completed, we have recorded intangible assets primarily related to marketed products, IPR&D projects and goodwill as part of our recognition and measurement of assets acquired and liabilities assumed in a business combination. Identifiable intangible assets, such as those related to marketed products or IPR&D projects, are measured at their respective fair values as of the acquisition date. We believe the fair values assigned to our acquired intangible assets are based on reasonable estimates and assumptions given the available facts and circumstances as of the acquisition dates. Discounted cash flow models are used in valuing these intangible assets, and these models require the use of significant estimates and assumptions including but not limited to: • estimates of revenues and operating profits related to the products or product candidates; • the probability of success for unapproved product candidates considering their stages of development; • the time and resources needed to complete the development and approval of product candidates; • the life of the potential commercialized products and associated risks, including the inherent difficulties and uncertainties in developing a product candidate such as obtaining FDA and other regulatory approvals; and • risks related to the viability of and potential alternative treatments in any future target markets. Goodwill represents the excess of the consideration transferred over the estimated fair values of assets acquired and liabilities assumed in a business combination. Goodwill and intangible assets determined to have indefinite useful lives are not amortized, but are required to be tested for impairment at least annually. We test goodwill and other indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment on an annual basis and in between annual tests if we become aware of any events occurring or changes in circumstances that would indicate a reduction in the fair values of the assets below their carrying amounts. As of December 31, 2011, we had $1.27 billion of indefinite-lived intangible assets consisting of $1.00 billion of goodwill resulting from various business combinations and $266.2 million of intangible assets related to the IPR&D projects that we acquired from Arresto and Calistoga. Intangible assets with finite useful lives are amortized over their estimated useful lives and are reviewed for impairment when facts or circumstances suggest that the carrying value of these assets may not be recoverable. We are amortizing the intangible asset related to the Ranexa product, which we acquired from CV Therapeutics, over its estimated useful life using an amortization rate derived from our forecasted future product sales for Ranexa. Our product sales forecasts are prepared annually and determined using our best estimates of future activity upon considering such factors as historical and expected future patient usage or uptake of our products, the introduction of complimentary or combination therapies or products and future product launch plans. If a previously unanticipated and significant change occurs to our sales forecasts, we will prospectively update the rate used to amortize our intangible asset related to Ranexa which may increase future cost of goods sold, as that is where we record the amortization expense. We are amortizing the intangible asset related to the Lexiscan product, which we also acquired from CV Therapeutics, over its estimated useful life to cost of goods sold on a straight-line basis. Given that current Lexiscan revenues consist of royalties received from a collaboration partner and our lack of ongoing access and visibility into that partner’s future sales forecasts, we cannot make a reasonable estimate of the amortization rate using a forecasted product sales approach. As of December 31, 2011, we had $796.7 million of net unamortized finite-lived intangible assets consisting primarily of intangible assets related to the marketed products that we acquired from CV Therapeutics. Our judgment regarding the existence of impairment indicators is based on our historical and projected future operating results, our extent or manner of use of the acquired assets, legal and regulatory factors and events, our overall business strategy and market and economic trends. If events occur in the future that cause us to conclude that impairment indicators exist and that certain intangible assets are impaired, our financial condition and results of operations may be adversely impacted. 62 Table of Contents During the fourth quarter of 2010, we recorded $136.0 million of impairment charges related to certain IPR&D assets acquired from CV Therapeutics which we had no future plans to develop and which were deemed to have no future use to us or other market participants. These charges related to the GS-9667, Adentri and tecadenoson programs and were recorded in R&D expense. The majority of the impairment charge related to our GS-9667 program, a product candidate that was in Phase 1 clinical studies for the treatment of diabetes and hypertriglyceridemia, which was terminated in the fourth quarter of 2010 due to unfavorable results from pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics tests that demonstrated limited effectiveness of the compound in patients. Given these results, we do not believe it has alternative future uses for us or other market participants. During the fourth quarter of 2011, we recorded $26.6 million of impairment charges related to certain IPR&D assets acquired from CGI. These impairment charges were a result of changes in the anticipated market share related to the Syk compound. Allowance for Doubtful Accounts We also maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments. This allowance is based on our analysis of several factors including, but not limited to, contractual payment terms, historical payment patterns of our customers and individual customer circumstances, an analysis of days sales outstanding by geographic region and a review of the local economic environment and its potential impact on government funding and reimbursement practices. If the financial condition of our customers or the economic environment in which they operate were to deteriorate, resulting in an inability to make payments, additional allowances may be required. We believe that the allowance for doubtful accounts is adequate; however, significant deterioration in any of the above factors could materially change these expectations and may result in an increase to our allowance for doubtful accounts. Prepaid Royalties We capitalize royalties that we have prepaid at cost, specifically those related to the emtricitabine royalties we paid to Emory University (Emory) for the HIV indication, based on the present value of the future royalty obligation that we would expect to pay to Emory assuming certain expected future levels of our product sales incorporating emtricitabine. The present value of our future royalty obligation was derived using our weighted-average cost of capital. We review periodically the expected future sales levels of our products and any indicators that might require a write-down in the net recoverable value of our asset or a change in the estimated life of the prepaid royalty. Some potential indicators of impairment include the launch of a significant product by a competitor, significant deviations in recognized product sales compared to forecast and product safety issues and recalls. We amortize our prepaid royalties based on an effective royalty rate that we derive from forecasted future HIV product sales incorporating emtricitabine. Our product sales forecasts are prepared annually and determined using our best estimates of future activity upon considering such factors as historical and expected future patient usage or uptake of our products, the introduction of complimentary or combination therapies or products and future product launch plans. If a previously unanticipated and significant change occurs to our sales forecasts, including the introduction of a competing product by us or one of our competitors in the same HIV market as emtricitabine, we will prospectively update the royalty rate used to amortize our prepaid royalties which may increase future cost of goods sold, as that is where we record the amortization expense. As of December 31, 2011 and 2010, we had a prepaid royalty asset relating to the emtricitabine royalties we paid to Emory of $190.2 million and $219.5 million, respectively. Amortization expense relating to this prepaid royalty asset was $29.3 million, $25.5 million and $29.9 million for the years ended December 31, 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively. Clinical Trial Accruals We record accruals for estimated clinical study costs. Most of our clinical studies are performed by third-party contract research organizations (CROs). These costs are a significant component of R&D expenses. During 63 Table of Contents 2011, 2010 and 2009, we incurred CRO costs of $138.0 million, $99.0 million and $109.9 million, respectively. We accrue costs for clinical studies performed by CROs over the service periods specified in the contracts and adjust our estimates, if required, based upon our ongoing review of the level of effort and costs actually incurred by the CROs. We validate our accruals quarterly with our vendors and perform detailed reviews of the activities related to our significant contracts. Based upon the results of these validation processes, we assess the appropriateness of our accruals and make any adjustments we deem necessary to ensure that our expenses reflect the actual effort incurred by the CROs. Generally, a significant portion of the total clinical trial costs is associated with start up activities for the trial and patient enrollment. We extensively outsource our clinical trial activities and usually perform only a small portion of the start-up activities in-house. As a result, CROs typically perform most of the total start-up activities for our trials, including document preparation, site identification, screening and preparation, pre-study visits, training and program management. Start-up costs usually occur within a few months after the contract has been executed and are milestone or event driven in nature. The remaining clinical activities and related costs, such as patient monitoring and administration, generally occur ratably throughout the life of the individual contract or study. Most contracts are negotiated as fixed per unit prices and can vary in length between three months for a single dose Phase 1 clinical study and up to two years or more for a more complex Phase 3 clinical study. The average length of contracts in 2011, 2010 and 2009 has been at the upper end of this range in order to provide long-term safety and efficacy data to support the commercial launches of Atripla, Truvada, Viread, Complera/Eviplera, Hepsera, Emtriva, Letairis and Ranexa. All of our material CRO contracts are terminable by us upon written notice and we are generally only liable for actual effort expended by the CRO and certain non-cancelable expenses incurred at any point of termination. Amounts paid in advance relating to uncompleted services will be refunded to us if a contract is terminated. Some contracts may include additional termination payments that become due and payable if we terminate the contract. Such additional termination payments are only recorded if it becomes probable that a contract will be terminated. Through December 31, 2011, differences between actual and estimated activity levels for any particular study have not been material. However, if management does not receive complete and accurate information from our vendors or underestimates activity levels associated with a study at a given point in time, we may have to record additional and potentially significant R&D expenses in future periods. Tax Provision We estimate our income tax provision, including deferred tax assets and liabilities, based on significant management judgment. We evaluate the realization of all or a portion of our deferred tax assets on a quarterly basis. We record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets to the amounts that are more likely than not to be realized. We consider future taxable income, ongoing tax planning strategies and our historical financial performance in assessing the need for a valuation allowance. If we expect to realize deferred tax assets for which we have previously recorded a valuation allowance, we will reduce the valuation allowance in the period in which such determination is first made. Our future effective income tax rate may be affected by such factors as changes in tax laws, regulations or rates, changing interpretation of existing laws or regulations, the impact of accounting for stock-based compensation, changes in our international organization and changes in overall levels of income before tax. We record liabilities related to uncertain tax positions in accordance with the guidance that clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in an enterprise’s financial statements by prescribing a minimum recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. We do not believe any such uncertain tax positions currently pending will have a material adverse effect on our Consolidated Financial Statements, although an adverse resolution of one or more of these uncertain tax positions in any period could have a material impact on the results of operations for that period. 64 Table of Contents At December 31, 2011 and 2010, we had total federal, state and foreign unrecognized tax benefits of $146.9 million and $126.5 million, respectively. Of the total unrecognized tax benefits, $120.6 million and $106.5 million at December 31, 2011 and 2010, respectively, if recognized, would reduce our effective tax rate in the period of recognition. As of December 31, 2011, we believe that it is reasonably possible that our unrecognized tax benefits will not significantly change in the next 12 months as we do not expect to have clarification from the IRS and other tax authorities around any of our uncertain tax positions. We file federal, state and foreign income tax returns in many jurisdictions in the United States and abroad. For federal income tax purposes, the statute of limitations is open for 2003 and onwards. For certain acquired entities, the statute of limitations is open for all years from inception due to our utilization of their net operating losses and credits carried over from prior years. For California income tax purposes, the statute of limitations is open for 2002 and onwards. Our income tax returns are audited by federal, state and foreign tax authorities. We are currently under examination by the IRS for the 2008 and 2009 tax years and by various state and foreign jurisdictions. There are differing interpretations of tax laws and regulations, and as a result, significant disputes may arise with these tax authorities involving issues of the timing and amount of deductions and allocations of income among various tax jurisdictions. We periodically evaluate our exposures associated with our tax filing positions. Stock-based Compensation We measure all share-based payments to employees and directors, including grants of stock options, based on their relative fair values. Fair values of awards granted under our stock option plans and Employee Stock Purchase Plan were estimated at grant or purchase dates using a Black-Scholes option valuation model. The Black-Scholes option valuation model was developed for use in estimating the fair value of traded options, which have no vesting restrictions and are fully transferable. In addition, option valuation models require the input of highly subjective assumptions, including expected stock price volatility and expected award life. Fair value of our restricted stock units (RSUs) is equal to the closing price of our common stock on the grant date. Our RSUs vest ratably on an annual basis over five years from the grant date for awards granted prior to 2011 and four years from the grant date for awards granted in 2011. We also grant performance-based restricted stock units which are valued using the Monte Carlo valuation method and vest upon the achievement of specified market and performance goals relative to a pre-determined peer group. The actual number of common shares ultimately issued is calculated by multiplying the number of performance units by a payout percentage ranging from 0% to 200%. Performance awards vest only when a committee (or subcommittee) of our Board has determined that we have achieved our specified market and performance goals. Stock-based compensation is recognized as expense over the requisite service periods in our Consolidated Statements of Income using a graded vesting expense attribution approach for unvested stock options granted prior to January 1, 2006, and using the straight-line expense attribution approach for stock options granted after our adoption of new guidance for share-based payments to employees and directors on January 1, 2006. As stock-based compensation expenses, related to stock options recognized on adoption of the new guidance, is based on awards ultimately expected to vest, gross expense has been reduced for estimated forfeitures. The guidance requires forfeitures to be estimated at the time of grant and revised, if necessary, in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates. We estimated forfeitures based on our historical experience. Prior to the adoption of this guidance, pro forma information that was required to be disclosed included forfeitures as they occurred. As a result of the guidance adopted on January 1, 2006, we only recognize a tax benefit from stock-based compensation in additional paid-in capital (APIC) if an incremental tax benefit is realized after all other tax attributes currently available to us have been utilized. In addition, we have elected to account for the indirect benefits of stock-based compensation on the research tax credit and the extraterritorial income deduction through our Consolidated Statements of Income rather than through APIC. During the years ended December 31, 2011, 2010 and 2009, we recognized stock-based compensation expenses of $192.4 million, $200.0 million and $185.8 million, respectively, in operating expenses, and we 65 Table of Contents capitalized $8.6 million, $10.9 million and $11.4 million, respectively, to inventory. As of December 31, 2011, 2010 and 2009, $2.0 million, $1.8 million and $1.1 million of stock-based compensation costs was included in inventory, respectively. As of December 31, 2011, we had unrecognized stock-based compensation expenses of $163.0 million related to unvested stock options, which we expect to expense over an estimated weighted-average period of 2.4 years and we had unrecognized stock-based compensation expenses of $218.9 million related to RSUs which we expect to expense over an estimated weighted average period of 3.3 years. Results of Operations Total Revenues We had total revenues of $8.39 billion in 2011, $7.95 billion in 2010 and $7.01 billion in 2009. Included in total revenues were product sales, royalty revenues and contract and other revenues. Increases in total revenues were driven by growth in product sales. Total product sales were $8.10 billion in 2011, an increase of 10% over total product sales of $7.39 billion in 2010, driven primarily by our antiviral franchise, resulting from the continued growth in sales of Atripla and Truvada. The increase in product sales also reflected sales growth in our non-antiviral products, primarily AmBisome, Ranexa, Letairis and Cayston, which reached $1.05 billion mark in 2011 compared to $853.0 million in 2010. In 2011, the increase in our product sales was partially offset by a decline in our Tamiflu royalties from Roche, due to declining pandemic planning initiatives worldwide. Total product sales increased by 14% in 2010 compared to $6.47 billion in 2009, primarily driven by growth of Atripla and Truvada sales. Product sales in the United States increased 9% for 2011 compared to 2010, primarily driven by the continued sales growth in our antiviral franchise and the introduction of Complera, partially offset by the ongoing impact of U.S. healthcare reform. The increase also reflected sales growth in non-antiviral franchises. Ranexa sales contributed $315.0 million to our 2011 product sales, an increase of 34% compared to 2010. Letairis sales contributed $293.4 million to our 2011 product sales, an increase of 22% compared to 2010. Cayston contributed $77.5 million to our 2011 product sales, an increase of 84% compared to 2010. Product sales in Europe increased 9% for 2011 compared to 2010, primarily driven by sales growth in our antiviral franchise. This increase was partially offset by the impact of price reductions, due in part to austerity measures in certain European countries. Antiviral product sales in Europe totaled $2.71 billion in 2011, an increase of 9% compared to $2.49 billion in 2010, driven primarily by the sales of Atripla and Truvada. Foreign currency exchange, net of hedges, had an unfavorable impact on our European product sales in 2011 compared to 2010. A significant percentage of our product sales continues to be denominated in foreign currencies and we face exposure to adverse movements in foreign currency exchange rates. We used foreign currency exchange forward and option contracts to hedge a percentage of our forecasted international sales, primarily those denominated in Euro. Foreign currency exchange, net of hedges, had a favorable impact of $21.4 million on our 2011 revenues compared to 2010 and an unfavorable impact of $93.7 million on our 2010 revenues compared to 2009. We expect total product sales to continue to grow in 2012 as we expect to realize the full year impact related to our newest product Complera/Eviplera and expect to launch Quad in the United States in September 2012. 66 Table of Contents Product Sales The following table summarizes the period over period changes in our product sales (in thousands): 2011 Change 2010 Change 2009 Antiviral products: Atripla $ 3,224,518 10 % $ 2,926,579 23 % $ 2,382,113 Truvada 2,875,141 8 % 2,649,908 6 % 2,489,682 Viread 737,867 1 % 732,240 10 % 667,510 Hepsera 144,679 (28 )% 200,592 (26 )% 271,595 Complera/Eviplera 38,747 — — — — Emtriva 28,764 4 % 27,679 (1 )% 27,974 Total antiviral products 7,049,716 8 % 6,536,998 12 % 5,838,874 AmBisome 330,156 8 % 305,856 2 % 298,597 Letairis 293,426 22 % 240,279 31 % 183,949 Ranexa 320,004 33 % 239,832 83 % 131,062 Other 109,057 63 % 66,956 298 % 16,829 Total product sales $ 8,102,359 10 % $ 7,389,921 14 % $ 6,469,311 Antiviral Products Antiviral product sales increased by 8% in 2011 compared to 2010 and 12% in 2010 compared to 2009. • Atripla Atripla sales increased by 10% in 2011 compared to 2010, driven primarily by sales growth in Europe and the United States. Atripla sales increased by 23% in 2010 compared to 2009, driven primarily by sales growth in the United States and Europe where we benefited from the launch of Atripla in France in the second quarter of 2009. Atripla sales include the efavirenz component which has a gross margin of zero. The efavirenz portion of our Atripla sales was approximately $1.21 billion, $1.07 billion and $880.7 million in 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively. Atripla sales accounted for 46%, 45% and 41% of our total antiviral product sales for 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively. • Truvada Truvada sales increased by 8% in 2011 compared to 2010, driven primarily by sales growth in Europe and the United States. Truvada sales increased by 6% in 2010 compared to 2009, driven primarily by sales growth in the United States and Europe. Truvada sales accounted for 41%, 41% and 43% of our total antiviral product sales for 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively. • Other Antiviral Products Other antiviral product sales, which include product sales of Viread, Hepsera, Complera/Eviplera and Emtriva, decreased by 1% in 2011 compared to 2010 due primarily to a decrease in Hepsera sales, partially offset by the launch of Complera/Eviplera following its FDA approval in August 2011 and European Commission approval in November 2011. Other antiviral product sales decreased by 1% for 2010 compared to 2009, due primarily to decreases in Hepsera sales, partially offset by sales growth of Viread. AmBisome Sales of AmBisome increased by 8% in 2011 compared to 2010, driven primarily by sales growth in Latin America, Canada and Europe. Sales of AmBisome increased by 2% in 2010 compared to 2009, driven primarily by sales growth in certain markets outside of the United States, partially offset by an unfavorable foreign 67 Table of Contents currency exchange impact. AmBisome product sales in the United States and Canada relate solely to our sales of AmBisome to Astellas Pharma US, Inc. which are recorded at our manufacturing cost. Letairis Sales of Letairis increased by 22% for 2011 compared to 2010 and 31% in 2010 compared to 2009, driven primarily by sales growth. New patient enrollments increased during 2011 following the FDA’s approval in March 2011 to remove liver toxicity language from the Boxed Warning. Ranexa Sales of Ranexa increased by 33% for 2011 compared to 2010 and 83% for 2010 compared to 2009, driven primarily by sales growth. Royalty Revenues The following table summarizes the period over period changes in our royalty revenues (in thousands): 2011 Change 2010 Change 2009 Royalty revenues $ 268,827 -51 % $ 545,970 11 % $ 491,818 Historically, our most significant source of royalty revenues has been from sales of Tamiflu by Roche. We recognize royalties on Tamiflu sales by Roche in the quarter following the quarter in which Tamiflu sales are recognized by Roche. Royalty revenues declined 51% for 2011 compared to 2010, due primarily to lower Tamiflu royalties from Roche. Royalty revenues increased 11% for 2010 compared to 2009, driven primarily by increase in other royalty revenues, which include royalties from GSK for Hepsera, royalties from Astellas US LLC for Lexiscan and royalties from Japan Tobacco for Truvada, partially offset by the lower Tamiflu royalties from Roche. Tamiflu royalties since the second quarter of 2010 have been decreasing due to declining pandemic planning initiatives worldwide. Tamiflu royalties from Roche contributed $75.5 million, $386.5 million and $392.7 million to total royalty revenues in 2011, 2010 and 2009 respectively. Cost of Goods Sold and Product Gross Margin The following table summarizes the period over period changes in our product sales (in thousands), cost of goods sold (in thousands) and product gross margin: 2011 Change 2010 Change 2009 Total product sales $ 8,102,359 10 % $ 7,389,921 14 % $ 6,469,311 Cost of goods sold $ 2,124,410 14 % $ 1,869,876 17 % $ 1,595,558 Product gross margin 74 % 75 % 75 % Our product gross margin for 2011 was 74%, a decrease of 1% compared to 2010, due primarily to an annual selling price adjustment for the percentage share of Atripla that is paid to our partner. Our product gross margin for 2010 was 75%, consistent with our product gross margin for 2009. We expect our product gross margin in 2012 to be lower compared to 2011, due primarily to product mix as we expect a higher proportion of Atripla sales partially offset by an increase in product gross margin related to the full year impact of sales of Complera/Eviplera and the anticipated launch of Quad in September 2012. 68 Table of Contents Research and Development Expenses We manage our R&D expenses by identifying the research and development activities we anticipate will be performed during a given period and then prioritizing efforts based on scientific data, probability of successful development, market potential, available human and capital resources and other similar considerations. We continually review our R&D pipeline and the status of development and, as necessary, reallocate resources among the R&D portfolio that we believe will best support the future growth of our business. The following table summarizes the period over period changes in our R&D expenses (in thousands): 2011 Change 2010 Change 2009 Research and development $ 1,229,151 15 % $ 1,072,930 14 % $ 939,918 R&D expenses summarized above consist primarily of personnel costs, including salaries, benefits and stock-based compensation, clinical studies performed by CROs, materials and supplies, licenses and fees, milestone payments under collaboration arrangements and overhead allocations consisting of various support and facilities-related costs. The following table provides a breakout of R&D expenses by major cost type (in thousands): 2011 2010 2009 Clinical studies and outside services $ 570,302 $ 375,228 $ 413,487 Personnel expenses 412,463 384,488 364,505 Impairment and restructuring charges 26,716 135,800 2,200 Other 219,670 177,414 159,726 Total $ 1,229,151 $ 1,072,930 $ 939,918 R&D expenses for 2011 increased by $156.2 million, or 15%, compared to 2010, due primarily to a $195.1 million increase in clinical studies and outside services related to study progression in liver disease and HIV, new investments in oncology and inflammation and new in-license agreements, milestones and ongoing collaborations, a $28.0 million increase in personnel expenses due to higher headcount, an increase in other expenses including research and process development manufacturing to support clinical studies and the ongoing growth of our business, partially offset by a decrease in impairment charges. R&D expenses in 2010 increased by $133.0 million, or 14%, compared to 2009, due primarily to impairment charges of $136.0 million that we recorded related to IPR&D assets acquired from CV Therapeutics, $23.5 million of clinical studies expenses related to increased HIV research activities and $16.1 million of compensation and benefits expenses. The majority of the impairment charge related to our GS-9667 program, a product candidate that was in Phase 1 clinical studies for the treatment of diabetes and hypertriglyceridemia, which was terminated in the fourth quarter of 2010 due to unfavorable results from pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics tests that demonstrated limited effectiveness of the compound in patients. Given these results, we do not believe it has alternative future uses for us or other market participants. The increase in R&D expenses was partially offset by $37.0 million due to the timing of certain clinical studies and $30.3 million of lower R&D expense reimbursement related to our collaboration with Tibotec. In 2012, we expect R&D expenses to increase over 2011 levels due to continued investment in our internal and collaborative R&D efforts as we anticipate that some of our product candidates will progress into more advanced phases of clinical studies as well as adding more clinical development programs to our pipeline. 69 Table of Contents Selling, General and Administrative Expenses The following table summarizes the period over period changes in our SG&A expenses (in thousands): 2011 Change 2010 Change 2009 Selling, general and administrative $ 1,241,983 19 % $ 1,044,392 10 % $ 946,686 SG&A expenses are comprised primarily of compensation and benefits associated with sales and marketing, finance, human resources, legal and other administrative personnel; facilities and overhead costs; outside marketing, advertising and legal expenses and other general and administrative costs. SG&A expenses in 2011 increased by $197.6 million or 19%, compared to 2010, due primarily to increased contract, legal and other professional services of $86.8 million, pharmaceutical excise tax of $47.3 million resulting from U.S. healthcare reform, increased compensation and benefits expenses of $41.6 million as a result of higher headcount to support our expanding commercial activities, promotional costs of $20.1 million driven by our expanding sales and marketing activities and bad debt provisions of $14.7 million associated with slower collections in southern European countries. SG&A expenses in 2010 increased by $97.7 million or 10%, compared to 2009, due primarily to increased compensation and benefits expenses of $36.3 million as a result of higher headcount to support our expanding commercial activities, increased contract and professional services expenses of $27.3 million driven primarily by our expanding sales and marketing activities and $18.1 million related to facilities and equipment expenses. In 2012, we expect SG&A expenses to increase over 2011 levels due to increased investments supporting the continued growth in all of our franchises and the increase in the U.S. pharmaceutical excise tax. We believe we have the appropriate SG&A infrastructure to support the growth of our business in 2012. Restructuring Expenses During the second quarter of 2010, we approved and communicated a plan to close our research operations in Durham, North Carolina and consolidate our liver disease research activities in Foster City, California. We believe this plan will allow our employees to collaborate more effectively and further advance our programs in the liver disease area. In 2010, we recorded a total of $14.6 million and $10.4 million of restructuring expenses in SG&A and R&D expenses, respectively, related to employee severance and facilities-related expenses under this plan. In December 2010, we closed our operations in Durham. We have not incurred and do not expect to incur any additional significant costs in connection with this plan. During the second quarter of 2009, we approved a plan to realize certain synergies as a result of the CV Therapeutics acquisition by re-aligning our cardiovascular operations and eliminating redundancies. In 2010, we recorded $10.6 million and $3.4 million in restructuring expenses in SG&A and R&D expenses, respectively, related to employee severance, relocation, lease termination costs and other facilities-related expenses. In 2011, we recorded $6.7 million in restructuring expenses in SG&A related to other facilities-related expenses. Total costs incurred under this plan were $43.5 million and $29.1 million in SG&A and R&D expenses, respectively. We have not incurred and do not expect to incur any additional significant costs in connection with this plan. Interest and Other Income, Net We recorded interest and other income, net, of $66.6 million, $60.3 million and $42.4 million in 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively. The increase in interest and other income, net, in 2011 compared to 2010 was driven primarily by a favorable net foreign currency exchange impact and an increase in interest income, partially offset by an increase in costs related to our hedging activities. The increase in interest and other income, net, in 2010 compared to 2009 was driven primarily by decreased costs related to our hedging activities. 70 Table of Contents We expect interest income to decrease in 2012 as we spent cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities to partially fund our Pharmasset acquisition which closed in January 2012. Interest Expense Our interest expense was $205.4 million, $109.0 million and $69.7 million in 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively. The increase in interest expense in 2011 compared to 2010 was due primarily to the issuance of our convertible senior notes for $2.50 billion in July 2010, the issuance of our senior unsecured notes for $1.00 billion in March 2011, the issuance of our senior unsecured notes for $3.70 billion in December 2011 and bridge financing associated with our acquisition of Pharmasset. This 2011 increase was partially offset by the maturity of our convertible senior notes due in May 2011, which had an aggregate principal balance of $650.0 million. The increase in interest expense in 2010 compared to 2009 was due primarily to the issuance of our senior convertible notes for $2.50 billion in July 2010. We expect interest expense to increase in 2012 due to the additional debt we issued in connection with our acquisition of Pharmasset, which included the $3.70 billion in senior unsecured notes issued in December 2011 and $2.15 billion in bank debt we raised subsequent to December 31, 2011. Provision for Income Taxes Our provision for income taxes was $861.9 million, $1.02 billion and $876.4 million in 2011, 2010 and 2009 respectively. The 2011 effective tax rate of 23.6% differed from the U.S. federal statutory rate of 35% due primarily to tax credits and certain operating earnings from non-U.S. subsidiaries that are considered indefinitely invested outside the United States, partially offset by state taxes and the non-deductible pharmaceutical excise tax. We do not provide for U.S. income taxes on undistributed earnings of our foreign operations that are intended to be permanently reinvested. The 2010 effective tax rate of 26.2% differed from the U.S. federal statutory rate of 35% due primarily to tax credits and certain operating earnings from non-U.S. subsidiaries that are considered indefinitely invested outside the United States, partially offset by state taxes. The 2009 effective tax rate of 25.0% differed from the U.S. federal statutory rate of 35% due primarily to tax credits, the resolution of certain tax positions with tax authorities and certain operating earnings from non-U.S. subsidiaries that are considered indefinitely invested outside the United States, partially offset by state taxes and the revaluation of certain state tax assets related to the integration of CV Therapeutics. Liquidity and Capital Resources We believe that our existing capital resources, supplemented by our cash flows generated from operating activities, will be adequate to satisfy our capital needs for the foreseeable future. Our cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities increased significantly in the fourth quarter of 2011 as we issued senior unsecured notes for total net proceeds of $3.67 billion to fund our $11.1 billion acquisition of Pharmasset, which closed in January 2012. Below is additional information describing our cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities, working capital and primary sources and uses of cash. 71 Table of Contents The following table summarizes our cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities, our working capital and our cash flow activities as of the end of, and for each of, the periods presented (in thousands): 2011 2010 2009 As of December 31: Cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities $ 9,963,972 $ 5,318,071 $ 3,904,846 Working capital $ 11,403,995 $ 3,243,132 $ 2,940,927 Year Ended December 31: Cash provided by (used in): Operating activities $ 3,639,010 $ 2,833,913 $ 3,080,054 Investing activities $ 3,589,845 $ (1,937,751 ) $ (2,215,900 ) Financing activities $ 1,763,569 $ (1,338,710 ) $ (1,051,438 ) Cash, Cash Equivalents and Marketable Securities Cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities totaled $9.96 billion at December 31, 2011, an increase of $4.65 billion or 87% from December 31, 2010. This increase was primarily attributable to the issuance of our senior unsecured notes in 2011 for total net proceeds of $4.66 billion and cash provided by operations of $3.64 billion. This increase was partially offset by $2.38 billion used to repurchases of our common stock under our stock repurchase programs, $650.0 million used to repay our convertible senior notes due in May 2011 and $588.6 million used in our recent acquisitions of Arresto and Calistoga. The net proceeds related to our senior unsecured notes issued in December 2011 were used to fund our acquisition of Pharmasset in January 2012. Cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities totaled $5.32 billion at December 31, 2010, an increase of $1.41 billion or 36% from December 31, 2009. This increase was primarily attributable to net cash provided by operations of $2.83 billion and net proceeds of $2.46 billion from the issuance of our convertible senior notes in 2010, partially offset by $4.02 billion used to repurchase our common stock under our stock repurchase programs. Working Capital Working capital was $11.40 billion at December 31, 2011. The increase of $8.16 billion or 251% from working capital as of December 31, 2010 was primarily attributable to: • an increase of $7.80 billion in cash, cash equivalents and short-term marketable securities resulting from the $3.67 billion issuance of senior unsecured notes in December 2011 and sales of long-term marketable securities in anticipation of the acquisition of Pharmasset; and • a decrease of $644.8 million in the current portion of long-term debt and other obligations, net, due primarily to the repayment of our convertible senior notes due in May 2011. Working capital was $3.24 billion at December 31, 2010, an increase of $302.2 million or 10% from working capital as of December 31, 2009. This increase was primarily attributable to: • an increase of $441.7 million in cash, cash equivalents and short-term marketable securities; • an increase of $232.4 million in accounts receivable, net, primarily driven by increased product sales; and • an increase of $152.0 million in inventories, due primarily to the purchase of efavirenz at its estimated net selling price from BMS. 72 Table of Contents This increase was partially offset by an increase of $640.8 million in the current portion of convertible senior notes, net and other long-term obligations, due to the reclassification of our convertible senior notes due in May 2011 to current liabilities. Cash Provided by Operating Activities Cash provided by operating activities of $3.64 billion in 2011 primarily related to net income of $2.79 billion, adjusted for non-cash items such as $302.2 million of depreciation and amortization expenses, $192.4 million of stock-based compensation expenses, $64.1 million of deferred income taxes and $220.3 million of net cash inflow related to changes in operating assets and liabilities. This was partially offset by $40.8 million of excess tax benefits from stock option exercises which we reclassified to cash used in financing activities. Cash provided by operating activities of $2.83 billion in 2010 primarily related to net income of $2.89 billion, adjusted for non-cash items such as $265.5 million of depreciation and amortization expenses, $200.0 million of stock-based compensation expenses, $136.0 million of IPR&D impairment expenses and $82.1 million of tax benefits from employee stock plans, partially offset by $680.4 million of net cash outflow related to changes in operating assets and liabilities and $81.6 million of excess tax benefits from stock option exercises which we reclassified to cash used in financing activities. Cash provided by operating activities of $3.08 billion in 2009 primarily related to net income of $2.63 billion, adjusted for non-cash items such as $180.7 million of stock-based compensation expenses and $148.4 million of amortization expenses. Cash Provided by (Used in) Investing Activities Cash provided by investing activities in 2011 was $3.59 billion, consisting of a net proceeds of $4.31 billion related to the sales of marketable securities in connection with our acquisition of Pharmasset, partially offset by $588.6 million used in our acquisitions of Arresto and Calistoga and $131.9 million of capital expenditures. Cash used in investing activities in 2010 was $1.94 billion, driven by a net use of $1.78 billion in purchases of marketable securities, $91.0 million used in our acquisition of CGI and $61.9 million of capital expenditures. Cash used in investing activities in 2009 was $2.22 billion, driven by cash used for our acquisition of CV Therapeutics of $1.25 billion (net of cash acquired), a net use of $738.0 million in purchases of marketable securities and $230.1 million of capital expenditures for the year. Capital expenditures in 2009 included the purchase of an office building and approximately 30 acres of land located in Foster City, California. Cash Provided by (Used in) Financing Activities Cash provided by financing activities in 2011 was $1.76 billion, driven primarily by the issuance of $4.66 billion in senior unsecured notes, of which $3.67 billion was raised in December 2011 to partially fund the Pharmasset acquisition, net of issuance costs and $211.7 million in proceeds from issuances of common stock under our employee stock plans. The cash proceeds were partially offset by $2.38 billion used to repurchase our common stock under our stock repurchase programs, including commissions and $650.0 million used to repay our convertible senior notes due in May 2011. Cash used in financing activities in 2010 was $1.34 billion, driven primarily by the $4.02 billion used to repurchase our common stock under our stock repurchase programs and $362.6 million used to purchase note hedges related to our convertible senior notes due in May 2014 and May 2016. The cash outflows were partially offset by $2.46 billion in net proceeds from the issuance of such notes, $155.4 million in proceeds from the sale of warrants related to such notes and $221.2 million in proceeds from issuances of common stock under our employee stock plans. 73 Table of Contents Cash used in financing activities in 2009 was $1.05 billion, driven primarily by the $998.5 million used to repurchase our common stock under our stock repurchase program and the $305.5 million used to extinguish the convertible senior notes assumed from the acquisition of CV Therapeutics. The cash outflows were partially offset by proceeds of $222.7 million from issuances of common stock under our employee stock plans. During 2011, we completed our May 2010, three-year, $5.00 billion stock repurchase program at which time we initiated purchases under our January 2011, three-year, $5.00 billion stock repurchase program. Under the completed program, we repurchased and retired a total of 135.5 million shares of our common stock at an average purchase price of $36.89 per share. As of December 31, 2011, the remaining authorized amount of stock repurchases that may be made under the repurchase program was $4.60 billion. Long-Term Debt We were eligible to borrow up to an aggregate of $1.25 billion in revolving credit loans under an amended and restated credit agreement. The credit agreement also included a sub-facility for swing-line loans and letters of credit. As of December 31, 2011, we had $4.0 million in letters of credit outstanding under the $1.25 billion credit agreement. In January 2012, we fully repaid the outstanding obligations under this credit agreement, at which time this credit agreement was terminated. On January 12, 2012, in conjunction with our acquisition of Pharmasset, we entered into a five-year $1.25 billion revolving credit facility credit agreement (the Five-Year Revolving Credit Agreement), a $750.0 million short-term revolving credit facility credit agreement (the Short-Term Revolving Credit Agreement) and a $1.00 billion Term Loan Facility (the Term Loan Credit Agreement). We borrowed an aggregate principal amount of $2.15 billion as follows: $750.0 million under the Five-Year Revolving Credit Agreement, $400.0 million under the Short-Term Revolving Credit Agreement and $1.00 billion under the Term Loan Credit Agreement, upon the close of the acquisition. All three credit agreements contain customary representations, warranties, affirmative, negative and financial maintenance covenants and events of default. These loans will bear interest at either (i) the Eurodollar Rate plus the Applicable Margin or (ii) the Base Rate plus the Applicable Margin, each as defined in the applicable credit agreement. We may reduce the commitments and may prepay loans under any of these agreements in whole or in part at any time without premium or penalty. The Five-Year Revolving Credit Agreement was inclusive of a $30.0 million swing line loan sub-facility and a $25.0 million letter of credit sub-facility. The Five-Year Revolving Credit Agreement will terminate and all amounts owing thereunder shall be due and payable on January 12, 2017. The Short-Term Revolving Credit Agreement will terminate and all amounts owing thereunder shall be due and payable on January 10, 2013; however, we may request that the maturity date be extended until January 9, 2014. All principal repayment installments under the Term Loan Credit Agreement will be due and payable as specified in the Term Loan Credit Agreement, with the final principal installment payment due and payable on January 12, 2015. In December 2011, we issued senior unsecured notes in a registered offering for an aggregate principal amount of $3.70 billion to partially fund our acquisition of Pharmasset. The notes will pay interest at fixed annual rates ranging from 2.40% to 5.65%. Our convertible senior notes due in May 2011 matured and we repaid the aggregate principal balance of $650.0 million. We also paid $36.1 million in cash related to the conversion spread of our matured notes, which represent the conversion value in excess of the principal amount, and received $36.1 million in cash from the related convertible note hedges. Warrants related to our convertible senior notes due in May 2011 expired in August 2011. 74 Table of Contents In March 2011, we issued senior unsecured notes due in April 2021 in a registered offering for an aggregate principal amount of $1.00 billion. The notes will pay interest at a fixed annual rate of 4.50%. We believe that our existing capital resources, supplemented by cash generated from our operations, will be adequate to satisfy our capital needs for the foreseeable future. Our future capital requirements will depend on many factors, including but not limited to the following: • the commercial performance of our current and future products; • the progress and scope of our R&D efforts, including preclinical studies and clinical trials; • the cost, timing and outcome of regulatory reviews; • the expansion of our sales and marketing capabilities; • administrative expenses; • the possibility of acquiring additional manufacturing capabilities or office facilities; • the possibility of acquiring other companies or new products; • the establishment of additional collaborative relationships with other companies; and • costs associated with the defense, settlement and adverse results of litigation and government investigations. We may in the future require additional funding, which could be in the form of proceeds from equity or debt financings. If such funding is required, we cannot assure that it will be available to us on favorable terms, if at all. Off Balance Sheet Arrangements We do not have any off balance sheet arrangements. Contractual Obligations Our contractual obligations consist of debt obligations, operating leases, capital commitments, purchase obligations for active pharmaceutical ingredients and inventory-related items and clinical trials contracts. The following table summarizes our significant enforceable and legally binding obligations, future commitments and obligations related to all contracts that we are likely to continue regardless of the fact that certain of these obligations may be cancelable as of December 31, 2011 (in thousands): Payments due by Period Contractual Obligations Total Less than oneyear 1-3 years 3-5 years More than 5years Long-term debt (1) $ 10,811,866 $ 232,724 $ 3,102,973 $ 2,336,169 $ 5,140,000 Operating lease obligations 204,954 43,635 66,329 41,775 53,215 Capital commitments (2) 16,556 16,556 — — — Purchase obligations (3)(4) 1,317,922 990,151 202,471 125,300 — Clinical trials (5) 191,043 124,473 64,872 1,698 — Total $ 12,542,341 $ 1,407,539 $ 3,436,645 $ 2,504,942 $ 5,193,215 (1) Long-term debt obligations include future interest payments based on fixed rates of 0.625%, 1.00% and 1.625% for our convertible senior notes due in May 2013, May 2014 and May 2016, respectively. Long-term debt obligations also include future interest payments based on fixed rates of 2.40%, 3.05%, 4.50% 4.40% and 5.65% for our senior unsecured notes due in December 2014, December 2016, April 2021, December 2021 and December 2041, respectively. At December 31, 2011, the aggregate carrying values of our convertible notes and senior unsecured notes were $2.92 billion and $4.68 billion, respectively. 75 Table of Contents (2) At December 31, 2011, we had firm capital project commitments of approximately $16.6 million primarily relating to facilities improvement projects. (3) At December 31, 2011, we had firm purchase commitments related to active pharmaceutical ingredients and certain inventory-related items. These amounts include minimum purchase requirements and actual purchases are expected to significantly exceed these amounts. (4) In addition to the above, we have committed to make potential future milestone payments to third parties as part of licensing, collaboration and development arrangements. Payments under these agreements generally become due and payable only upon achievement of certain developmental, regulatory and/or commercial milestones. Because the achievement of these milestones is neither probable nor reasonably estimable, such contingencies have not been recorded on our Consolidated Balance Sheets and have not been included in the table above. (5) At December 31, 2011, we had several clinical studies in various clinical trial phases. Our most significant clinical trial expenditures are to CROs. Although all of our material contracts with CROs are cancelable, we historically have not cancelled such contracts. These amounts reflect commitments based on existing contracts and do not reflect any future modifications to, or terminations of, existing contracts or anticipated or potential new contracts. We had total gross unrecognized tax benefit liabilities of $170.6 million as of December 31, 2011. We believe that it is reasonably possible that our unrecognized tax benefits will not significantly change in the next 12 months as we do not expect to have clarification from the IRS and other tax authorities around any of our uncertain tax positions. The unrecognized tax benefits were included in long-term income taxes payable and non-current deferred tax assets on our Consolidated Balance Sheet and have not been included in the table above. Recent Accounting Pronouncements In May 2011, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued amendments to its existing standard for fair value measurement to achieve common guidance between U.S. generally accepted accounting principles and International Financial Reporting Standards. In addition, the amended standard revises certain requirements for measuring fair value and for disclosure around fair value measurement. It does not require additional fair value measurements and was not intended to establish valuation standards or affect valuation practices outside of financial reporting. The updated standard is effective for us beginning in the first quarter of 2012. Early adoption is not permitted. The adoption of these amendments will not have a material impact on our Consolidated Financial Statements. In June 2011, the FASB issued an update to an existing standard for comprehensive income to make the presentation of items within other comprehensive income (OCI) more prominent. The updated standard prohibits the current presentation of OCI in the statement of stockholders’ equity and instead, provides public companies the option of presenting OCI in a continuous statement of comprehensive income or as two separate consecutive statements. Additionally, the update requires that reclassification adjustments be displayed on the face of the financial statements where OCI is reported. In December 2011, the FASB issued another update that indefinitely deferred the specific requirement of presenting reclassification adjustments out of OCI in both net income and OCI on the face of the financial statements. During the deferral period, the existing requirements for the presentation of reclassification adjustments must continue to be followed. The updated standard is effective for us beginning in the first quarter of 2012. Upon adoption, the updated standard will impact the presentation of our Consolidated Financial Statements; however, it will have no impact on our financial position or results of operations. In September 2011, the FASB issued new accounting guidance intended to simplify goodwill impairment testing. Entities will be allowed to perform a qualitative assessment on goodwill impairment to determine whether a quantitative assessment is necessary. This guidance is effective for goodwill impairment tests performed in interim and annual periods for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2011. The standard is effective for us beginning in the first quarter of 2012. The adoption of this guidance will not have a material impact on our Consolidated Financial Statements. 76 Table of Contents In December 2011, the FASB issued a new standard to address the disclosure requirements around offsetting financial and derivative instruments and their related arrangements to enable users of financial statements to understand the effect of those arrangements on a company’s financial position. The update requires companies to disclose both the net and gross amounts of the relevant assets and liabilities that are offset in the notes to the financial statements. The updated standard is effective for us beginning in the first quarter of 2013 and will be applied retrospectively for all comparative periods presented. We believe that the adoption of this standard will not have a material impact on our Consolidated Financial Statements. 77 Table of Contents ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK Foreign Currency Exchange Risk Our operations include manufacturing and sales activities in the United States, Canada and Ireland as well as sales activities in countries outside the United States, including Europe and Asia Pacific. As a result, our financial results could be significantly affected by factors such as changes in foreign currency exchange rates or weak economic conditions in the foreign markets in which we distribute our products. Our operating results are exposed to changes in foreign currency exchange rates between the U.S. dollar and various foreign currencies, the most significant of which is the Euro. When the U.S. dollar strengthens against these currencies, the relative value of sales made in the respective foreign currency decreases. Conversely, when the U.S. dollar weakens against these currencies, the relative amounts of such sales increase. Overall, we are a net receiver of foreign currencies and, therefore, benefit from a weaker U.S. dollar and are adversely affected by a stronger U.S. dollar relative to those foreign currencies in which we transact significant amounts of business. A significant percentage of our product sales are denominated in foreign currencies. We enter into foreign currency exchange forward and option contracts to partially mitigate the impact of changes in currency exchange rates on net cash flows from our foreign currency denominated sales. We also hedge certain monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies, which reduces but does not eliminate our exposure to currency fluctuations between the date a transaction is recorded and the date that cash is collected or paid. In general, the market risks of these contracts are offset by corresponding gains and losses on the transactions being hedged. The following table summarizes the notional amounts, weighted-average currency exchange rates and fair values of our open foreign currency exchange forward contracts at December 31, 2011. We had no foreign currency exchange option contracts outstanding at December 31, 2011. All contracts have maturities of 18 months or less. Weighted-average rates are stated in terms of the amount of U.S. dollars per foreign currency. Fair values represent estimated settlement amounts at December 31, 2011 and 2010 (notional amounts and fair values in U.S. dollars and in thousands): Foreign Currency Exchange Forward Contracts December 31, 2011 December 31, 2010 Currency NotionalAmount Weighted-AverageSettlement Price Fair Value NotionalAmount Weighted-AverageSettlement Price Fair Value Euro $ 3,205,266 1.34 $ 86,942 $ 2,763,277 1.33 $ 43,854 British Pound 305,314 1.57 4,030 313,380 1.55 2,133 Canadian Dollar 179,785 0.99 1,904 183,276 0.97 (5,669 ) Australian Dollar 129,025 0.98 (3,356 ) 112,145 0.95 (8,494 ) Swiss Franc 110,161 1.10 2,532 82,765 0.99 (4,935 ) Danish Krone 1,520 0.16 (170 ) 29,532 0.18 690 Swedish Krone 31,738 0.15 531 30,266 0.14 (881 ) Norwegian Krone 17,898 0.17 428 18,871 0.17 (272 ) New Zealand Dollar 9,304 0.75 (217 ) 10,035 0.74 (507 ) Turkish Lira 10,539 0.52 (7 ) 10,539 0.64 (11 ) Polish Zloty 25,532 0.32 2,148 435 0.33 (0 ) Total $ 4,026,082 $ 94,765 $ 3,554,521 $ 25,908 78 Table of Contents Interest Rate Risk Our portfolio of available-for-sale marketable securities and our fixed and variable rate liabilities create an exposure to interest rate risk. With respect to our investment portfolio, we adhere to an investment policy that requires us to limit amounts invested in securities based on credit rating, maturity, industry group and investment type and issuer, except for securities issued by the U.S. government. The goals of our investment policy, in order of priority, are as follows: • safety and preservation of principal and diversification of risk; • liquidity of investments sufficient to meet cash flow requirements; and • competitive after-tax rate of return. The following table summarizes the expected maturities and average interest rates of our interest-generating assets and interest-bearing liabilities at December 31, 2011 (dollars in thousands): Total FairValue atDecember 31,2011 Years Ending December 31, 2012 2013 2014 2015 2016 Thereafter Total Assets Available-for-sale debt securities $ 1,574,140 $ 26,100 $ — $ — $ — $ 51,500 $ 1,651,740 $ 1,616,664 Average interest rate 1.2 % 101.2 % 0.0 % 0.0 % 0.0 % 0.8 % Liabilities Long-term debt (1) $ — $ 649,867 $ 2,000,000 $ — $ 1,950,000 $ 3,250,000 $ 7,849,867 $ 8,522,542 Average interest rate 0.0 % 0.6 % 1.5 % 0.0 % 2.1 % 4.8 % (1) In April 2006, we issued convertible senior notes due in May 2013 in a private placement pursuant to Rule 144A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended. The notes were issued at par and bear interest rates of 0.625%, and may be converted into shares of our common stock subject to certain circumstances. In July 2010, we issued convertible senior notes due in May 2014 and May 2016 in a private placement pursuant to Rule 144A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended. The notes due in May 2014 and May 2016 were issued at par and bear interest rates of 1.00% and 1.625%, respectively, and may be converted into shares of our common stock subject to certain circumstances. In March 2011, we issued senior unsecured notes due in April 2021 in a registered offering. The notes pay interest at a fixed annual rate of 4.50%. In December 2011, we issued senior unsecured notes due in December 2014, 2016, 2021 and 2041 in a registered offering. The notes pay interest at fixed annual rates ranging from 2.40% to 5.65%. In connection with funding our $11.1 billion acquisition of Pharmasset, we liquidated approximately $4.34 billion of our investment portfolio in late 2011. The proceeds of the sales were reinvested in money market funds which totaled $7.46 billion as of December 31, 2011. As interest rate risk for money market funds is low, we have excluded the balance from the table of interest rate sensitive instruments above. We continue to invest our existing portfolio in securities with a similar profile, however, the amounts invested are generally smaller and have a shorter investment horizon. Credit Risk As of December 31, 2011, we held approximately $47.0 million of auction rate securities within our available-for-sale long-term marketable securities. Our auction rate securities comprised less than 1% of our total 79 Table of Contents cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities as of December 31, 2011. In 2008, we began observing the failed auctions for our auction rate securities for which the underlying assets are comprised of student loans. Most of our auction rate securities, including those subject to the failed auctions, are currently rated AAA, consistent with the high quality rating required by our investment policy, are supported by the federal government as part of the Federal Family Education Loan Program and are over-collateralized. Our auction rate securities reset every seven to 14 days with maturity dates ranging from 2025 through 2040 and have annual interest rates ranging from 0.18% to 0.80%. As of December 31, 2011, our auction rate securities continued to earn interest. If auctions continue to fail for securities in which we have invested, we may be unable to liquidate some or all of our auction rate securities at par should we need or desire to access the funds invested in those securities. However, based on our expected operating cash flows as well as access to funds through our credit facility, we believe that we will be able to hold these securities until there is a recovery in the auction market and the related securities, which may be at final maturity. As a result, we do not anticipate that the current illiquidity of these auction rate securities will have a material effect on our cash requirements or working capital. As of December 31, 2011, we held Greek government-issued bonds with an estimated fair value of approximately $24.7 million within our available-for-sale long-term marketable securities. In 2010, the Greek government agreed to settle the majority of its aged outstanding accounts receivable with zero-coupon bonds. Currently, these bonds trade infrequently on the open market at a substantial discount to the face value. We believe we will be able to hold these securities until maturity. As a result, we do not anticipate that the illiquidity of these securities will have a material effect on our cash requirements or working capital. In light of the volatility and developments that we have seen in the financial markets, we continue to review our cash equivalents and marketable securities carefully and strive to invest prudently. We believe that maintaining the primary goals of our investment policy, safety and preservation of principal and diversification of risk, as well as liquidity, has helped protect us from many of the risks in the credit markets while allowing us to continue to meet our operating cash flow requirements as well as execute on other strategic opportunities. We are also subject to credit risk from our accounts receivable related to our product sales. Our accounts receivable balance at December 31, 2011 was $1.95 billion, compared to $1.62 billion at December 31, 2010. The majority of our trade accounts receivable arises from product sales in the United States and Europe. As of December 31, 2011, our accounts receivables in Southern Europe, specifically Greece, Italy, Portugal and Spain totaled approximately $1.10 billion, of which $612.4 million were greater than 120 days past due and $250.7 million were greater than 365 days past due.",2023-12-30 19:04:29.530396
