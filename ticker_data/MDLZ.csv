1103982,MDLZ,"Mondelez International, Inc.",2019,"Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.The following discussion and analysis contains forward-looking statements. It should be read in conjunction with the other sections of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, including the consolidated financial statements and related notes contained in Forward-Looking Statements and Item 1A, Risk Factors.Description of the CompanyWe make and sell primarily snacks, including biscuits (cookies, crackers and salted snacks), chocolate, gum & candy as well as various cheese & grocery and powdered beverage products. We have operations in more than 80 countries and sell our products in over 150 countries.We aim to be the global leader in snacking. Our strategy is to drive long-term growth by focusing on three strategic priorities: accelerating consumer-centric growth, driving operational excellence and creating a winning growth culture. We believe the successful implementation of our strategic priorities and our leveraging our strong foundation of iconic global and local brands, an attractive global footprint, and deep innovation, marketing and distribution capabilities will drive top- and bottom-line growth, enabling us to continue to create long-term value for our shareholders.Significant Items Affecting ComparabilityKeurig Dr Pepper TransactionOn July 9, 2018, Keurig Green Mountain, Inc. (""Keurig"") closed on its definitive merger agreement with Dr Pepper Snapple Group, Inc., and formed Keurig Dr Pepper Inc. (NYSE: ""KDP""), a publicly traded company. Following the close of the transaction, our 24.2% investment in Keurig together with our shareholder loan receivable became a 13.8% investment in KDP. During the third quarter of 2018, we recorded a preliminary pre-tax gain of $757 million reported as a gain on equity method transaction and $184 million of deferred tax expense reported in the provision for income taxes (or $573 million after-tax gain) related to the change in our ownership interest while KDP finalized the valuation for the transaction. During our fourth quarter of 2018, KDP finalized its opening balance sheet and we increased our pre-tax gain by $21 million (or $13 million after tax) to $778 million (or $586 million after tax) for 2018. We hold two director positions on the KDP board as well as additional governance rights. As we continue to have significant influence, we continue to account for our investment in KDP under the equity method, resulting in recognizing our share of their earnings within our earnings and our share of their dividends within our cash flows. In connection with this transaction, we changed our accounting principle to reflect our share of Keurig's historical and KDP's ongoing earnings on a one-quarter lag basis while we continue to record dividends when cash is received. We determined a lag was preferable as it enables us to continue to report our quarterly and annual results on a timely basis and to record our share of KDP’s ongoing results once KDP has publicly reported its results. This change in accounting principle was applied retrospectively to all periods. While our operating income did not change, equity method investment net earnings, net earnings and earnings per share have been adjusted to reflect the lag across all reported periods. Refer to Note 6, Equity Method Investments, for additional information.U.S. Tax ReformOn December 22, 2017, the United States enacted tax reform legislation (""U.S. tax reform"") that included a broad range of business tax provisions, including but not limited to a reduction in the U.S. federal tax rate from 35% to 21% as well as provisions that limit or eliminate various deductions or credits. The legislation also causes U.S. allocated expenses (e.g. interest and general administrative expenses) to be taxed and imposes a new tax on U.S. cross-border payments. Furthermore, the legislation includes a one-time transition tax on accumulated foreign earnings and profits. While clarifying guidance was issued by the Internal Revenue Service (“IRS”) during 2018, further tax guidance is expected during 2019.Certain impacts of the new legislation would have generally required accounting to be completed and incorporated into our 2017 year-end financial statements, however in response to the complexities of this new legislation, the SEC issued guidance to provide companies with relief. The SEC provided up to a one-year window for companies to finalize the accounting for the impacts of this new legislation. We finalized our accounting for the new provisions during the fourth quarter of 2018.26Table of ContentsThe 2018 impact from finalizing the accounting for the new provisions was a discrete net tax expense of $19 million. The $19 million expense in 2018 is primarily comprised of a $60 million expense related to finalizing the changes in our indefinite reinvestment assertion, partially offset by a $38 million decrease to the transition tax estimated as of December 31, 2017. Refer to Note 15, Income Taxes, for more information on the impact of U.S. tax reform.Multiemployer Pension Plan WithdrawalIn the United States, we contribute to multiemployer pension plans based on obligations arising from our collective bargaining agreements. In 2017 and 2016, the only individually significant multiemployer plan we contributed to was the Bakery and Confectionery Union and Industry International Pension Fund (the “Fund”). Our obligation to contribute to the Fund arose with respect to 8 collective bargaining agreements covering most of our employees represented by the Bakery, Confectionery, Tobacco and Grain Millers Union (""BCTGM""). All of those collective bargaining agreements expired in 2016. In the fourth quarter of 2018, we executed a complete withdrawal from the Fund. We estimated a withdrawal liability of $573 million, which represents our best estimate of the withdrawal liability absent an assessment from the Fund. We anticipate receiving an assessment in 2019, and the ultimate withdrawal liability may change from the currently estimated amount. We will record any future adjustments in the period during which the liability is confirmed or as new information becomes available. We expect to pay the liability over a period of 20 years from the date of the assessment. During 2018, within our North America segment, we recorded a discounted liability and related charge of $423 million or $316 million net of tax. We determined the net present value of the liability using a risk-free interest rate. We recorded the pre-tax non-cash charges in selling, general and administrative expense (and in other non-cash items, net in the consolidated statement of cash flows) and the liability in long-term other liabilities. During 2018, we also recorded $6 million of accreted interest related to the long-term liability within interest and other expense, net.Malware IncidentOn June 27, 2017, a global malware incident impacted our business. The malware affected a significant portion of our global sales, distribution and financial networks. In the last four days of the second quarter and during the third quarter of 2017, we executed business continuity and contingency plans to contain the impact, minimize damages and restore our systems environment. To date, we have not found, nor do we expect to find, any instances of Company or personal data released externally. We have also restored our main operating systems and processes and enhanced our system security.For the second quarter of 2017, we estimated that the malware incident had a negative impact of 2.3% on our net revenue growth and 2.4% on our Organic Net Revenue growth and we also incurred incremental expenses of $7 million as a result of the incident. We recognized the majority of delayed second quarter shipments in our third quarter 2017 results, although we permanently lost some revenue. On a 2017 full-year basis, we estimated the loss of revenue had a negative impact of 0.4% on our net revenue and Organic Net Revenue growth. We also incurred total incremental expenses of $84 million predominantly during the second half of 2017 as part of the recovery effort. The recovery from the incident was largely resolved by December 31, 2017 and we continued efforts to strengthen our security measures and enhance general information technology, business process and disclosure controls.27Table of ContentsSummary of Results •Net revenues were approximately $25.9 billion in both 2018 and 2017, an increase of 0.2% in 2018 and a decrease of 0.1% in 2017. In 2018, net revenues grew due to higher net pricing and favorable volume/mix. Net revenues were also positively affected by the acquisition of a U.S. premium biscuit company, Tate's Bake Shop, in 2018. Net revenue growth was negatively affected by the impact of unfavorable currency translation and the impact of several business divestitures that occurred in 2017 which reduced net revenues in 2018 as compared to the prior year. In 2017, net revenues declined driven by several business divestitures that occurred during the year, partially offset by favorable currency translation and the impact of a biscuit acquisition in 2016.•Organic Net Revenue increased 2.4% to $26.2 billion in 2018 and increased 0.9% to $25.5 billion in 2017. In 2018, Organic Net Revenue increased as a result of higher net pricing and favorable volume/mix. In 2017, Organic Net Revenue increased as a result of higher net pricing partially offset by unfavorable volume/mix. Organic Net Revenue is on a constant currency basis and excludes revenue from divestitures and acquisitions. We use Organic Net Revenue as it provides improved year-over-year comparability of our underlying operating results (see the definition of Organic Net Revenue and our reconciliation with net revenues within Non-GAAP Financial Measures appearing later in this section).•Diluted EPS attributable to Mondelēz International increased 23.2% to $2.28 in 2018 and increased 77.9% to $1.85 in 2017. Diluted EPS increased in 2018 primarily driven by the after-tax gain on the KDP transaction, favorable year-over-year change in mark-to-market impacts from currency and commodity derivatives, operating gains, lower costs incurred for the Simplify to Grow Program, lower shares outstanding, increased equity method investment earnings and lower taxes, partially offset by the impact from pension participation changes, lapping the benefit from the resolution of tax matters and lapping a prior-year net gain on divestitures. Diluted EPS increased in 2017 as prior-year refinancing and higher restructuring activities drove lower interest and overhead costs in 2017. We also recorded benefits from resolving two local indirect tax matters and gains from divesting non-core businesses during 2017. See our Discussion and Analysis of Historical Results appearing later in this section for further details.•Adjusted EPS increased 13.6% to $2.43 in 2018 and increased 16.3% to $2.14 in 2017. On a constant currency basis, Adjusted EPS increased 15.0% to $2.46 in 2018 and increased 15.8% to $2.13 in 2017. For 2018, operating gains, lower shares outstanding, increased equity method investment earnings, lower taxes and lower interest drove the Adjusted EPS growth. For 2017, operating gains, lower interest expense, increased equity method investment earnings and lower shares outstanding were the significant drivers of Adjusted EPS growth. Adjusted EPS and Adjusted EPS on a constant currency basis are non-GAAP financial measures. We use these measures as they provide improved year-over-year comparability of our underlying results (see the definition of Adjusted EPS and our reconciliation with diluted EPS within Non-GAAP Financial Measures appearing later in this section).28Table of ContentsFinancial OutlookWe seek to achieve profitable, long-term growth and manage our business to attain this goal using our key operating metrics: Organic Net Revenue, Adjusted Operating Income and Adjusted EPS. We use these non-GAAP financial metrics and related computations, particularly growth in profit dollars, to evaluate and manage our business and to plan and make near-and long-term operating and strategic decisions. As such, we believe these metrics are useful to investors as they provide supplemental information in addition to our U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (“U.S. GAAP”) financial results. We believe it is useful to provide investors with the same financial information that we use internally to make comparisons of our historical operating results, identify trends in our underlying operating results and evaluate our business. We believe our non-GAAP financial measures should always be considered in relation to our GAAP results. We have provided reconciliations between our GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures in Non-GAAP Financial Measures, which appears later in this section.In addition to monitoring our key operating metrics, we monitor a number of developments and trends that could impact our revenue and profitability objectives.Long-Term Demographics and Consumer Trends – Snack food consumption is highly correlated to GDP growth, urbanization of populations and rising discretionary income levels associated with a growing middle class, particularly in emerging markets. Over the long term, we expect these trends to continue leading to growth in consumer behaviors such as more frequent, smaller meals, snacking and greater use of convenience foods. We also recognize changing consumer trends such as the increased emphasis on well-being, time compression and wide participation across an evolving retail and digital landscape. To position ourselves for long-term growth, we are investing in our well-being and other snack offerings, product and marketing innovation and new routes to market including e-commerce.Demand – We monitor consumer spending and our market share within the food and beverage categories in which we sell our products. In recent years, low GDP growth, economic recessionary pressures, weak consumer confidence, a historically strong U.S. dollar and changing consumer trends have slowed category growth. We have begun to see improvements in global economic growth and consumer confidence, however, there are still geopolitical and economic uncertainties that may affect category growth, Growth in our global snacking categories improved this year to approximately 2.7% in 2018, from 2.1% in 2017 and 2.3% in 2016. As part of our new strategic plan, we seek to drive category growth through leveraging our local-first commercial approach, making additional investments in our brand and snacks portfolio, building strong routes to market in both emerging and developed markets and improving our position across multiple channels. We believe these actions will help drive demand in our categories and strengthen our positions across markets.Volatility of Global Markets – Our growth strategy depends in part on our ability to expand our operations, particularly in emerging markets. Some emerging markets have greater political, economic and currency volatility and greater vulnerability to infrastructure and labor disruptions. Volatility in these markets affects demand for and the costs of our products and requires frequent changes in how we operate our business. See below for a discussion of Brexit and Argentina, which was designated a highly inflationary economy in 2018. In addition, the imposition of increased or new tariffs, quotas, trade barriers or similar restrictions on our sales or key commodities and potential changes in U.S. trade programs, trade relations, regulations, taxes or fiscal policies might negatively affect our sales or profitability. To help mitigate adverse effects of ongoing volatility across markets, we aim to protect profitability through the management of costs (including hedging) and pricing as well as invest in our brands and new routes to market.Competition – We operate in highly competitive markets that include global, regional and local competitors. Our advantaged geographic footprint, operating scale and portfolio of brands have all significantly contributed to building our market-leading positions across most of the product categories in which we sell. To grow and maintain our market positions, we focus on meeting consumer needs and preferences through a local-first commercial focus, new digital and other sales and marketing initiatives, agile product innovation and high standards of product quality. We also continue to optimize our manufacturing and other operations and invest in our brands through ongoing research and development, advertising, marketing and consumer promotions.Pricing – Our net revenue growth and profitability may be affected as we adjust prices to address new conditions. We adjust our product prices based on a number of variables including demand, the competitive environment and changes in our product input costs. We generally have increased prices in response to higher commodity costs, currency and other market factors. In 2019, we anticipate changing market conditions to continue to impact pricing. 29Table of ContentsPrice changes may affect net revenues or market share in the near term as the market adjusts to changes in input costs and other market conditions.Operating Costs – Our operating costs include raw materials, labor, selling, general and administrative expenses, taxes, currency impacts and financing costs. We manage these costs through cost saving and productivity initiatives, sourcing and hedging programs, pricing actions, refinancing and tax planning. To remain competitive on our operating structure, we continue to work on programs to expand our profitability, such as our Simplify to Grow Program, which is designed to bring about significant reductions in our operating cost structure in both our supply chain and overhead costs. Multiemployer pension plan – In 2018, we executed a complete withdrawal from the Fund. We estimated a withdrawal liability of $573 million, which represents our best estimate of the withdrawal liability absent an assessment from the Fund. We anticipate receiving an assessment in 2019, and the ultimate withdrawal liability may change from the currently estimated amount. We will record any future adjustments in the period during which the liability is confirmed or as new information becomes available. We expect to pay the liability over a period of 20 years from the date of the assessment. During 2018, within our North America segment, we recorded a discounted liability and related charge of $423 million or $316 million net of tax. Taxes – In December 2017, the United States enacted U.S. tax reform. The legislation implements many new U.S. domestic and international tax provisions. A year after enactment, some aspects of U.S. tax reform still remain unclear, and although additional clarifying guidance has been issued (by the IRS, and the U.S. Treasury Department), there are still some areas that may not be clarified for some time. Also, a number of U.S. states have not yet updated their laws to take into account the new federal legislation. As a result, there may be further impact of the new laws on our future results of operations and financial condition. It is possible that U.S. tax reform, or interpretations under it, could change and could have an adverse effect on us, and such effect could be material.Currency – As a global company with 75.3% of our net revenues generated outside the United States, we are continually exposed to changes in global economic conditions and currency movements. While we hedge significant forecasted currency exchange transactions as well as currency translation impacts from certain net assets of our non-U.S. operations, including the United Kingdom, we cannot fully predict or eliminate all adverse impacts arising from changes in currency exchange rates on our consolidated financial results. To partially offset currency translation impacts arising from our overseas operations, we enter into net investment hedges primarily in the form of local currency-denominated debt and cross-currency swaps and other financial instruments. While we work to mitigate our exposure to currency risks, factors such as continued global and local market volatility, actions by foreign governments, political uncertainty, limited hedging opportunities and other factors could lead to unfavorable currency impacts in the future and could adversely affect our results of operations or financial position. See additional discussion of Brexit and Argentina below and refer also to Note 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies – Currency Translation and Highly Inflationary Accounting, and Note 9, Financial Instruments, for additional information on how we manage currency and related risks. As currency movements can make comparison of year-over-year operating performance challenging, we isolate the impact of currency and also report growth on a constant currency basis, holding prior-year currency exchange rates constant, so that prior-year and current-year results can be compared on a consistent basis.Brexit – We continue to monitor Brexit and take protective measures in response to the potential impacts on our results of operations and financial condition. Our exposure to disruptions to our supply chain, the imposition of tariffs and currency devaluation in the United Kingdom could result in a material impact to our consolidated revenue, earnings and cash flow. In 2018, we generated 8.6% of our net revenues in the United Kingdom and our supply chain in this market relies on imports of raw and packaging materials as well as finished goods. Following the Brexit vote in June 2016, there was significant volatility in the global stock markets and currency exchange rates. The value of the British pound sterling relative to the U.S. dollar declined significantly and negatively affected our translated results reported in U.S. dollars. The volatility in foreign currencies is expected to continue as the United Kingdom executes its exit from the European Union. If the U.K.'s membership in the European Union terminates in March 2019 without an agreement (“hard Brexit”), there could be increased costs from re-imposition of tariffs on trade between the United Kingdom and European Union, shipping delays because of the need for customs inspections and procedures and shortages of certain goods. The United Kingdom will also need to negotiate its own tax and trade treaties with countries all over the world, which could take years to complete. If the ultimate terms of the U.K.’s separation from the European Union negatively impact the U.K. economy or result in disruptions to sales or our supply chain, the impact to our results of operations and financial condition could be material. We are taking measures to increase our resources in customer service & logistics together with increasing our inventory levels of 30Table of Contentsimported raw materials, packaging and finished goods in the United Kingdom to help us manage through the Brexit transition and the inherent risks. Resulting impacts and market volatility can vary significantly depending on the final terms of the U.K.’s exit agreement from the European Union.Argentina – as further discussed in Note 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies – Currency Translation and Highly Inflationary Accounting, on July 1, 2018, we began to apply highly inflationary accounting for our Argentinean subsidiaries. During 2018, we recorded an $11 million remeasurement loss in net earnings related to the devaluation of our Argentinean peso denominated net monetary assets from July 1, 2018 through December 31, 2018. The mix of monetary assets and liabilities and the exchange rate to convert Argentinean pesos to U.S. dollars could change over time, so it is difficult to predict the overall impact of the Argentina highly inflationary accounting on future net earnings. Accounting Standards – We adopted a new lease accounting standard on January 1, 2019. The most significant impact is the initial recognition of operating lease Right of Use assets and lease liabilities on our balance sheet, while our accounting for finance leases (i.e. capital leases) remains substantially unchanged. Refer to Note 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, for more information on the estimated impact of the new lease accounting standard.Financing Costs – We regularly evaluate our variable and fixed-rate debt. We continue to use low-cost, short- and long-term debt to finance our ongoing working capital, capital expenditures and other investments, dividends and share repurchases. Our weighted-average interest rate on our total debt as of December 31, 2018 was 2.3%, up from 2.1% as of December 31, 2017 and up from 2.2% as of December 31, 2016, primarily due to higher interest rates on commercial paper borrowings in 2018. We expect to use cash and proceeds from debt issuances to finance the $1.2 billion of remaining U.S. tax reform transition tax installments, payable through 2026, and the estimated $573 million multiemployer pension plan withdrawal liability payable over 20 years from the date of the final assessment from the Fund. We continue to use interest rate swaps and other financial instruments to manage our exposure to interest rate and cash flow variability, protect the value of our existing currency assets and liabilities and protect the value of our debt. We also enter into cross-currency interest rate swaps and forwards to hedge our non-U.S. net investments against adverse movements in exchange rates. In connection with the net investment hedge derivative contracts, we expect a favorable impact on our prospective financing costs as we reduce some of the financing costs and related currency impacts within our interest costs. Refer to Note 8, Debt and Borrowing Arrangements, and Note 9, Financial Instruments, for additional information on our debt and derivative activity. Cybersecurity Risks – In 2017, the malware incident impacted our operating systems and results. We continue to devote focused resources to network security, backup and disaster recovery, enhanced training and other security measures to protect our systems and data. We also focus on enhancing the monitoring and detection of threats in our environment, including but not limited to the manufacturing environment and operational technologies, as well as adjusting information security controls based on updated threats. While we have taken a number of security measures to protect our systems and data, security measures cannot provide absolute certainty or guarantee that we will be successful in preventing or responding to every breach or disruption on a timely basis. 31Table of ContentsDiscussion and Analysis of Historical ResultsItems Affecting Comparability of Financial ResultsThe following table includes significant income or (expense) items that affected the comparability of our results of operations and our effective tax rates.

Power Brands net revenues increased 2.0%, including an unfavorable currency impact, and Power Brands Organic Net Revenue increased 3.2%. Emerging markets net revenues decreased 0.5%, including an unfavorable currency impact, and emerging markets Organic Net Revenue increased 5.7%. The underlying changes in net revenues and Organic Net Revenue are detailed below: 2018Change in net revenues (by percentage point) Total change in net revenues0.2 %Add back the following items affecting comparability: Unfavorable currency1.4 ppImpact of acquisition(0.2)ppImpact of divestitures1.0 ppTotal change in Organic Net Revenue (1)2.4 %Higher net pricing1.3 ppFavorable volume/mix1.1 pp (1)Please see the Non-GAAP Financial Measures section at the end of this item.Net revenue increase of 0.2% was driven by our underlying Organic Net Revenue growth of 2.4% and the impact of an acquisition, mostly offset by unfavorable currency and the impact of divestitures. Our underlying Organic Net Revenue growth was driven by higher net pricing and favorable volume/mix. Net pricing was up, which includes the benefit of carryover pricing from 2017 as well as the effects of input cost-driven pricing actions taken during 2018. Higher net pricing was reflected in Latin America, AMEA and North America, partially offset by lower net pricing in Europe. Favorable volume/mix was reflected in Europe and AMEA, partially offset by unfavorable volume/mix in Latin America and North America. The June 7, 2018 acquisition of a U.S. premium biscuit company, Tate’s Bake Shop, added net revenues of $52 million in 2018. Unfavorable currency impacts decreased net revenues by $343 million, due primarily to the strength of the U.S. dollar relative to several other currencies, including the Argentinean peso, Brazilian real, Russian ruble, Indian rupee and Turkish lira, partially offset by the strength of several currencies relative to the U.S. dollar, including the euro, British pound sterling and Chinese yuan. The impact of divestitures that occurred in 2017 resulted in a year-over-year decline in net revenues of $270 million.

Higher net pricing, which included the carryover impact of pricing actions taken in 2017 as well as the effects of input cost-driven pricing actions taken during 2018, was reflected across all regions except Europe. The increase in input costs was driven by higher raw material costs, mostly offset by lower manufacturing costs due to productivity efforts. Higher raw material costs were primarily due to higher currency exchange transaction costs on imported materials, as well as higher packaging, dairy and energy, partially offset primarily by lower cocoa costs. Favorable volume/mix was driven by Europe and AMEA, which was partially offset by unfavorable volume/mix in North America and Latin America.Total selling, general and administrative expenses increased $537 million from 2017, due to a number of factors noted in the table above, including in part, the impact from pension participation changes, lapping of prior-year benefits from the resolution of tax matters, lapping of a prior-year property insurance recovery, acquisition-related costs, remeasurement of net monetary position in Argentina, the impact of an acquisition and higher CEO transition remuneration. The increases were partially offset by favorable currency impact, lower implementation costs incurred for the Simplify to Grow Program, lower divestiture-related costs, the lapping of prior-year malware incident incremental costs, a value-added tax (“VAT”) related settlement in 2018, the impact of divestitures and the net benefit from the resolution of tax matters in 2018. Excluding these factors, selling, general and administrative expenses increased $83 million from 2017. The increase was driven by the year-over year net unfavorable change in miscellaneous other income and expense items within selling, general and administrative expenses and higher overhead costs, which more than offset lower advertising and consumer promotion costs. We recorded a benefit of $21 million from a VAT-related settlement in Latin America in 2018. We recorded a benefit of $27 million from an insurance recovery in AMEA in 2017. Unfavorable currency changes decreased operating income by $55 million due primarily to the strength of the U.S. dollar relative to several currencies, including the Brazilian real, Argentinean peso, Russian ruble and Turkish lira, partially offset by the strength of several currencies relative to the U.S. dollar, including the euro and British pound sterling.Operating income margin decreased from 13.4% in 2017 to 12.8% in 2018. The decrease in operating income margin was driven by the impact from pension participation changes, the lapping of prior-year benefits from the resolution of tax matters, the lapping of a prior-year gain on divestiture and higher CEO transition remuneration. These unfavorable items were partially offset by the year-over-year favorable change in mark-to-market gains/(losses) from currency and commodity hedging activities, lower Simplify to Grow Program costs, an increase in our Adjusted Operating Income margin, the lapping of prior-year malware incident incremental costs, lower divestiture-related costs and lower intangible asset impairment charges. Adjusted Operating Income margin increased from 16.1% in 2017 to 16.7% in 2018. The increase in Adjusted Operating Income margin was driven primarily by higher net pricing, lower manufacturing costs due to continued cost reduction efforts and lower advertising and consumer promotion costs, partially offset by higher raw material costs.35Table of ContentsNet Earnings and Earnings per Share Attributable to Mondelēz International – Net earnings attributable to Mondelēz International of $3,381 million increased by $553 million (19.6%) in 2018.

The impact of divestitures resulted in a year-over-year decline in net revenues of $383 million for 2017. Our underlying Organic Net Revenue increase was driven by higher net pricing, partially offset by unfavorable volume/mix. Net pricing was up, which includes the benefit of carryover pricing from 2016 as well as the effects of input cost-driven pricing actions taken during 2017. Higher net pricing was reflected in Latin America and AMEA, partially offset by lower net pricing in North America and Europe. Unfavorable volume/mix was reflected in all segments except Europe, in part due to expected shipments that we did not realize following the second quarter malware incident. Favorable year-over-year currency impacts increased net revenues by $77 million, due primarily to the strength of several currencies relative to the U.S. dollar, including the Brazilian real, euro, Russian ruble, Australian dollar, Indian rupee and South African rand, partially offset by the strength of the U.S. dollar relative to several currencies, including the Egyptian pound, British pound sterling, Argentinean peso, Nigerian naira, Turkish lira, Philippine peso and Chinese yuan.

Primarily includes the reversal of tax liabilities in connection with the resolution of a Brazilian indirect tax matter and settlement of pre-acquisition Cadbury tax matters.During 2017, we realized higher net pricing while input costs increased modestly. Higher net pricing, which included the carryover impact of pricing actions taken in 2016 as well as the effects of input cost-driven pricing actions taken during 2017, was driven by Latin America and AMEA, partially offset by lower net pricing in North America and Europe. The increase in input costs was driven by higher raw material costs which were partially offset by lower manufacturing costs due to productivity. Unfavorable volume/mix was driven by North America, Latin America and AMEA, which was partially offset by favorable volume/mix in Europe.Total selling, general and administrative expenses decreased $608 million from 2016, due to a number of factors noted in the table above, including in part, the benefits from the resolution of tax matters, lower implementation costs incurred for the Simplify to Grow Program, lower divestiture-related costs, a property insurance recovery in AMEA and lower intangible asset impairment charges. The decreases were partially offset by gains on sales of property in 2016, unfavorable currency impact, value-added tax (“VAT”) related settlements in 2016 and incremental expenses incurred due to the malware incident.Excluding the factors noted above, selling, general and administrative expenses decreased $380 million from 2016. The decrease was driven primarily by lower overhead costs and lower advertising and consumer promotion costs due to continued cost reduction efforts in both areas.Currency changes during the year did not impact operating income as the strength of the U.S. dollar relative to several currencies, including the Egyptian pound, British pound sterling and Argentinean peso, was offset by the strength of several currencies relative to the U.S. dollar, including the euro, Brazilian real, Russian ruble, Australian dollar, Indian rupee and South African rand.Operating income margin increased from 9.9% in 2016 to 13.4% in 2017. The increase in operating income margin was driven primarily by an increase in our Adjusted Operating Income margin, lower Simplify to Grow Program costs, the benefits from the resolution of tax matters, the net gain on divestitures and lower divestiture-related costs, partially offset by incremental costs related to the malware incident and CEO transition remuneration costs. Adjusted Operating Income margin increased from 14.9% in 2016 to 16.1% in 2017. The increase in Adjusted Operating Income margin was driven primarily by lower overheads and lower advertising and consumer promotion costs due to continued cost reduction efforts in both areas.40Table of ContentsNet Earnings and Earnings per Share Attributable to Mondelēz International – Net earnings attributable to Mondelēz International of $2,828 million increased by $1,193 million (73.0%) in 2017.

Unfavorable currency impacts were due primarily to the strength of the U.S. dollar relative to most currencies in the region including the Argentinean peso, Brazilian real and Mexican peso. Unfavorable volume/mix was due primarily to the impact of pricing-related elasticity, as well as in part due to the negative impact of the Brazil trucking strike that occurred in the second quarter. Unfavorable volume/mix was driven by declines in all categories except biscuits. Higher net pricing was reflected across all categories, driven primarily by Argentina, Mexico and Brazil.Segment operating income decreased $154 million (27.3%), primarily due to lapping last year's benefit from the resolution of a Brazilian indirect tax matter of $153 million, higher raw material costs, unfavorable currency, higher other selling, general and administrative expenses (net of the benefit from a VAT-related settlement in 2018), unfavorable volume/mix and a loss from the remeasurement of the net monetary position in Argentina. These unfavorable items were partially offset by higher net pricing, lower manufacturing costs, the 2018 benefit from the resolution of a Brazilian tax matter of $26 million, lower advertising and consumer promotion costs, lower costs incurred for the Simplify to Grow Program and the lapping of the 2017 intangible asset impairment charges.2017 compared with 2016:Net revenues increased $174 million (5.1%), due to higher net pricing (7.7 pp) and favorable currency (1.9 pp), partially offset by unfavorable volume/mix (4.2 pp) and the impact of a divestiture (0.3 pp). Higher net pricing was reflected across all categories driven primarily by Argentina, Brazil and Mexico. Favorable currency impacts were due primarily to the strength of several currencies in the region relative to the U.S. dollar, primarily the Brazilian real, partially offset by the strength of the U.S. dollar relative to the Argentinean peso and Mexican peso. Unfavorable volume/mix, which occurred across most of the region, was largely due to the impact of pricing-related elasticity. In addition, only a portion of the shipments delayed at the end of the second quarter due to the malware incident was recovered. Unfavorable volume/mix was driven by declines in all categories except chocolate and candy. On December 1, 2016, we sold a small confectionery business in Costa Rica.Segment operating income increased $292 million (107.4%), primarily due to higher net pricing, the benefit from the resolution of a Brazilian indirect tax matter of $153 million, lower manufacturing costs, lower costs incurred for the Simplify to Grow Program, favorable currency and lower advertising and consumer promotion costs. These favorable items were partially offset by higher raw material costs, unfavorable volume/mix and higher other selling, general and administrative expenses (net of prior-year VAT-related settlements).44Table of ContentsAMEA For the Years EndedDecember 31, 2018 2017 $ change % change (in millions) Net revenues$5,729 $5,739 $(10) (0.2)%Segment operating income702 514 188 36.6 % For the Years EndedDecember 31, 2017 2016 $ change % change (in millions) Net revenues$5,739 $5,816 $(77) (1.3)%Segment operating income514 505 9 1.8 %2018 compared with 2017:Net revenues decreased $10 million (0.2%), due to the impact of divestitures (2.4 pp) and unfavorable currency (1.3 pp), partially offset by favorable volume/mix (1.9 pp) and higher net pricing (1.6 pp). The impact of divestitures related to the grocery & cheese business in Australia and New Zealand that was divested on July 4, 2017 and the confectionery business in Japan that was divested on December 28, 2017, resulted in a year-over-year decline in net revenues of $133 million for 2018. Unfavorable currency impacts were due primarily to the strength of the U.S. dollar relative to several currencies in the region, including the Indian rupee, Australian dollar and Philippine peso, partially offset by the strength of several currencies in the region relative to the U.S. dollar, including the Chinese yuan and Japanese yen. Favorable volume/mix, including the shift of Chinese New Year into the first quarter of 2018, was driven by gains in chocolate and biscuits, partially offset by declines in refreshment beverages, cheese & grocery, gum and candy. Higher net pricing was reflected across all categories except gum and candy. Segment operating income increased $188 million (36.6%), primarily due to higher net pricing, lower costs incurred for the Simplify to Grow Program, lower manufacturing costs, lower intangible asset impairment charges, lower advertising and consumer promotion costs and favorable volume/mix. These favorable items were partially offset by higher raw material costs, the impact of divestitures, unfavorable currency and higher other selling, general and administrative expenses (net of prior-year property insurance recovery).2017 compared with 2016:Net revenues decreased $77 million (1.3%), due to the impact of divestitures (2.2 pp), unfavorable currency (1.8 pp) and unfavorable volume/mix (0.2 pp), partially offset by higher net pricing (2.9 pp). The impact of divestitures, primarily related to the grocery & cheese business in Australia and New Zealand that was divested on July 4, 2017, resulted in a year-over-year decline in net revenues of $128 million for 2017. Unfavorable currency impacts were due primarily to the strength of the U.S. dollar relative to several currencies in the region, including the Egyptian pound, Nigerian naira, Philippine peso, Chinese yuan and Japanese yen, partially offset by the strength of several other currencies in the region relative to the U.S. dollar, including the Australian dollar, Indian rupee and South African rand. Unfavorable volume/mix was driven by declines in refreshment beverages, cheese & grocery, gum and candy, partially offset by gains in chocolate and biscuits. In addition, only a portion of the shipments delayed at the end of the second quarter due to the malware incident was recovered. Higher net pricing was reflected across all categories except cheese & grocery.Segment operating income increased $9 million (1.8%), primarily due to higher net pricing, lower other selling, general and administrative expenses (including a property insurance recovery), lower manufacturing costs and lower advertising and consumer promotion costs. These favorable items were mostly offset by higher raw material costs, unfavorable currency, unfavorable volume/mix, higher costs incurred for the Simplify to Grow Program, the impact of divestitures and higher intangible asset impairment charges.45Table of ContentsEurope For the Years EndedDecember 31, 2018 2017 $ change % change (in millions) Net revenues$10,122 $9,794 $328 3.3%Segment operating income1,734 1,610 124 7.7% For the Years EndedDecember 31, 2017 2016 $ change % change (in millions) Net revenues$9,794 $9,755 $39 0.4%Segment operating income1,610 1,198 412 34.4%2018 compared with 2017:Net revenues increased $328 million (3.3%), due to favorable volume/mix (3.1 pp) and favorable currency (2.3 pp), partially offset by the impact of divestitures (1.5 pp) and lower net pricing (0.6 pp). Favorable volume/mix was driven by chocolate, biscuits and candy, partially offset by declines in cheese & grocery, gum and refreshment beverages. Favorable currency impacts reflected the strength of several currencies relative to the U.S. dollar, primarily the euro, British pound sterling, Polish zloty and Czech koruna, partially offset by the strength of the U.S. dollar relative to several currencies, primarily the Russian ruble and Turkish lira. The impact of divestitures, due to the sale of a confectionery business in France and the termination of certain Kraft Heinz Company-owned grocery brand licenses, resulted in a year-over-year decline in net revenues of $137 million for 2018. Lower net pricing was driven by chocolate and biscuits, partially offset by higher net pricing in cheese & grocery, candy and gum.Segment operating income increased $124 million (7.7%), primarily due to favorable volume/mix, lower manufacturing costs, lower costs incurred for the Simplify to Grow Program, favorable currency, lower raw material costs, lower divestiture-related costs and the lapping of prior-year malware incident incremental costs. These favorable items were partially offset by higher advertising and consumer promotion costs, higher other selling, general and administrative expenses, lower net pricing, lapping the prior-year benefit from the settlement of a Cadbury tax matter, higher intangible asset impairment charges and the impact from divestitures.2017 compared with 2016:Net revenues increased $39 million (0.4%), due to favorable volume/mix (1.4 pp), favorable currency (1.0 pp), and the impact of an acquisition (0.6 pp), partially offset by the impact of divestitures (2.5 pp) and lower net pricing (0.1 pp). Favorable volume/mix was driven by chocolate and biscuits, partially offset by declines in gum, cheese & grocery, candy and refreshment beverages. In addition, a portion of the shipments delayed at the end of the second quarter due to the malware incident was not recovered. Favorable currency impacts reflected the strength of several other currencies relative to the U.S. dollar, primarily the euro and Russian ruble, partially offset by the strength of the U.S. dollar against several currencies in the region, including the British pound sterling and Turkish lira. The November 2016 acquisition of a business and license to manufacture, market and sell Cadbury-branded biscuits added net revenues of $59 million (constant currency basis). The impact of divestitures, primarily due to the sale of a confectionery business in France, resulted in a year-over-year decline in net revenues of $234 million for 2017. Lower net pricing was driven by biscuits, mostly offset by higher net pricing in all other categories.Segment operating income increased $412 million (34.4%), primarily due to lower manufacturing costs, lower costs incurred for the Simplify to Grow Program, lower other selling, general and administrative expenses, lower divestiture-related costs, lower advertising and consumer promotion costs, the benefit from the settlement of a Cadbury tax matter, favorable volume/mix, lower intangible asset impairment charges, favorable currency and the impact of an acquisition. These favorable items were partially offset by higher raw material costs, the impact of divestitures, incremental costs incurred due to the malware incident, lower net pricing and a prior-year gain on the sale of an intangible asset.46Table of ContentsNorth America For the Years EndedDecember 31, 2018 2017 $ change % change (in millions) Net revenues$6,885 $6,797 $88 1.3 %Segment operating income849 1,144 (295) (25.8)% For the Years EndedDecember 31, 2017 2016 $ change % change (in millions) Net revenues$6,797 $6,960 $(163) (2.3)%Segment operating income1,144 1,128 16 1.4 %2018 compared with 2017:Net revenues increased $88 million (1.3%), due to higher net pricing (1.1 pp) and the impact of an acquisition (0.8 pp), partially offset by unfavorable volume/mix (0.5 pp) and unfavorable currency (0.1 pp). Higher net pricing was reflected in biscuits and gum, partially offset by lower net pricing in chocolate and candy. The June 7, 2018 acquisition of a U.S. premium biscuit company, Tate’s Bake Shop, added net revenues of $52 million in 2018. Unfavorable volume/mix, which was net of the benefit from lapping last year's negative impact from the 2017 malware incident, reflected declines in gum and chocolate, partially offset by gains in biscuits and candy. Unfavorable currency impact was due to the strength of the U.S. dollar relative to the Canadian dollar. Segment operating income decreased $295 million (25.8%), primarily due to the impact from pension participation changes, higher manufacturing costs, unfavorable volume/mix, higher raw material costs and higher other selling, general and administrative expenses. These unfavorable items were partially offset by lower advertising and consumer promotion costs, higher net pricing, the lapping of prior-year malware incident incremental costs, lower costs incurred for the Simplify to Grow Program, lower intangible asset impairment charges and the impact from the acquisition of Tate's Bake Shop.2017 compared with 2016:Net revenues decreased $163 million (2.3%), due to unfavorable volume/mix (1.8 pp), lower net pricing (0.6 pp) and the impact of divestitures (0.1 pp), partially offset by favorable currency (0.2 pp).

Favorable currency impact was due to the strength of the Canadian dollar relative to the U.S. dollar.Segment operating income increased $16 million (1.4%), primarily due to lower costs incurred for the Simplify to Grow Program, lower advertising and consumer promotion costs, lower other selling, general and administrative expenses (net of the prior-year’s gain on sale of property), lower manufacturing costs and lower raw material costs. These favorable items were partially offset by unfavorable volume/mix, incremental costs incurred due to the malware incident, lower net pricing, the impact of divestitures and prior-year gain on the sale of an intangible asset.47Table of ContentsCritical Accounting EstimatesWe prepare our consolidated financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP. The preparation of these financial statements requires the use of estimates, judgments and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the periods presented. Actual results could differ from those estimates and assumptions. Note 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, to the consolidated financial statements includes a summary of the significant accounting policies we used to prepare our consolidated financial statements. We have discussed the selection and disclosure of our critical accounting policies and estimates with our Audit Committee. The following is a review of our most significant assumptions and estimates.Goodwill and Non-Amortizable Intangible Assets:We test goodwill and non-amortizable intangible assets for impairment on an annual basis on July 1. We assess goodwill impairment risk throughout the year by performing a qualitative review of entity-specific, industry, market and general economic factors affecting our goodwill reporting units. We review our operating segment and reporting unit structure for goodwill testing annually or as significant changes in the organization occur. Annually, we may perform qualitative testing, or depending on factors such as prior-year test results, current year developments, current risk evaluations and other practical considerations, we may elect to do quantitative testing instead. In our quantitative testing, we compare a reporting unit’s estimated fair value with its carrying value. We estimate a reporting unit’s fair value using a discounted cash flow method which incorporates planned growth rates, market-based discount rates and estimates of residual value. This year, for our Europe and North America reporting units, we used a market-based, weighted-average cost of capital of 7.3% to discount the projected cash flows of those operations. For our Latin America and AMEA reporting units, we used a risk-rated discount rate of 10.3%. Estimating the fair value of individual reporting units requires us to make assumptions and estimates regarding our future plans and industry and economic conditions, and our actual results and conditions may differ over time. If the carrying value of a reporting unit’s net assets exceeds its fair value, we would recognize an impairment charge for the amount by which the carrying value exceeds the reporting unit fair value.In 2018, 2017 and 2016, there were no impairments of goodwill. In connection with our 2018 annual impairment testing, each of our reporting units had sufficient fair value in excess of carrying value. While all reporting units passed our annual impairment testing, if planned business performance expectations are not met or specific valuation factors outside of our control, such as discount rates, change significantly, then the estimated fair values of a reporting unit or reporting units might decline and lead to a goodwill impairment in the future.Annually, we assess non-amortizable intangible assets for impairment by performing a qualitative review and assessing events and circumstances that could affect the fair value or carrying value of the indefinite-lived intangible assets. If significant potential impairment risk exists for a specific asset, we quantitatively test it for impairment by comparing its estimated fair value with its carrying value. We determine estimated fair value using planned growth rates, market-based discount rates and estimates of royalty rates. If the carrying value of the asset exceeds its estimated fair value, the asset is impaired and its carrying value is reduced to the estimated fair value.During our 2018 annual testing of non-amortizable intangible assets, we recorded $68 million of impairment charges in the third quarter of 2018 related to five trademarks. The impairments arose due to lower than expected product growth. We recorded charges related to gum, chocolate, biscuits and candy trademarks of $45 million in Europe, $14 million in North America and $9 million in AMEA. The impairment charges were calculated as the excess of the carrying value over the estimated fair value of the intangible assets on a global basis and were recorded within asset impairment and exit costs. We primarily use a relief of royalty valuation method, which utilizes estimates of future sales, growth rates, royalty rates and discount rates in determining a brand's global fair value. We also identified seven brands, including the five impaired trademarks, with $538 million of aggregate book value as of December 31, 2018 that each had a fair value in excess of book value of 10% or less. We believe our current plans for each of these brands will allow them to continue to not be impaired, but if the product line expectations are not met or specific valuation factors outside of our control, such as discount rates, change significantly, then a brand or brands could become impaired in the future. In 2017, we recorded charges related to candy and gum trademarks of $52 million in AMEA, $11 million in Europe, $5 million in Latin America and $2 million in North America. In 2016, we recorded charges related to biscuits, candy and gum trademarks of $41 million in AMEA, $32 million in North America, $22 million in Europe, and $3 million in Latin America.Refer to Note 5, Goodwill and Intangible Assets, for additional information.48Table of ContentsTrade and marketing programs:We promote our products with trade and sales incentives as well as marketing and advertising programs. These programs include, but are not limited to, new product introduction fees, discounts, coupons, rebates and volume-based incentives as well as cooperative advertising, in-store displays and consumer marketing promotions. Trade and sales incentives are recorded as a reduction to revenues based on amounts estimated due to customers and consumers at the end of a period. We base these estimates principally on historical utilization and redemption rates. For interim reporting purposes, advertising and consumer promotion expenses are charged to operations as a percentage of volume, based on estimated sales volume and estimated program spending. We do not defer costs on our year-end consolidated balance sheet and all marketing and advertising costs are recorded as an expense in the year incurred.Employee Benefit Plans:We sponsor various employee benefit plans throughout the world. These include primarily pension plans and postretirement healthcare benefits. For accounting purposes, we estimate the pension and postretirement healthcare benefit obligations utilizing assumptions and estimates for discount rates; expected returns on plan assets; expected compensation increases; employee-related factors such as turnover, retirement age and mortality; and health care cost trends. We review our actuarial assumptions on an annual basis and make modifications to the assumptions based on current rates and trends when appropriate. Our assumptions also reflect our historical experiences and management’s best judgment regarding future expectations. These and other assumptions affect the annual expense and obligations recognized for the underlying plans.As permitted by U.S. GAAP, we generally amortize the effect of changes in the assumptions over future periods. The cost or benefit of plan changes, such as increasing or decreasing benefits for prior employee service (prior service cost), is deferred and included in expense on a straight-line basis over the average remaining service period of the employees expected to receive benefits.Since pension and postretirement liabilities are measured on a discounted basis, the discount rate significantly affects our plan obligations and expenses. For plans that have assets held in trust, the expected return on plan assets assumption affects our pension plan expenses. The assumptions for discount rates and expected rates of return and our process for setting these assumptions are described in Note 10, Benefit Plans, to the consolidated financial statements.While we do not anticipate further changes in the 2019 assumptions for our U.S. and non-U.S. pension and postretirement health care plans, as a sensitivity measure, a fifty-basis point change in our discount rates or the expected rate of return on plan assets would have the following effects, increase/(decrease), on our annual benefit plan costs: As of December 31, 2018 U.S. Plans Non-U.S. PlansFifty-Basis-Point Fifty-Basis-Point Increase Decrease Increase Decrease (in millions)Effect of change in discount rate on pension costs$(14) $15 $(57) $60Effect of change in expected rate of return on plan assets on pension costs(8) 8 (39) 39Effect of change in discount rate on postretirement health care costs(3) 3 — —In accordance with obligations we have under collective bargaining agreements, we participate in multiemployer pension plans. In 2017 and 2016, the only individually significant multiemployer plan we contributed to was the Bakery and Confectionery Union and Industry International Pension Fund. Our obligation to contribute to the Fund arose with respect to 8 collective bargaining agreements covering most of our employees represented by the BCTGM. All of those collective bargaining agreements expired in 2016. In the fourth quarter of 2018, we executed a complete withdrawal from the Fund. We estimated a withdrawal liability of $573 million, which represents our best estimate of the withdrawal liability absent an assessment from the Fund. We anticipate receiving an assessment in 2019, and the ultimate withdrawal liability may change from the currently 49Table of Contentsestimated amount. We will record any future adjustments in the period during which the liability is confirmed or as new information becomes available. We expect to pay the liability over a period of 20 years from the date of the assessment. During 2018, within our North America segment, we recorded a discounted liability and related charge of $423 million or $316 million net of tax. We determined the net present value of the liability using a risk-free interest rate. We recorded the pre-tax non-cash charges in selling, general and administrative expense (and in other non-cash items, net in the consolidated statement of cash flows) and the liability in long-term other liabilities. During 2018, we also recorded $6 million of accreted interest related to the long-term liability within interest and other expense, net.See additional information on our employee benefit plans in Note 10, Benefit Plans.Income Taxes:As a global company, we calculate and provide for income taxes in each tax jurisdiction in which we operate. The provision for income taxes includes the amounts payable or refundable for the current year, the effect of deferred taxes and impacts from uncertain tax positions. Our provision for income taxes is significantly affected by shifts in the geographic mix of our pre-tax earnings across tax jurisdictions, changes in tax laws and regulations, tax planning opportunities available in each tax jurisdiction and the ultimate outcome of various tax audits.Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between the financial statement and tax bases of our assets and liabilities and for operating losses and tax credit carryforwards. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates that will apply to taxable income in the years in which those differences are expected to be recovered or settled. Valuation allowances are established for deferred tax assets when it is more likely than not that a tax benefit will not be realized.We believe our tax positions comply with applicable tax laws and that we have properly accounted for uncertain tax positions. We recognize tax benefits in our financial statements from uncertain tax positions only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained by the taxing authorities based on the technical merits of the position. The amount we recognize is measured as the largest amount of benefit that is greater than 50 percent likely of being realized upon resolution. We evaluate uncertain tax positions on an ongoing basis and adjust the amount recognized in light of changing facts and circumstances, such as the progress of a tax audit or expiration of a statute of limitations. We believe the estimates and assumptions used to support our evaluation of uncertain tax positions are reasonable. However, final determination of historical tax liabilities, whether by settlement with tax authorities, judicial or administrative ruling or due to expiration of statutes of limitations, could be materially different from estimates reflected on our consolidated balance sheet and historical income tax provisions. The outcome of these final determinations could have a material effect on our provision for income taxes, net earnings or cash flows in the period in which the determination is made.As a result of U.S. tax reform and the related SEC guidance, we finalized our accounting for the legislation based on guidance that was issued prior to 2018 year end and included updates to the prior provisional estimates in our 2018 consolidated financial statements. See Note 15, Income Taxes, for further discussion of the amounts recorded related to U.S. tax reform in our financial statements, as well as additional information on our effective tax rate, current and deferred taxes, valuation allowances and unrecognized tax benefits.Contingencies:See Note 13, Commitments and Contingencies, to the consolidated financial statements.New Accounting Guidance:See Note 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, to the consolidated financial statements for a discussion of new accounting standards.50Table of ContentsLiquidity and Capital ResourcesWe believe that cash from operations, our revolving credit facilities, short-term borrowings and our authorized long-term financing will provide sufficient liquidity for our working capital needs, planned capital expenditures and future payments of our U.S. tax reform transition tax liability, contractual and benefit plan obligations, share repurchases and quarterly dividends. We continue to utilize our commercial paper program, international credit lines and long-term debt issuances for our funding requirements. We also use intercompany loans with our international subsidiaries to improve financial flexibility. Overall, we do not expect any negative effects to our funding sources that would have a material effect on our liquidity.Net Cash Provided by Operating Activities:Operating activities provided net cash of $3,948 million in 2018, $2,593 million in 2017 and $2,838 million in 2016. The increase in net cash provided by operating activities in 2018 relative to 2017 was due primarily to higher cash flow from working capital, higher net earnings as well as lower pension contributions. Cash flows from operating activities were lower in 2017 than 2016 primarily due to increases in working capital including higher tax and VAT-related payments in 2017 and lower operating cash flows from divested businesses, partially offset by higher net earnings and lower pension contributions in 2017.Net Cash Used in Investing Activities:Net cash used in investing activities was $1,224 million in 2018, $301 million in 2017 and $1,029 million in 2016. The increase in net cash used in investing activities in 2018 relative to 2017 was primarily due to cash received in 2017 from proceeds from divestitures, cash expenditures in 2018 for an acquisition and higher capital expenditures in 2018, partially offset by cash received as a result of the settlement and replacement of several net investment hedge derivative contracts. The decrease in net cash used in investing activities in 2017 relative to 2016 was due to higher net proceeds received from divestitures in 2017, no acquisition-related payments in 2017 as in 2016 and lower capital expenditures in 2017.Capital expenditures were $1,095 million in 2018, $1,014 million in 2017 and $1,224 million in 2016. We continue to make capital expenditures primarily to modernize manufacturing facilities and support new product and productivity initiatives. We expect 2019 capital expenditures to be up to $1.0 billion, including capital expenditures in connection with our Simplify to Grow Program. We expect to continue to fund these expenditures from operations.Net Cash Used in Financing Activities:Net cash used in financing activities was $2,329 million in 2018, $3,361 million in 2017 and $1,862 million in 2016. The decrease in net cash used in financing activities in 2018 relative to 2017 was primarily due to higher net debt issuances and lower share repurchases partially offset by higher dividends paid. The increase in net cash used in financing activities in 2017 relative to 2016 was primarily due to lower net issuances of short-term and long-term debt as well as an increase in dividends paid, partly offset by lower share repurchases compared to 2016.Debt:From time to time we refinance long-term and short-term debt. Refer to Note 8, Debt and Borrowing Arrangements, for details of our recent tender offers, debt issuances and maturities. The nature and amount of our long-term and short-term debt and the proportionate amount of each varies as a result of current and expected business requirements, market conditions and other factors. Due to seasonality, in the first and second quarters of the year, our working capital requirements grow, increasing the need for short-term financing. The second half of the year typically generates higher cash flows. As such, we may issue commercial paper or secure other forms of financing throughout the year to meet short-term working capital or other financing needs.During 2016, one of our subsidiaries, Mondelez International Holdings Netherlands B.V. (“MIHN”), issued debt totaling $4.5 billion. The operations held by MIHN generated approximately 74.1% (or $19.2 billion) of the $25.9 billion of consolidated net revenue during fiscal year 2018 and represented approximately 80.5% (or $20.7 billion) of the $25.7 billion of net assets as of December 31, 2018.On February 7, 2019, our Board of Directors approved a new $5.0 billion long-term financing authority to replace the prior $5.0 billion authority. As of December 31, 2018, we had $1.7 billion of long-term financing authority remaining.51Table of ContentsIn the next 12 months, we expect approximately $2.7 billion of long-term debt will mature as follows: $400 million in February 2019 and $2.3 billion in October 2019. We expect to fund these repayments with a combination of cash from operations and the issuance of commercial paper or long-term debt.Our total debt was $18.4 billion at December 31, 2018 and $17.7 billion at December 31, 2017. Our debt-to-capitalization ratio was 0.42 at December 31, 2018 and 0.40 at December 31, 2017. At December 31, 2018, the weighted-average term of our outstanding long-term debt was 5.8 years. Our average daily commercial borrowings were $4.5 billion in 2018, $4.4 billion in 2017 and $2.2 billion in 2016. We had $3.1 billion of commercial paper borrowings outstanding at December 31, 2018 and $3.4 billion outstanding as of December 31, 2017. We expect to continue to use commercial paper to finance various short and long-term financing needs and to continue to comply with our long-term debt covenants. Refer to Note 8, Debt and Borrowing Arrangements, for more information on our debt and debt covenants.Commodity TrendsWe regularly monitor worldwide supply, commodity cost and currency trends so we can cost-effectively secure ingredients, packaging and fuel required for production. During 2018, the primary drivers of the increase in our aggregate commodity costs were higher currency-related costs on our commodity purchases and increased costs for packaging, dairy, energy, grains, oils and other raw materials, partially offset by lower costs for cocoa, sugar and nuts.A number of external factors such as weather conditions, commodity market conditions, currency fluctuations and the effects of governmental agricultural or other programs affect the cost and availability of raw materials and agricultural materials used in our products. We address higher commodity costs and currency impacts primarily through hedging, higher pricing and manufacturing and overhead cost control. We use hedging techniques to limit the impact of fluctuations in the cost of our principal raw materials; however, we may not be able to fully hedge against commodity cost changes, such as dairy, where there is a limited ability to hedge, and our hedging strategies may not protect us from increases in specific raw material costs. Due to competitive or market conditions, planned trade or promotional incentives, fluctuations in currency exchange rates or other factors, our pricing actions may also lag commodity cost changes temporarily.We expect price volatility and a slightly higher aggregate cost environment to continue in 2019. While the costs of our principal raw materials fluctuate, we believe there will continue to be an adequate supply of the raw materials we use and that they will generally remain available from numerous sources.Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements and Aggregate Contractual ObligationsWe have no significant off-balance sheet arrangements other than the contractual obligations discussed below.Guarantees:As discussed in Note 13, Commitments and Contingencies, we enter into third-party guarantees primarily to cover the long-term obligations of our vendors. As part of these transactions, we guarantee that third parties will make contractual payments or achieve performance measures. At December 31, 2018, we had no material third-party guarantees recorded on our consolidated balance sheet.Guarantees do not have, and we do not expect them to have, a material effect on our liquidity.52Table of ContentsAggregate Contractual Obligations:The following table summarizes our contractual obligations at December 31, 2018.

The amounts also exclude $70 million of net unamortized non-cash bond premiums, discounts, bank fees and mark-to-market adjustments related to our interest rate swaps recorded in total debt.(2)Amounts represent the expected cash payments of our interest expense on our long-term debt. Interest calculated on our euro, British pound sterling and Swiss franc notes was forecasted using currency exchange rates as of December 31, 2018. An insignificant amount of interest expense was excluded from the table for a portion of our other non-U.S. debt obligations due to the complexities involved in forecasting expected interest payments.(3)Operating lease payments represent the minimum rental commitments under non-cancelable operating leases.(4)Purchase obligations for inventory and production costs (such as raw materials, indirect materials and supplies, packaging, co-manufacturing arrangements, storage and distribution) are commitments for projected needs to be utilized in the normal course of business. Other purchase obligations include commitments for marketing, advertising, capital expenditures, information technology and professional services. Arrangements are considered purchase obligations if a contract specifies all significant terms, including fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased, a pricing structure and approximate timing of the transaction. Most arrangements are cancelable without a significant penalty and with short notice (usually 30 days). Any amounts reflected on the consolidated balance sheet as accounts payable and accrued liabilities are excluded from the table above.(5)In connection with U.S. tax reform, we currently estimate paying a total $1.3 billion transition tax liability through 2026. As of December 31, 2018, the amount outstanding was $1.2 billion. The amounts and timing of our tax payments are likely to change as a result of additional guidance issued. See Note 15, Income Taxes, for additional information on U.S. tax reform and its impact on our financial statements.(6)Other long-term liabilities in the table above include both the current and long-term related liabilities. We have included the estimated future benefit payments for our postretirement health care plans through December 31, 2028 of $198 million. We are unable to reliably estimate the timing of the payments beyond 2028; as such, they are excluded from the above table. There are also another $15 million of various other long-term liabilities that are expected to be paid over the next 5 years. In addition, the following long-term liabilities included on the consolidated balance sheet are excluded from the table above: accrued pension costs, estimated multiemployer pension plan withdrawal liabilities, unrecognized tax benefits, insurance accruals and other accruals. As of December 31, 2018, our unrecognized tax benefit, including associated interest and penalties, classified as a long-term payable is $550 million. We currently expect to make approximately $237 million in contributions to our pension plans in 2019. In 2018, we estimated a multiemployer pension plan withdrawal liability of $573 million. We anticipate receiving an assessment in 2019, and the ultimate withdrawal liability may change from the currently estimated amount. We will record any future adjustments in the period during which the liability is confirmed or as new information becomes available. We expect to pay the liability over a period of 20 years from the date of the assessment. 53Table of ContentsEquity and DividendsStock Plans:See Note 11, Stock Plans, to the consolidated financial statements for more information on our stock plans and grant activity during 2016-2018.Share Repurchases:See Note 12, Capital Stock, to the consolidated financial statements for more information on our share repurchase program.Between 2013 and 2017, our Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of a total of $13.7 billion of our Common Stock through December 31, 2018. On January 31, 2018, our Finance Committee, with authorization delegated from our Board of Directors, approved an increase of $6.0 billion in the share repurchase program, raising the authorization to $19.7 billion of Common Stock repurchases, and extended the program through December 31, 2020. We repurchased approximately $15.0 billion of shares ($2.0 billion in 2018, $2.2 billion in 2017, $2.6 billion in 2016, $3.6 billion in 2015, $1.9 billion in 2014 and $2.7 billion in 2013), at a weighted-average cost of $39.30 per share, through December 31, 2018. The number of shares that we ultimately repurchase under our share repurchase program may vary depending on numerous factors, including share price and other market conditions, our ongoing capital allocation planning, levels of cash and debt balances, other demands for cash, such as acquisition activity, general economic or business conditions and board and management discretion. Additionally, our share repurchase activity during any particular period may fluctuate. We may accelerate, suspend, delay or discontinue our share repurchase program at any time, without notice.Dividends:We paid dividends of $1,359 million in 2018, $1,198 million in 2017 and $1,094 million in 2016. On July 25, 2018, the Finance Committee, with authorization delegated from our Board of Directors, declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.26 per share of Class A Common Stock, an increase of 18 percent, which would be $1.04 per common share on an annualized basis. On August 2, 2017, the Finance Committee, with authorization delegated from our Board of Directors, approved a 16% increase in the quarterly dividend to $0.22 per common share or $0.88 per common share on an annualized basis. On July 19, 2016, our Board of Directors approved a 12% increase in the quarterly dividend to $0.19 per common share or $0.76 per common share on an annual basis. The declaration of dividends is subject to the discretion of our Board of Directors and depends on various factors, including our net earnings, financial condition, cash requirements, future prospects and other factors that our Board of Directors deems relevant to its analysis and decision making.For U.S. income tax purposes only, the Company has determined that 100% of the distributions paid to its shareholders in 2018 are characterized as a qualified dividend paid from U.S. earnings and profits. Shareholders should consult their tax advisors for a full understanding of the tax consequences of the receipt of dividends.54Table of ContentsNon-GAAP Financial MeasuresWe use non-GAAP financial information and believe it is useful to investors as it provides additional information to facilitate comparisons of historical operating results, identify trends in our underlying operating results and provide additional insight and transparency on how we evaluate our business. We use non-GAAP financial measures to budget, make operating and strategic decisions and evaluate our performance. We have detailed the non-GAAP adjustments that we make in our non-GAAP definitions below. The adjustments generally fall within the following categories: acquisition & divestiture activities, gains and losses on intangible asset sales and non-cash impairments, major program restructuring activities, constant currency and related adjustments, major program financing and hedging activities and other major items affecting comparability of operating results. We believe the non-GAAP measures should always be considered along with the related U.S. GAAP financial measures. We have provided the reconciliations between the GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures below, and we also discuss our underlying GAAP results throughout our Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations in this Form 10-K.Our primary non-GAAP financial measures are listed below and reflect how we evaluate our current and prior-year operating results. As new events or circumstances arise, these definitions could change. When our definitions change, we provide the updated definitions and present the related non-GAAP historical results on a comparable basis (1). •“Organic Net Revenue” is defined as net revenues excluding the impacts of acquisitions, divestitures (2) and currency rate fluctuations (3). We also evaluate Organic Net Revenue growth from emerging markets and our Power Brands.•Our emerging markets include our Latin America region in its entirety; the AMEA region, excluding Australia, New Zealand and Japan; and the following countries from the Europe region: Russia, Ukraine, Turkey, Kazakhstan, Belarus, Georgia, Poland, Czech Republic, Slovak Republic, Hungary, Bulgaria, Romania, the Baltics and the East Adriatic countries. (Our developed markets include the entire North America region, the Europe region excluding the countries included in the emerging markets definition, and Australia, New Zealand and Japan from the AMEA region.)•Our Power Brands include some of our largest global and regional brands such as Oreo, Chips Ahoy!, Ritz, TUC/Club Social and belVita biscuits; Cadbury Dairy Milk, Milka and Lacta chocolate; Trident gum; Halls candy and Tang powdered beverages. As we shift our focus to invest in a wider group of global and local brands, after 2018, we will discontinue tracking Power Brands and have included it here for a final full-year comparison of results on this basis. •“Adjusted Operating Income” is defined as operating income excluding the impacts of the Simplify to Grow Program (4); gains or losses (including non-cash impairment charges) on goodwill and intangible assets; divestiture (2) or acquisition gains or losses and related divestiture (2), acquisition and integration costs (2); the operating results of divestitures (2); remeasurement of net monetary position (5); mark-to-market impacts from commodity and forecasted currency transaction derivative contracts (6); impact from resolution of tax matters (7); CEO transition remuneration (8); impact from pension participation changes (9); and incremental expenses related to the 2017 malware incident. We also present “Adjusted Operating Income margin,” which is subject to the same adjustments as Adjusted Operating Income. We also evaluate growth in our Adjusted Operating Income on a constant currency basis (3).•“Adjusted EPS” is defined as diluted EPS attributable to Mondelēz International from continuing operations excluding the impacts of the items listed in the Adjusted Operating Income definition as well as losses on debt extinguishment and related expenses; gain on equity method investment transactions; net earnings from divestitures (2); gains or losses on interest rate swaps no longer designated as accounting cash flow hedges due to changed financing and hedging plans and U.S. tax reform discrete impacts (10). Similarly, within Adjusted EPS, our equity method investment net earnings exclude our proportionate share of our investees’ unusual or infrequent items (11). We also evaluate growth in our Adjusted EPS on a constant currency basis (3).(1)When items no longer impact our current or future presentation of non-GAAP operating results, we remove these items from our non-GAAP definitions. During 2018, we added to the non-GAAP definitions the exclusion of: remeasurement gains or losses related to remeasuring net monetary assets or liabilities in Argentina (see footnote (5) below) and the impact from pension participation changes (see footnote (9) below).(2)Divestitures include completed sales of businesses and exits of major product lines upon completion of a sale or licensing agreement. See Note 2, Divestitures and Acquisitions, for information on divestitures and acquisitions impacting the comparability of our results.55Table of Contents(3)Constant currency operating results are calculated by dividing or multiplying, as appropriate, the current-period local currency operating results by the currency exchange rates used to translate the financial statements in the comparable prior-year period to determine what the current-period U.S. dollar operating results would have been if the currency exchange rate had not changed from the comparable prior-year period.(4)Non-GAAP adjustments related to the Simplify to Grow Program reflect costs incurred that relate to the objectives of our program to transform our supply chain network and organizational structure. Costs that do not meet the program objectives are not reflected in the non-GAAP adjustments.(5)During the third quarter of 2018, as we began to apply highly inflationary accounting for Argentina, we excluded the remeasurement gains or losses related to remeasuring net monetary assets or liabilities in Argentina to be consistent with our prior accounting for these remeasurement gains or losses for Venezuela when it was subject to highly inflationary accounting prior to 2016. See Note 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, for more information.(6)During the third quarter of 2016, we began to exclude unrealized gains and losses (mark-to-market impacts) from outstanding commodity and forecasted currency transaction derivatives from our non-GAAP earnings measures until such time that the related exposures impact our operating results. Since we purchase commodity and forecasted currency transaction contracts to mitigate price volatility primarily for inventory requirements in future periods, we made this adjustment to remove the volatility of these future inventory purchases on current operating results to facilitate comparisons of our underlying operating performance across periods. We also discontinued designating commodity and forecasted currency transaction derivatives for hedge accounting treatment. To facilitate comparisons of our underlying operating results, we have recast all historical non-GAAP earnings measures to exclude the mark-to-market impacts.(7)See Note 13, Commitments and Contingencies – Tax Matters, for additional information.(8)On November 20, 2017, Dirk Van de Put succeeded Irene Rosenfeld as CEO of Mondelēz International in advance of her retirement at the end of March 2018. In order to incent Mr. Van de Put to join us, we provided him compensation with a total combined target value of $42.5 million to make him whole for incentive awards he forfeited or grants that were not made to him when he left his former employer. The compensation we granted took the form of cash, deferred stock units, performance share units and stock options. In connection with Irene Rosenfeld’s retirement, we made her outstanding grants of performance share units for the 2016-2018 and 2017-2019 performance cycles eligible for continued vesting and approved a $0.5 million salary for her service as Chairman from January through March 2018. We refer to these elements of Mr. Van de Put’s and Ms. Rosenfeld’s compensation arrangements together as “CEO transition remuneration.” We are excluding amounts we expense as CEO transition remuneration from our non-GAAP results because those amounts are not part of our regular compensation program and are incremental to amounts we would have incurred as ongoing CEO compensation. As a result, in 2017, we excluded amounts expensed for the cash payment to Mr. Van de Put and partial vesting of his equity grants. In 2018, we excluded amounts paid for Ms. Rosenfeld’s service as Chairman and partial vesting of Mr. Van de Put’s and Ms. Rosenfeld’s equity grants.(9)The impact from pension participation changes represents the charges incurred when employee groups are withdrawn from multiemployer pension plans and other changes in employee group pension plan participation. We exclude these charges from our non–GAAP results because those amounts do not reflect our ongoing pension obligations. See Note 10, Benefit Plans, for more information.(10) On December 22, 2017, the United States enacted tax reform legislation that included a broad range of business tax provisions as further detailed in Note 15, Income Taxes. We exclude the discrete U.S. tax reform impacts from our Adjusted EPS as they do not reflect our ongoing tax obligations under U.S. tax reform.(11) We have excluded our proportionate share of our equity method investees’ unusual or infrequent items such as acquisition and divestiture related costs, restructuring program costs and discrete U.S. tax reform impacts, in order to provide investors with a comparable view of our performance across periods. Although we have shareholder rights and board representation commensurate with our ownership interests in our equity method investees and review the underlying operating results and unusual or infrequent items with them each reporting period, we do not have direct control over their operations or resulting revenue and expenses. Our use of equity method investment net earnings on an adjusted basis is not intended to imply that we have any such control. Our GAAP “diluted EPS attributable to Mondelēz International from continuing operations” includes all of the investees’ unusual and infrequent items.We believe that the presentation of these non-GAAP financial measures, when considered together with our U.S. GAAP financial measures and the reconciliations to the corresponding U.S. GAAP financial measures, provides you with a more complete understanding of the factors and trends affecting our business than could be obtained absent these disclosures. Because non-GAAP financial measures vary among companies, the non-GAAP financial measures presented in this report may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies. Our use of these non-GAAP financial measures is not meant to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for any U.S. GAAP financial measure. A limitation of these non-GAAP financial measures is they exclude items detailed below that have an impact on our U.S. GAAP reported results. The best way this limitation can be addressed is by evaluating our non-GAAP financial measures in combination with our U.S. GAAP reported results and carefully evaluating the following tables that reconcile U.S. GAAP reported figures to the non-GAAP financial measures in this Form 10-K.56Table of ContentsOrganic Net Revenue:Applying the definition of “Organic Net Revenue”, the adjustments made to “net revenues” (the most comparable U.S. GAAP financial measure) were to exclude the impact of currency, acquisitions and divestitures. We believe that Organic Net Revenue reflects the underlying growth from the ongoing activities of our business and provides improved comparability of results. We also evaluate our Organic Net Revenue growth from emerging markets and Power Brands, and these underlying measures are also reconciled to U.S. GAAP below.

As such, we may make changes in our planned investments in primarily regional Power Brands following our annual review cycles. For 2018, we made limited changes to our list of regional Power Brands and as such, we reclassified 2017 and 2016 Power Brand net revenues on a basis consistent with the current list of Power Brands. As we shift our focus to invest in a wider group of global and local brands, after 2018, we will discontinue tracking Power Brands and have included it here for a final full-year comparison of results on this basis. 57Table of ContentsAdjusted Operating Income:Applying the definition of “Adjusted Operating Income”, the adjustments made to “operating income” (the most comparable U.S. GAAP financial measure) were to exclude Simplify to Grow Program; intangible asset impairment charges, mark-to-market impacts from commodity and forecasted currency transaction derivative contracts; malware incident incremental expenses, acquisition integration costs; acquisition-related and divestiture-related costs; the operating results of divestitures; gain on divestitures; the remeasurement of net monetary position; the impact from pension participation changes; the impact from the resolution of tax matters and CEO transition remuneration.

Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk.As we operate globally, we are primarily exposed to currency exchange rate, commodity price and interest rate market risks. We monitor and manage these exposures as part of our overall risk management program. Our risk management program focuses on the unpredictability of financial markets and seeks to reduce the potentially adverse effects that the volatility of these markets may have on our operating results. We principally utilize derivative instruments to reduce significant, unanticipated earnings fluctuations that may arise from volatility in currency exchange rates, commodity prices and interest rates. For additional information on our derivative activity and the types of derivative instruments we use to hedge our currency exchange, commodity price and interest rate exposures, see Note 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, and Note 9, Financial Instruments.Many of our non-U.S. subsidiaries operate in functional currencies other than the U.S. dollar. Fluctuations in currency exchange rates create volatility in our reported results as we translate the balance sheets, operating results and cash flows of these subsidiaries into the U.S. dollar for consolidated reporting purposes. The translation of non-U.S. dollar denominated balance sheets and statements of earnings of our subsidiaries into the U.S. dollar for consolidated reporting generally results in a cumulative translation adjustment to other comprehensive income within equity. A stronger U.S. dollar relative to other functional currencies adversely affects our consolidated earnings and net assets while a weaker U.S. dollar benefits our consolidated earnings and net assets. While we hedge significant forecasted currency exchange transactions as well as certain net assets of non-U.S. operations and other currency impacts, we cannot fully predict or eliminate volatility arising from changes in currency exchange rates on our consolidated financial results. See Consolidated Results of Operations and Results of Operations by Reportable Segment under Discussion and Analysis of Historical Results for currency exchange effects on our financial results. For additional information on the impact of currency policies, recent currency devaluations and highly inflationary accounting on our financial condition and results of operations, also see Note 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies—Currency Translation and Highly Inflationary Accounting.We also continually monitor the market for commodities that we use in our products. Input costs may fluctuate widely due to international demand, weather conditions, government policy and regulation and unforeseen conditions. To manage input cost volatility, we enter into forward purchase agreements and other derivative financial instruments. We also pursue productivity and cost saving measures and take pricing actions when necessary to mitigate the impact of higher input costs on earnings.We regularly evaluate our variable and fixed-rate debt as well as current and expected interest rates in the markets in which we raise capital. Our primary exposures include movements in U.S. Treasury rates, corporate credit spreads, commercial paper rates as well as limited debt tied to London Interbank Offered Rates (“LIBOR”). The Financial Conduct Authority in the United Kingdom plans to phase out LIBOR by the end of 2021. We do not anticipate a significant impact to our financial position from the planned phase out of LIBOR given our current mix of variable and fixed-rate debt. We periodically use interest rate swaps and forward interest rate contracts to achieve a desired proportion of variable versus fixed rate debt based on current and projected market conditions. Our weighted-average interest rate on our total debt was 2.3% as of December 31, 2018, up from 2.1% as of December 31, 2017 primarily due to higher interest rates on commercial paper borrowings.Beginning in the first quarter of 2018, we entered into new investment hedge derivative contracts, specifically, cross-currency interest rate swaps and forwards, to hedge certain investments in our non-U.S. operations against movements in exchange rates. See Note 9, Financial Instruments, for more information on our derivative activity. There were no other significant changes in the types of derivative instruments we use to hedge our exposures between December 31, 2017 and December 31, 2018. Value at Risk:We use a value at risk (“VAR”) computation to estimate: 1) the potential one-day loss in the fair value of our interest rate-sensitive financial instruments; and 2) the potential one-day loss in pre-tax earnings of our currency and commodity price-sensitive derivative financial instruments. The VAR analysis was done separately for our currency exchange, fixed income and commodity risk portfolios as of each quarter end during the periods presented below. The instruments included in the VAR computation were currency exchange forwards and options for currency exchange risk, debt and swaps for interest rate risk, and commodity forwards, futures and options for commodity risk. Excluded from the computation were anticipated transactions, currency trade payables and receivables, and net investments in non-U.S. subsidiaries, which the above-mentioned instruments are intended to hedge.62Table of ContentsThe VAR model assumes normal market conditions, a 95% confidence interval and a one-day holding period. A parametric delta-gamma approximation technique was used to determine the expected return distribution in interest rates, currencies and commodity prices for the purpose of calculating the fixed income, currency exchange and commodity VAR, respectively. The parameters used for estimating the expected return distributions were determined by observing interest rate, currency exchange and commodity price movements over the prior quarter for the calculation of VAR amounts at December 31, 2018 and 2017, and over each of the four prior quarters for the calculation of average VAR amounts during each year. The values of currency and commodity options do not change on a one-to-one basis with the underlying currency or commodity and were valued accordingly in the VAR computation.As of December 31, 2018 and December 31, 2017, the estimated potential one-day loss in fair value of our interest rate-sensitive instruments, primarily debt, and the estimated potential one-day loss in pre-tax earnings from our currency and commodity instruments, as calculated in the VAR model, were: Pre-Tax Earnings Impact Fair Value Impact At 12/31/18 Average High Low At 12/31/18 Average High Low (in millions)Instruments sensitive to: Interest rates $35 $33 $36 $27Foreign currency rates$19 $30 $39 $19 Commodity prices15 16 17 15 Pre-Tax Earnings Impact Fair Value Impact At 12/31/17 Average High Low At 12/31/17 Average High Low (in millions)Instruments sensitive to: Interest rates $31 $45 $55 $31Foreign currency rates$15 $16 $22 $11 Commodity prices14 17 24 14 This VAR computation is a risk analysis tool designed to statistically estimate the maximum expected daily loss, under the specified confidence interval and assuming normal market conditions, from adverse movements in interest rates, currency exchange rates and commodity prices. The computation does not represent actual losses in fair value or earnings we will incur, nor does it consider the effect of favorable changes in market rates. We cannot predict actual future movements in market rates and do not present these VAR results to be indicative of future movements in market rates or to be representative of any actual impact that future changes in market rates may have on our future financial results.63Table of Contents",2023-12-30 19:01:13.782695
1103982,MDLZ,"Mondelez International, Inc.",2020,"Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.The following discussion and analysis contains forward-looking statements. It should be read in conjunction with the other sections of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, including the consolidated financial statements and related notes contained in Forward-Looking Statements and Item 1A, Risk Factors.Overview of Business and StrategyWe make and sell primarily snacks, including biscuits (cookies, crackers and salted snacks), chocolate, gum & candy, as well as various cheese & grocery and powdered beverage products. We have operations in approximately 80 countries and sell our products in over 150 countries.We aim to be the global leader in snacking. Our strategy is to drive long-term growth by focusing on three strategic priorities: accelerating consumer-centric growth, driving operational excellence and creating a winning growth culture. We believe the successful implementation of our strategic priorities and the leveraging of our strong foundation of iconic global and local brands, an attractive global footprint, our market leadership in developed and emerging markets, our deep innovation, marketing and distribution capabilities, and our efficiency and sustainability efforts, will drive top- and bottom-line growth, enabling us to continue to create long-term value for our shareholders. For more detailed information on our business and strategy, refer to Item 1, Business.Recent Developments and Significant Items Affecting ComparabilitySwiss and U.S. Tax ReformOn August 6, 2019, Switzerland published changes to its Federal tax law in the Official Federal Collection of Laws. On September 27, 2019, the Zurich Canton published their decision on the September 1, 2019 Zurich Canton public vote regarding the Cantonal changes associated with the Swiss Federal tax law change. The intent of these tax law changes was to replace certain preferential tax regimes with a new set of internationally accepted measures that are hereafter referred to as “Swiss tax reform”. Based on these Federal / Cantonal events, our position is the enactment of Swiss tax reform for U.S. GAAP purposes was met as of September 30, 2019, and we recorded the impacts in the third quarter 2019. The net impact was a benefit of $767 million, which consisted of a $769 million reduction in deferred tax expense from an allowed step-up of intangible assets for tax purposes and remeasurement of our deferred tax balances, partially offset by a $2 million indirect tax impact in selling, general and administrative expenses. The future rate impacts of these Swiss tax reform law changes are effective starting January 1, 2020. We will continue to monitor Swiss tax reform for any additional interpretative guidance that could result in changes to the amounts we have recorded.On December 22, 2017, the United States enacted tax reform legislation (""U.S. tax reform"") that included a broad range of business tax provisions, including but not limited to a reduction in the U.S. federal tax rate from 35% to 21%, as well as provisions that limit or eliminate various deductions or credits. The legislation causes certain U.S. allocated expenses (e.g. interest and general administrative expenses) to be taxed and imposes a tax on U.S. cross-border payments. Furthermore, the legislation included a one-time transition tax on accumulated foreign earnings and profits. While clarifying guidance was issued by the U.S. Treasury Department and Internal Revenue Service (""IRS"") during 2018 and 2019, we continue to evaluate the impacts as additional guidance on implementing the legislation becomes available. The impact of adopting the new provisions was a discrete net tax expense of $5 million in 2019 and $19 million in 2018 and a discrete net tax benefit of $44 million in 2017.Refer to Note 16, Income Taxes, for more information on our annual effective tax rates and Swiss and U.S. tax reform.27Table of ContentsMultiemployer Pension Plan WithdrawalIn the United States, we contribute to multiemployer pension plans based on obligations arising from our collectivebargaining agreements. The most individually significant multiemployer plan we participated in prior to the second quarter of 2018 was the Bakery and Confectionery Union and Industry International Pension Fund (the ""Fund""). Our obligation to contribute to the Fund arose with respect to 8 collective bargaining agreements covering most of our employees represented by the Bakery, Confectionery, Tobacco and Grain Millers Union (""BCTGM""). All of those collective bargaining agreements expired in 2016 and we continued to contribute to the Fund through 2018. In 2018, we executed a complete withdrawal from the Fund and recorded a $429 million estimated withdrawal liability. On July 11, 2019, we received an undiscounted withdrawal liability assessment from the Fund totaling $526 million requiring pro-rata monthly payments over 20 years and we recorded a $35 million final adjustment to reduce our withdrawal liability as of June 30, 2019. We began making monthly payments during the third quarter of 2019. As of December 31, 2019, the remaining discounted withdrawal liability was $391 million, with $14 million recorded in other current liabilities and $377 million recorded in long-term other liabilities.Adoption of New Lease Accounting StandardAs further described in Note 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, we adopted the new lease accounting standard on January 1, 2019. The impact of adopting the standard included the initial recognition as of January 1, 2019, of $710 million of lease-related assets and $730 million of lease-related liabilities on our consolidated balance sheet. The transition method we elected for adoption required a cumulative effect adjustment to retained earnings as of January 1, 2019, which was not material. For additional information on leases, refer to Note 5, Leases.Keurig Dr Pepper TransactionOn July 9, 2018, Keurig Green Mountain, Inc. (""Keurig"") closed on its definitive merger agreement with Dr Pepper Snapple Group, Inc., and formed Keurig Dr Pepper Inc. (NYSE: ""KDP""), a publicly traded company. Following the close of the transaction, our 24.2% investment in Keurig together with our shareholder loan receivable became a 13.8% investment in KDP. During 2018, we recorded a pre-tax gain of $778 million (or $586 million after-tax). Also, during the first quarter of 2019, we recognized a $23 million pre-tax gain related to the impact of a KDP acquisition that decreased our ownership interest from 13.8% to 13.6%. In connection with the KDP transaction, in the third quarter of 2018, we changed our accounting principle to reflect our share of Keurig's historical and KDP's ongoing earnings on a one-quarter lag basis for all periods presented while we continue to record dividends when cash is received. Refer to Note 7, Equity Method Investments, for additional information on KDP and the transaction.Malware IncidentOn June 27, 2017, a global malware incident impacted our business. The malware affected a significant portion of our global sales, distribution and financial networks. Following the incident, we executed business continuity and contingency plans to contain the impact, minimize damages and restore our systems environment. We also restored our main operating systems and processes and enhanced our system security. To date, we have not found, nor do we expect to find, any instances of Company or personal data released externally. During 2017, we estimated the malware incident had a negative impact of 0.4% on our net revenue and Organic Net Revenue growth as we recognized the majority of delayed second quarter shipments in our third quarter 2017 results and we also permanently lost some revenue. We incurred total incremental expenses of $84 million predominantly during the second half of 2017 as part of the recovery effort. The recovery from the incident was largely resolved by the end of 2017 and we continued efforts to strengthen our security measures and enhance general information technology, business process and disclosure controls.28Table of ContentsSummary of Results •Net revenues were approximately $25.9 billion in both 2019 and 2018, a decrease of 0.3% in 2019 and an increase of 0.2% in 2018. In 2019, net revenues declined due to the impact of unfavorable currency translation and the impact of the divestiture of most of our cheese business in the Middle East and Africa. Net revenues were positively affected by higher net pricing and favorable volume/mix, as well as the acquisitions of a majority interest in Perfect Snacks in 2019 and a U.S. premium biscuit company, Tate's Bake Shop, in 2018. In 2018, net revenues grew due to higher net pricing and favorable volume/mix. Net revenues were also positively affected by the acquisition of Tate's Bake Shop. Net revenue growth was negatively affected by the impact of unfavorable currency translation and the impact of several business divestitures that occurred in 2017 which reduced net revenues in 2018 as compared to the prior year.•Organic Net Revenue increased 4.1% to $26.9 billion in 2019 and increased 2.4% to $26.1 billion in 2018. In both 2019 and 2018, Organic Net Revenue increased as a result of higher net pricing and favorable volume/mix. Organic Net Revenue is on a constant currency basis and excludes revenue from divestitures and acquisitions. We use Organic Net Revenue as it provides improved year-over-year comparability of our underlying operating results (see the definition of Organic Net Revenue and our reconciliation with net revenues within Non-GAAP Financial Measures appearing later in this section).•Diluted EPS attributable to Mondelēz International increased 16.2% to $2.65 in 2019 and increased 23.2% to $2.28 in 2018. Diluted EPS increased in 2019 primarily driven by the benefit from Swiss tax reform, lapping the prior-year impact from pension participation changes, operating gains, lower Simplify to Grow program costs, lapping the prior-year loss on debt extinguishment, fewer shares outstanding, a gain on divestiture, an increase in equity method investment earnings, lower interest expense and a benefit from current-year pension participation changes, partially offset by lapping the prior-year gain on equity method investment transactions, unfavorable currency translation, a loss related to interest rate swaps, the expense from the resolution of tax matters in 2019 and an unfavorable year-over-year change in mark-to-market impacts from currency and commodity derivatives. Diluted EPS increased in 2018 primarily driven by the after-tax gain on the KDP transaction, a favorable year-over-year change in mark-to-market impacts from currency and commodity derivatives, operating gains, lower costs incurred for the Simplify to Grow Program, fewer shares outstanding, lower taxes and increased equity method investment earnings, partially offset by the impact from pension participation changes, lapping the benefit from the resolution of tax matters and lapping a prior-year net gain on divestitures. See our Discussion and Analysis of Historical Results appearing later in this section for further details.•Adjusted EPS increased 2.1% to $2.47 in 2019 and increased 14.2% to $2.42 in 2018. On a constant currency basis, Adjusted EPS increased 8.3% to $2.62 in 2019 and increased 15.6% to $2.45 in 2018. For 2019, operating gains, fewer shares outstanding, increased equity method investment earnings, lower interest expense and lower taxes drove the Adjusted EPS growth. For 2018, operating gains, fewer shares outstanding, lower taxes, increased equity method investment earnings and lower interest expense drove the Adjusted EPS growth. Adjusted EPS and Adjusted EPS on a constant currency basis are non-GAAP financial measures. We use these measures as they provide improved year-over-year comparability of our underlying results (see the definition of Adjusted EPS and our reconciliation with diluted EPS within Non-GAAP Financial Measures appearing later in this section).29Table of ContentsFinancial OutlookWe seek to achieve profitable, long-term growth and manage our business to attain this goal using our key operating metrics: Organic Net Revenue, Adjusted Operating Income and Adjusted EPS. We use these non-GAAP financial metrics and related computations, particularly growth in profit dollars, to evaluate and manage our business and to plan and make near-and long-term operating and strategic decisions. As such, we believe these metrics are useful to investors as they provide supplemental information in addition to our U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (“U.S. GAAP”) financial results. We believe it is useful to provide investors with the same financial information that we use internally to make comparisons of our historical operating results, identify trends in our underlying operating results and evaluate our business. We believe our non-GAAP financial measures should always be considered in relation to our GAAP results. We have provided reconciliations between our GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures in Non-GAAP Financial Measures, which appears later in this section.In addition to monitoring our key operating metrics, we monitor a number of developments and trends that could impact our revenue and profitability objectives.Long-Term Demographics and Consumer Trends – Snack food consumption is highly correlated to GDP growth, urbanization of populations and rising discretionary income levels associated with a growing middle class, particularly in emerging markets. Snacking behavior is on the rise around the world according to the first annual “State of Snacking” report, commissioned by Mondelēz International and issued in November 2019, which summarizes the findings from interviews with thousands of consumers across 12 countries. A majority of adults, and an even higher percentage of Millennial consumers, indicated they prefer to eat small bites throughout the day as opposed to larger meals. The report concludes that consumer needs are evolving in response to busy modern lifestyles, the desire for community connections and a more holistic sense of well-being. Also, the way consumers snack and buy snacks around the world is diverse, with consumers purchasing snacks across evolving retail and digital landscapes. We expect these trends to continue and, in order to position ourselves for long-term growth, we are investing in our well-being and other snack offerings, product and marketing innovation and new routes to market including e-commerce.Demand – We monitor consumer spending and our market share within the food and beverage categories in which we sell our products. Over the last three years, we have been seeing improvements in regional economic growth, consumer confidence and growth in our categories. However, geopolitical and economic uncertainties from time to time may continue to affect economic growth, consumer confidence and category growth. As part of our new strategic plan, we seek to drive category growth by offering snack innovations, leveraging our local and consumer-focused commercial approach, making investments in our brand and snacks portfolio, building strong routes to market in both emerging and developed markets and improving our position across multiple channels. We believe these actions will help drive demand in our categories and strengthen our positions across markets.Volatility of Global Markets – Our growth strategy depends in part on our ability to expand our operations, including in emerging markets. Some emerging markets have greater political, economic and currency volatility and greater vulnerability to infrastructure and labor disruptions. Volatility in these markets affects demand for and the costs of our products and requires frequent changes in how we operate our business. See below for a discussion of Brexit as well as Argentina, which was designated a highly inflationary economy in 2018. In addition, the imposition of increased or new tariffs, quotas, trade barriers or similar restrictions on our sales or key commodities and potential changes in U.S. trade programs, trade relations, regulations, taxes or fiscal policies might negatively affect our sales or profitability. To help mitigate adverse effects of ongoing volatility across markets, we aim to protect profitability through the management of costs (including hedging) and pricing as well as targeted investments in our brands and new routes to market.Coronavirus – We have been monitoring the outbreak of a new coronavirus that originated in China. We believe it could have a negative impact on our results in the short term and we are taking steps to protect our employees, consumers and business.Competition – We operate in highly competitive markets that include global, regional and local competitors. Our advantaged geographic footprint, operating scale and portfolio of brands have all significantly contributed to building our market-leading positions across most of the product categories in which we sell. To grow and maintain our market positions, we focus on meeting consumer needs and preferences through a local-first commercial focus, new digital and other sales and marketing initiatives, product innovation and high standards of product quality. We 30Table of Contentsalso continue to optimize our manufacturing and other operations and invest in our brands through ongoing research and development, advertising, marketing and consumer promotions.Pricing – Our net revenue growth and profitability may be affected as we adjust prices to address new conditions. We adjust our product prices based on a number of variables including demand, the competitive environment and changes in our product input costs. We generally have increased prices in response to higher commodity costs, currency and other market factors. In 2020, we anticipate changing market conditions to continue to impact pricing. Price changes may affect net revenues or market share in the near term as the market adjusts to changes in input costs and other market conditions.Operating Costs – Our operating costs include raw materials, labor, selling, general and administrative expenses, taxes, currency impacts and financing costs. We manage these costs through cost saving and productivity initiatives, sourcing and hedging programs, pricing actions, refinancing and tax planning. To remain competitive on our operating structure, we continue to work on programs to expand our profitability, such as our Simplify to Grow Program, which is designed to bring about significant reductions in our operating cost structure in both our supply chain and overhead costs. Multiemployer pension plan – In 2018, we executed a complete withdrawal from the Fund and recorded a $429 million estimated withdrawal liability. On July 11, 2019, we received an undiscounted withdrawal liability assessment from the Fund totaling $526 million and we recorded a $35 million final adjustment to reduce our withdrawal liability at that time. During the third quarter of 2019, we began making monthly pro-rata payments on the 20-year obligation. As of December 31, 2019, the remaining discounted withdrawal liability was $391 million.Taxes – During the third quarter of 2019, Swiss Federal and Zurich Cantonal tax events drove our recognition of a $767 million Swiss tax reform net benefit to our results of operations. The future tax rate impacts of the Swiss tax reform law changes became effective on January 1, 2020 and are not expected to have a material impact on our overall results of operations. We will continue to monitor Swiss tax reform for any additional interpretative guidance that could result in changes to the amounts we have recorded. In the United States, while the 2017 U.S. tax reform reduced the U.S. corporate tax rate and included some beneficial provisions, other provisions have, and in the future will have, an adverse effect on our results. We continue to evaluate the impacts as additional guidance on implementing the legislation becomes available. While additional guidance has been issued by the IRS and the U.S. Treasury Department, there are still some areas that may not be clarified for some time. Also, a number of U.S. states have not updated their laws to take into account the new federal legislation. As a result, there may be additional impacts of the new laws on our future results of operations and financial condition. It is possible that U.S. tax reform or related interpretations could change and have an adverse effect on us that could be material.Currency – As a global company with 74.4% of our net revenues generated outside the United States, we are continually exposed to changes in global economic conditions and currency movements. While we hedge significant forecasted currency exchange transactions as well as currency translation impacts from certain net assets of our non-U.S. operations, including the United Kingdom, we cannot fully predict or eliminate all adverse impacts arising from changes in currency exchange rates on our consolidated financial results. To partially offset currency translation impacts arising from our overseas operations, we enter into net investment hedges primarily in the form of local currency-denominated debt, cross-currency swaps and other financial instruments. While we work to mitigate our exposure to currency risks, factors such as continued global and local market volatility, actions by foreign governments, political uncertainty, limited hedging opportunities and other factors could lead to unfavorable currency impacts in the future and could adversely affect our results of operations or financial position. See additional discussion of Brexit and Argentina below and refer also to Note 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies – Currency Translation and Highly Inflationary Accounting, and Note 10, Financial Instruments, for additional information on how we manage currency and related risks. As currency movements can make comparison of year-over-year operating performance challenging, we isolate the impact of currency and also report growth on a constant currency basis, holding prior-year currency exchange rates constant, so that prior-year and current-year results can be compared on a consistent basis.Brexit – On January 31, 2020, the United Kingdom began the withdrawal process from the European Union under the European and U.K. Parliament approved Withdrawal Agreement. During a transition period currently scheduled to end on December 31, 2020, the United Kingdom will effectively remain in the E.U.’s customs union and single market while a trade deal with the European Union is negotiated. The deadline for extending the transition period ends on June 30, 2020. If the transition period is not extended, on December 31, 2020, the United Kingdom will either exit the European Union without a trade deal or will begin a new trade relationship with the European Union. 31Table of ContentsDuring the transition period, we continue to take protective measures in response to the potential impacts on our results of operations and financial condition. Our exposure to disruptions to our supply chain, the imposition of tariffs and currency devaluation in the United Kingdom could result in a material impact to our consolidated revenue, earnings and cash flow. In 2019, we generated 8.6% of our net revenues in the United Kingdom and our supply chain in this market relies on imports of raw and packaging materials as well as finished goods. Following the Brexit vote in June 2016, there was significant volatility in the global stock markets and currency exchange rates. The value of the British pound sterling relative to the U.S. dollar declined significantly and negatively affected our translated results reported in U.S. dollars. The volatility in foreign currencies and other markets is expected to continue as the United Kingdom executes its exit from the European Union. If the U.K.'s membership in the European Union terminates without trade and other cross-border operating agreements, there could be increased costs from re-imposition of tariffs on trade between the United Kingdom and other countries, including those in the European Union, shipping delays because of the need for customs inspections and procedures and shortages of certain goods. The United Kingdom will also need to negotiate its own tax and trade treaties with countries all over the world, which could take years to complete. If the ultimate terms of the U.K.’s separation from the European Union negatively impact the U.K. economy or result in disruptions to sales or our supply chain, the impact to our results of operations and financial condition could be material. We have taken measures to increase our resources in customer service & logistics together with increasing our inventory levels of imported raw materials, packaging and finished goods in the United Kingdom to help us manage through the Brexit transition and the inherent risks. Resulting impacts and market volatility can vary significantly depending on the final terms of the U.K.’s exit from the European Union.Argentina – as further discussed in Note 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies – Currency Translation and Highly Inflationary Accounting, on July 1, 2018, we began to apply highly inflationary accounting for our Argentinean subsidiaries. As a result, we recorded a remeasurement gain of $4 million in 2019 and a remeasurement loss of $11 million in 2018 within selling, general and administrative expenses related to the revaluation of the Argentinean peso denominated net monetary position over these periods. The mix of monetary assets and liabilities and the exchange rate to convert Argentinean pesos to U.S. dollars could change over time, so it is difficult to predict the overall impact of the Argentina highly inflationary accounting on future net earnings. Financing Costs – We regularly evaluate our variable and fixed-rate debt. We continue to use low-cost, short- and long-term debt to finance our ongoing working capital, capital expenditures and other investments, dividends and share repurchases. Our weighted-average interest rate on our total debt as of December 31, 2019 was 2.2%, down from 2.3% as of December 31, 2018 and up from 2.1% as of December 31, 2017, primarily reflecting changes in our interest rates on commercial paper borrowings over these periods. We continue to use interest rate swaps and other financial instruments to manage our exposure to interest rate and cash flow variability, protect the value of our existing currency assets and liabilities and protect the value of our debt. We also enter into cross-currency interest rate swaps and forwards to hedge our non-U.S. net investments against adverse movements in exchange rates. Our net investment hedge derivative contracts have had and are expected to have a favorable impact and reduce some of the financing costs and related currency impacts within our interest costs. Refer to Note 9, Debt and Borrowing Arrangements, and Note 10, Financial Instruments, for additional information on our debt and derivative activity. Cybersecurity Risks – In 2017, the malware incident impacted our operating systems and results. We continue to devote focused resources to network security, backup and disaster recovery, enhanced training and other security measures to protect our systems and data. We also focus on enhancing the monitoring and detection of threats in our environment, including but not limited to the manufacturing environment and operational technologies, as well as adjusting information security controls based on updated threats. While we have taken a number of security measures to protect our systems and data, security measures cannot provide absolute certainty or guarantee that we will be successful in preventing or responding to every breach or disruption on a timely basis. 32Table of ContentsDiscussion and Analysis of Historical ResultsItems Affecting Comparability of Financial ResultsThe following table includes significant income or (expense) items that affected the comparability of our results of operations and our effective tax rates.

Emerging markets net revenues increased 0.2%, including an unfavorable currency impact, and emerging markets Organic Net Revenue increased 7.7%. The underlying changes in net revenues and Organic Net Revenue are detailed below: 2019Change in net revenues (by percentage point) Total change in net revenues(0.3)%Add back the following items affecting comparability: Unfavorable currency4.5 ppImpact of divestiture0.3 ppImpact of acquisitions(0.4)ppTotal change in Organic Net Revenue (1)4.1 %Higher net pricing2.2 ppFavorable volume/mix1.9 pp (1)Please see the Non-GAAP Financial Measures section at the end of this item.Net revenue decrease of 0.3% was driven by unfavorable currency and the impact of a divestiture, partially offset by our underlying Organic Net Revenue growth of 4.1% and the impact of acquisitions. Unfavorable currency impacts decreased net revenues by $1,154 million, due primarily to the strength of the U.S. dollar relative to most currencies, including the Argentinean peso, euro, Brazilian real, British pound sterling, Australian dollar, Chinese yuan, Indian rupee, Turkish lira and South African rand. The impact of the divestiture of most of our cheese business in the Middle East and Africa on May 28, 2019 resulted in a year-over-year decline in net revenues of $71 million. Our underlying Organic Net Revenue growth was driven by higher net pricing and favorable volume/mix. Net pricing was up, which includes the benefit of carryover pricing from 2018 as well as the effects of input cost-driven pricing actions taken during 2019. Higher net pricing was reflected in Latin America, North America and AMEA as net pricing in Europe was flat. Favorable volume/mix was reflected in Europe and AMEA, partially offset by unfavorable volume/mix in Latin America and North America. The July 16, 2019 acquisition of a majority interest in Perfect Snacks added net revenues of $53 million and the June 7, 2018 acquisition of Tate’s Bake Shop added incremental net revenues of $35 million in 2019.

Higher net pricing, which included the carryover impact of pricing actions taken in 2018 as well as the effects of input cost-driven pricing actions taken during 2019, was reflected in Latin America, North America and AMEA as net pricing in Europe was flat. The increase in input costs was driven by higher raw material costs, partially offset by lower manufacturing costs due to productivity efforts. Higher raw material costs were in part due to higher currency exchange transaction costs on imported materials, as well as higher packaging, energy, dairy, grains, cocoa and oils costs, partially offset by lower costs for sugar and nuts. Favorable volume/mix was driven by Europe and AMEA, which was partially offset by unfavorable volume/mix in Latin America and North America. Total selling, general and administrative expenses decreased $339 million from 2018, due to a number of factors noted in the table above, including in part, the lapping of the prior-year impact from pension participation changes, favorable currency impact, the benefit from current-year pension participation changes, favorable change in remeasurement on net monetary position in Argentina (remeasurement gain in 2019 as compared to a remeasurement loss in 2018), the lapping of a prior-year expense from the resolution of a tax matter, lower CEO transition remuneration and lower acquisition-related costs. These decreases were partially offset by the expenses from the resolution of tax matters in 2019, higher implementation costs incurred for the Simplify to Grow program, the impact of acquisitions, the lapping of a benefit from a prior-year value-added tax (“VAT”) related settlement, a VAT cost settlement in 2019 and higher divestiture-related costs. Excluding these factors, selling, general and administrative expenses increased $173 million from 2018. The increase was driven primarily by higher overheads reflecting route-to-market investments and higher advertising and consumer promotion costs. We recorded an expense of $11 million from a VAT-related settlement in Latin America in 2019 and a benefit of $21 million from a VAT-related settlement in Latin America in 2018. Unfavorable currency changes decreased operating income by $227 million due primarily to the strength of the U.S. dollar relative to most currencies, including the euro, Argentinean peso, British pound sterling, Brazilian real, Australian dollar, Chinese yuan and Indian rupee.Operating income margin increased from 12.8% in 2018 to 14.9% in 2019. The increase in operating income margin was driven primarily by the lapping of the prior-year impact from pension participation changes, lower Simplify to Grow Program costs, a gain on divestiture, the benefit from current-year pension participation changes, the lapping of a prior-year expense from the resolution of a tax matter and lower CEO transition remuneration, partially offset by the expenses from the resolution of tax matters in 2019 and the year-over-year unfavorable change in mark-to-market gains/(losses) from currency and commodity hedging activities. Adjusted Operating Income margin decreased from 16.7% in 2018 to 16.5% in 2019. The decrease in Adjusted Operating Income margin was driven primarily by higher raw material costs, mostly offset by higher pricing and lower manufacturing costs.36Table of ContentsNet Earnings and Earnings per Share Attributable to Mondelēz International – Net earnings attributable to Mondelēz International of $3,870 million increased by $489 million (14.5%) in 2019.

Our underlying Organic Net Revenue growth was driven by higher net pricing and favorable volume/mix. Net pricing was up, which includes the benefit of carryover pricing from 2017 as well as the effects of input cost-driven pricing actions taken during 2018. Higher net pricing was reflected in Latin America, AMEA and North America, partially offset by lower net pricing in Europe. Favorable volume/mix was reflected in Europe and AMEA, partially offset by unfavorable volume/mix in Latin America and North America. The June 7, 2018 acquisition of a U.S. premium biscuit company, Tate’s Bake Shop, added net revenues of $52 million in 2018. Unfavorable currency impacts decreased net revenues by $343 million, due primarily to the strength of the U.S. dollar relative to several other currencies, including the Argentinean peso, Brazilian real, Russian ruble, Indian rupee and Turkish lira, partially offset by the strength of several currencies relative to the U.S. dollar, including the euro, British pound sterling and Chinese yuan. Businesses divested in 2019 and 2017 resulted in a decline in net revenues of $276 million.

Higher net pricing, which included the carryover impact of pricing actions taken in 2017 as well as the effects of input cost-driven pricing actions taken during 2018, was reflected across all regions except Europe. The increase in input costs was driven by higher raw material costs, mostly offset by lower manufacturing costs due to productivity efforts. Higher raw material costs were primarily due to higher currency exchange transaction costs on imported materials, as well as higher packaging, dairy and energy, partially offset primarily by lower cocoa costs. Favorable volume/mix was driven by Europe and AMEA, which was partially offset by unfavorable volume/mix in North America and Latin America.Total selling, general and administrative expenses increased $537 million from 2017, due to a number of factors noted in the table above, including in part, the impact from pension participation changes, lapping of prior-year benefits from the resolution of tax matters, lapping of a prior-year property insurance recovery, acquisition-related costs, remeasurement of net monetary position in Argentina, the impact of an acquisition and higher CEO transition remuneration. The increases were partially offset by favorable currency impact, lower implementation costs incurred for the Simplify to Grow Program, lower divestiture-related costs, the lapping of prior-year malware incident incremental costs, a VAT related settlement in 2018, the impact of divestitures and the net benefit from the resolution of tax matters in 2018. Excluding these factors, selling, general and administrative expenses increased $75 million from 2017. The increase was driven by the year-over year net unfavorable change in miscellaneous other income and expense items within selling, general and administrative expenses and higher overhead costs, which more than offset lower advertising and consumer promotion costs. We recorded a benefit of $21 million from a VAT-related settlement in Latin America in 2018. We recorded a benefit of $27 million from an insurance recovery in AMEA in 2017. Unfavorable currency changes decreased operating income by $55 million due primarily to the strength of the U.S. dollar relative to several currencies, including the Brazilian real, Argentinean peso, Russian ruble and Turkish lira, partially offset by the strength of several currencies relative to the U.S. dollar, including the euro and British pound sterling.Operating income margin decreased from 13.4% in 2017 to 12.8% in 2018. The decrease in operating income margin was driven by the impact from pension participation changes, the lapping of prior-year benefits from the resolution of tax matters, the lapping of a prior-year gain on divestiture and higher CEO transition remuneration. These unfavorable items were partially offset by the year-over-year favorable change in mark-to-market gains/(losses) from currency and commodity hedging activities, lower Simplify to Grow Program costs, an increase in our Adjusted Operating Income margin, the lapping of prior-year malware incident incremental costs, lower divestiture-related costs and lower intangible asset impairment charges. Adjusted Operating Income margin increased from 16.0% in 2017 to 16.7% in 2018. The increase in Adjusted Operating Income margin was driven primarily by higher net pricing, lower manufacturing costs due to continued cost reduction efforts and lower advertising and consumer promotion costs, partially offset by higher raw material costs.41Table of ContentsNet Earnings and Earnings per Share Attributable to Mondelēz International – Net earnings attributable to Mondelēz International of $3,381 million increased by $553 million (19.6%) in 2018.

Unfavorable currency impacts were due primarily to the strength of the U.S. dollar relative to most currencies in the region including the Argentinean peso and Brazilian real. Unfavorable volume/mix was due to the impact of pricing-related elasticity, and was driven by declines in refreshment beverages, candy, cheese & grocery and chocolate, partially offset by gains in biscuits and gum. Higher net pricing was reflected across all categories, driven primarily by Argentina, Brazil and Mexico.Segment operating income decreased $69 million (16.8%), primarily due to higher raw material costs, unfavorable currency, unfavorable volume/mix, the lapping of the 2018 benefit from the resolution of a Brazilian indirect tax matter of $26 million, higher manufacturing costs and higher other selling, general and administrative expenses (including lapping the benefit from a VAT-related settlement in 2018 and the expense of a VAT-related settlement in 2019). These unfavorable items were partially offset by higher net pricing, lower costs incurred for the Simplify to Grow Program, favorable change in remeasurement on net monetary position in Argentina (remeasurement gain in 2019 as compared to a remeasurement loss in 2018) and lower advertising and consumer promotion costs.2018 compared with 2017:Net revenues decreased $364 million (10.2%), due to unfavorable currency (13.8 pp) and unfavorable volume/mix (2.6 pp), partially offset by higher net pricing (6.2 pp). Unfavorable currency impacts were due primarily to the strength of the U.S. dollar relative to most currencies in the region including the Argentinean peso, Brazilian real and Mexican peso. Unfavorable volume/mix was due primarily to the impact of pricing-related elasticity, as well as in part due to the negative impact of the Brazil trucking strike that occurred in the second quarter. Unfavorable volume/mix was driven by declines in all categories except biscuits. Higher net pricing was reflected across all categories, driven primarily by Argentina, Mexico and Brazil.Segment operating income decreased $154 million (27.3%), primarily due to lapping last year's benefit from the resolution of a Brazilian indirect tax matter of $153 million, higher raw material costs, unfavorable currency, higher other selling, general and administrative expenses (net of the benefit from a VAT-related settlement in 2018), unfavorable volume/mix and a loss from the remeasurement of the net monetary position in Argentina. These unfavorable items were partially offset by higher net pricing, lower manufacturing costs, the 2018 benefit from the resolution of a Brazilian tax matter of $26 million, lower advertising and consumer promotion costs, lower costs incurred for the Simplify to Grow Program and the lapping of the 2017 intangible asset impairment charges.45Table of ContentsAMEA For the Years EndedDecember 31, 2019 2018 $ change % change (in millions) Net revenues$5,770 $5,729 $41 0.7 %Segment operating income691 702 (11) (1.6)% For the Years EndedDecember 31, 2018 2017 $ change % change (in millions) Net revenues$5,729 $5,739 $(10) (0.2)%Segment operating income702 514 188 36.6 %2019 compared with 2018:Net revenues increased $41 million (0.7%), due to favorable volume/mix (3.6 pp) and higher net pricing (1.7 pp), mostly offset by unfavorable currency (3.3 pp) and the impact of a divestiture (1.3 pp). Favorable volume/mix was driven by gains across all categories except refreshment beverages and candy. Higher net pricing was reflected across all categories. Unfavorable currency impacts were due to the strength of the U.S. dollar relative to several currencies in the region, including the Australian dollar, Chinese yuan, Indian rupee and South African rand. The divestiture of most of our cheese business in the Middle East and Africa on May 28, 2019, resulted in a year-over-year decline in net revenues of $71 million.Segment operating income decreased $11 million (1.6%), primarily due to higher raw material costs, expenses from the resolution of tax matters in India totaling $87 million, higher advertising and consumer promotion costs, unfavorable currency, higher other selling, general and administrative expenses, the impact of the divestiture and higher intangible asset impairment charges. These unfavorable items were partially offset by lower manufacturing costs, higher net pricing, lower costs incurred for the Simplify to Grow Program and favorable volume/mix. 2018 compared with 2017:Net revenues decreased $10 million (0.2%), due to the impact of divestitures (2.6 pp) and unfavorable currency (1.3 pp), partially offset by favorable volume/mix (2.2 pp) and higher net pricing (1.5 pp). The impact of divestitures related to most of our cheese business in the Middle East and Africa on May 28, 2019, the grocery & cheese business in Australia and New Zealand that was divested on July 4, 2017 and the confectionery business in Japan that was divested on December 28, 2017, and resulted in a year-over-year decline in net revenues of $139 million for 2018. Unfavorable currency impacts were due primarily to the strength of the U.S. dollar relative to several currencies in the region, including the Indian rupee, Australian dollar and Philippine peso, partially offset by the strength of several currencies in the region relative to the U.S. dollar, including the Chinese yuan and Japanese yen. Favorable volume/mix was driven by gains in chocolate and biscuits, including the shift of volume into the first quarter of 2018 due to the timing of Chinese New Year, partially offset by declines in refreshment beverages, cheese & grocery, gum and candy. Higher net pricing was reflected across all categories except gum and candy. Segment operating income increased $188 million (36.6%), primarily due to higher net pricing, lower costs incurred for the Simplify to Grow Program, lower manufacturing costs, lower intangible asset impairment charges, lower advertising and consumer promotion costs and favorable volume/mix. These favorable items were partially offset by higher raw material costs, the impact of divestitures, unfavorable currency and higher other selling, general and administrative expenses (net of prior-year property insurance recovery).46Table of ContentsEurope For the Years EndedDecember 31, 2019 2018 $ change % change (in millions) Net revenues$9,972 $10,122 $(150) (1.5)%Segment operating income1,732 1,734 (2) (0.1)% For the Years EndedDecember 31, 2018 2017 $ change % change (in millions) Net revenues$10,122 $9,794 $328 3.3 %Segment operating income1,734 1,610 124 7.7 %2019 compared with 2018:Net revenues decreased $150 million (1.5%), due to unfavorable currency (5.2 pp), partially offset by favorable volume/mix (3.7 pp), as net pricing was flat.

Favorable currency impacts reflected the strength of several currencies relative to the U.S. dollar, primarily the euro, British pound sterling, Polish zloty and Czech koruna, partially offset by the strength of the U.S. dollar relative to several currencies, primarily the Russian ruble and Turkish lira. The impact of divestitures, due to the sale of a confectionery business in France and the termination of certain Kraft Heinz Company-owned grocery brand licenses, resulted in a year-over-year decline in net revenues of $137 million for 2018. Lower net pricing was driven by chocolate and biscuits, partially offset by higher net pricing in cheese & grocery, candy and gum.Segment operating income increased $124 million (7.7%), primarily due to favorable volume/mix, lower manufacturing costs, lower costs incurred for the Simplify to Grow Program, favorable currency, lower raw material costs, lower divestiture-related costs and the lapping of prior-year malware incident incremental costs. These favorable items were partially offset by higher advertising and consumer promotion costs, higher other selling, general and administrative expenses, lower net pricing, lapping the prior-year benefit from the settlement of a Cadbury tax matter, higher intangible asset impairment charges and the impact from divestitures.47Table of ContentsNorth America For the Years EndedDecember 31, 2019 2018 $ change % change (in millions) Net revenues$7,108 $6,885 $223 3.2 %Segment operating income1,451 849 602 70.9 % For the Years EndedDecember 31, 2018 2017 $ change % change (in millions) Net revenues$6,885 $6,797 $88 1.3 %Segment operating income849 1,144 (295) (25.8)%2019 compared with 2018:Net revenues increased $223 million (3.2%), due to higher net pricing (2.3 pp) and the impact of acquisitions (1.3 pp), partially offset by unfavorable currency (0.3 pp) and unfavorable volume/mix (0.1 pp).

The preparation of these financial statements requires the use of estimates, judgments and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the periods presented. Actual results could differ from those estimates and assumptions. Note 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, to the consolidated financial statements includes a summary of the significant accounting policies we used to prepare our consolidated financial statements. We have discussed the selection and disclosure of our critical accounting policies and estimates with our Audit Committee. The following is a review of our most significant assumptions and estimates.Goodwill and Non-Amortizable Intangible Assets:We test goodwill and non-amortizable intangible assets for impairment on an annual basis on July 1. We assess goodwill impairment risk throughout the year by performing a qualitative review of entity-specific, industry, market and general economic factors affecting our goodwill reporting units. We review our operating segment and reporting unit structure for goodwill testing annually or as significant changes in the organization occur. Annually, we may perform qualitative testing, or depending on factors such as prior-year test results, current year developments, current risk evaluations and other practical considerations, we may elect to do quantitative testing instead. In our quantitative testing, we compare a reporting unit’s estimated fair value with its carrying value. We estimate a reporting unit’s fair value using a discounted cash flow method which incorporates planned growth rates, market-based discount rates and estimates of residual value. This year, for our Europe and North America reporting units, we used a market-based, weighted-average cost of capital of 5.9% to discount the projected cash flows of those operations. For our Latin America and AMEA reporting units, we used a risk-rated discount rate of 8.9%. Estimating the fair value of individual reporting units requires us to make assumptions and estimates regarding our future plans and industry and economic conditions, and our actual results and conditions may differ over time. If the carrying value of a reporting unit’s net assets exceeds its fair value, we would recognize an impairment charge for the amount by which the carrying value exceeds the reporting unit fair value.In 2019, 2018 and 2017, there were no impairments of goodwill. In connection with our 2019 annual impairment testing, each of our reporting units had sufficient fair value in excess of carrying value. While all reporting units passed our annual impairment testing, if planned business performance expectations are not met or specific valuation factors outside of our control, such as discount rates, change significantly, then the estimated fair values of a reporting unit or reporting units might decline and lead to a goodwill impairment in the future.Annually, we assess non-amortizable intangible assets for impairment by performing a qualitative review and assessing events and circumstances that could affect the fair value or carrying value of the indefinite-lived intangible assets. If significant potential impairment risk exists for a specific asset, we quantitatively test it for impairment by comparing its estimated fair value with its carrying value. We determine estimated fair value using planned growth rates, market-based discount rates and estimates of royalty rates. If the carrying value of the asset exceeds its estimated fair value, the asset is impaired and its carrying value is reduced to the estimated fair value.During our 2019 annual testing of non-amortizable intangible assets, we recorded $57 million of impairment charges in the third quarter of 2019 related to nine brands. The impairments arose due to lower than expected brand earnings growth. We recorded charges related to gum, chocolate, biscuits and candy brands of $39 million in Europe, $15 million in AMEA and $3 million in Latin America. The impairment charges were calculated as the excess of the carrying value over the estimated fair value of the intangible assets on a global basis and were recorded within asset impairment and exit costs. We use several accepted valuation methods, including relief of royalty, excess earnings and excess margin, that utilize estimates of future sales, earnings growth rates, royalty rates and discount rates in determining a brand's global fair value. We also identified fourteen brands, including the nine impaired brands, with $635 million of aggregate book value as of December 31, 2019 that each had a fair value in excess of book value of 10% or less. We believe our current plans for each of these brands will allow them to not be impaired, but if the brand earnings expectations are not met or specific valuation factors outside of our control, such as discount rates, change significantly, then a brand or brands could become impaired in the future. In 2018, we recorded charges related to gum, chocolate, biscuits and candy brands of $45 million in Europe, $14 million in North America and $9 million in AMEA. In 2017, we recorded charges related to candy and gum brands of $52 million in AMEA, $11 million in Europe, $5 million in Latin America and $2 million in North America.Refer to Note 6, Goodwill and Intangible Assets, for additional information.49Table of ContentsTrade and marketing programs:We promote our products with trade and sales incentives as well as marketing and advertising programs. These programs include, but are not limited to, new product introduction fees, discounts, coupons, rebates and volume-based incentives as well as cooperative advertising, in-store displays and consumer marketing promotions. Trade and sales incentives are recorded as a reduction to revenues based on amounts estimated due to customers and consumers at the end of a period. We base these estimates principally on historical utilization and redemption rates. For interim reporting purposes, advertising and consumer promotion expenses are charged to operations as a percentage of volume, based on estimated sales volume and estimated program spending. We do not defer costs on our year-end consolidated balance sheet and all marketing and advertising costs are recorded as an expense in the year incurred.Employee Benefit Plans:We sponsor various employee benefit plans throughout the world. These include primarily pension plans and postretirement healthcare benefits. For accounting purposes, we estimate the pension and postretirement healthcare benefit obligations utilizing assumptions and estimates for discount rates; expected returns on plan assets; expected compensation increases; employee-related factors such as turnover, retirement age and mortality; and health care cost trends. We review our actuarial assumptions on an annual basis and make modifications to the assumptions based on current rates and trends when appropriate. Our assumptions also reflect our historical experiences and management’s best judgment regarding future expectations. These and other assumptions affect the annual expense and obligations recognized for the underlying plans.As permitted by U.S. GAAP, we generally amortize the effect of changes in the assumptions over future periods. The cost or benefit of plan changes, such as increasing or decreasing benefits for prior employee service (prior service cost), is deferred and included in expense on a straight-line basis over the average remaining service period of the employees expected to receive benefits.Since pension and postretirement liabilities are measured on a discounted basis, the discount rate significantly affects our plan obligations and expenses. For plans that have assets held in trust, the expected return on plan assets assumption affects our pension plan expenses. The assumptions for discount rates and expected rates of return and our process for setting these assumptions are described in Note 11, Benefit Plans, to the consolidated financial statements.While we do not anticipate further changes in the 2020 assumptions for our U.S. and non-U.S. pension and postretirement health care plans, as a sensitivity measure, a fifty-basis point change in our discount rates or the expected rate of return on plan assets would have the following effects, increase/(decrease), on our annual benefit plan costs: As of December 31, 2019 U.S. Plans Non-U.S. PlansFifty-Basis-Point Fifty-Basis-Point Increase Decrease Increase Decrease (in millions)Effect of change in discount rate on pension costs$(14) $15 $(30) $62Effect of change in expected rate of return on plan assets on pension costs(8) 8 (48) 48Effect of change in discount rate on postretirement health care costs(3) 3 — —In accordance with obligations we have under collective bargaining agreements, we participate in multiemployer pension plans. In 2017, the only individually significant multiemployer plan we contributed to was the Bakery and Confectionery Union and Industry International Pension Fund. Our obligation to contribute to the Fund arose with respect to 8 collective bargaining agreements covering most of our employees represented by the BCTGM. All of those collective bargaining agreements expired in 2016. In 2018, we executed a complete withdrawal from the Fund and recorded a $429 million estimated withdrawal liability. On July 11, 2019, we received an undiscounted withdrawal liability assessment from the Fund totaling $526 million requiring pro-rata monthly payments over 20 years and we recorded a $35 million final adjustment to reduce our withdrawal liability as of June 30, 2019. We 50Table of Contentsbegan making monthly payments during the third quarter of 2019. As of December 31, 2019, the remaining discounted withdrawal liability was $391 million.See additional information on our employee benefit plans in Note 11, Benefit Plans.Income Taxes:As a global company, we calculate and provide for income taxes in each tax jurisdiction in which we operate. The provision for income taxes includes the amounts payable or refundable for the current year, the effect of deferred taxes and impacts from uncertain tax positions. Our provision for income taxes is significantly affected by shifts in the geographic mix of our pre-tax earnings across tax jurisdictions, changes in tax laws and regulations, tax planning opportunities available in each tax jurisdiction and the ultimate outcome of various tax audits.Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between the financial statement and tax bases of our assets and liabilities and for operating losses and tax credit carryforwards. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates that will apply to taxable income in the years in which those differences are expected to be recovered or settled. Valuation allowances are established for deferred tax assets when it is more likely than not that a tax benefit will not be realized.We believe our tax positions comply with applicable tax laws and that we have properly accounted for uncertain tax positions. We recognize tax benefits in our financial statements from uncertain tax positions only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained by the taxing authorities based on the technical merits of the position. The amount we recognize is measured as the largest amount of benefit that is greater than 50 percent likely of being realized upon resolution. We evaluate uncertain tax positions on an ongoing basis and adjust the amount recognized in light of changing facts and circumstances, such as the progress of a tax audit or expiration of a statute of limitations. We believe the estimates and assumptions used to support our evaluation of uncertain tax positions are reasonable. However, final determination of historical tax liabilities, whether by settlement with tax authorities, judicial or administrative ruling or due to expiration of statutes of limitations, could be materially different from estimates reflected on our consolidated balance sheet and historical income tax provisions. The outcome of these final determinations could have a material effect on our provision for income taxes, net earnings or cash flows in the period in which the determination is made.As a result of Swiss and U.S. tax reform and the related SEC guidance, we finalized our accounting for the legislation based on guidance issued prior to 2019 year end. See Note 16, Income Taxes, for further discussion of the amounts recorded related to Swiss and U.S. tax reform in our financial statements, as well as additional information on our effective tax rate, current and deferred taxes, valuation allowances and unrecognized tax benefits.Contingencies:See Note 14, Commitments and Contingencies, to the consolidated financial statements.New Accounting Guidance:See Note 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, to the consolidated financial statements for a discussion of new accounting standards.51Table of ContentsLiquidity and Capital ResourcesWe believe that cash from operations, our revolving credit facilities, short-term borrowings and our authorized long-term financing will provide sufficient liquidity for our working capital needs, planned capital expenditures and future payments of our U.S. tax reform transition tax liability, contractual and benefit plan obligations, share repurchases and quarterly dividends. We continue to utilize our commercial paper program, international credit lines and long-term debt issuances for our funding requirements. We also use intercompany loans with our international subsidiaries to improve financial flexibility. Overall, we do not expect any negative effects to our funding sources that would have a material effect on our liquidity.Net Cash Provided by Operating Activities:Operating activities provided net cash of $3,965 million in 2019, $3,948 million in 2018 and $2,593 million in 2017. The increase in net cash provided by operating activities in 2019 relative to 2018 was due primarily to higher earnings, increased distributions from equity method investments and lower pension contributions, partially offset by increased working capital requirements including higher tax payments. Cash flows from operating activities were higher in 2018 than 2017 primarily due to higher cash flow from working capital, higher net earnings as well as lower pension contributions.Net Cash Used in Investing Activities:Net cash used in investing activities was $960 million in 2019, $1,224 million in 2018 and $301 million in 2017. The decrease in net cash used in investing activities in 2019 relative to 2018 was primarily due to less cash expended for acquisitions in 2019 than in 2018, lower capital expenditures and the 2019 cash proceeds from the divestiture of primarily our cheese business in the Middle East and Africa, partially offset by lower cash received as a result of the settlement and replacement of several net investment hedge derivative contracts and cash paid to settle our forward-starting interest rate swaps. The increase in net cash used in investing activities in 2018 relative to 2017 was primarily due to cash received in 2017 from proceeds from divestitures, cash expenditures in 2018 for an acquisition and higher capital expenditures in 2018, partially offset by cash received as a result of the settlement and replacement of several net investment hedge derivative contracts.Capital expenditures were $925 million in 2019, $1,095 million in 2018 and $1,014 million in 2017. We continue to make capital expenditures primarily to modernize manufacturing facilities and support new product and productivity initiatives. We expect 2020 capital expenditures to be up to $0.9 billion, including capital expenditures in connection with our Simplify to Grow Program. We expect to continue to fund these expenditures from operations.Net Cash Used in Financing Activities:Net cash used in financing activities was $2,787 million in 2019, $2,329 million in 2018 and $3,361 million in 2017. The increase in net cash used in financing activities in 2019 relative to 2018 was primarily due to lower net debt issuances and higher dividends paid in 2019, partially offset by lower share repurchases. The decrease in net cash used in financing activities in 2018 relative to 2017 was primarily due to higher net debt issuances and lower share repurchases partially offset by higher dividends paid.Debt:From time to time we refinance long-term and short-term debt. Refer to Note 9, Debt and Borrowing Arrangements, for details of our recent tender offers, debt issuances and maturities. The nature and amount of our long-term and short-term debt and the proportionate amount of each varies as a result of current and expected business requirements, market conditions and other factors. Due to seasonality, in the first and second quarters of the year, our working capital requirements grow, increasing the need for short-term financing. The second half of the year typically generates higher cash flows. As such, we may issue commercial paper or secure other forms of financing throughout the year to meet short-term working capital or other financing needs.One of our subsidiaries, Mondelez International Holdings Netherlands B.V. (“MIHN”), has outstanding debt. Refer to Note 9, Debt and Borrowing Arrangements. The operations held by MIHN generated approximately 73.0% (or $18.9 billion) of the $25.9 billion of consolidated net revenue during fiscal year 2019 and represented approximately 87.2% (or $23.9 billion) of the $27.4 billion of net assets as of December 31, 2019.On February 7, 2019, our Board of Directors approved a new $5.0 billion long-term financing authority to replace the prior $5.0 billion authority. As of December 31, 2019, we had $1.8 billion of long-term financing authority remaining.52Table of ContentsIn the next 12 months, we expect approximately $1.5 billion of long-term debt will mature as follows: $427 million in February 2020, $233 million in March 2020, $750 million in May 2020 and $140 million in October 2020. We expect to fund these repayments with a combination of cash from operations, short-term debt, including issuance of commercial paper and long-term debt.Our total debt was $18.4 billion at December 31, 2019 and $18.4 billion at December 31, 2018. Our debt-to-capitalization ratio was 0.40 at December 31, 2019 and 0.42 at December 31, 2018. At December 31, 2019, the weighted-average term of our outstanding long-term debt was 5.8 years. Our average daily commercial borrowings were $4.1 billion in 2019, $4.5 billion in 2018 and $4.4 billion in 2017. We had $2.6 billion of commercial paper borrowings outstanding at December 31, 2019 and $3.1 billion outstanding as of December 31, 2018. We expect to continue to use commercial paper to finance various short-term financing needs. We continue to comply with our debt covenants. Refer to Note 9, Debt and Borrowing Arrangements, for more information on our debt and debt covenants.Commodity TrendsWe regularly monitor worldwide supply, commodity cost and currency trends so we can cost-effectively secure ingredients, packaging and fuel required for production. During 2019, the primary drivers of the increase in our aggregate commodity costs were higher currency exchange transaction costs on imported materials, as well as increased costs for packaging, energy, dairy, grains, cocoa and oils, partially offset by lower costs for sugar and nuts.A number of external factors such as weather conditions, commodity market conditions, currency fluctuations and the effects of governmental agricultural or other programs affect the cost and availability of raw materials and agricultural materials used in our products. We address higher commodity costs and currency impacts primarily through hedging, higher pricing and manufacturing and overhead cost control. We use hedging techniques to limit the impact of fluctuations in the cost of our principal raw materials; however, we may not be able to fully hedge against commodity cost changes, such as dairy, where there is a limited ability to hedge, and our hedging strategies may not protect us from increases in specific raw material costs. Due to competitive or market conditions, planned trade or promotional incentives, fluctuations in currency exchange rates or other factors, our pricing actions may also lag commodity cost changes temporarily.We expect price volatility and a higher aggregate cost environment to continue in 2020. While the costs of our principal raw materials fluctuate, we believe there will continue to be an adequate supply of the raw materials we use and that they will generally remain available from numerous sources.Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements and Aggregate Contractual ObligationsWe have no significant off-balance sheet arrangements other than the contractual obligations discussed below.Guarantees:As discussed in Note 14, Commitments and Contingencies, we enter into third-party guarantees primarily to cover the long-term obligations of our vendors. As part of these transactions, we guarantee that third parties will make contractual payments or achieve performance measures. At December 31, 2019, we had no material third-party guarantees recorded on our consolidated balance sheet.Guarantees do not have, and we do not expect them to have, a material effect on our liquidity.53Table of ContentsAggregate Contractual Obligations:The following table summarizes our contractual obligations at December 31, 2019.

The amounts also exclude $76 million of net unamortized non-cash bond premiums, discounts, bank fees and mark-to-market adjustments related to our interest rate swaps recorded in total debt.(2)Amounts represent the expected cash payments of our interest expense on our long-term debt. Interest calculated on our non-U.S. dollar denominated debt was forecasted using currency exchange rates as of December 31, 2019. (3)Amounts exclude imputed interest on finance leases of $11 million.(4)Purchase obligations for inventory and production costs (such as raw materials, indirect materials and supplies, packaging, co-manufacturing arrangements, storage and distribution) are commitments for projected needs to be utilized in the normal course of business. Other purchase obligations include commitments for marketing, advertising, capital expenditures, information technology and professional services. Arrangements are considered purchase obligations if a contract specifies all significant terms, including fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased, a pricing structure and approximate timing of the transaction. Most arrangements are cancelable without a significant penalty and with short notice (usually 30 days). Any amounts reflected on the consolidated balance sheet as accounts payable and accrued liabilities are excluded from the table above.(5)In connection with U.S. tax reform, we estimate paying a total $1.3 billion transition tax liability through 2026. As of December 31, 2019, the amount outstanding was $1.0 billion. The amounts and timing of our tax payments may change as a result of additional guidance issued. See Note 16, Income Taxes, for additional information on U.S. tax reform and its impact on our financial statements.(6)During 2018, we executed a complete withdrawal liability from our most individually significant multiemployer pension plan. On July 11, 2019, we received an undiscounted withdrawal liability assessment from the Fund totaling $526 million requiring pro-rata monthly payments over 20 years through 2039. See Note 11, Benefit Plans, for additional information on our multiemployer pension plan withdrawal liability.(7)Other long-term liabilities in the table above include the long-term liabilities and any current portion of these obligations. We have included the estimated future benefit payments for our postretirement health care plans through December 31, 2029 of $198 million. We are unable to reliably estimate the timing of the payments beyond 2029; as such, they are excluded from the above table. There are also another $1 million of various other long-term liabilities that are expected to be paid over the next 5 years. In addition, the following long-term liabilities included on the consolidated balance sheet are excluded from the table above: accrued pension costs, unrecognized tax benefits, insurance accruals and other accruals. As of December 31, 2019, our unrecognized tax benefit, including associated interest and penalties, classified as a long-term payable is $507 million. We currently expect to make approximately $246 million in contributions to our pension plans in 2020.54Table of ContentsEquity and DividendsStock Plans:See Note 12, Stock Plans, to the consolidated financial statements for more information on our stock plans and grant activity during 2017-2019.Share Repurchases:See Note 13, Capital Stock, to the consolidated financial statements for more information on our share repurchase program.Between 2013 and 2017, our Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of a total of $13.7 billion of our Common Stock through December 31, 2018. On January 31, 2018, our Finance Committee, with authorization delegated from our Board of Directors, approved an increase of $6.0 billion in the share repurchase program, raising the authorization to $19.7 billion of Common Stock repurchases, and extended the program through December 31, 2020. Through December 31, 2019, we repurchased approximately $16.5 billion of shares ($1.5 billion in 2019, $2.0 billion in 2018, $2.2 billion in 2017, $2.6 billion in 2016, $3.6 billion in 2015, $1.9 billion in 2014 and $2.7 billion in 2013), at a weighted-average cost of $39.65 per share. The number of shares that we ultimately repurchase under our share repurchase program may vary depending on numerous factors, including share price and other market conditions, our ongoing capital allocation planning, levels of cash and debt balances, other demands for cash, such as acquisition activity, general economic or business conditions and board and management discretion. Additionally, our share repurchase activity during any particular period may fluctuate. We may accelerate, suspend, delay or discontinue our share repurchase program at any time, without notice.Dividends:We paid dividends of $1,542 million in 2019, $1,359 million in 2018 and $1,198 million in 2017. On July 30, 2019, the Finance Committee, with authorization delegated from our Board of Directors, declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.285 per share of Class A Common Stock, an increase of 10 percent, which would be $1.14 per common share on an annualized basis. On July 25, 2018, the Finance Committee, with authorization delegated from our Board of Directors, declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.26 per share of Class A Common Stock, an increase of 18 percent, which would be $1.04 per common share on an annualized basis. On August 2, 2017, the Finance Committee, with authorization delegated from our Board of Directors, approved a 16% increase in the quarterly dividend to $0.22 per common share or $0.88 per common share on an annualized basis. The declaration of dividends is subject to the discretion of our Board of Directors and depends on various factors, including our net earnings, financial condition, cash requirements, future prospects and other factors that our Board of Directors deems relevant to its analysis and decision making.For U.S. income tax purposes only, the Company has determined that 100% of the distributions paid to its shareholders in 2019 are characterized as a qualified dividend paid from U.S. earnings and profits. Shareholders should consult their tax advisors for a full understanding of the tax consequences of the receipt of dividends.55Table of ContentsNon-GAAP Financial MeasuresWe use non-GAAP financial information and believe it is useful to investors as it provides additional information to facilitate comparisons of historical operating results, identify trends in our underlying operating results and provide additional insight and transparency on how we evaluate our business. We use non-GAAP financial measures to budget, make operating and strategic decisions and evaluate our performance. We have detailed the non-GAAP adjustments that we make in our non-GAAP definitions below. The adjustments generally fall within the following categories: acquisition & divestiture activities, gains and losses on intangible asset sales and non-cash impairments, major program restructuring activities, constant currency and related adjustments, major program financing and hedging activities and other major items affecting comparability of operating results. We believe the non-GAAP measures should always be considered along with the related U.S. GAAP financial measures. We have provided the reconciliations between the GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures below, and we also discuss our underlying GAAP results throughout our Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations in this Form 10-K.Our primary non-GAAP financial measures are listed below and reflect how we evaluate our current and prior-year operating results. As new events or circumstances arise, these definitions could change. When our definitions change, we provide the updated definitions and present the related non-GAAP historical results on a comparable basis (1). •“Organic Net Revenue” is defined as net revenues excluding the impacts of acquisitions, divestitures (2) and currency rate fluctuations (3). We also evaluate Organic Net Revenue growth from emerging and developed markets.•Our emerging markets include our Latin America region in its entirety; the AMEA region, excluding Australia, New Zealand and Japan; and the following countries from the Europe region: Russia, Ukraine, Turkey, Kazakhstan, Belarus, Georgia, Poland, Czech Republic, Slovak Republic, Hungary, Bulgaria, Romania, the Baltics and the East Adriatic countries. Our developed markets include the entire North America region, the Europe region excluding the countries included in the emerging markets definition, and Australia, New Zealand and Japan from the AMEA region.•“Adjusted Operating Income” is defined as operating income excluding the impacts of the Simplify to Grow Program (4); gains or losses (including non-cash impairment charges) on goodwill and intangible assets; divestiture (2) or acquisition gains or losses and related divestiture (2), acquisition and integration costs (2); the operating results of divestitures (2); remeasurement of net monetary position (5); mark-to-market impacts from commodity and forecasted currency transaction derivative contracts (6); impact from resolution of tax matters (7); CEO transition remuneration (8); impact from pension participation changes (9); Swiss tax reform impacts (10); and incremental expenses related to the 2017 malware incident. We also present “Adjusted Operating Income margin,” which is subject to the same adjustments as Adjusted Operating Income. We also evaluate growth in our Adjusted Operating Income on a constant currency basis (3).•“Adjusted EPS” is defined as diluted EPS attributable to Mondelēz International from continuing operations excluding the impacts of the items listed in the Adjusted Operating Income definition as well as losses on debt extinguishment and related expenses; gain on equity method investment transactions; net earnings from divestitures (2); gains or losses on interest rate swaps no longer designated as accounting cash flow hedges due to changed financing and hedging plans and U.S. and Swiss tax reform impacts (10). Similarly, within Adjusted EPS, our equity method investment net earnings exclude our proportionate share of our investees’ unusual or infrequent items (11). We also evaluate growth in our Adjusted EPS on a constant currency basis (3).(1)When items no longer impact our current or future presentation of non-GAAP operating results, we remove these items from our non-GAAP definitions. During 2019, we added to the non-GAAP definitions the exclusion of the impact from Swiss tax reform as described in footnote (10) below. During 2018, we added to the non-GAAP definitions the exclusion of: remeasurement gains or losses related to remeasuring net monetary assets or liabilities in Argentina (see footnote (5) below) and the impact from pension participation changes (see footnote (9) below).(2)Divestitures include completed sales of businesses and exits of major product lines upon completion of a sale or licensing agreement. See Note 2, Divestitures and Acquisitions, for information on divestitures and acquisitions impacting the comparability of our results.(3)Constant currency operating results are calculated by dividing or multiplying, as appropriate, the current-period local currency operating results by the currency exchange rates used to translate the financial statements in the comparable prior-year period to determine what the current-period U.S. dollar operating results would have been if the currency exchange rate had not changed from the comparable prior-year period.56Table of Contents(4)Non-GAAP adjustments related to the Simplify to Grow Program reflect costs incurred that relate to the objectives of our program to transform our supply chain network and organizational structure. Costs that do not meet the program objectives are not reflected in the non-GAAP adjustments.(5)During the third quarter of 2018, as we began to apply highly inflationary accounting for Argentina (refer to Note 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies), we excluded the remeasurement gains or losses related to remeasuring net monetary assets or liabilities in Argentina to be consistent with our prior accounting for these remeasurement gains/losses for Venezuela when it was subject to highly inflationary accounting prior to 2016. (6)During the third quarter of 2016, we began to exclude unrealized gains and losses (mark-to-market impacts) from outstanding commodity and forecasted currency transaction derivatives from our non-GAAP earnings measures until such time that the related exposures impact our operating results. Since we purchase commodity and forecasted currency transaction contracts to mitigate price volatility primarily for inventory requirements in future periods, we made this adjustment to remove the volatility of these future inventory purchases on current operating results to facilitate comparisons of our underlying operating performance across periods. We also discontinued designating commodity and forecasted currency transaction derivatives for hedge accounting treatment. To facilitate comparisons of our underlying operating results, we have recast all historical non-GAAP earnings measures to exclude the mark-to-market impacts.(7)See Note 14, Commitments and Contingencies – Tax Matters, for additional information.(8)On November 20, 2017, Dirk Van de Put succeeded Irene Rosenfeld as CEO of Mondelēz International in advance of her retirement at the end of March 2018. In order to incent Mr. Van de Put to join us, we provided him compensation with a total combined target value of $42.5 million to make him whole for incentive awards he forfeited or grants that were not made to him when he left his former employer. The compensation we granted took the form of cash, deferred stock units, performance share units and stock options. In connection with Irene Rosenfeld’s retirement, we made her outstanding grants of performance share units for the 2016-2018 and 2017-2019 performance cycles eligible for continued vesting and approved a $0.5 million salary for her service as Chairman from January through March 2018. We refer to these elements of Mr. Van de Put’s and Ms. Rosenfeld’s compensation arrangements together as “CEO transition remuneration.” We are excluding amounts we expense as CEO transition remuneration from our non-GAAP results because those amounts are not part of our regular compensation program and are incremental to amounts we would have incurred as ongoing CEO compensation. As a result, in 2017, we excluded amounts expensed for the cash payment to Mr. Van de Put and partial vesting of his equity grants. In 2018, we excluded amounts paid for Ms. Rosenfeld’s service as Chairman and partial vesting of Mr. Van de Put’s and Ms. Rosenfeld’s equity grants. In 2019, we excluded amounts related to the partial vesting of Mr. Van de Put’s equity grants.(9)The impact from pension participation changes represents the charges incurred when employee groups are withdrawn from multiemployer pension plans and other changes in employee group pension plan participation. We exclude these charges from our non–GAAP results because those amounts do not reflect our ongoing pension obligations. See Note 11, Benefit Plans, for more information on the multiemployer pension plan withdrawal.(10) We exclude the impact of the 2019 Swiss tax reform and 2017 U.S. tax reform. During the third quarter of 2019, Swiss Federal and Zurich Cantonal tax events drove our recognition of a Swiss tax reform net benefit to our results of operations. On December 22, 2017, the United States enacted tax reform legislation that included a broad range of business tax provisions. We exclude these tax reform impacts from our Adjusted EPS as they do not reflect our ongoing tax obligations under the new tax reforms. Refer to Note 16, Income Taxes, for more information on our current year estimated annual effective tax rate and U.S. and Swiss tax reform.(11) We have excluded our proportionate share of our equity method investees’ unusual or infrequent items such as acquisition and divestiture related costs, restructuring program costs and discrete U.S. tax reform impacts, in order to provide investors with a comparable view of our performance across periods. Although we have shareholder rights and board representation commensurate with our ownership interests in our equity method investees and review the underlying operating results and unusual or infrequent items with them each reporting period, we do not have direct control over their operations or resulting revenue and expenses. Our use of equity method investment net earnings on an adjusted basis is not intended to imply that we have any such control. Our GAAP “diluted EPS attributable to Mondelēz International from continuing operations” includes all of the investees’ unusual and infrequent items.We believe that the presentation of these non-GAAP financial measures, when considered together with our U.S. GAAP financial measures and the reconciliations to the corresponding U.S. GAAP financial measures, provides you with a more complete understanding of the factors and trends affecting our business than could be obtained absent these disclosures. Because non-GAAP financial measures vary among companies, the non-GAAP financial measures presented in this report may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies. Our use of these non-GAAP financial measures is not meant to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for any U.S. GAAP financial measure. A limitation of these non-GAAP financial measures is they exclude items detailed below that have an impact on our U.S. GAAP reported results. The best way this limitation can be addressed is by evaluating our non-GAAP financial measures in combination with our U.S. GAAP reported results and carefully evaluating the following tables that reconcile U.S. GAAP reported figures to the non-GAAP financial measures in this Form 10-K.57Table of ContentsOrganic Net Revenue:Applying the definition of “Organic Net Revenue”, the adjustments made to “net revenues” (the most comparable U.S. GAAP financial measure) were to exclude the impact of currency, acquisitions and divestitures. We believe that Organic Net Revenue reflects the underlying growth from the ongoing activities of our business and provides improved comparability of results. We also evaluate our Organic Net Revenue growth from emerging markets, and these underlying measures are also reconciled to U.S. GAAP below.

Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk. As we operate globally, we are primarily exposed to currency exchange rate, commodity price and interest rate market risks. We monitor and manage these exposures as part of our overall risk management program. Our risk management program focuses on the unpredictability of financial markets and seeks to reduce the potentially adverse effects that the volatility of these markets may have on our operating results. We principally utilize derivative instruments to reduce significant, unanticipated earnings fluctuations that may arise from volatility in currency exchange rates, commodity prices and interest rates. For additional information on our derivative activity and the types of derivative instruments we use to hedge our currency exchange, commodity price and interest rate exposures, see Note 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, and Note 10, Financial Instruments.Many of our non-U.S. subsidiaries operate in functional currencies other than the U.S. dollar. Fluctuations in currency exchange rates create volatility in our reported results as we translate the balance sheets, operating results and cash flows of these subsidiaries into the U.S. dollar for consolidated reporting purposes. The translation of non-U.S. dollar denominated balance sheets and statements of earnings of our subsidiaries into the U.S. dollar for consolidated reporting generally results in a cumulative translation adjustment to other comprehensive income within equity. A stronger U.S. dollar relative to other functional currencies adversely affects our consolidated earnings and net assets while a weaker U.S. dollar benefits our consolidated earnings and net assets. While we hedge significant forecasted currency exchange transactions as well as certain net assets of non-U.S. operations and other currency impacts, we cannot fully predict or eliminate volatility arising from changes in currency exchange rates on our consolidated financial results. See Consolidated Results of Operations and Results of Operations by Reportable Segment under Discussion and Analysis of Historical Results for currency exchange effects on our financial results. For additional information on the impact of currency policies, recent currency devaluations and highly inflationary accounting on our financial condition and results of operations, also see Note 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies—Currency Translation and Highly Inflationary Accounting.We also continually monitor the market for commodities that we use in our products. Input costs may fluctuate widely due to international demand, weather conditions, government policy and regulation and unforeseen conditions. To manage input cost volatility, we enter into forward purchase agreements and other derivative financial instruments. We also pursue productivity and cost saving measures and take pricing actions when necessary to mitigate the impact of higher input costs on earnings.We regularly evaluate our variable and fixed-rate debt as well as current and expected interest rates in the markets in which we raise capital. Our primary exposures include movements in U.S. Treasury rates, corporate credit spreads, commercial paper rates as well as limited debt tied to London Interbank Offered Rates (“LIBOR”). The Financial Conduct Authority in the United Kingdom plans to phase out LIBOR by the end of 2021. We do not anticipate a significant impact to our financial position from the planned phase out of LIBOR given our current mix of variable and fixed-rate debt. We periodically use interest rate swaps and forward interest rate contracts to achieve a desired proportion of variable versus fixed-rate debt based on current and projected market conditions. Our weighted-average interest rate on our total debt was 2.2% as of December 31, 2019, down from 2.3% as of December 31, 2018, primarily due to lower interest rates on commercial paper borrowings.Beginning in 2018, we entered into new investment hedge derivative contracts, specifically, cross-currency interest rate swaps and forwards, to hedge certain investments in our non-U.S. operations against movements in exchange rates. See Note 10, Financial Instruments, for more information on our derivative activity. Value at Risk:We use a value at risk (“VAR”) computation to estimate: 1) the potential one-day loss in the fair value of our interest rate-sensitive financial instruments; and 2) the potential one-day loss in pre-tax earnings of our currency and commodity price-sensitive derivative financial instruments. The VAR analysis was done separately for our currency exchange, fixed income and commodity risk portfolios as of each quarter end during the periods presented below. The instruments included in the VAR computation were currency exchange forwards and options for currency exchange risk, debt and swaps for interest rate risk, and commodity forwards, futures and options for commodity risk. Excluded from the computation were anticipated transactions, currency trade payables and receivables, and net investments in non-U.S. subsidiaries, which the above-mentioned instruments are intended to hedge.63Table of ContentsThe VAR model assumes normal market conditions, a 95% confidence interval and a one-day holding period. A parametric delta-gamma approximation technique was used to determine the expected return distribution in interest rates, currencies and commodity prices for the purpose of calculating the fixed income, currency exchange and commodity VAR, respectively. The parameters used for estimating the expected return distributions were determined by observing interest rate, currency exchange and commodity price movements over the prior quarter for the calculation of VAR amounts at December 31, 2019 and 2018, and over each of the four prior quarters for the calculation of average VAR amounts during each year. The values of currency and commodity options do not change on a one-to-one basis with the underlying currency or commodity and were valued accordingly in the VAR computation.As of December 31, 2019 and December 31, 2018, the estimated potential one-day loss in fair value of our interest rate-sensitive instruments, primarily debt, and the estimated potential one-day loss in pre-tax earnings from our currency and commodity instruments, as calculated in the VAR model, were: Pre-Tax Earnings Impact Fair Value Impact At 12/31/19 Average High Low At 12/31/19 Average High Low (in millions)Instruments sensitive to: Interest rates $86 $70 $97 $49Foreign currency rates$15 $19 $25 $15 Commodity prices11 13 14 11 Pre-Tax Earnings Impact Fair Value Impact At 12/31/18 Average High Low At 12/31/18 Average High Low (in millions)Instruments sensitive to: Interest rates $35 $33 $36 $27Foreign currency rates$19 $30 $39 $19 Commodity prices15 16 17 15 This VAR computation is a risk analysis tool designed to statistically estimate the maximum expected daily loss, under the specified confidence interval and assuming normal market conditions, from adverse movements in interest rates, currency exchange rates and commodity prices. The computation does not represent actual losses in fair value or earnings we will incur, nor does it consider the effect of favorable changes in market rates. We cannot predict actual future movements in market rates and do not present these VAR results to be indicative of future movements in market rates or to be representative of any actual impact that future changes in market rates may have on our future financial results.64Table of Contents",2023-12-30 19:01:11.257636

It should be read in conjunction with the other sections of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, including the consolidated financial statements and related notes contained in Forward-Looking Statements and Item 1A, Risk Factors.Overview of Business and StrategyWe make and sell primarily snacks, including biscuits (cookies, crackers and salted snacks), chocolate, gum & candy, as well as various cheese & grocery and powdered beverage products around the world. We aim to be the global leader in snacking. Our strategy is to drive long-term growth by focusing on three strategic priorities: accelerating consumer-centric growth, driving operational excellence and creating a winning growth culture. We believe the successful implementation of our strategic priorities and leveraging of our strong foundation of iconic global and local brands, an attractive global footprint, our market leadership in developed and emerging markets, our deep innovation, marketing and distribution capabilities, and our efficiency and sustainability efforts, will drive top- and bottom-line growth, enabling us to continue to create long-term value for our shareholders. For more detailed information on our business and strategy, refer to Item 1, Business.Recent Developments and Significant Items Affecting ComparabilityCOVID-19We have been actively monitoring the outbreak of COVID-19 and its impact globally. Our highest priorities continue to be the safety of our employees and working with our employees and network of suppliers and customers to help maintain the global food supply chain. During 2020, we experienced a significant increase in demand and revenue growth in certain markets as consumers increased their food purchases for in-home consumption. Results were particularly strong in modern trade (such as large grocery supermarkets and retail chains) and e-commerce, and especially for categories such as biscuits. Other parts of our business were negatively affected by mandated lockdowns and other related restrictions including some of our emerging markets with a greater concentration of traditional trade (such as small family-run stores) as well as our world travel retail (such as international duty-free stores) and foodservice businesses. During the second quarter especially, lockdowns and other related measures or restrictions had a negative impact on emerging markets with a greater concentration of traditional trade due to store closures (particularly in our Latin America region as well as parts of our AMEA region) as well as in categories like gum and candy, which are more traditionally purchased and consumed out of home. In the second half of the year, demand grew in both developed and emerging markets as the negative impacts of COVID-19 during the second quarter subsided and a number of our key markets returned to higher growth. A sharp reduction in global travel continues to negatively impact our world travel retail business, and lower out-of-home consumption continues to negatively impact our foodservice business as well as sales of our gum and candy products. During 2020, we also experienced temporary disruptions in operations in some of our emerging markets that were not material to our consolidated results. We discuss these and other impacts of COVID-19 below.Our Employees, Customers and Communities We have taken a number of actions to promote the health and safety of our employees, customers and consumers, which is our first priority:•We implemented enhanced protocols to provide a safe and sanitary working environment for our employees. In many locations, our employees are working remotely whenever possible. For employees who are unable to work remotely, we have adopted a number of heightened protocols, consistent with those prescribed by the World Health Organization, related to social distancing (including staggering lunchtimes and shifts where possible and restricting in-person gatherings and non-essential travel) and enhanced hygiene and workplace sanitation. At a local level, we have also provided additional flexibility and support to employees in our manufacturing facilities, distribution and logistics operations and sales organization. •We have been hiring frontline employees in the U.S. and other locations to meet additional marketplace demand and promote uninterrupted functioning of our manufacturing, distribution and sales network. 31Table of Contents•We increased our $15 million global commitment to assist those most impacted by COVID-19 to approximately $28 million to date. We have been supporting local and global organizations that are responding to food instability and providing emergency relief.Our Supply Chain and OperationsWe operate in the food and beverages industry and are part of the global food supply chain. One of our main objectives during the pandemic is to maintain the availability of our products to meet the needs of our consumers. In response to increased demand, we have increased production and, to date, we have not experienced material disruptions in our supply chain or operations:•We were able to leverage learnings from our timely response to the initial outbreak in China, and we put in place procedures across our supply chain to help mitigate the risk that our manufacturing sites will experience material closures or disruptions. •We have been able to continue to source raw ingredients, packaging, energy and transportation and deliver our products to our customers. •We have not experienced material disruptions in our workforce; however, mandatory and voluntary stay-at-home restrictions have resulted in increased levels of absenteeism.•Commodity costs have become more volatile due to the COVID-19 outbreak. Although we monitor our exposure to commodity prices and hedge against input price increases, we cannot fully hedge against changes in commodity costs, and our hedging strategies may not protect us from increases in specific raw material costs. We anticipate continued commodity cost volatility as the pandemic continues. •We have experienced temporary disruptions in operations in some of our emerging markets. The disruptions were not material to our consolidated results for 2020. In the future, the ongoing COVID-19 outbreak could disrupt our global supply chain, operations and routes to market or those of our suppliers, their suppliers, or our co-manufacturers or distributors. These disruptions or our failure to effectively respond to them could increase product or distribution costs, prices and potentially affect the availability of our products. •Our 2020 net revenue and net earnings in U.S. dollars were negatively affected by currency translation losses from a generally stronger U.S. dollar relative to other currencies in the countries in which we operate. •During the second quarter of 2020, we incurred higher operating costs primarily for labor, customer service and logistics, security, personal protective equipment and cleaning. In the second half of 2020, our spending in these areas was significantly less but still above pre-COVID levels. We continued to incur higher costs in these areas in response to the ongoing pandemic as we worked to protect our employees and deliver our products timely and safely to our customers. Most other aspects of our global supply chain and operations did not change materially during 2020. While we have not had material disruptions to date, we do not know whether or how our supply chain or operations may be negatively affected if the pandemic persists for an extended period or worsens. As we respond to this evolving situation, we intend to continue to execute on our strategic operating plans. However, disruptions, higher operating costs or uncertainties like those noted above could result in delays or modifications to our plans and initiatives.Our LiquidityWe believe the steps we have taken to enhance our capital structure and liquidity over the last several years and months have strengthened our ability to operate through current conditions:•During 2019, we generated $4.0 billion of cash from operations, or $3.0 billion after deducting capital expenditures. •During 2020, we generated $4.0 billion of cash from operations, or $3.1 billion after capital expenditures. Also, as of December 31, 2020, we had $3.6 billion of cash and cash equivalents on hand. •During 2020, we also received cash of €350 million ($394 million) from our participation in the JDE Peet's public share offerings and $2,094 million from our participation in the KDP secondary offering and subsequent KDP share sales (see additional information below and in Note 7, Equity Method Investments). •As a precautionary measure, in March, we also suspended our share repurchase program, which was reinstated during our fourth quarter. •In connection with various legislatively authorized tax payment deferral mechanisms available for income tax, indirect tax (such as value-added tax) and payroll tax in a number of jurisdictions, we were able to defer certain of these tax payments, which provided a cash benefit that reverses when the payments come due. Some of these payments were made in the fourth quarter of 2020; the remainder will come due in 2021 and 2022. The benefits associated with the deferral of these tax payments were not material to our financial statements. 32Table of Contents•Based on our current available cash and access to financing markets, we do not anticipate any issue funding our next long-term debt maturities of approximately $1.5 billion in October 2021 and approximately $0.3 billion in December 2021 and after paying approximately $0.8 billion of maturing debt in January 2021.•We also have access to short-term and long-term financing markets and have actively utilized these markets in 2020. During the initial outbreak of COVID-19 in March, we put supplemental short-term credit facilities in place, which we have since retired in full. We also continued to utilize the commercial paper markets in the United States and Europe for flexible, low-cost, short-term financing. We also issued additional long-term debt several times in 2020 due to favorable market conditions and opportunities to shift a portion of our funding mix from short-term debt to long-term debt at a low cost. We continue to have $6.0 billion of undrawn credit facilities as well as other forms of short-term and long-term financing options available (refer to the Liquidity and Capital Resources section and Note 9, Debt and Borrowing Arrangements). We have been, and we expect to continue to be, in compliance with our debt covenants.Our Financial Position•We evaluated the realizability of our assets and whether there are any impairment indicators. We reviewed our receivables, inventory, right-of-use lease assets, long-lived assets, equity method and other long-term investments, deferred tax assets, goodwill and intangible assets. •In connection with the ongoing pandemic, we identified a decline in demand for certain of our brands, primarily in the gum category, that prompted additional evaluation of our indefinite-life intangible assets during the second quarter of 2020 in addition to our annual testing in the third quarter of 2020. In connection with the testing, we concluded that eight brands were impaired and we recorded $144 million of impairment charges in 2020. While we did not identify impairment triggers for other brands, there continues to be significant uncertainty due to the pandemic. If brand earnings expectations are not met or specific valuation factors outside of our control, such as discount rates, change significantly, then a brand or brands could become impaired in the future. Refer to Note 6, Goodwill and Intangible Assets, for additional details on our intangible asset impairment evaluation. •Restructuring and implementation activities were in line with our Simplify to Grow Program strategic objectives.•Our equity investments in JDE Peet's and KDP give us additional financial flexibility.•We will continue to monitor the quality of our assets and our overall financial position over coming quarters. •We continue to maintain oversight over our core process controls through our centralized shared service model, and our key controls are operating as designed.While some of the initial impacts of the pandemic on our business moderated in the second half of 2020, the business and economic environment remains uncertain and additional impacts may arise that we cannot currently anticipate. Barring material business disruptions or other negative developments, we expect to continue to meet the demand of consumers for our snacks, food and beverage products. However, the elevated consumer demand we experienced primarily in some of our developed market countries in 2020 may not continue. We are unable to predict how long this sustained demand will last or how significant it will be. We expect the COVID-19 outbreak to result in lower revenues primarily in some of our emerging market countries that have a higher concentration of traditional trade outlets (such as small family-run stores), our gum and candy categories (which are more instant consumption in nature), as well as our world travel retail (such as international duty-free stores) and foodservice businesses. As we continue to proactively manage our business in response to the evolving impacts of the pandemic, we continue to communicate with and support our employees and customers; monitor and take steps to further safeguard our supply chain, operations, technology and assets; protect our liquidity and financial position; work toward our strategic priorities and monitor our financial performance as we seek to position the Company to withstand the current uncertainty related to this pandemic.KDP and JDE Peet's Equity Method Investment TransactionsOn July 9, 2018, Keurig Green Mountain, Inc. (""Keurig"") closed on its definitive merger agreement with Dr Pepper Snapple Group, Inc., and formed Keurig Dr Pepper Inc. (NYSE: ""KDP""), a publicly traded company. Following the close of the transaction, our 24.2% investment in Keurig together with our shareholder loan receivable became a 13.8% investment in KDP. During 2018, we recorded a pre-tax gain of $778 million (or $586 million after-tax). In connection with the KDP transaction, in the third quarter of 2018, we changed our accounting principle to reflect our share of Keurig's historical and KDP's ongoing earnings on a one-quarter lag basis for all periods presented while we continue to record dividends when cash is received.During 2019, we recognized a $23 million pre-tax gain related to the impact of a KDP acquisition that decreased our ownership interest from 13.8% to 13.6%. 33Table of ContentsOn March 4, 2020, we participated in a secondary offering of KDP shares and sold approximately 6.8 million shares, which reduced our ownership interest by 0.5% to 13.1% of the total outstanding shares. We received $185 million of proceeds and recorded a pre-tax gain of $71 million (or $54 million after-tax) during the first quarter of 2020. Subsequently, on August 3, 2020, we sold approximately 14.1 million shares and on September 9, 2020, we sold approximately 12.5 million shares, which in the aggregate reduced our KDP ownership interest to 11.2% of total outstanding shares. During the third quarter of 2020, we received $777 million of proceeds and recorded pre-tax gains of $335 million (or $258 million after tax). On November 17, 2020, we sold approximately 40.0 million shares, which reduced our ownership interest by 2.8% to 8.4%. We received $1,132 million of proceeds and recorded a pre-tax gain of $459 million (or $350 million after tax) during the fourth quarter of 2020. The cash taxes associated with the KDP share sales were paid in 2020.During the second quarter of 2020, in connection with the JDE Peet's offering of its ordinary shares, we exchanged our 26.4% ownership interest in JDE for a 26.5% equity interest in JDE Peet’s. On May 29, 2020, we participated in the JDE Peet's offering and, with the subsequent exercise of the over-allotment option, we sold a total of approximately 11.1 million shares during the second quarter of 2020, retaining a 22.9% ownership interest in JDE Peet's. We received €350 million ($394 million) of total proceeds from the sales of JDE Peet's shares and we recorded a preliminary pre-tax gain of $121 million during the second quarter of 2020. We also incurred a $261 million tax expense that is payable in 2020 and 2021. During the third quarter of 2020, we increased our preliminary gain by $10 million to $131 million. During the fourth quarter of 2020, we reduced our tax expense by $11 million to $250 million. Consistent with our accounting for KDP and in connection with JDE Peet's becoming a public company, during the second quarter of 2020, we changed our accounting principle to reflect our share of JDE historical results and JDE Peet's ongoing results on a one-quarter lag basis while we continue to record dividends when cash is received. We determined a lag was preferable as it enables us to continue to report our quarterly and annual results on a timely basis and to record our share of JDE Peet's ongoing results once JDE Peet's has publicly reported its results. This change was applied retrospectively to all periods presented. For additional information, refer to Note 7, Equity Method Investments, and Note 16, Income Taxes.Swiss and U.S. Tax ReformOn August 6, 2019, Switzerland published changes to its Federal tax law in the Official Federal Collection of Laws. On September 27, 2019, the Zurich Canton published their decision on the September 1, 2019 Zurich Canton public vote regarding the Cantonal changes associated with the Swiss Federal tax law change. The intent of these tax law changes was to replace certain preferential tax regimes with a new set of internationally accepted measures that are hereafter referred to as “Swiss tax reform”. Based on these Federal / Cantonal events, our position is the enactment of Swiss tax reform for U.S. GAAP purposes was met as of September 30, 2019, and we recorded the impacts in the third quarter 2019. The net impact was a benefit of $767 million, which consisted of a $769 million reduction in deferred tax expense from an allowed step-up of intangible assets for tax purposes and remeasurement of our deferred tax balances, partially offset by a $2 million indirect tax impact in selling, general and administrative expenses. The ongoing impacts of these Swiss tax reform law changes became effective January 1, 2020. On December 22, 2017, the United States enacted tax reform legislation (""U.S. tax reform"") that included a broad range of business tax provisions and a one-time transition tax on accumulated foreign earnings and profits.See Note 16, Income Taxes, for more information on our annual effective tax rates and Swiss and U.S. tax reform.Multiemployer Pension Plan WithdrawalIn 2018, we executed a complete withdrawal from the Bakery and Confectionery Union and Industry International Pension Fund (the ""Fund"") and recorded a $429 million estimated withdrawal liability. On July 11, 2019, we received an undiscounted withdrawal liability assessment from the Fund totaling $526 million requiring pro-rata monthly payments over 20 years. We began making monthly payments during the third quarter of 2019. Within selling, general and administrative expenses, we recorded a $35 million ($26 million net of tax) adjustment related to the discounted withdrawal liability. Within interest and other expense, net, we recorded accreted interest on the long-term liability of $11 million in 2020, $12 million in 2019 and $6 million in 2018. As of December 31, 2020, the remaining discounted withdrawal liability was $375 million, with $14 million recorded in other current liabilities and $361 million recorded in long-term other liabilities.34Table of ContentsSummary of Results •Net revenues were approximately $26.6 billion in 2020 and $25.9 billion in 2019, an increase of 2.8% in 2020 and a decrease of 0.3% in 2019. In 2020, net revenues were significantly impacted by the COVID-19 outbreak and response. In developed markets, particularly North America, demand for our products, primarily biscuits and chocolate, grew significantly as consumers increased their food purchases for in-home consumption. In some of our emerging markets, where we have a greater concentration of traditional trade, as well as in our gum and candy, world travel retail and foodservice businesses, where we sell products that are typically consumed away from home, net revenues were negatively affected by mandated lockdowns and other related restrictions. In the second half of the year the negative impacts we experienced from COVID-19, particularly during the second quarter, subsided, resulting in a return to revenue growth across a number of our key markets.–Net revenue increased in 2020, driven by higher net pricing, favorable volume/mix and incremental net revenues from our acquisitions of Give & Go in 2020 and Perfect Snacks in 2019. These items were partially offset by the significant impact of unfavorable currency translation, as the U.S. dollar strengthened against most currencies in which we operate compared to exchange rates in the prior year, as well as the May 28, 2019 divestiture of most of our cheese business in the Middle East and Africa. –Net revenue decreased in 2019, driven by the impact of unfavorable currency translation and the impact of the divestiture of most of our cheese business in the Middle East and Africa. Net revenues were positively affected by higher net pricing and favorable volume/mix, as well as our acquisitions of Perfect Snacks in 2019 and Tate's Bake Shop in 2018.•Organic Net Revenue increased 3.7% to $26.8 billion in 2020 and increased 4.1% to $26.9 billion in 2019. While Organic Net Revenue in 2020 was impacted by the COVID-19 outbreak and response described above, Organic Net Revenue increased in both 2020 and 2019 due to higher net pricing and favorable volume/mix. Organic Net Revenue is on a constant currency basis and excludes revenue from acquisitions and divestitures. We use Organic Net Revenue as it provides improved year-over-year comparability of our underlying operating results (see the definition of Organic Net Revenue and our reconciliation with net revenues within Non-GAAP Financial Measures appearing later in this section).•Diluted EPS attributable to Mondelēz International decreased 8.2% to $2.47 in 2020 and increased 20.6% to $2.69 in 2019. –Diluted EPS decreased in 2020 primarily driven by lapping the prior-year benefit from Swiss tax reform, costs associated with the JDE Peet's transaction, loss on debt extinguishment, higher intangible asset impairment charges, unfavorable year-over-year mark-to-market impacts from currency and commodity derivatives, lapping a prior-year gain on divestiture, lapping the prior-year benefit from pension participation changes and the unfavorable impact on net earnings from divestitures. These factors were partially offset by gains on equity method investment transactions, higher Adjusted EPS, favorable change from the resolution of tax matters (a benefit in 2020 as compared to an expense in 2019), lower Simplify to Grow program costs and lower losses related to interest rate swaps. –Diluted EPS increased in 2019 primarily driven by the benefit from Swiss tax reform, lapping the prior-year impact from pension participation changes, operating gains, lower Simplify to Grow program costs, an increase in equity method investment earnings, lapping the prior-year loss on debt extinguishment, fewer shares outstanding, a gain on divestiture, lower interest expense and a benefit from current-year pension participation changes, partially offset by lapping the prior-year gain on equity method investment transactions, unfavorable currency translation, a loss related to interest rate swaps, the expense from the resolution of tax matters in 2019 and an unfavorable year-over-year change in mark-to-market impacts from currency and commodity derivatives. See our Discussion and Analysis of Historical Results appearing later in this section for further details.•Adjusted EPS increased 5.3% to $2.59 in 2020 and increased 4.2% to $2.46 in 2019. On a constant currency basis, Adjusted EPS increased 6.5% to $2.62 in 2020 and increased 11.0% to $2.62 in 2019. –For 2020, operating gains, an increase in benefit plan non-service income and fewer shares outstanding, partially offset by unfavorable currency translation and a decrease in equity method investment earnings drove the Adjusted EPS growth. –For 2019, operating gains, increased equity method investment earnings, fewer shares outstanding, lower interest expense and lower taxes, partially offset by unfavorable currency translation drove the Adjusted EPS growth. 35Table of ContentsAdjusted EPS and Adjusted EPS on a constant currency basis are non-GAAP financial measures. We use these measures as they provide improved year-over-year comparability of our underlying results (see the definition of Adjusted EPS and our reconciliation with diluted EPS within Non-GAAP Financial Measures appearing later in this section).Financial OutlookWe seek to achieve profitable, long-term growth and manage our business to attain this goal using our key operating metrics: Organic Net Revenue, Adjusted Operating Income and Adjusted EPS. We use these non-GAAP financial metrics and related computations, particularly growth in profit dollars, to evaluate and manage our business and to plan and make near-and long-term operating and strategic decisions. As such, we believe these metrics are useful to investors as they provide supplemental information in addition to our U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (“U.S. GAAP”) financial results. We believe it is useful to provide investors with the same financial information that we use internally to make comparisons of our historical operating results, identify trends in our underlying operating results and evaluate our business. We believe our non-GAAP financial measures should always be considered in relation to our GAAP results. We have provided reconciliations between our GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures in Non-GAAP Financial Measures, which appears later in this section.In addition to monitoring our key operating metrics, we monitor a number of developments and trends that could impact our revenue and profitability objectives.COVID-19 – We continue to monitor and respond to the COVID-19 outbreak. While its full impact is not yet known, it has had a material negative effect on economic conditions globally and could have a material negative effect on our business and results in the future, particularly if there are significant adverse changes to consumer demand or significant disruptions to the supply, production or distribution of our products or the credit or financial stability of our customers and other business partners. An economic or credit crisis could occur and impair credit availability and our ability to raise capital when needed. A disruption in the financial markets may also have a negative effect on our derivative counterparties and could also impair our banking or other business partners, on whom we rely for access to capital and as counterparties for a number of our derivative contracts. Any of these and other developments could materially harm our business, results of operations and financial condition. We will continue to prioritize the safety of our employees and consumers. As we manage operations during the pandemic, we may continue to incur increased labor, customer service, logistics and other costs. As consumer demand for our products evolves, we could see continued shifts in product mix that could have a negative impact on our results. As discussed in Recent Developments and Significant Items Affecting Comparability, we are working to mitigate any negative impacts to our business from the COVID-19 outbreak, but we may not be able to fully predict or respond to all impacts on a timely basis to prevent near- and long-term adverse impacts to our results.Demand – We monitor consumer spending and our market share within the food and beverage categories in which we sell our products. While gum and candy category growth was down due to less on-the-go consumption, the overall snack category continued to grow in 2020, in part due to increased consumer demand for snacks purchases for in-home consumption during the COVID-19 outbreak. As part of our strategic plan, we seek to drive category growth by leveraging our local and consumer-focused commercial approach, making investments in our brand and snacks portfolio, building strong routes to market in both emerging and developed markets and improving our availability across multiple channels. We believe these actions will help drive demand in our categories and strengthen our positions across markets.Long-Term Demographics and Consumer Trends – Snack food consumption is highly correlated to GDP growth, urbanization of populations and rising discretionary income levels associated with a growing middle class, particularly in emerging markets. Our recent research underscores the growth of snacking worldwide and how behavior, sentiment and routines surrounding food are being reshaped by COVID-19. Snacking, which was already increasing among consumers, has accelerated further in 2020 as consumers spend more time at home, according to the second annual State of Snacking report, commissioned by Mondelēz International and issued in November 2020. The report was conducted in conjunction with consumer poll specialist The Harris Poll and summarizes the findings from interviews with thousands of consumers across 12 countries. The report shows that consumers see snacking as an important source of comfort, connection and community, especially during the past year. For many, snacking offers moments of satisfaction and peace, with a majority of respondents noting it has helped distract them from a challenging year. 36Table of ContentsVolatility of Global Markets – Our growth strategy depends in part on our ability to expand our operations, including in emerging markets. Some emerging markets have greater political, economic and currency volatility and greater vulnerability to infrastructure and labor disruptions. Volatility in these markets affects demand for and the costs of our products and requires frequent changes in how we operate our business. As further discussed in COVID-19 above and in Item 7A, Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk, volatility in global consumer, commodity, currency and capital markets increased significantly during 2020 and is expected to continue until the COVID-19 outbreak is largely resolved. See also below for a discussion of Brexit as well as Argentina, which was designated a highly inflationary economy in 2018. In addition, the imposition of increased or new tariffs, quotas, trade barriers or similar restrictions on our sales or key commodities and potential changes in U.S. trade programs, trade relations, regulations, taxes or fiscal policies might negatively affect our sales or profitability. To help mitigate adverse effects of ongoing volatility across markets, we aim to protect profitability through the management of costs (including hedging) and pricing as well as targeted investments in our brands and new routes to market.Competition – We operate in highly competitive markets that include global, regional and local competitors. Our advantaged geographic footprint, operating scale and portfolio of brands have all significantly contributed to building our market-leading positions across most of the product categories in which we sell. To grow and maintain our market positions, we focus on meeting consumer needs and preferences through a local-first commercial focus, new digital and other sales and marketing initiatives, product innovation and high standards of product quality. We also continue to optimize our manufacturing and other operations and invest in our brands through ongoing research and development, advertising, marketing and consumer promotions.Pricing – Our net revenue growth and profitability may be affected as we adjust prices to address new conditions. We adjust our product prices based on a number of variables including demand, the competitive environment and changes in our product input costs. We generally have increased prices in response to higher commodity costs, currency and other market factors. In 2021, we anticipate changing market conditions to continue to impact pricing. Price changes may affect net revenues or market share in the near term as the market adjusts to changes in input costs and other market conditions.Operating Costs – Our operating costs include raw materials, labor, selling, general and administrative expenses, taxes, currency impacts and financing costs. We manage these costs through cost saving and productivity initiatives, sourcing and hedging programs, pricing actions, refinancing and tax planning. To remain competitive on our operating structure, we continue to work on programs to expand our profitability, such as our Simplify to Grow Program, which is designed to bring about significant reductions in our operating cost structure in both our supply chain and overhead costs. Taxes – We continue to monitor existing and potential future tax reform. During the third quarter of 2019, we recorded the impact of Swiss tax reform and we will continue to monitor for any additional interpretative guidance that could result in changes to the amounts we have recorded. In the United States, while the 2017 U.S. tax reform reduced the U.S. corporate tax rate and included some beneficial provisions, other provisions have, and will continue to have, an adverse effect on our results.Currency – As a global company with 73.2% of our net revenues generated outside the United States, we are continually exposed to changes in global economic conditions and currency movements. While we hedge significant forecasted currency exchange transactions as well as currency translation impacts from certain net assets of our non-U.S. operations, including the United Kingdom, we cannot fully predict or eliminate all adverse impacts arising from changes in currency exchange rates on our consolidated financial results. To partially offset currency translation impacts arising from our overseas operations, we enter into net investment hedges primarily in the form of local currency-denominated debt, cross-currency swaps and other financial instruments. While we work to mitigate our exposure to currency risks, factors such as continued global and local market volatility, actions by foreign governments, political uncertainty, limited hedging opportunities and other factors could lead to unfavorable currency impacts in the future and could adversely affect our results of operations or financial position. See additional discussion of Brexit and Argentina below and refer also to Note 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies – Currency Translation and Highly Inflationary Accounting, and Note 10, Financial Instruments, for additional information on how we manage currency and related risks. As currency movements can make comparison of year-over-year operating performance challenging, we isolate the impact of currency and also report growth on a constant currency basis, holding prior-year currency exchange rates constant, so that prior-year and current-year results can be compared on a consistent basis.37Table of ContentsBrexit – On December 24, 2020, the European Union and the United Kingdom reached an agreement on a new trade arrangement that became effective on January 1, 2021. Main trade provisions include the continuation of no tariffs or quotas on trade between the U.K. and E.U. so long as we meet prescribed trade terms. We will also need to meet product and labeling standards for both the U.K. and E.U. and we have already begun to introduce these changes gradually. The U.K. may also set its own trade policies with countries such as the United States, Australia and New Zealand that currently do not have free trade agreements with the E.U. Cross-border trade between the U.K. and E.U. will be subject to new customs regulations, documentation and reviews. To date, we have not experienced significant delays at U.K.-E.U. border crossings, however, we anticipate increased shipping costs and near-term delays because of the need for ongoing customs inspections and related procedures. Our supply chain in this market relies on imports of raw and packaging materials as well as finished goods. Volatility in foreign currencies and other markets may also arise as the U.K. and E.U. work though the new trade arrangements. Once the new rules are formalized, there could be other near- or long-term negative impacts. We have been taking protective measures to limit disruptions to our supply chain and sales to limit potential negative impacts on our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. We continue to increase our resources in customer service & logistics as well as in our factories and on our customs support teams. We are adapting our systems and processes for new and increased customs transactions. We continue to enhance resilience plans to aid in dealing with anticipated border delays. We are working to address new regulatory requirements such as packaging changes. Also, we continue to closely monitor and manage our inventory levels of imported raw materials, packaging and finished goods in the U.K. Any disagreements on trade terms or supply chain or distribution delays or other disruptions could negatively affect our U.K. business. In 2020, we generated 9.0% of our net revenues in the U.K.Argentina – as further discussed in Note 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies – Currency Translation and Highly Inflationary Accounting, on July 1, 2018, we began to apply highly inflationary accounting for our Argentinean subsidiaries. As a result, we recorded a remeasurement loss of $9 million in 2020, a remeasurement gain of $4 million in 2019 and a remeasurement loss of $11 million in 2018 within selling, general and administrative expenses related to the revaluation of the Argentinean peso denominated net monetary position over these periods. The mix of monetary assets and liabilities and the exchange rate to convert Argentinean pesos to U.S. dollars could change over time, so it is difficult to predict the overall impact of the Argentina highly inflationary accounting on future net earnings. Financing Costs – We regularly evaluate our variable and fixed-rate debt. We continue to use low-cost, short- and long-term debt to finance our ongoing working capital, capital expenditures and other investments, dividends and share repurchases. We continued to secure low-cost short and long-term debt during 2020. We continue to use interest rate swaps and other financial instruments to manage our exposure to interest rate and cash flow variability, protect the value of our existing currency assets and liabilities and protect the value of our debt. We also enter into cross-currency interest rate swaps and forwards to hedge our non-U.S. net investments against adverse movements in exchange rates. Our net investment hedge derivative contracts have had and are expected to have a favorable impact and reduce some of the financing costs and related currency impacts within our interest costs. Refer to Note 9, Debt and Borrowing Arrangements, and Note 10, Financial Instruments, for additional information on our debt and derivative activity. Cybersecurity Risks – We continue to devote focused resources to network security, backup and disaster recovery, enhanced training and other security measures to protect our systems and data. We also focus on enhancing the monitoring and detection of threats in our environment, including but not limited to the manufacturing environment and operational technologies, as well as adjusting information security controls based on updated threats. While we have taken a number of security measures to protect our systems and data, security measures cannot provide absolute certainty or guarantee that we will be successful in preventing or responding to every breach or disruption on a timely basis. 38Table of ContentsDiscussion and Analysis of Historical ResultsItems Affecting Comparability of Financial ResultsThe following table includes significant income or (expense) items that affected the comparability of our results of operations and our effective tax rates.

However, our gum and candy categories as well as our world travel retail and foodservice businesses were negatively impacted by COVID-19. In emerging markets, where we have a greater concentration of traditional trade, several markets were challenged by COVID-19 impacts, particularly those with significant gum and candy portfolios. Overall, as the negative impacts of COVID-19 experienced in the first half of the year subsided in the second half of the year, revenue growth began to recover in a number of our key emerging markets, though overall emerging markets net revenues declined due to unfavorable currency impacts.Net revenue increase of 2.8% was driven by our underlying Organic Net Revenue growth of 3.7% and the impact of acquisitions, mostly offset by unfavorable currency and the impact of a prior-year divestiture. Organic Net Revenue growth was driven by higher net pricing and favorable volume/mix. Higher net pricing in all regions except Europe was due to the benefit of carryover pricing from 2019 as well as the effects of input cost-driven pricing actions taken during 2020. Favorable volume/mix in North America and Europe, partially offset by unfavorable volume/mix in Latin America and AMEA, included strong volume gains tempered by unfavorable mix reflecting shifts in consumer purchases in response to the COVID-19 outbreak. The April 1, 2020 acquisition of Give & Go added incremental net revenues of $390 million and the July 16, 2019 acquisition of a majority interest in Perfect Snacks added incremental net revenues of $55 million in 2020. Unfavorable currency impacts decreased net revenues by $637 40Table of Contentsmillion, due primarily to the strength of the U.S. dollar relative to most currencies, including the Brazilian real, Argentinean peso, Russian ruble, Mexican peso, Indian rupee, South African rand and Turkish lira, partially offset by the strength of several currencies relative to the U.S. dollar, including the euro, Philippine peso, British pound sterling, Egyptian pound and Swedish krona. The impact of the May 28, 2019 divestiture of most of our cheese business in the Middle East and Africa resulted in a year-over-year decline in net revenues of $55 million.

Higher net pricing, which included the carryover impact of pricing actions taken in 2019 as well as the effects of input cost-driven pricing actions taken during 2020, was reflected in all regions except Europe. Favorable volume/mix was driven by North America and Europe, which was partially offset by unfavorable volume/mix in Latin America and AMEA. The increase in input costs was driven by higher raw material costs, partially offset by lower manufacturing costs driven by productivity net of incremental COVID-19 related costs. Higher raw material costs were in part due to higher currency exchange transaction costs on imported materials, as well as higher cocoa, dairy, sugar, energy, packaging, nuts, grains and other ingredients costs, partially offset by lower costs for oils. Total selling, general and administrative expenses decreased $38 million from 2019, due to a number of factors noted in the table above, including in part, a favorable currency impact related to expenses, favorable change from the resolution of tax matters (a benefit in 2020 as compared to an expense in 2019), lower implementation costs incurred for the Simplify to Grow Program, lapping prior-year value-added tax (“VAT”) related settlements, lapping prior-year CEO transition remuneration and lapping the prior-year divestiture. These decreases were partially offset by the impact of acquisitions, costs associated with the JDE Peet's transaction, lapping the benefit from prior-year pension participation changes, unfavorable change in remeasurement of net monetary position in Argentina (remeasurement loss in 2020 as compared to a remeasurement gain in 2019) and higher acquisition-related costs. Excluding these factors, selling, general and administrative expenses increased $77 million from 2019. The increase was driven primarily by higher advertising and consumer promotion costs, partially offset by lower overhead spending net of incremental COVID-19 related costs. We recorded an expense of $11 million from a VAT-related settlement in Latin America in 2019. Unfavorable currency changes decreased operating income by $59 million due primarily to the strength of the U.S. dollar relative to most currencies, including the Brazilian real, Russian ruble, Indian rupee, Swiss franc, South African rand and Turkish Lira, partially offset by the strength of several currencies relative to the U.S. dollar, including the euro, Egyptian pound, Philippine peso, British pound sterling and Swedish krona.Operating income margin decreased from 14.9% in 2019 to 14.5% in 2020. The decrease in operating income margin was driven primarily by the year-over-year unfavorable change in mark-to-market gains/(losses) from currency and commodity hedging activities, higher intangible asset impairment charges, costs associated with the JDE Peet's transaction, lapping the prior-year gain on a divestiture and lapping the benefit from prior-year pension participation changes, partially offset by the favorable impact from the resolution of tax matters and lower costs for the Simplify to Grow Program. Adjusted Operating Income margin increased from 16.5% in 2019 to 16.6% in 2020. The increase in Adjusted Operating Income margin was driven primarily by higher pricing, lower manufacturing costs reflecting productivity net of incremental COVD-19 costs, and selling, general and administrative cost leverage, mostly offset by higher raw material costs.43Table of ContentsNet Earnings and Earnings per Share Attributable to Mondelēz International – Net earnings attributable to Mondelēz International of $3,555 million decreased by $374 million (9.5%) in 2020.

Unfavorable currency impacts decreased net revenues by $1,154 million, due primarily to the strength of the U.S. dollar relative to most currencies, including the Argentinean peso, euro, Brazilian real, British pound sterling, Australian dollar, Chinese yuan, Indian rupee, Turkish lira and South African rand. The impact of the divestiture of most of our cheese business in the Middle East and Africa on May 28, 2019 resulted in a year-over-year decline in net revenues of $71 million. Our underlying Organic Net Revenue growth was driven by higher net pricing and favorable volume/mix. Net pricing was up, which includes the benefit of carryover pricing from 2018 as well as the effects of input cost-driven pricing actions taken during 2019. Higher net pricing was reflected in Latin America, North America and AMEA as net pricing in Europe was flat. Favorable volume/mix was reflected in Europe and AMEA, partially offset by unfavorable volume/mix in Latin America and North America. The July 16, 2019 acquisition of a majority interest in Perfect Snacks added net revenues of $53 million and the June 7, 2018 acquisition of Tate’s Bake Shop added incremental net revenues of $35 million in 2019.

Higher net pricing, which included the carryover impact of pricing actions taken in 2018 as well as the effects of input cost-driven pricing actions taken during 2019, was reflected in Latin America, North America and AMEA as net pricing in Europe was flat. The increase in input costs was driven by higher raw material costs, partially offset by lower manufacturing costs due to productivity efforts. Higher raw material costs were in part due to higher currency exchange transaction costs on imported materials, as well as higher packaging, energy, dairy, grains, cocoa and oils costs, partially offset by lower costs for sugar and nuts. Favorable volume/mix was driven by Europe and AMEA, which was partially offset by unfavorable volume/mix in Latin America and North America. Total selling, general and administrative expenses decreased $339 million from 2018, due to a number of factors noted in the table above, including in part, the lapping of the prior-year impact from pension participation changes, favorable currency impact, the benefit from current-year pension participation changes, favorable change in remeasurement of net monetary position in Argentina (remeasurement gain in 2019 as compared to a remeasurement loss in 2018), the lapping of a prior-year expense from the resolution of a tax matter, lower CEO transition remuneration and lower acquisition-related costs. These decreases were partially offset by the expenses from the resolution of tax matters in 2019, higher implementation costs incurred for the Simplify to Grow program, the impact of acquisitions, the lapping of a benefit from a prior-year VAT-related settlement, a VAT cost settlement in 2019 and higher divestiture-related costs. Excluding these factors, selling, general and administrative expenses increased $173 million from 2018. The increase was driven primarily by higher overheads reflecting route-to-market investments and higher advertising and consumer promotion costs. We recorded an expense of $11 million from a VAT-related settlement in Latin America in 2019 and a benefit of $21 million from a VAT-related settlement in Latin America in 2018. Unfavorable currency changes decreased operating income by $227 million due primarily to the strength of the U.S. dollar relative to most currencies, including the euro, Argentinean peso, British pound sterling, Brazilian real, Australian dollar, Chinese yuan and Indian rupee.Operating income margin increased from 12.8% in 2018 to 14.9% in 2019. The increase in operating income margin was driven primarily by the lapping of the prior-year impact from pension participation changes, lower Simplify to Grow Program costs, a gain on divestiture, the benefit from current-year pension participation changes, the lapping of a prior-year expense from the resolution of a tax matter and lower CEO transition remuneration, partially offset by the expenses from the resolution of tax matters in 2019 and the year-over-year unfavorable change in mark-to-market gains/(losses) from currency and commodity hedging activities. Adjusted Operating Income margin decreased from 16.7% in 2018 to 16.5% in 2019. The decrease in Adjusted Operating Income margin was driven primarily by higher raw material costs, mostly offset by higher pricing and lower manufacturing costs.48Table of ContentsNet Earnings and Earnings per Share Attributable to Mondelēz International – Net earnings attributable to Mondelēz International of $3,929 million increased by $612 million (18.5%) in 2019.

Unfavorable currency impacts were due primarily to the strength of the U.S. dollar relative to most currencies in the region including the Brazilian real, Argentinean peso and Mexican peso. Unfavorable volume/mix was due to the negative volume impact from the COVID-19 outbreak as well as the impact of pricing-related elasticity. Unfavorable volume/mix was driven by declines in gum and candy, partially offset by gains in cheese & grocery, chocolate, refreshment beverages and biscuits. Higher net pricing was reflected across all categories, driven primarily by Argentina, Brazil and Mexico. Segment operating income decreased $152 million (44.6%), primarily due to higher raw material costs, unfavorable volume/mix, unfavorable currency, higher other selling, general and administrative expenses (net of lapping the expense of VAT-related settlements in 2019) and an unfavorable change in remeasurement of net monetary position in Argentina (remeasurement loss in 2020 as compared to a remeasurement gain in 2019). These unfavorable items were partially offset by higher net pricing, lower manufacturing costs (net of incremental COVID-19 related costs), lower costs incurred for the Simplify to Grow Program and higher benefits from the resolution of a tax matters. 2019 compared with 2018:Net revenues decreased $184 million (5.7%), due to unfavorable currency (13.5 pp) and unfavorable volume/mix (2.1 pp), partially offset by higher net pricing (9.9 pp). Unfavorable currency impacts were due primarily to the strength of the U.S. dollar relative to most currencies in the region including the Argentinean peso and Brazilian real. Unfavorable volume/mix was due to the impact of pricing-related elasticity, and was driven by declines in refreshment beverages, candy, cheese & grocery and chocolate, partially offset by gains in biscuits and gum. Higher net pricing was reflected across all categories, driven primarily by Argentina, Brazil and Mexico.Segment operating income decreased $69 million (16.8%), primarily due to higher raw material costs, unfavorable currency, unfavorable volume/mix, the lapping of the 2018 benefit from the resolution of a Brazilian indirect tax matter of $26 million, higher manufacturing costs and higher other selling, general and administrative expenses (including lapping the benefit from a VAT-related settlement in 2018 and the expense of a VAT-related settlement in 2019). These unfavorable items were partially offset by higher net pricing, lower costs incurred for the Simplify to Grow Program, favorable change in remeasurement of net monetary position in Argentina (remeasurement gain in 2019 as compared to a remeasurement loss in 2018) and lower advertising and consumer promotion costs.52Table of ContentsAMEA For the Years EndedDecember 31, 20202019$ change% change (in millions) Net revenues$5,740 $5,770 $(30)(0.5)%Segment operating income821 691 130 18.8 % For the Years EndedDecember 31, 20192018$ change% change (in millions) Net revenues$5,770 $5,729 $41 0.7 %Segment operating income691 702 (11)(1.6)%2020 compared with 2019:Net revenues decreased $30 million (0.5%), due to unfavorable currency (1.3 pp), the impact of a divestiture (0.9 pp) and unfavorable volume/mix (0.6 pp), partially offset by higher net pricing (2.3 pp).

The May 28, 2019 divestiture of most of our cheese business in the Middle East and Africa resulted in a year-over-year decline in net revenues of $55 million. Unfavorable volume/mix was due to unfavorable product mix as overall higher volume was tempered by the negative volume impact from COVID-19 related lockdowns impacting our traditional trade markets. Unfavorable volume/mix was driven by declines in gum, chocolate, candy and refreshment beverages, partially offset by gains in biscuits and cheese & grocery. Higher net pricing was driven by chocolate, biscuits, refreshment beverages and cheese & grocery, partially offset by lower net pricing in candy and gum. Segment operating income increased $130 million (18.8%), primarily due to higher net pricing, lapping prior-year expenses from the resolution of tax matters in India totaling $87 million, lower manufacturing costs (net of incremental COVID-19 related costs), lower other selling, general and administrative expenses, lower intangible asset impairment charges and lower costs incurred for the Simplify to Grow Program. These favorable items were partially offset by higher raw material costs, unfavorable volume/mix, unfavorable currency and the impact of the prior-year divestiture. 2019 compared with 2018:Net revenues increased $41 million (0.7%), due to favorable volume/mix (3.6 pp) and higher net pricing (1.7 pp), mostly offset by unfavorable currency (3.3 pp) and the impact of a divestiture (1.3 pp). Favorable volume/mix was driven by gains across all categories except refreshment beverages and candy. Higher net pricing was reflected across all categories. Unfavorable currency impacts were due to the strength of the U.S. dollar relative to several currencies in the region, including the Australian dollar, Chinese yuan, Indian rupee and South African rand. The divestiture of most of our cheese business in the Middle East and Africa on May 28, 2019, resulted in a year-over-year decline in net revenues of $71 million. Segment operating income decreased $11 million (1.6%), primarily due to higher raw material costs, expenses from the resolution of tax matters in India totaling $87 million, higher advertising and consumer promotion costs, unfavorable currency, higher other selling, general and administrative expenses, the impact of the divestiture and higher intangible asset impairment charges. These unfavorable items were partially offset by lower manufacturing costs, higher net pricing, lower costs incurred for the Simplify to Grow Program and favorable volume/mix.53Table of ContentsEurope For the Years EndedDecember 31, 20202019$ change% change (in millions) Net revenues$10,207 $9,972 $235 2.4 %Segment operating income1,775 1,732 43 2.5 % For the Years EndedDecember 31, 20192018$ change% change (in millions) Net revenues$9,972 $10,122 $(150)(1.5)%Segment operating income1,732 1,734 (2)(0.1)%2020 compared with 2019:Net revenues increased $235 million (2.4%), due to favorable volume/mix (2.8 pp), partially offset by lower net pricing (0.3 pp) and unfavorable currency (0.1 pp).

The preparation of these financial statements requires the use of estimates, judgments and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the periods presented. Actual results could differ from those estimates and assumptions. Note 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, to the consolidated financial statements includes a summary of the significant accounting policies we used to prepare our consolidated financial statements. We have discussed the selection and disclosure of our critical accounting policies and estimates with our Audit Committee. The following is a review of our most significant assumptions and estimates.Goodwill and Indefinite-Life Intangible Assets:We test goodwill and indefinite-life intangible assets for impairment on an annual basis on July 1. We assess goodwill impairment risk throughout the year by performing a qualitative review of entity-specific, industry, market and general economic factors affecting our goodwill reporting units. We review our operating segment and reporting unit structure for goodwill testing annually or as significant changes in the organization occur. Annually, we may perform qualitative testing, or depending on factors such as prior-year test results, current year developments, current risk evaluations and other practical considerations, we may elect to do quantitative testing instead. In our quantitative testing, we compare a reporting unit’s estimated fair value with its carrying value. We estimate a reporting unit’s fair value using a discounted cash flow method which incorporates planned growth rates, market-based discount rates and estimates of residual value. This year, for our Europe and North America reporting units, we used a market-based, weighted-average cost of capital of 6.1% to discount the projected cash flows of those operations. For our Latin America and AMEA reporting units, we used a risk-rated discount rate of 9.1%. Estimating the fair value of individual reporting units requires us to make assumptions and estimates regarding our future plans and industry and economic conditions based on available information. Given the uncertainty of the global economic environment and the impact of COVID-19, those estimates could be significantly different than future performance. If the carrying value of a reporting unit’s net assets exceeds its fair value, we would recognize an impairment charge for the amount by which the carrying value exceeds the reporting unit fair value.In 2020, 2019 and 2018, there were no impairments of goodwill. In connection with our 2020 annual impairment testing, each of our reporting units had sufficient fair value in excess of carrying value. While all reporting units passed our annual impairment testing, if planned business performance expectations are not met or specific valuation factors outside of our control, such as discount rates, change significantly, then the estimated fair values of a reporting unit or reporting units might decline and lead to a goodwill impairment in the future.Annually, we assess indefinite-life intangible assets for impairment by performing a qualitative review and assessing events and circumstances that could affect the fair value or carrying value of these assets. If significant potential impairment risk exists for a specific asset, we quantitatively test it for impairment by comparing its estimated fair value with its carrying value. We determine estimated fair value using planned growth rates, market-based discount rates and estimates of royalty rates. If the carrying value of the asset exceeds its estimated fair value, the asset is impaired and its carrying value is reduced to the estimated fair value.During 2020, we recorded $144 million of intangible asset impairment charges related to eight brands. We recorded charges related to gum, chocolate, biscuits and candy brands of $83 million in North America, $53 million in Europe, $5 million in AMEA and $3 million in Latin America. The impairment charges were calculated as the excess of the carrying value over the estimated fair value of the intangible assets on a global basis and were recorded within asset impairment and exit costs. We use several accepted valuation methods, including relief of royalty, excess earnings and excess margin, that utilize estimates of future sales, earnings growth rates, royalty rates and discount rates in determining a brand's global fair value. We also identified nine brands, including the eight impaired brands, with $753 million of aggregate book value as of December 31, 2020 that each had a fair value in excess of book value of 10% or less. We continue to monitor our brand performance, particularly in light of the significant uncertainty due to the COVID-19 pandemic and related impacts to our business. If the brand earnings expectations are not met or specific valuation factors outside of our control, such as discount rates, change significantly, then a brand or brands could become impaired in the future. In 2019, we recorded charges related to gum, chocolate, biscuits and candy brands of $39 million in Europe, $15 million in AMEA and $3 million in Latin America. In 2018, we recorded charges related to gum, chocolate, biscuits and candy brands of $45 million in Europe, $14 million in North America and $9 million in AMEA.Refer to Note 6, Goodwill and Intangible Assets, for additional information.56Table of ContentsTrade and marketing programs:We promote our products with trade and sales incentives as well as marketing and advertising programs. These programs include, but are not limited to, new product introduction fees, discounts, coupons, rebates and volume-based incentives as well as cooperative advertising, in-store displays and consumer marketing promotions. Trade and sales incentives are recorded as a reduction to revenues based on amounts estimated due to customers and consumers at the end of a period. We base these estimates principally on historical utilization and redemption rates. For interim reporting purposes, advertising and consumer promotion expenses are charged to operations as a percentage of volume, based on estimated sales volume and estimated program spending. We do not defer costs on our year-end consolidated balance sheet and all marketing and advertising costs are recorded as an expense in the year incurred.Employee Benefit Plans:We sponsor various employee benefit plans throughout the world. These include primarily pension plans and postretirement healthcare benefits. For accounting purposes, we estimate the pension and postretirement healthcare benefit obligations utilizing assumptions and estimates for discount rates; expected returns on plan assets; expected compensation increases; employee-related factors such as turnover, retirement age and mortality; and health care cost trends. We review our actuarial assumptions on an annual basis and make modifications to the assumptions based on current rates and trends when appropriate. Our assumptions also reflect our historical experiences and management’s best judgment regarding future expectations. These and other assumptions affect the annual expense and obligations recognized for the underlying plans.As permitted by U.S. GAAP, we generally amortize the effect of changes in the assumptions over future periods. The cost or benefit of plan changes, such as increasing or decreasing benefits for prior employee service (prior service cost), is deferred and included in expense on a straight-line basis over the average remaining service period of the employees expected to receive benefits.Since pension and postretirement liabilities are measured on a discounted basis, the discount rate significantly affects our plan obligations and expenses. For plans that have assets held in trust, the expected return on plan assets assumption affects our pension plan expenses. The assumptions for discount rates and expected rates of return and our process for setting these assumptions are described in Note 11, Benefit Plans, to the consolidated financial statements.While we do not anticipate further changes in the 2020 assumptions for our U.S. and non-U.S. pension and postretirement health care plans, as a sensitivity measure, a fifty-basis point change in our discount rates or the expected rate of return on plan assets would have the following effects, increase/(decrease), on our annual benefit plan costs: As of December 31, 2020 U.S. PlansNon-U.S. PlansFifty-Basis-PointFifty-Basis-Point IncreaseDecreaseIncreaseDecrease (in millions)Effect of change in discount rate on pension costs$(2)$2 $(35)$68 Effect of change in expected rate of return on plan assets on pension costs(8)8 (54)54 Effect of change in discount rate on postretirement health care costs(3)3 — — In accordance with obligations we have under collective bargaining agreements, we participate in multiemployer pension plans. In 2017, the only individually significant multiemployer plan we contributed to was the Bakery and Confectionery Union and Industry International Pension Fund. Our obligation to contribute to the Fund arose with respect to 8 collective bargaining agreements covering most of our employees represented by the Bakery, Confectionery, Tobacco and Grain Millers Union. All of those collective bargaining agreements expired in 2016. In 2018, we executed a complete withdrawal from the Fund and recorded a $429 million estimated withdrawal liability. On July 11, 2019, we received an undiscounted withdrawal liability assessment from the Fund totaling $526 million requiring pro-rata monthly payments over 20 years and we recorded a $35 million final adjustment to reduce our 57Table of Contentswithdrawal liability as of June 30, 2019. We began making monthly payments during the third quarter of 2019. As of December 31, 2020, the remaining discounted withdrawal liability was $375 million.See additional information on our employee benefit plans in Note 11, Benefit Plans.Income Taxes:As a global company, we calculate and provide for income taxes in each tax jurisdiction in which we operate. The provision for income taxes includes the amounts payable or refundable for the current year, the effect of deferred taxes and impacts from uncertain tax positions. Our provision for income taxes is significantly affected by shifts in the geographic mix of our pre-tax earnings across tax jurisdictions, changes in tax laws and regulations, tax planning opportunities available in each tax jurisdiction and the ultimate outcome of various tax audits.Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between the financial statement and tax bases of our assets and liabilities and for operating losses and tax credit carryforwards. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates that will apply to taxable income in the years in which those differences are expected to be recovered or settled. Valuation allowances are established for deferred tax assets when it is more likely than not that a tax benefit will not be realized.We believe our tax positions comply with applicable tax laws and that we have properly accounted for uncertain tax positions. We recognize tax benefits in our financial statements from uncertain tax positions only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained by the taxing authorities based on the technical merits of the position. The amount we recognize is measured as the largest amount of benefit that is greater than 50 percent likely of being realized upon resolution. We evaluate uncertain tax positions on an ongoing basis and adjust the amount recognized in light of changing facts and circumstances, such as the progress of a tax audit or expiration of a statute of limitations. We believe the estimates and assumptions used to support our evaluation of uncertain tax positions are reasonable. However, final determination of historical tax liabilities, whether by settlement with tax authorities, judicial or administrative ruling or due to expiration of statutes of limitations, could be materially different from estimates reflected on our consolidated balance sheet and historical income tax provisions. The outcome of these final determinations could have a material effect on our provision for income taxes, net earnings or cash flows in the period in which the determination is made.See Note 16, Income Taxes, for further discussion of the impacts from Swiss and U.S. tax reform in our financial statements, as well as additional information on our effective tax rate, current and deferred taxes, valuation allowances and unrecognized tax benefits.Contingencies:See Note 14, Commitments and Contingencies, to the consolidated financial statements.New Accounting Guidance:See Note 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, to the consolidated financial statements for a discussion of new accounting standards.58Table of ContentsLiquidity and Capital ResourcesWe believe that cash from operations, our revolving credit facilities, short-term borrowings and our authorized long-term financing will continue to provide sufficient liquidity for our working capital needs, planned capital expenditures and future payments of our contractual, tax and benefit plan obligations and payments for acquisitions, share repurchases and quarterly dividends. In light of the current uncertainty in the global markets related to the COVID-19 pandemic, however, an economic or credit crisis could occur and impair credit availability and our ability to raise capital when needed. A disruption in the financial markets could also impair our banking and other business partners, on whom we rely for access to capital and as counterparties for a number of our derivative contracts. Any of these and other developments could materially harm our access to capital or financial condition. As a precautionary measure and to preserve financial flexibility, we temporarily increased our credit facility borrowing capacity in 2020. In the third quarter of 2020, we completed the retirement of this incremental short-term borrowing capacity and have returned our credit facility available capacity to pre-COVID-19 levels. Refer to Note 9, Debt and Borrowing Arrangements, for additional details. In connection with COVID-19 and various legislatively authorized tax payment deferral mechanisms available for income tax, indirect tax (such as value-added tax) and payroll tax in a number of jurisdictions, we were able to defer certain of these tax payments, which provided a cash benefit that reverses when the payments come due. Some of these payments were made in the fourth quarter of 2020; the remainder will come due in 2021 and 2022. The benefits associated with the deferral of these payments were not material. We expect to continue to utilize our commercial paper program and international credit lines as needed, and we secured and continue to evaluate long-term debt issuances to meet our short- and longer-term funding requirements. We also use intercompany loans with our international subsidiaries to improve financial flexibility. Overall, we do not expect any negative effects to our funding sources that would have a material effect on our liquidity; however, if a serious economic or credit market crisis ensues, it could have a material adverse effect on our liquidity, results of operations and financial condition.Net Cash Provided by Operating Activities:Operating activities provided net cash of $3,964 million in 2020, $3,965 million in 2019 and $3,948 million in 2018. Net cash provided by operating activities was largely flat in 2020 relative to 2019 as higher cash tax payments in 2020 (primarily related to sales of KDP and JDE Peet's shares and the resolution of several indirect tax matters under a tax amnesty program in India) and the payment of costs associated with the JDE Peet's transaction in 2020 were largely offset by working capital improvements. The increase in net cash provided by operating activities in 2019 relative to 2018 was due primarily to higher earnings, increased distributions from equity method investments and lower pension contributions, partially offset by increased working capital requirements including higher tax payments.Net Cash Provided by/Used in Investing Activities:Net cash provided by investing activities was $500 million in 2020, compared to net cash used in investing activities of $960 million in 2019 and $1,224 million in 2018. The increase in net cash provided by investing activities in 2020 relative to 2019 was primarily due to cash received from the sale of shares in the JDE Peet's and KDP offerings and lower capital expenditures, partially offset by cash paid to acquire a majority interest in Give & Go. The decrease in net cash used in investing activities in 2019 relative to 2018 was primarily due to less cash expended for acquisitions in 2019 than in 2018, lower capital expenditures and the 2019 cash proceeds from the divestiture of primarily our cheese business in the Middle East and Africa, partially offset by lower cash received as a result of the settlement and replacement of several net investment hedge derivative contracts and cash paid to settle our forward-starting interest rate swaps.Capital expenditures were $863 million in 2020, $925 million in 2019 and $1,095 million in 2018. We continue to make capital expenditures primarily to modernize manufacturing facilities and support new product and productivity initiatives. We expect 2021 capital expenditures to be up to $1.0 billion, including capital expenditures in connection with our Simplify to Grow Program. We expect to continue to fund these expenditures with cash from operations.Net Cash Used in Financing Activities:Net cash used in financing activities was $2,215 million in 2020, $2,787 million in 2019 and $2,329 million in 2018. The decrease in net cash used in financing activities in 2020 relative to 2019 was primarily due to higher net debt issuances and lower share repurchases, partially offset by higher dividends paid and lower proceeds from stock option exercises in 2020. The increase in net cash used in financing activities in 2019 relative to 2018 was primarily due to lower net debt issuances and higher dividends paid in 2019, partially offset by lower share repurchases.59Table of ContentsDebt:From time to time we refinance long-term and short-term debt. Refer to Note 9, Debt and Borrowing Arrangements, for details of our recent tender offers, debt issuances and maturities. The nature and amount of our long-term and short-term debt and the proportionate amount of each varies as a result of current and expected business requirements, market conditions and other factors. Due to seasonality, in the first and second quarters of the year, our working capital requirements grow, increasing the need for short-term financing. The second half of the year typically generates higher cash flows. As such, we may issue commercial paper or secure other forms of financing throughout the year to meet short-term working capital or other financing needs.One of our subsidiaries, Mondelez International Holdings Netherlands B.V. (“MIHN”), has outstanding debt. Refer to Note 9, Debt and Borrowing Arrangements. The operations held by MIHN generated approximately 71.8% (or $19.1 billion) of the $26.6 billion of consolidated net revenue during fiscal year 2020 and represented approximately 76.2% (or $21.1 billion) of the $27.7 billion of net assets as of December 31, 2020.During December 2020, our Board of Directors approved a new $6.0 billion long-term financing authority to replace the prior $8.0 billion authority. As of December 31, 2020, we had $6.0 billion of long-term financing authority remaining.In January 2021, we repaid approximately $0.8 billion of maturing debt. In the next 12 months, we expect to repay approximately $1.8 billion of maturing long-term debt including: $1.5 billion in October 2021 and $0.3 billion in December 2021. We expect to fund these repayments with cash on hand, as well as short-term and long-term debt.Our total debt was $20.0 billion at December 31, 2020 and $18.4 billion at December 31, 2019. Our debt-to-capitalization ratio was 0.42 at December 31, 2020 and 0.40 at December 31, 2019. At December 31, 2020, the weighted-average term of our outstanding long-term debt was 7.4 years. Our average daily commercial borrowings were $2.3 billion in 2020, $4.1 billion in 2019 and $4.5 billion in 2018. We had no commercial paper borrowings outstanding at December 31, 2020 and $2.6 billion outstanding as of December 31, 2019. We expect to continue to use cash or commercial paper to finance various short-term financing needs. As of December 31, 2020, we continued to be in compliance with our debt covenants. Refer to Note 9, Debt and Borrowing Arrangements, for more information on our debt and debt covenants.Commodity TrendsWe regularly monitor worldwide supply, commodity cost and currency trends so we can cost-effectively secure ingredients, packaging and fuel required for production. During 2020, the primary drivers of the increase in our aggregate commodity costs were higher currency exchange transaction costs on imported materials, as well as increased costs for cocoa, dairy, sugar, energy, packaging, nuts, grains and other ingredients costs, partially offset by lower costs for oils.A number of external factors such as weather conditions, commodity market conditions, currency fluctuations and the effects of governmental agricultural or other programs affect the cost and availability of raw materials and agricultural materials used in our products. We address higher commodity costs and currency impacts primarily through hedging, higher pricing and manufacturing and overhead cost control. We use hedging techniques to limit the impact of fluctuations in the cost of our principal raw materials; however, we may not be able to fully hedge against commodity cost changes, such as dairy, where there is a limited ability to hedge, and our hedging strategies may not protect us from increases in specific raw material costs. Due to competitive or market conditions, planned trade or promotional incentives, fluctuations in currency exchange rates or other factors, our pricing actions may also lag commodity cost changes temporarily.We expect price volatility and a higher aggregate cost environment to continue in 2021. While the costs of our principal raw materials fluctuate, we believe there will continue to be an adequate supply of the raw materials we use and that they will generally remain available from numerous sources.Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements and Aggregate Contractual ObligationsWe have no significant off-balance sheet arrangements other than the contractual obligations discussed below.60Table of ContentsGuarantees:As discussed in Note 14, Commitments and Contingencies, we enter into third-party guarantees primarily to cover the long-term obligations of our vendors. As part of these transactions, we guarantee that third parties will make contractual payments or achieve performance measures. At December 31, 2020, we had no material third-party guarantees recorded on our consolidated balance sheet.Guarantees do not have, and we do not expect them to have, a material effect on our liquidity.Aggregate Contractual Obligations:The following table summarizes our contractual obligations at December 31, 2020. Payments Due Total20212022-232024-252026 and Thereafter (in millions)Debt (1)$19,855 $2,669 $4,434 $3,081 $9,671 Interest expense (2)4,194 427 705 556 2,506 Finance leases (3)276 81 122 51 22 Operating leases757 203 262 123 169 Purchase obligations: (4)Inventory and production costs6,612 3,750 2,314 473 75 Other1,188 853 248 87 — 32,882 7,983 8,085 4,371 12,443 U.S. tax reform transition liability (5)936 95 247 497 97 Multiemployer pension plan withdrawal liability (6)489 26 53 53 357 Other long-term liabilities (7)208 33 33 34 108 Total$34,515 $8,137 $8,418 $4,955 $13,005 (1)Amounts include the expected cash payments of our long-term debt, including the current portion and excluding finance leases, which are presented separately in the table above. The amounts also exclude $94 million of net unamortized non-cash bond premiums, discounts, bank fees and mark-to-market adjustments related to our interest rate swaps recorded in total debt.(2)Amounts represent the expected cash payments of our interest expense on our long-term debt. Interest calculated on our non-U.S. dollar denominated debt was forecasted using currency exchange rates as of December 31, 2020. (3)Amounts exclude imputed interest on finance leases of $20 million.(4)Purchase obligations for inventory and production costs (such as raw materials, indirect materials and supplies, packaging, co-manufacturing arrangements, storage and distribution) are commitments for projected needs to be utilized in the normal course of business. Other purchase obligations include commitments for marketing, advertising, capital expenditures, information technology and professional services. Arrangements are considered purchase obligations if a contract specifies all significant terms, including fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased, a pricing structure and approximate timing of the transaction. Most arrangements are cancelable without a significant penalty and with short notice (usually 30 days). Any amounts reflected on the consolidated balance sheet as accounts payable and accrued liabilities are excluded from the table above.(5)In connection with U.S. tax reform, we estimate paying a total $1.3 billion transition tax liability through 2026. As of December 31, 2020, the amount outstanding was $0.9 billion. See Note 16, Income Taxes, for additional information on U.S. tax reform and its impact on our financial statements.(6)During 2018, we executed a complete withdrawal liability from our most individually significant multiemployer pension plan. On July 11, 2019, we received an undiscounted withdrawal liability assessment from the Fund totaling $526 million requiring pro-rata monthly payments over 20 years through 2039. See Note 11, Benefit Plans, for additional information on our multiemployer pension plan withdrawal liability.(7)Other long-term liabilities in the table above include the long-term liabilities and any current portion of these obligations. We have included the estimated future benefit payments for our postretirement health care plans through December 31, 2030 of $172 million. We are unable to reliably estimate the timing of the payments beyond 2030; as such, they are excluded from the above table. There are also another $18 million of various other long-term liabilities that are expected to be paid over the next 5 years. In addition, the following long-term liabilities included on the consolidated balance sheet are excluded from the table above: accrued pension costs, unrecognized tax benefits, insurance accruals and other accruals. As of December 31, 2020, our unrecognized tax benefit, including associated interest and penalties, classified as a long-term payable is $515 million. We currently expect to make approximately $236 million in contributions to our pension plans in 2021.61Table of ContentsEquity and DividendsStock Plans:See Note 12, Stock Plans, to the consolidated financial statements for more information on our stock plans and grant activity during 2018-2020.Share Repurchases:See Note 13, Capital Stock, to the consolidated financial statements and Item 5, Market for Registrant’s Common Equity, Related Stockholder Matters and Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities – Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities, for more information on our share repurchase program. As of December 31, 2020, our Board of Director has authorized share repurchases up to $23.7 billion through December 31, 2023. Under this program, we have repurchased approximately $17.9 billion of shares through December 31, 2020 ($1.4 billion in 2020, $1.5 billion in 2019, $2.0 billion in 2018, $2.2 billion in 2017, $2.6 billion in 2016, $3.6 billion in 2015, $1.9 billion in 2014 and $2.7 billion in 2013), at a weighted-average cost of $40.57 per share. The number of shares that we ultimately repurchase under our share repurchase program may vary depending on numerous factors, including share price and other market conditions, our ongoing capital allocation planning, levels of cash and debt balances, other demands for cash, such as acquisition activity, general economic or business conditions and board and management discretion. Additionally, our share repurchase activity during any particular period may fluctuate. We may accelerate, suspend, delay or discontinue our share repurchase program at any time, without notice.Dividends:We paid dividends of $1,678 million in 2020, $1,542 million in 2019 and $1,359 million in 2018. On July 28, 2020, the Finance Committee, with authorization delegated from our Board of Directors, declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.315 per share of Class A Common Stock, an increase of 11 percent, which would be $1.26 per common share on an annualized basis. In 2019, our quarterly cash dividend increased from $0.26 to $0.285 per share of Class A Common Stock, an increase of 10 percent, and in 2018, our quarterly cash dividend increased from $0.22 to $0.26 per share of Class A Common Stock, an increase of 18 percent. The declaration of dividends is subject to the discretion of our Board of Directors and depends on various factors, including our net earnings, financial condition, cash requirements, future prospects and other factors that our Board of Directors deems relevant to its analysis and decision making.For U.S. income tax purposes only, the Company has determined that 100% of the distributions paid to its shareholders in 2020 are characterized as a qualified dividend paid from U.S. earnings and profits. Shareholders should consult their tax advisors for a full understanding of the tax consequences of the receipt of dividends.62Table of ContentsNon-GAAP Financial MeasuresWe use non-GAAP financial information and believe it is useful to investors as it provides additional information to facilitate comparisons of historical operating results, identify trends in our underlying operating results and provide additional insight and transparency on how we evaluate our business. We use non-GAAP financial measures to budget, make operating and strategic decisions and evaluate our performance. We have detailed the non-GAAP adjustments that we make in our non-GAAP definitions below. The adjustments generally fall within the following categories: acquisition & divestiture activities, gains and losses on intangible asset sales and non-cash impairments, major program restructuring activities, constant currency and related adjustments, major program financing and hedging activities and other major items affecting comparability of operating results. We believe the non-GAAP measures should always be considered along with the related U.S. GAAP financial measures. We have provided the reconciliations between the GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures below, and we also discuss our underlying GAAP results throughout our Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations in this Form 10-K.Our primary non-GAAP financial measures are listed below and reflect how we evaluate our current and prior-year operating results. As new events or circumstances arise, these definitions could change. When our definitions change, we provide the updated definitions and present the related non-GAAP historical results on a comparable basis (1).•“Organic Net Revenue” is defined as net revenues excluding the impacts of acquisitions, divestitures (2) and currency rate fluctuations (3). We also evaluate Organic Net Revenue growth from emerging and developed markets.•Our emerging markets include our Latin America region in its entirety; the AMEA region, excluding Australia, New Zealand and Japan; and the following countries from the Europe region: Russia, Ukraine, Turkey, Kazakhstan, Belarus, Georgia, Poland, Czech Republic, Slovak Republic, Hungary, Bulgaria, Romania, the Baltics and the East Adriatic countries. •Our developed markets include the entire North America region, the Europe region excluding the countries included in the emerging markets definition, and Australia, New Zealand and Japan from the AMEA region.•“Adjusted Operating Income” is defined as operating income excluding the impacts of the Simplify to Grow Program (4); gains or losses (including non-cash impairment charges) on goodwill and intangible assets; divestiture (2) or acquisition gains or losses and related divestiture (2), acquisition and integration costs (2); the operating results of divestitures (2); remeasurement of net monetary position (5); mark-to-market impacts from commodity and forecasted currency transaction derivative contracts (6); impact from resolution of tax matters (7); CEO transition remuneration (8); impact from pension participation changes (9); Swiss tax reform impacts (10); and costs associated with the JDE Peet's transaction (1). We also present “Adjusted Operating Income margin,” which is subject to the same adjustments as Adjusted Operating Income. We also evaluate growth in our Adjusted Operating Income on a constant currency basis (3).•“Adjusted EPS” is defined as diluted EPS attributable to Mondelēz International from continuing operations excluding the impacts of the items listed in the Adjusted Operating Income definition as well as losses on debt extinguishment and related expenses; gains or losses on equity method investment transactions; net earnings from divestitures (2); gains or losses on interest rate swaps no longer designated as accounting cash flow hedges due to changed financing and hedging plans and U.S. and Swiss tax reform impacts (10). Similarly, within Adjusted EPS, our equity method investment net earnings exclude our proportionate share of our investees’ significant operating and non-operating items (11). We also evaluate growth in our Adjusted EPS on a constant currency basis (3).(1) When items no longer impact our current or future presentation of non-GAAP operating results, we remove these items from our non-GAAP definitions. During 2020, we added to the non-GAAP definitions the exclusion of costs associated with the JDE Peet's transaction. Refer to Note 7, Equity Method Investments, and Note 16, Income Taxes, for more information on the JDE Peet's transaction.(2) Divestitures include completed sales of businesses (including the partial or full sale of an equity method investment) and exits of major product lines upon completion of a sale or licensing agreement. As we record our share of KDP and JDE Peet’s ongoing earnings on a one-quarter lag basis, any KDP or JDE Peet’s ownership reductions are reflected as divestitures within our non-GAAP results the following quarter. See Note 2, Acquisitions and Divestitures, and Note 7, Equity Method Investments, for information on acquisitions and divestitures impacting the comparability of our results.(3) Constant currency operating results are calculated by dividing or multiplying, as appropriate, the current-period local currency operating results by the currency exchange rates used to translate the financial statements in the comparable prior-year period to determine what the current-period U.S. dollar operating results would have been if the currency exchange rate had not changed from the comparable prior-year period.63Table of Contents(4) Non-GAAP adjustments related to the Simplify to Grow Program reflect costs incurred that relate to the objectives of our program to transform our supply chain network and organizational structure. Costs that do not meet the program objectives are not reflected in the non-GAAP adjustments.(5) During the third quarter of 2018, as we began to apply highly inflationary accounting for Argentina (refer to Note 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies), we excluded the remeasurement gains or losses related to remeasuring net monetary assets or liabilities in Argentina to be consistent with our prior accounting for these remeasurement gains/losses for Venezuela when it was subject to highly inflationary accounting prior to 2016. (6) During the third quarter of 2016, we began to exclude unrealized gains and losses (mark-to-market impacts) from outstanding commodity and forecasted currency transaction derivatives from our non-GAAP earnings measures until such time that the related exposures impact our operating results. Since we purchase commodity and forecasted currency transaction contracts to mitigate price volatility primarily for inventory requirements in future periods, we made this adjustment to remove the volatility of these future inventory purchases on current operating results to facilitate comparisons of our underlying operating performance across periods. We also discontinued designating commodity and forecasted currency transaction derivatives for hedge accounting treatment. To facilitate comparisons of our underlying operating results, we have recast all historical non-GAAP earnings measures to exclude the mark-to-market impacts.(7) See Note 14, Commitments and Contingencies – Tax Matters, for additional information.(8) On November 20, 2017, Dirk Van de Put succeeded Irene Rosenfeld as CEO of Mondelēz International in advance of her retirement at the end of March 2018. In order to incent Mr. Van de Put to join us, we provided him compensation with a total combined target value of $42.5 million to make him whole for incentive awards he forfeited or grants that were not made to him when he left his former employer. The compensation we granted took the form of cash, deferred stock units, performance share units and stock options. In connection with Irene Rosenfeld’s retirement, we made her outstanding grants of performance share units for the 2016-2018 and 2017-2019 performance cycles eligible for continued vesting and approved a $0.5 million salary for her service as Chairman from January through March 2018. We refer to these elements of Mr. Van de Put’s and Ms. Rosenfeld’s compensation arrangements together as “CEO transition remuneration.” We are excluding amounts we expense as CEO transition remuneration from our non-GAAP results because those amounts are not part of our regular compensation program and are incremental to amounts we would have incurred as ongoing CEO compensation. As a result, in 2017, we excluded amounts expensed for the cash payment to Mr. Van de Put and partial vesting of his equity grants. In 2018, we excluded amounts paid for Ms. Rosenfeld’s service as Chairman and partial vesting of Mr. Van de Put’s and Ms. Rosenfeld’s equity grants. In 2019, we excluded amounts related to the partial vesting of Mr. Van de Put’s equity grants. During the first quarter of 2020, Mr. Van de Put's equity grants became fully vested.(9) The impact from pension participation changes represents the charges incurred when employee groups are withdrawn from multiemployer pension plans and other changes in employee group pension plan participation. We exclude these charges from our non–GAAP results because those amounts do not reflect our ongoing pension obligations. See Note 11, Benefit Plans, for more information on the multiemployer pension plan withdrawal.(10) We exclude the impact of the 2019 Swiss tax reform and 2017 U.S. tax reform. During the third quarter of 2019, Swiss Federal and Zurich Cantonal tax events drove our recognition of a Swiss tax reform net benefit to our results of operations. On December 22, 2017, the United States enacted tax reform legislation that included a broad range of business tax provisions. We exclude these tax reform impacts from our Adjusted EPS as they do not reflect our ongoing tax obligations under the new tax reforms. Refer to Note 16, Income Taxes, for more information on our current year estimated annual effective tax rate and Swiss and U.S. tax reform.(11) We have excluded our proportionate share of our equity method investees’ significant operating and non-operating items such as acquisition and divestiture related costs, restructuring program costs and discrete U.S. tax reform impacts, in order to provide investors with a comparable view of our performance across periods. Although we have shareholder rights and board representation commensurate with our ownership interests in our equity method investees and review the underlying operating results and significant operating and non-operating items each reporting period, we do not have direct control over their operations or resulting revenue and expenses. Our use of equity method investment net earnings on an adjusted basis is not intended to imply that we have any such control. Our GAAP “diluted EPS attributable to Mondelēz International from continuing operations” includes all of the investees’ significant operating and non-operating items.We believe that the presentation of these non-GAAP financial measures, when considered together with our U.S. GAAP financial measures and the reconciliations to the corresponding U.S. GAAP financial measures, provides you with a more complete understanding of the factors and trends affecting our business than could be obtained absent these disclosures. Because non-GAAP financial measures vary among companies, the non-GAAP financial measures presented in this report may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies. Our use of these non-GAAP financial measures is not meant to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for any U.S. GAAP financial measure. A limitation of these non-GAAP financial measures is they exclude items detailed below that have an impact on our U.S. GAAP reported results. The best way this limitation can be addressed is by evaluating our non-GAAP financial measures in combination with our U.S. GAAP reported results and carefully evaluating the following tables that reconcile U.S. GAAP reported figures to the non-GAAP financial measures in this Form 10-K.64Table of ContentsOrganic Net Revenue:Applying the definition of “Organic Net Revenue”, the adjustments made to “net revenues” (the most comparable U.S. GAAP financial measure) were to exclude the impact of currency, acquisitions and divestitures. We believe that Organic Net Revenue reflects the underlying growth from the ongoing activities of our business and provides improved comparability of results. We also evaluate our Organic Net Revenue growth from emerging markets, and these underlying measures are also reconciled to U.S. GAAP below.

Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk. As we operate globally, we are primarily exposed to currency exchange rate, commodity price and interest rate market risks. We monitor and manage these exposures as part of our overall risk management program. Our risk management program focuses on the unpredictability of financial markets and seeks to reduce the potentially adverse effects that the volatility of these markets may have on our operating results.During 2020, the COVID-19 pandemic and related global response significantly impacted economic activity and markets around the world. National and local governments imposed preventative or protective restrictions on travel and business operations and advised or required citizens to remain at home. Temporary closures of businesses were ordered and numerous other businesses temporarily closed voluntarily. The impact of the global pandemic and response has had a material unfavorable impact on global markets, including commodity, currency and capital markets. While some of these markets such as the U.S. and other major stock markets and certain currencies have rebounded significantly in the second and third quarters of 2020, these markets are likely to continue to remain volatile while the situation continues. An economic or credit crisis could occur and impair credit availability and our ability to raise capital when needed. A disruption in the financial markets may have a negative effect on our derivative counterparties and could impair our banking or other business partners, on whom we rely for access to capital and as counterparties for a number of our derivative contracts. We are actively working to mitigate these risks and we largely employed existing strategies that are described below to mitigate these market risks related to currency, commodity and interest rate risks.We principally utilize derivative instruments to reduce significant, unanticipated earnings fluctuations that may arise from volatility in currency exchange rates, commodity prices and interest rates. For additional information on our derivative activity and the types of derivative instruments we use to hedge our currency exchange, commodity price and interest rate exposures, see Note 10, Financial Instruments.Many of our non-U.S. subsidiaries operate in functional currencies other than the U.S. dollar. Fluctuations in currency exchange rates create volatility in our reported results as we translate the balance sheets, operating results and cash flows of these subsidiaries into the U.S. dollar for consolidated reporting purposes. The translation of non-U.S. dollar denominated balance sheets and statements of earnings of our subsidiaries into the U.S. dollar for consolidated reporting generally results in a cumulative translation adjustment to other comprehensive income within equity. A stronger U.S. dollar relative to other functional currencies adversely affects our consolidated earnings and net assets while a weaker U.S. dollar benefits our consolidated earnings and net assets. While we hedge significant forecasted currency exchange transactions as well as certain net assets of non-U.S. operations and other currency impacts, we cannot fully predict or eliminate volatility arising from changes in currency exchange rates on our consolidated financial results. See Consolidated Results of Operations and Results of Operations by Operating Segment under Discussion and Analysis of Historical Results for currency exchange effects on our financial results. Throughout our discussion and analysis of results, we isolate currency impacts and supplementally provide net revenues, operating income and diluted earnings per share on a constant currency basis. For additional information on the impact of currency policies, recent currency devaluations and highly inflationary accounting on our financial condition and results of operations, also see Note 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies – Currency Translation and Highly Inflationary Accounting.We also continually monitor the market for commodities that we use in our products. Input costs may fluctuate widely due to international demand, weather conditions, government policy and regulation and unforeseen conditions such as the current COVID-19 pandemic. To manage input cost volatility, we enter into forward purchase agreements and other derivative financial instruments. We also pursue productivity and cost saving measures and take pricing actions when necessary to mitigate the impact of higher input costs on earnings.We regularly evaluate our variable and fixed-rate debt as well as current and expected interest rates in the markets in which we raise capital. Our primary exposures include movements in U.S. Treasury rates, corporate credit spreads, commercial paper rates as well as limited debt tied to London Interbank Offered Rates (“LIBOR”). The Financial Conduct Authority in the United Kingdom plans to phase out LIBOR by the end of 2021. We do not anticipate a significant impact to our financial position from the planned phase out of LIBOR given our current mix of variable and fixed-rate debt. We periodically use interest rate swaps and forward interest rate contracts to achieve a desired proportion of variable versus fixed rate debt based on current and projected market conditions. For more information on our 2020 debt activity, see Note 9, Debt and Borrowing Arrangements.See Note 10, Financial Instruments, for more information on our derivative activity. 70Table of ContentsValue at Risk:We use a value at risk (“VAR”) computation to estimate: 1) the potential one-day loss in the fair value of our interest rate-sensitive financial instruments; and 2) the potential one-day loss in pre-tax earnings of our currency and commodity price-sensitive derivative financial instruments. The VAR analysis was done separately for our currency exchange, fixed income and commodity risk portfolios as of each quarter end during the periods presented below. The instruments included in the VAR computation were currency exchange forwards and options for currency exchange risk, debt and swaps for interest rate risk, and commodity forwards, futures and options for commodity risk. Excluded from the computation were anticipated transactions, currency trade payables and receivables, and net investments in non-U.S. subsidiaries, which the above-mentioned instruments are intended to hedge.The VAR model assumes normal market conditions, a 95% confidence interval and a one-day holding period. A parametric delta-gamma approximation technique was used to determine the expected return distribution in interest rates, currencies and commodity prices for the purpose of calculating the fixed income, currency exchange and commodity VAR, respectively. The parameters used for estimating the expected return distributions were determined by observing interest rate, currency exchange and commodity price movements over the prior quarter for the calculation of VAR amounts at December 31, 2020 and 2019, and over each of the four prior quarters for the calculation of average VAR amounts during each year. The values of currency and commodity options do not change on a one-to-one basis with the underlying currency or commodity and were valued accordingly in the VAR computation.As of December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019, the estimated potential one-day loss in fair value of our interest rate-sensitive instruments, primarily debt, and the estimated potential one-day loss in pre-tax earnings from our currency and commodity instruments, as calculated in the VAR model, were: Pre-Tax Earnings ImpactFair Value Impact At 12/31/20AverageHighLowAt 12/31/20AverageHighLow (in millions)Instruments sensitive to:Interest rates$91 $142 $308 $76 Foreign currency rates$16 $20 $31 $16 Commodity prices6 25 42 6 Pre-Tax Earnings ImpactFair Value Impact At 12/31/19AverageHighLowAt 12/31/19AverageHighLow (in millions)Instruments sensitive to:Interest rates$86 $70 $97 $49 Foreign currency rates$15 $19 $25 $15 Commodity prices11 13 14 11 This VAR computation is a risk analysis tool designed to statistically estimate the maximum expected daily loss, under the specified confidence interval and assuming normal market conditions, from adverse movements in interest rates, currency exchange rates and commodity prices. The computation does not represent actual losses in fair value or earnings we will incur, nor does it consider the effect of favorable changes in market rates. We cannot predict actual future movements in market rates and do not present these VAR results to be indicative of future movements in market rates or to be representative of any actual impact that future changes in market rates may have on our future financial results.71Table of Contents",2023-12-30 19:00:56.813617
1103982,MDLZ,"Mondelez International, Inc.",2022,"Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.The following discussion and analysis contains forward-looking statements. It should be read in conjunction with the other sections of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, including the consolidated financial statements and related notes contained in Forward-Looking Statements and Item 1A, Risk Factors.Overview of Business and StrategyWe make and sell primarily snacks, including biscuits (cookies, crackers and salted snacks), chocolate, gum & candy, as well as various cheese & grocery and powdered beverage products around the world. We aim to be the global leader in snacking. Our strategy is to drive long-term growth by focusing on three strategic priorities: accelerating consumer-centric growth, driving operational excellence and creating a winning growth culture. We believe the successful implementation of our strategic priorities and leveraging of our strong foundation of iconic global and local brands, an attractive global footprint, our market leadership in developed and emerging markets, our deep innovation, marketing and distribution capabilities, and our efficiency and sustainability efforts, will drive top- and bottom-line growth, enabling us to continue to create long-term value for our shareholders. For more detailed information on our business and strategy, refer to Item 1, Business.Recent Developments and Significant Items Affecting ComparabilityCOVID-19As the COVID-19 global pandemic continues and new variants of the virus emerge, such as Omicron in late 2021, our main priorities continue to be the safety of our employees and helping maintain the global food supply. Together with our employees, customers, suppliers and other partners, we are working to emerge from the pandemic stronger. During 2020, the first year of the pandemic, we experienced a significant increase in demand and revenue growth in certain markets as consumers increased their food purchases for in-home consumption. Results were particularly strong in modern trade (such as large grocery supermarkets and retail chains), digital commerce and especially for categories such as biscuits. However, other parts of our business were negatively affected by mandated lockdowns and other related restrictions. This was especially so during the second quarter of 2020 for some of our emerging markets due to store closures, particularly in our Latin America region as well as parts of our AMEA region that have a greater concentration of traditional trade (such as small family-run stores), our world travel retail (such as international duty-free stores), and our foodservice businesses as well as categories like gum and candy, which are more traditionally purchased and consumed out of home. The negative impacts experienced in the second quarter of 2020 began to subside in the second half of 2020, as demand grew in both developed and emerging markets and a number of our key markets returned to higher growth; however, our gum and candy, world travel retail and foodservice businesses as well as parts of our traditional trade business in parts of emerging markets continued to be negatively affected by the ongoing pandemic.During 2021, we continued to see increased demand for most of our snack category products in both our emerging and developed markets relative to 2020; however, revenue from parts of our business were not yet back to pre-pandemic levels. In 2021, net revenue growth was 8.0% and Organic Net Revenue growth was 5.2%. In 2021, while we experienced double-digit revenue growth in gum as well as significant growth in other areas such as foodservice and world travel retail, revenues in these businesses were not fully recovered to pre-pandemic levels. Our overall outlook for future snacks revenue growth remains strong, but as the pandemic continues, we anticipate increased volatility in revenues until COVID-related risks and the international supply chain issues and labor and transportation constraints subside and snacks consumption stabilizes to a more normal growth level.We continue to track new developments and ongoing impacts from the pandemic. Most disruptions we experienced in our operations due to the pandemic have been temporary and not material to our consolidated results. In the second half of 2021, we experienced higher operating costs, including higher overall raw material, transportation, labor and fuel costs, that we anticipate will continue into 2022. We discuss these and other ongoing impacts of COVID-19 below.31Table of ContentsOur Employees, Customers and Communities We have taken a number of actions to promote the health and safety of our employees, customers and consumers, which is our first priority:•We implemented enhanced protocols to provide a safe and sanitary working environment for our employees. In many locations, our employees are working remotely whenever possible. For employees who were unable to work remotely, we adopted a number of heightened protocols, consistent with those prescribed by the World Health Organization, related to social distancing (including staggering lunchtimes and shifts where possible and restricting in-person gatherings and non-essential travel) and enhanced hygiene and workplace sanitation. We have worked with governments and healthcare providers to help provide access to vaccines for our frontline and office employees when and where possible at a local level. At a local level, we have also provided additional flexibility and support to employees in our manufacturing facilities, distribution and logistics operations and sales organization. As more employees who have been working remotely return to shared workplaces, we have enhanced safety protocols we will follow while also encouraging continued flexible and virtual work arrangements wherever possible.•We have hired frontline employees in the U.S. and other locations to meet additional marketplace demand and promote uninterrupted functioning of our manufacturing, distribution and sales network. Labor markets, particularly in the U.S., U.K. as well as in other countries, have significantly tightened. We recognize the demand for talent and continue to actively work to safeguard, engage, attract and retain our employees.•Since the start of the pandemic, we have donated over $30 million to assist those impacted by COVID-19 and to support local and global organizations responding to food instability and providing emergency relief.Our Supply Chain and OperationsWe operate in the food and beverages industry and are part of the global food supply chain. One of our main objectives during the pandemic is to maintain the availability of our products to meet the needs of our consumers. In response to increased demand, we increased production and until recently, we have not experienced material disruptions in our supply chain or operations. Beginning in the second half of 2021, we began to experience more significant supply chain disruptions and higher operating costs as noted below:•As global supply, transportation and labor disruptions escalated in the second half of 2021, particularly in the U.S. and U.K., we incurred higher operating costs in our business. •We also experienced labor disruptions primarily in our North America region in the third quarter of 2021, including a strike that affected six of our U.S. manufacturing and sales distribution facilities for several weeks. In September 2021, after working with our employees and union representatives to resolve the strike, we entered into a new collective bargaining agreement at these facilities. In the fourth quarter of 2021, we did not experience significant operating or labor disruptions. However, we anticipate some disruption in early 2022 and higher expected absenteeism due to illness within our operations and among our third-party suppliers and business partners primarily as a result of the Omicron variant. Throughout the second half of 2021, we also experienced labor-related disruptions in our network of third-party logistics and external manufacturing, and we anticipate labor shortage-related issues will continue into 2022. As a result of incremental pandemic-related expenditures and labor disruptions, we incurred and expect to incur higher labor costs, particularly as the pandemic continues.•We continue to source raw ingredients, packaging, energy and transportation and deliver our products to our customers. Costs for resources, particularly commodity and transportation costs, have continued to increase. External factors, including the pandemic, adverse weather conditions, supply chain disruptions, and transportation and labor shortages, have impacted and are expected to continue to impact our operating costs. Although we monitor these costs and our exposure to commodity prices and hedge against input price increases, we cannot fully hedge against all cost increases and changes in costs, and our hedging strategies may not protect us from increases in specific raw materials or other costs. We also may not be able to adjust pricing timely or fully, and this may negatively affect our revenue, margins or earnings. We anticipate some of the supply, transportation and labor constraints and higher cost trends we experienced in 2021 will continue in 2022. While we have not had significant delays or unavailability of raw ingredients or other supplies, we continue to monitor this risk. At this time, we believe we will be able to continue to source raw materials and other supplies we use in our business.•The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic and related economic effects may disrupt our global supply chain, operations and routes to market or those of our suppliers, their suppliers, our co-manufacturers, distributors or other business partners. These disruptions or our failure to effectively respond to them could increase product or distribution costs and prices and continue to negatively affect operations and results. •During the pandemic, we have incurred higher operating costs primarily for labor, customer service and logistics, security, personal protective equipment and cleaning. While we have not had long-term, severe supply chain disruptions, we do not know whether or how our supply chain or operations may be negatively 32Table of Contentsaffected if the pandemic continues. We intend to continue to execute on our strategic operating plans as the situation evolves. Disruptions, higher operating costs or uncertainties like those noted above could result in delays or modifications to our plans and initiatives.Our LiquidityWe believe the steps we have taken to enhance our capital structure and liquidity, prior to and during the pandemic, strengthened our ability to operate during the pandemic:•In 2021, we generated $4.1 billion of cash from operations, or approximately $3.2 billion after deducting capital expenditures. During 2020 and 2019, we also generated $4.0 billion of cash from operations, or $3.1 billion in 2020 and $3.0 billion in 2019 after deducting capital expenditures. •As of December 31, 2021, we had $3.5 billion of cash and cash equivalents on hand. As further discussed below, in January 2022, we acquired Chipita S.A. to expand our snacks portfolio. We paid approximately €1.3 billion ($1.5 billion) in cash and we assumed and substantially paid down €0.4 billion ($0.4 billion) of Chipita’s debt in January for a total purchase price of approximately €1.7 billion ($1.9 billion). Based on our current available cash and access to financing markets, we do not anticipate any issue funding our obligations, including funding our next long-term debt maturities of approximately $1.2 billion in July 2022 and $0.5 billion in September 2022.•During 2021, we generated cash of approximately $1.5 billion from the sale of KDP shares. During 2020, we also received cash of €350 million ($394 million) from our participation in the JDE Peet’s public share offerings and approximately $2.1 billion from our participation in the KDP secondary offering and subsequent KDP share sales (see additional information below and in Note 7, Equity Method Investments). •We also have access to short-term and long-term financing markets and actively utilized these markets in 2020 and 2021. We continue to utilize the commercial paper markets in the United States and Europe for flexible, low-cost, short-term financing. We have issued additional long-term debt several times since the beginning of 2020 due to favorable market conditions and opportunities to shift a portion of our funding mix from short-term debt to long-term debt at a low cost. We renewed one of our credit facilities in early 2021 and now have $7.0 billion of undrawn credit facilities as well as other forms of short-term and long-term financing options available. As of December 31, 2021, we were, and we expect to continue to be, in compliance with our debt covenants (refer to the Liquidity and Capital Resources section and Note 9, Debt and Borrowing Arrangements). Our Financial Position•We continue to evaluate the realizability of our assets and indicators of potential impairment. We reviewed our receivables, inventory, right-of-use lease assets, long-lived assets, equity method and other long-term investments, deferred tax assets, goodwill and intangible assets. •During the third quarter of 2021, we completed our annual impairment testing of goodwill and intangible assets and noted no impairments. Over the course of the ongoing pandemic, we have identified declines in demand for certain of our brands, primarily in the gum category, that prompted additional evaluation of our indefinite-life intangible assets. During the second quarter of 2021, we concluded that one biscuit brand was impaired and we recorded a $32 million impairment charge. During 2020, we concluded that eight brands were impaired and we recorded $144 million of impairment charges. While we did not identify impairment triggers for other brands, there continues to be significant uncertainty due to the pandemic. If brand earnings expectations are not met or specific valuation factors outside of our control, such as discount rates, change significantly, then a brand or brands could become impaired in the future. Refer to Note 6, Goodwill and Intangible Assets, for additional details on our intangible asset impairment evaluation. •Restructuring and implementation activities were in line with our Simplify to Grow Program strategic objectives.•Our equity investments in JDE Peet’s and KDP give us additional financial flexibility.•We continue to monitor the quality of our assets and our overall financial position. •We also continue to maintain oversight over our core process controls through our centralized shared service model, with key controls operating as designed.At this point in the pandemic, while we have seen some improvements in business and economic conditions across many markets in which we do business, additional adverse impacts could arise such as those noted above and some that we cannot currently anticipate. Barring material business disruptions or other negative developments, we expect to meet the demand of consumers for our snacks, food and beverage products. Our overall outlook for future snacks revenue growth remains strong, but as the pandemic continues, we anticipate increased volatility in revenues until COVID-related risks and current international supply chain issues and labor and transportation constraints subside and snacks consumption stabilizes to a more normal growth level. Also, different markets and 33Table of Contentsparts of our business may recover from the COVID-19 pandemic at different rates depending on many factors including vaccination levels or new COVID-19 variants and related outbreaks. As we continue to proactively manage our business in response to the evolving impacts of the pandemic, we continue to prioritize and support our employees and customers; monitor and work to further safeguard our supply chain, operations, technology and assets; protect our liquidity and financial position; work toward our strategic priorities and monitor our financial performance. We seek to position the Company to withstand the current uncertainties related to this pandemic and to emerge stronger.Chipita AcquisitionOn January 3, 2022, we closed on our acquisition of Chipita S.A., which is a strategic complement to our existing snacks portfolio and advances our strategy to become the global leader in broader snacking. The cash consideration for Chipita totaled €1.3 billion ($1.5 billion) and we assumed and also substantially paid down €0.4 billion ($0.4 billion) of Chipita’s debt in January for a total purchase price of approximately €1.7 billion ($1.9 billion). Refer to Note 2, Acquisitions and Divestitures, and Liquidity and Capital Resources for additional details.KDP and JDE Peet’s Equity Method Investment TransactionsKDPOn June 7, 2021, we sold approximately 28 million shares of KDP, which reduced our ownership interest to 6.4%. We received $997 million of proceeds and recorded a pre-tax gain of $520 million (or $392 million after-tax) during the second quarter of 2021. On August 2, 2021, we sold approximately 14.7 million KDP shares, which reduced our ownership interest to 5.3%. We received $500 million of proceeds and recorded a pre-tax gain of $248 million (or $189 million after-tax) during the third quarter of 2021. The cash taxes associated with the KDP share sales were paid in 2021.On March 4, 2020, we participated in a secondary offering of KDP shares and sold approximately 6.8 million shares, which reduced our ownership interest by 0.5% to 13.1%. We received $185 million of proceeds and recorded a pre-tax gain of $71 million (or $54 million after-tax) during the first quarter of 2020. Subsequently, on August 3, 2020, we sold approximately 14.1 million shares and on September 9, 2020, we sold approximately 12.5 million shares, which in the aggregate reduced our KDP ownership interest to 11.2%. During the third quarter of 2020, we received $777 million of proceeds and recorded pre-tax gains of $335 million (or $258 million after tax). On November 17, 2020, we sold approximately 40.0 million shares, which reduced our ownership interest by 2.8% to 8.4%. We received $1,132 million of proceeds and recorded a pre-tax gain of $459 million (or $350 million after tax) during the fourth quarter of 2020. The cash taxes associated with the KDP share sales were paid in 2020.During 2019, we recognized a $23 million pre-tax gain related to the impact of a KDP acquisition that decreased our ownership interest from 13.8% to 13.6%.JDE Peet’sDuring the second quarter of 2020, in connection with the JDE Peet’s offering of its ordinary shares, we exchanged our 26.4% ownership interest in JDE for a 26.5% equity interest in JDE Peet’s. On May 29, 2020, we participated in the JDE Peet’s offering and, with the subsequent exercise of the over-allotment option, we sold a total of approximately 11.1 million shares during the second quarter of 2020. We received €350 million ($394 million) of total proceeds from the sales of JDE Peet’s shares and we recorded a preliminary pre-tax gain of $121 million during the second quarter of 2020. We also incurred a $261 million tax expense. During the third quarter of 2020, we increased our preliminary gain by $10 million to $131 million. During the fourth quarter of 2020, we reduced our tax expense by $11 million to $250 million and we paid the associated cash tax by the end of 2021. For additional information, refer to Note 7, Equity Method Investments, Note 16, Income Taxes, and Note 9, Debt and Borrowing Arrangements.Tax ReformWe continue to monitor existing and potential future tax reform. In 2019, the most significant tax reform impact was from Swiss tax reform. On August 6, 2019, Switzerland published changes to its Federal tax law in the Official Federal Collection of Laws. On September 27, 2019, the Zurich Canton published their decision on the September 1, 2019 Zurich Canton public vote regarding the Cantonal changes associated with the Swiss Federal tax law change. The intent of these tax law changes was to replace certain preferential tax regimes with a new set of 34Table of Contentsinternationally accepted measures that are hereafter referred to as “Swiss tax reform”. Based on these Federal / Cantonal events, our position is the enactment of Swiss tax reform for U.S. GAAP purposes was met as of September 30, 2019, and we recorded the impacts in the third quarter 2019. The net impact was a benefit of $767 million, which consisted of a $769 million reduction in deferred tax expense from an allowed step-up of intangible assets for tax purposes and remeasurement of our deferred tax balances, partially offset by a $2 million indirect tax impact in selling, general and administrative expenses. The ongoing impacts of these Swiss tax reform law changes became effective January 1, 2020. See Note 16, Income Taxes, for more information.Summary of Results •Net revenues were approximately $28.7 billion in 2021 and $26.6 billion in 2020, an increase of 8.0% in 2021 and an increase of 2.8% in 2020. In 2021, our net revenue growth continued to reflect increased demand for most of our snack category products in both our emerging and developed markets relative to 2020, though some markets were not yet back to pre-pandemic levels. In developed markets, increased food purchases for in-home consumption continued to drive net revenue growth, partially offset by declines in some markets as they lapped prior-year strong volume growth resulting from increased consumer demand due to the pandemic. In emerging markets, we lapped the negative initial impacts we experienced from the pandemic in 2020, with strong revenue growth in 2021 across most of our key markets, though some markets remained challenged. In addition, our out-of-home consumption businesses, which experienced significant negative impacts from the pandemic in 2020, continued to recover, particularly our gum and candy, foodservice and world travel retail businesses. –Net revenues increased in 2021, driven by favorable volume/mix, higher net pricing, a significant impact from favorable currency translation, as most currencies we operate in strengthened against the U.S. dollar compared to exchange rates in the prior year, and incremental net revenues from our acquisitions of Gourmet Foods, Grenade and Hu in 2021 and Give & Go in 2020.–Net revenues increased in 2020, driven by higher net pricing, favorable volume/mix and incremental net revenues from our acquisitions of Give & Go in 2020 and Perfect Snacks in 2019. These items were partially offset by the significant impact of unfavorable currency translation, as the U.S. dollar strengthened against most currencies in which we operate compared to exchange rates in the prior year, as well as the May 28, 2019 divestiture of most of our cheese business in the Middle East and Africa. •Organic Net Revenue increased 5.2% to $28.0 billion in 2021 and increased 3.7% to $26.8 billion in 2020. Organic Net Revenue increased in both 2021 and 2020 due to favorable volume/mix and higher net pricing, despite impacts from the COVID-19 pandemic described above. Organic Net Revenue is on a constant currency basis and excludes revenue from acquisitions and divestitures. We use Organic Net Revenue as it provides improved year-over-year comparability of our underlying operating results (see the definition of Organic Net Revenue and our reconciliation with net revenues within Non-GAAP Financial Measures appearing later in this section).•Diluted EPS attributable to Mondelēz International increased 23.1% to $3.04 in 2021 and decreased 8.2% to $2.47 in 2020. –Diluted EPS increased in 2021 primarily driven by an increase in Adjusted EPS, lapping prior-year costs associated with the JDE Peet’s transaction, favorable year-over-year mark-to-market impacts from currency and commodity derivatives, lower intangible asset impairment charges, lapping the prior-year loss on interest rate swaps, lower losses on debt extinguishment and related expenses, lower Simplify to Grow program costs and a net benefit from acquisition integration costs and contingent consideration adjustments. These factors were partially offset by a lower gain on equity method investment transactions, higher initial impacts from enacted tax law changes, lower net earnings from divestitures, lapping the prior-year benefit from the resolution of tax matters and higher impact from pension participation changes. –Diluted EPS decreased in 2020 primarily driven by lapping the prior-year benefit from initial impacts from enacted tax law changes, costs associated with the JDE Peet's transaction, loss on debt extinguishment, unfavorable year-over year change in equity method investee items, higher intangible asset impairment charges, unfavorable year-over-year mark-to-market impacts from currency and commodity derivatives, lapping a prior-year gain on divestiture and lapping the prior-year benefit from pension participation changes. These factors were partially offset by gains on equity method investment transactions, higher Adjusted EPS, favorable change from the resolution of tax matters (a benefit in 2020 as compared to an expense in 2019), lower Simplify to Grow program costs and lower losses related to interest rate swaps.35Table of Contents•Adjusted EPS increased 12.1% to $2.87 in 2021 and increased 6.7% to $2.56 in 2020. On a constant currency basis, Adjusted EPS increased 9.0% to $2.79 in 2021 and increased 8.3% to $2.60 in 2020. –For 2021, operating gains, favorable currency translation, fewer shares outstanding, higher equity method investment earnings and lower interest expense, partially offset by higher taxes primarily due to a lower net benefit from non-recurring discrete tax items, drove the Adjusted EPS growth.–For 2020, operating gains, an increase in benefit plan non-service income and fewer shares outstanding, partially offset by unfavorable currency translation, primarily drove the Adjusted EPS growth.Adjusted EPS and Adjusted EPS on a constant currency basis are non-GAAP financial measures. We use these measures as they provide improved year-over-year comparability of our underlying results (see the definition of Adjusted EPS and our reconciliation with diluted EPS within Non-GAAP Financial Measures appearing later in this section).Financial OutlookWe seek to achieve profitable, long-term growth and manage our business to attain this goal using our key operating metrics: Organic Net Revenue, Adjusted Operating Income and Adjusted EPS. We use these non-GAAP financial metrics and related computations, particularly growth in profit dollars, to evaluate and manage our business and to plan and make near- and long-term operating and strategic decisions. As such, we believe these metrics are useful to investors as they provide supplemental information in addition to our U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (“U.S. GAAP”) financial results. We believe it is useful to provide investors with the same financial information that we use internally to make comparisons of our historical operating results, identify trends in our underlying operating results and evaluate our business. We believe our non-GAAP financial measures should always be considered in relation to our GAAP results. We have provided reconciliations between our GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures in Non-GAAP Financial Measures, which appears later in this section.In addition to monitoring our key operating metrics, we monitor a number of developments and trends that could impact our revenue and profitability objectives.COVID-19 – As described above, we continue to monitor and respond to the COVID-19 pandemic. While its impact is not yet fully known, it has had a material negative effect on the global and local economies and could have a material negative effect on our business and results in the future, particularly if there are significant adverse changes to consumer demand or significant disruptions to the supply, production or distribution of our products or the credit or financial stability of our customers and other business partners. While we have seen some improvements in overall economic conditions and the business climate in many markets where we sell and operate, COVID-19 variants such as Omicron and spikes in infections continue across a number of markets. If a significant economic or credit deterioration occurs, it could impair credit availability and our ability to raise capital when needed. A significant disruption in the financial markets may also have a negative effect on our derivative counterparties and could also impair our banking or other business partners, on whom we rely for access to capital and as counterparties for a number of our derivative contracts. As we continue to manage operations during the pandemic, we will continue to prioritize the safety of our employees and consumers and we may continue to incur increased labor, customer service, commodity, transportation and other costs. We could see shifts in consumer demand and product mix that could have a negative impact on results. As discussed in Recent Developments and Significant Items Affecting Comparability, we are working to mitigate negative impacts to our business from the COVID-19 pandemic, but we may not be able to fully predict or respond to all impacts on a timely basis to prevent adverse impacts to our results. Any of these and other developments could materially harm our business, results of operations and financial condition.Chipita acquisition – As described above, on January 3, 2022, we closed on our acquisition of Chipita S.A. The cash consideration for Chipita totaled €1.3 billion ($1.5 billion) and we assumed and substantially paid down €0.4 billion ($0.4 billion) of Chipita’s debt in January for a total purchase price of approximately €1.7 billion ($1.9 billion). Refer to Note 2, Acquisitions and Divestitures, and Liquidity and Capital Resources for additional details.Demand – We monitor consumer spending and our market share within the food and beverage categories in which we sell our products. Core snacks categories continued to expand in 2021 due to the continued growth of snacking as a consumer behavior around the world. As part of our strategic plan, we seek to drive category growth by leveraging our local and consumer-focused commercial approach, making investments in our brand and snacks portfolio, building strong routes to market in both emerging and developed markets and improving our availability 36Table of Contentsacross multiple channels. We believe these actions will help drive demand in our categories and strengthen our positions across markets.Long-Term Demographics and Consumer Trends – Snack food consumption is highly correlated to GDP growth, urbanization of populations and rising discretionary income levels associated with a growing middle class, particularly in emerging markets. Our recent research underscores the growth of snacking worldwide and how behavior, sentiment and routines surrounding food are being reshaped by COVID-19. Snacking, which was already increasing among consumers, continues to grow according to snack category findings noted above and supported by the findings from the third annual State of Snacking report, commissioned by Mondelēz International and issued in January 2022. The report was conducted in conjunction with consumer poll specialist The Harris Poll and summarizes the findings from interviews with thousands of consumers across 12 countries. We believe that snacks continue to be a source of comfort as well as excitement and variety for consumers. Social media increasingly helps consumers find food trends, inspiration and connection on their social media and other feeds. Consumers are also interested in buying snacks conveniently, whether through same-day delivery apps, shipped sources or different retail settings. Many consumers also continue to prioritize sustainability in their purchase decisions, valuing sustainably sourced ingredients, low carbon footprint preparation and lower waste packaging. We seek to continue to offer snacks that meet consumer needs and preferences and align with our strategic priorities.Volatility of Global Markets – Our growth strategy depends in part on our ability to expand our operations, including in emerging markets. Some emerging markets have greater political, economic and currency volatility and greater vulnerability to infrastructure and labor disruptions. Volatility in these markets affects demand for and the costs of our products and requires frequent changes in how we operate our business. As further discussed in COVID-19 above and in Item 7A, Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk, we continue to monitor volatility in global consumer, commodity, transportation, labor, currency and capital markets that may continue until the COVID-19 pandemic or related issues are largely resolved. We expect input cost volatility and a higher aggregate cost environment to continue into 2022 as we manage through the pandemic and new COVID-19 variants, the related recovery, labor shortages, inflation, supply chain disruptions (including any potential disruptions in the availability of raw materials, packaging, transportation, energy or other supplies) and adverse weather factors. (See also below for a discussion of Brexit and Argentina, which was designated a highly inflationary economy in 2018.) In addition, the imposition of increased or new tariffs, quotas, trade barriers or similar restrictions on our sales or key commodities and potential changes in U.S. trade programs, trade relations, regulations, taxes or fiscal policies might negatively affect our sales or profitability. To help mitigate adverse effects of ongoing volatility across markets, we aim to protect profitability through the management of costs (including hedging) and pricing as well as targeted investments in our brands and new routes to market.Competition – We operate in highly competitive markets that include global, regional and local competitors. Our advantaged geographic footprint, operating scale and portfolio of brands have all significantly contributed to building our market-leading positions across most of the product categories in which we sell. To grow and maintain our market positions, we focus on meeting consumer needs and preferences through a local-first commercial focus, new digital and other sales and marketing initiatives, product innovation and high standards of product quality. We also continue to optimize our manufacturing and other operations and invest in our brands through ongoing research and development, advertising, marketing and consumer promotions.Pricing – Our net revenue growth and profitability may be affected as we adjust prices to address new conditions, such as increasing input and operating costs due to supply, transportation and labor constraints and higher cost trends we experienced, particularly in the second half of 2021. We adjust our product prices based on a number of variables including market factors, transportation, logistics and changes in our product input costs, and we have increased prices to control costs given recent significant cost inflation. However, we may not be able to adjust pricing fully or timely in response to rising costs, and this may negatively affect our revenue, margins or earnings.Operating Costs – Our operating costs include raw materials, labor, selling, general and administrative expenses, taxes, currency impacts and financing costs. We manage these costs through cost saving and productivity initiatives, sourcing and hedging programs, pricing actions, refinancing and tax planning. To remain competitive on our operating structure, we continue to work on programs to expand our profitability, such as our Simplify to Grow Program, which is designed to bring about significant reductions in our operating cost structure in both our supply chain and overhead costs. During the second half of 2021, in particular, we experienced higher operating costs, including higher overall raw material, transportation, labor and fuel costs that we anticipate will continue into 2022.37Table of ContentsTaxes – We continue to monitor existing and potential future tax reform around the world. During November 2021, the U.S. House of Representatives passed a bill that contains significant changes to currently enacted U.S. tax rules but the Senate has not yet acted on it. In December 2021, the OECD released model rules for a global minimum tax. Both of these proposed legislative changes could have a material effect on us if enacted.Currency – As a global company with 75.1% of our net revenues generated outside the United States, we are continually exposed to changes in global economic conditions and currency movements. While we hedge significant forecasted currency exchange transactions as well as currency translation impacts from certain net assets of our non-U.S. operations, we cannot fully predict or eliminate all adverse impacts arising from changes in currency exchange rates on our consolidated financial results. To partially offset currency translation impacts arising from our overseas operations, we enter into net investment hedges primarily in the form of local currency-denominated debt, cross-currency swaps and other financial instruments. While we work to mitigate our exposure to currency risks, factors such as continued global and local market volatility, actions by foreign governments, political uncertainty, limited hedging opportunities and other factors could lead to unfavorable currency impacts in the future and could adversely affect our results of operations or financial position. See additional discussion of Brexit and Argentina below and refer also to Note 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies – Currency Translation and Highly Inflationary Accounting, and Note 10, Financial Instruments, for additional information on how we manage currency and related risks. As currency movements can make comparison of year-over-year operating performance challenging, we isolate the impact of currency and also report growth on a constant currency basis, holding prior-year currency exchange rates constant, so that prior-year and current-year results can be compared on a consistent basis.Brexit – Following Brexit in 2020, a new trade arrangement was reached between the U.K. and E.U. that began on January 1, 2021. The main trade provisions include the continuation of no tariffs or quotas on trade between the U.K. and E.U. subject to prescribed trade terms, including but not limited to meeting product and labeling standards for both the U.K. and E.U. Cross-border trade between the U.K. and E.U. is also subject to new customs regulations, documentation and reviews. Our supply chain in this market relies on imports of raw and packaging materials as well as finished goods. To comply with the new requirements, we increased resources in customer service and logistics, in our factories and on our customs support teams. We adapted our processes and systems for the new and increased number of customs transactions. We continue to closely monitor and manage our inventory levels of imported raw materials, packaging and finished goods in the U.K. We have made investments in resources, systems and processes to meet the new ongoing requirements and we work to mitigate disruptions to our local supply chain and distribution, including those related to the recent transportation labor shortage in the U.K., to reduce the impact on our input and distribution costs. Despite our efforts to control costs, inflationary cost pressures increased in our U.K. business in 2021, as we also experienced in other markets. If the U.K.’s separation from, or new trade arrangements with, the E.U. negatively impact the U.K. economy or result in disagreements on trade terms, delays affecting our supply chain or distribution, disruptions to sales or collections, or further increases in inflationary cost pressures, the impact to our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows could be material. In 2021, we generated 9.3% of our consolidated net revenues in the U.K.U.K. advertising and promotion ban – In the United Kingdom, a ban on specific types of TV and online advertising of food containing levels of fat, sugar or salt above specified thresholds is expected to go into effect in 2023, and new measures restricting certain promotions and in-store placement of some of those products are expected to go into effect in October 2022. Although we are unable to estimate precisely the impact of the restrictions, they could significantly negatively affect our U.K. results of operations in 2022 and thereafter. Argentina – as further discussed in Note 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies – Currency Translation and Highly Inflationary Accounting, on July 1, 2018, we began to apply highly inflationary accounting for our Argentinean subsidiaries. As a result, we recorded a remeasurement loss of $13 million in 2021, a remeasurement loss of $9 million in 2020 and a remeasurement gain of $4 million in 2019 within selling, general and administrative expenses related to the revaluation of the Argentinean peso denominated net monetary position over these periods. The mix of monetary assets and liabilities and the exchange rate to convert Argentinean pesos to U.S. dollars could change over time, so it is difficult to predict the overall impact of the Argentina highly inflationary accounting on future net earnings. Gum Portfolio Review – During 2021, we began and continue to conduct a strategic review of our developed market gum business. We expect to complete the review and have more information in mid 2022. 38Table of ContentsFinancing Costs – We regularly evaluate our variable and fixed-rate debt. We continue to use low-cost, short- and long-term debt to finance our ongoing working capital, capital expenditures and other investments, dividends and share repurchases. We continued to secure low-cost short and long-term debt during 2021. In September 2021, we issued our first green bonds, raising nearly €2.0 billion and enabling us to cost-effectively fund eligible projects that align with our sustainability priorities in the areas of building a thriving ingredient supply chain and reducing our environmental impact. In September 2021, through our subsidiary Mondelez International Holdings Netherlands B.V. (“MIHN”), we also issued €300 million of zero interest exchangeable notes that are redeemable for cash or existing ordinary shares of JDE Peet's at our option. We also continue to use interest rate swaps and other financial instruments to manage our exposure to interest rate and cash flow variability, protect the value of our existing currency assets and liabilities and protect the value of our debt. We also enter into cross-currency interest rate swaps, forwards and option collars to hedge our non-U.S. net investments against adverse movements in exchange rates. Our net investment hedge derivative contracts have had and are expected to have a favorable impact and reduce some of the financing costs and related currency impacts within our interest costs. Refer to Note 9, Debt and Borrowing Arrangements, and Note 10, Financial Instruments, for additional information on our debt and derivative activity. Cybersecurity Risks – Global cybersecurity risks continue to increase, including during the pandemic and as more employees are working remotely and virtually outside of traditional workplaces. In response, we continue to be on heightened alert and dedicate focused resources to network security, backup and disaster recovery and to provide ongoing workforce training and employ security measures to protect our systems and data. We are also focusing on enhancing the monitoring and detection of threats in our environment, including but not limited to the manufacturing environment and operational technologies, as well as adjusting information security controls based on updated threats. While we have taken security measures to protect our systems and data, security measures cannot provide absolute certainty or guarantee that we will be successful in preventing or responding to every breach or disruption on a timely basis. 39Table of ContentsDiscussion and Analysis of Historical ResultsItems Affecting Comparability of Financial ResultsThe following table includes significant income or (expense) items that affected the comparability of our results of operations and our effective tax rates.

Overall, we continued to see increased demand for our snack category products, though parts of our business were not yet back to pre-pandemic levels. In developed markets, increased food purchases for in-home consumption continued to drive net revenue growth, partially offset by declines in some markets as they lapped strong volume growth in 2020 resulting from increased consumer demand due to the pandemic. In emerging markets, we lapped the negative initial impacts we experienced from the pandemic in 2020, with strong revenue growth in 2021 across most of our key markets, though some markets remained challenged. In addition, sales of our gum and candy products grew as out-of-home consumption continued to recover, as did our world travel business as global travel improved, though still below pre-pandemic levels. Favorable currency translation and incremental net revenues from acquisitions also added to revenue growth in 2021.Organic Net Revenue growth was driven by favorable volume/mix and higher net pricing. Favorable volume/mix in Europe, AMEA and Latin America was primarily driven by strong volume gains as we lapped the significant negative impacts of the pandemic in many of our key markets. This was partially offset by unfavorable volume/mix in North America as the region lapped very strong prior-year volume growth from significant food purchases for in-home consumption due to the pandemic. Higher net pricing in all regions was due to the benefit of carryover pricing from 2020 as well as the effects of input cost-driven pricing actions taken during 2021. Favorable currency impacts 41Table of Contentsincreased net revenues by $462 million, due primarily to the strength of several currencies relative to the U.S. dollar, including the euro, British pound sterling, Chinese yuan, Australian dollar, Canadian dollar, South African rand and Mexican peso, partially offset by the strength of the U.S. dollar relative to several currencies, including the Argentinean peso, Brazilian real and Turkish lira. The April 1, 2021 acquisition of Gourmet Food added incremental net revenues of $47 million (constant currency basis), the March 25, 2021 acquisition of Grenade added incremental net revenues of $63 million (constant currency basis), the January 4, 2021 acquisition of Hu added incremental net revenues of $38 million and the April 1, 2020 acquisition of Give & Go added incremental net revenues of $106 million in 2021. The packaged seafood business, which was part of our April 1, 2021 acquisition of Gourmet Food but divested on November 1, 2021, added incremental net revenues of $35 million prior to its divestiture.

Higher net pricing, which included the carryover impact of pricing actions taken in 2020 as well as the effects of input cost-driven pricing actions taken during 2021, was reflected in all regions. Favorable volume/mix was driven by Europe, AMEA and Latin America, which was partially offset by unfavorable volume/mix in North America. Overall, volume/mix benefited from volume gains as we lapped the significant negative impacts of the pandemic in many of our key markets, while in North America, we lapped high volume growth in 2020 from significant food purchases for in-home consumption due to the pandemic. The increase in input costs was driven by higher raw material costs, partially offset by lower manufacturing costs driven by productivity and lower year-over-year incremental COVID-19 related costs. Higher raw material costs were in part due to higher foreign currency transaction costs on imported materials, as well as increased costs for edible oils, packaging, sugar, cocoa, grains, dairy and other ingredients. Total selling, general and administrative expenses increased $165 million from 2020, due to a number of factors noted in the table above, including in part, an unfavorable currency impact related to expenses, incremental expenses from acquisitions, the impact from pension participation changes, lower benefits from the resolution of tax matters and higher acquisition-related costs, which were partially offset by lower implementation costs incurred for the Simplify to Grow Program, lapping prior-year costs associated with the JDE Peet's transaction and a net benefit from acquisition integration costs and contingent consideration adjustments. Excluding these factors, selling, general and administrative expenses increased $133 million from 2020. The increase was driven primarily by higher advertising and consumer promotion costs, partially offset by lower overhead spending including lower year-over-year incremental COVID-19 related costs. Favorable currency changes increased operating income by $118 million due primarily to the strength of several currencies relative to the U.S. dollar, including the British pound sterling, euro, Chinese yuan. Australian dollar and Canadian dollar, partially offset by the strength of the U.S. dollar relative to several currencies, including the Argentinean peso, Brazilian real and Turkish lira.Operating income margin increased from 14.5% in 2020 to 16.2% in 2021. The increase in operating income margin was driven primarily by the favorable year-over-year change in mark-to-market gains/(losses) from currency and commodity hedging activities, lower intangible asset impairment charges, lower Simplify to Grow program costs, a net benefit from acquisition integration costs and contingent consideration adjustments and lapping prior-year costs associated with the JDE Peet's transaction, partially offset by the impact from pension participation changes, higher divestiture-related costs and higher acquisition-related costs. Adjusted Operating Income margin for 2021 was flat to 2020 at 16.6%. Adjusted Operating Income margin was unchanged as higher net pricing, lower manufacturing costs due to productivity and lower year-over-year incremental COVID-19 costs, and lower selling, general and administrative costs were offset by higher raw material costs, unfavorable product mix and higher advertising and consumer promotion costs.44Table of ContentsNet Earnings and Earnings per Share Attributable to Mondelēz International – Net earnings attributable to Mondelēz International of $4,300 million increased by $745 million (21.0%) in 2021.

Developed markets net revenue increased 8.0% and developedmarkets Organic Net Revenue increased 4.5%. Emerging markets net revenues decreased 6.0%, including an unfavorable currency impact, and emerging markets Organic Net Revenue increased 2.3%.

Net revenues were higher in developed markets, particularly North America, where due to the COVID-19 outbreak and response, demand for our products, primarily biscuits and chocolate, grew significantly as consumers increased their food purchases for in-home consumption. However, our gum and candy categories as well as our world travel retail and foodservice businesses were negatively impacted by COVID-19. In emerging markets, where we have a greater concentration of traditional trade, several markets were challenged by COVID-19 impacts, particularly those with significant gum and candy portfolios. Overall, as the negative impacts of COVID-19 experienced in the first half of the year subsided in the second half of the year, revenue growth began to recover in a number of our key emerging markets, though overall emerging markets net revenues declined due to unfavorable currency impacts.Organic Net Revenue growth was driven by higher net pricing and favorable volume/mix. Higher net pricing in all regions except Europe was due to the benefit of carryover pricing from 2019 as well as the effects of input cost-driven pricing actions taken during 2020. Favorable volume/mix in North America and Europe, partially offset by unfavorable volume/mix in Latin America and AMEA, included strong volume gains tempered by unfavorable mix reflecting shifts in consumer purchases in response to the COVID-19 outbreak. The April 1, 2020 acquisition of Give & Go added incremental net revenues of $390 million and the July 16, 2019 acquisition of a majority interest in Perfect Snacks added incremental net revenues of $55 million in 2020. Unfavorable currency impacts decreased net revenues by $637 million, due primarily to the strength of the U.S. dollar relative to most currencies, including the Brazilian real, Argentinean peso, Russian ruble, Mexican peso, Indian rupee, South African rand and Turkish lira, partially offset by the strength of several currencies relative to the U.S. dollar, including the euro, Philippine peso, British pound sterling, Egyptian pound and Swedish krona. The impact of the May 28, 2019 divestiture of most of our cheese business in the Middle East and Africa resulted in a year-over-year decline in net revenues of $55 million.

Higher net pricing, which included the carryover impact of pricing actions taken in 2019 as well as the effects of input cost-driven pricing actions taken during 2020, was reflected in all regions except Europe. Favorable volume/mix was driven by North America and Europe, which was partially offset by unfavorable volume/mix in Latin America and AMEA. The increase in input costs was driven by higher raw material costs, partially offset by lower manufacturing costs driven by productivity net of incremental COVID-19 related costs. Higher raw material costs were in part due to higher foreign currency transaction costs on imported materials, as well as higher cocoa, dairy, sugar, energy, packaging, nuts, grains and other ingredients costs, partially offset by lower costs for oils. Total selling, general and administrative expenses decreased $38 million from 2019, due to a number of factors noted in the table above, including in part, a favorable currency impact related to expenses, favorable change from the resolution of tax matters (a benefit in 2020 as compared to an expense in 2019), lower implementation costs incurred for the Simplify to Grow Program, lapping prior-year value-added tax (“VAT”) related settlements, lapping prior-year CEO transition remuneration and lapping the prior-year divestiture. These decreases were partially offset by the impact of acquisitions, costs associated with the JDE Peet's transaction, lapping the benefit from prior-year pension participation changes, unfavorable change in remeasurement of net monetary position in Argentina (remeasurement loss in 2020 as compared to a remeasurement gain in 2019) and higher acquisition-related costs. Excluding these factors, selling, general and administrative expenses increased $77 million from 2019. The increase was driven primarily by higher advertising and consumer promotion costs, partially offset by lower overhead spending net of incremental COVID-19 related costs. We recorded an expense of $11 million from a VAT-related settlement in Latin America in 2019. Unfavorable currency changes decreased operating income by $59 million due primarily to the strength of the U.S. dollar relative to most currencies, including the Brazilian real, Russian ruble, Indian rupee, Swiss franc, South African rand and Turkish lira, partially offset by the strength of several currencies relative to the U.S. dollar, including the euro, Egyptian pound, Philippine peso, British pound sterling and Swedish krona.Operating income margin decreased from 14.9% in 2019 to 14.5% in 2020. The decrease in operating income margin was driven primarily by the year-over-year unfavorable change in mark-to-market gains/(losses) from currency and commodity hedging activities, higher intangible asset impairment charges, costs associated with the JDE Peet's transaction, lapping the prior-year gain on a divestiture and lapping the benefit from prior-year pension participation changes, partially offset by the favorable impact from the resolution of tax matters and lower costs for the Simplify to Grow Program. Adjusted Operating Income margin increased from 16.5% in 2019 to 16.6% in 2020. The increase in Adjusted Operating Income margin was driven primarily by higher pricing, lower manufacturing costs reflecting productivity net of incremental COVD-19 costs, and selling, general and administrative cost leverage, mostly offset by higher raw material costs.49Table of ContentsNet Earnings and Earnings per Share Attributable to Mondelēz International – Net earnings attributable to Mondelēz International of $3,555 million decreased by $374 million (9.5%) in 2020.

Higher net pricing was reflected across all categories, driven primarily by Argentina, Brazil and Mexico. Favorable volume/mix reflected strong volume growth as the negative impacts from the pandemic that we experienced in the prior year subsided across the region. Favorable volume/mix was driven by gains in chocolate, biscuits, gum and candy, partially offset by declines in refreshment beverages and cheese & grocery. Unfavorable currency impacts were due primarily to the strength of the U.S. dollar relative to most currencies in the region including the Argentinean peso and Brazilian real. Segment operating income increased $72 million (38.1%), primarily due to higher net pricing, lower manufacturing costs (productivity and lower incremental COVID-19 related costs), favorable volume/mix and lower costs incurred for the Simplify to Grow Program. These favorable items were partially offset by higher raw material costs, higher advertising and consumer promotion costs, unfavorable currency, divestiture-related costs incurred in 2021, higher other selling, general and administrative expenses and lower benefits from the resolution of tax matters.2020 compared with 2019:Net revenues decreased $541 million (17.9%), due to unfavorable currency (18.1 pp) and unfavorable volume/mix (7.5 pp), partially offset by higher net pricing (7.7 pp). Unfavorable currency impacts were due primarily to the strength of the U.S. dollar relative to most currencies in the region including the Brazilian real, Argentinean peso and Mexican peso. Unfavorable volume/mix was due to the negative volume impact from the COVID-19 outbreak as well as the impact of pricing-related elasticity. Unfavorable volume/mix was driven by declines in gum and candy, partially offset by gains in cheese & grocery, chocolate, refreshment beverages and biscuits. Higher net pricing was reflected across all categories, driven primarily by Argentina, Brazil and Mexico.Segment operating income decreased $152 million (44.6%), primarily due to higher raw material costs, unfavorable volume/mix, unfavorable currency, higher other selling, general and administrative expenses (net of lapping the expense of VAT-related settlements in 2019) and an unfavorable change in remeasurement of net monetary position in Argentina (remeasurement loss in 2020 as compared to a remeasurement gain in 2019). These unfavorable items were partially offset by higher net pricing, lower manufacturing costs (net of incremental COVID-19 related costs), lower costs incurred for the Simplify to Grow Program and higher benefits from the resolution of a tax matter.53Table of ContentsAMEA For the Years EndedDecember 31, 20212020$ change% change (in millions) Net revenues$6,465 $5,740 $725 12.6 %Segment operating income1,054 821 233 28.4 % For the Years EndedDecember 31, 20202019$ change% change (in millions) Net revenues$5,740 $5,770 $(30)(0.5)%Segment operating income821 691 130 18.8 %2021 compared with 2020:Net revenues increased $725 million (12.6%), due to favorable volume/mix (5.3 pp), favorable currency (3.8 pp), higher net pricing (2.0 pp), the impact of an acquisition (0.9 pp) and the partial year contribution of a business divested on November 1, 2021 which had been part of an earlier 2021 acquisition (0.6 pp). Favorable volume/mix reflected net overall volume gains as the negative impacts from the pandemic that we experienced in the prior year subsided across most of the region, though some markets were still challenged. Favorable volume/mix was driven by gains in chocolate, biscuits, gum and candy, partially offset by declines in cheese & grocery and refreshment beverages. Favorable currency impacts were due to the strength of most currencies relative to the U.S. dollar, including the Chinese yuan, Australian dollar, South African rand and New Zealand dollar. Higher net pricing was reflected across all categories except cheese & grocery. The April 1, 2021 acquisition of Gourmet Food added incremental net revenues of $47 million (constant currency basis) in 2021. The packaged seafood business, which was part of our April 1, 2021 acquisition of Gourmet Food but divested on November 1, 2021, added incremental net revenues of $35 million prior to its divestiture. Segment operating income increased $233 million (28.4%), primarily due to lower manufacturing costs (productivity and lower incremental COVID-19 related costs), higher net pricing, favorable volume/mix, lower costs incurred for the Simplify to Grow Program, favorable currency, the impact of an acquisition, lapping prior-year intangible asset impairment charges and the partial year contribution of a business divested which had been part of an earlier 2021 acquisition. These favorable items were partially offset by higher raw material costs, higher advertising and consumer promotion costs and higher other selling, general and administrative expenses.2020 compared with 2019:Net revenues decreased $30 million (0.5%), due to unfavorable currency (1.3 pp), the impact of a divestiture (0.9 pp) and unfavorable volume/mix (0.6 pp), partially offset by higher net pricing (2.3 pp). Unfavorable currency impacts were due to the strength of the U.S. dollar relative to several currencies in the region, including the Indian rupee, South African rand, Australian dollar and Pakistan rupee, partially offset by the strength of several currencies relative to the U.S. dollar, including the Philippine peso, Egyptian pound, Japanese yen and Chinese yuan. The May 28, 2019 divestiture of most of our cheese business in the Middle East and Africa resulted in a year-over-year decline in net revenues of $55 million. Unfavorable volume/mix was due to unfavorable product mix as overall higher volume was tempered by the negative volume impact from COVID-19 related lockdowns impacting our traditional trade markets. Unfavorable volume/mix was driven by declines in gum, chocolate, candy and refreshment beverages, partially offset by gains in biscuits and cheese & grocery. Higher net pricing was driven by chocolate, biscuits, refreshment beverages and cheese & grocery, partially offset by lower net pricing in candy and gum. Segment operating income increased $130 million (18.8%), primarily due to higher net pricing, lapping prior-year expenses from the resolution of tax matters in India totaling $87 million, lower manufacturing costs (net of incremental COVID-19 related costs), lower other selling, general and administrative expenses, lower intangible asset impairment charges and lower costs incurred for the Simplify to Grow Program. These favorable items were partially offset by higher raw material costs, unfavorable volume/mix, unfavorable currency and the impact of the prior-year divestiture.54Table of ContentsEurope For the Years EndedDecember 31, 20212020$ change% change (in millions) Net revenues$11,156 $10,207 $949 9.3 %Segment operating income2,092 1,775 317 17.9 % For the Years EndedDecember 31, 20202019$ change% change (in millions) Net revenues$10,207 $9,972 $235 2.4 %Segment operating income1,775 1,732 43 2.5 %2021 compared with 2020:Net revenues increased $949 million (9.3%), due to favorable currency (3.7 pp), favorable volume/mix (3.6 pp), higher net pricing (1.4 pp) and the impact of an acquisition (0.6 pp).

Favorable volume/mix was driven by strong volume growth as we experienced increased demand for most of our snack category products and our world travel business continued to recover as global travel improved though still remained below pre-pandemic levels. Favorable volume/mix was driven by gains in chocolate, biscuits, cheese & grocery, and refreshment beverages, partially offset by declines in gum and candy. Higher net pricing was reflected across all categories except cheese & grocery. The March 25, 2021 acquisition of Grenade added incremental net revenues of $63 million (constant currency basis) in 2021. Segment operating income increased $317 million (17.9%), primarily due to favorable volume/mix, higher net pricing, lower Simplify to Grow Program costs, lower manufacturing costs (productivity and lower incremental COVID-19 related costs), favorable currency, lapping prior-year intangible asset impairment charges, lower other selling, general and administrative expenses and the impact of an acquisition. These favorable items were partially offset by higher raw material costs, higher advertising and consumer promotion costs, the impact from pension participation changes and acquisition integration costs incurred in 2021. 2020 compared with 2019:Net revenues increased $235 million (2.4%), due to favorable volume/mix (2.8 pp), partially offset by lower net pricing (0.3 pp) and unfavorable currency (0.1 pp).

Unfavorable currency impacts reflected the strength of the U.S. dollar relative to several currencies in the region, including the Russian ruble, Turkish lira, Norwegian krone and Ukrainian hryvnia, mostly offset by the strength of several currencies in the region relative to the U.S. dollar, primarily the euro, British pound sterling, Swedish krona and Swiss franc.Segment operating income increased $43 million (2.5%), primarily due to favorable volume/mix, lower costs incurred for the Simplify to Grow Program and lower advertising and consumer promotion costs. These favorable items were partially offset by higher raw material costs, lower net pricing, higher intangible asset impairment charges, higher other selling, general and administrative expenses and unfavorable currency.55Table of ContentsNorth America For the Years EndedDecember 31, 20212020$ change% change (in millions) Net revenues$8,302 $8,157 $145 1.8 %Segment operating income1,371 1,587 (216)(13.6)% For the Years EndedDecember 31, 20202019$ change% change (in millions) Net revenues$8,157 $7,108 $1,049 14.8 %Segment operating income1,587 1,451 136 9.4 %2021 compared with 2020:Net revenues increased $145 million (1.8%), due to the impact of acquisitions (1.8 pp), higher net pricing (1.0 pp) and favorable currency (0.6 pp), partially offset by unfavorable volume/mix (1.6 pp). The April 1, 2020 acquisition of Give & Go added incremental net revenues of $106 million and the January 4, 2021 acquisition of Hu added incremental net revenues of $38 million in 2021. Higher net pricing was driven by biscuits, gum and candy, partially offset by lower net pricing in chocolate. Favorable currency impact was due to the strength of the Canadian dollar relative to the U.S. dollar. Unfavorable volume mix reflected volume declines as the region lapped prior-year strong volume growth driven by significantly increased food purchases for in-home consumption due to the pandemic as well as impacts from labor disruptions and supply chain constraints in the second half of 2021. Unfavorable volume/mix was driven by declines in biscuits, candy, chocolate and gum. Segment operating income decreased $216 million (13.6%), primarily due to unfavorable volume/mix, higher raw material costs, higher Simplify to Grow Program costs and higher advertising and consumer promotion costs. These unfavorable items were partially offset by higher net pricing, lower other selling, general and administrative expenses (including lower COVID-19 related costs), a net benefit from acquisition integration costs and contingent consideration adjustments, lower intangible asset impairment charges, lower manufacturing costs (lower incremental COVID-19 related costs and productivity) and favorable currency. 2020 compared with 2019:Net revenues increased $1,049 million (14.8%), due to favorable volume/mix (6.3 pp), the impact of acquisitions (6.3 pp) and higher net pricing (2.3 pp), partially offset by unfavorable currency (0.1 pp). Favorable volume/mix, in part due to the positive volume impact from COVID-19 as consumers increased their food purchases for in-home consumption, was driven by gains in biscuits, partially offset by declines in gum, chocolate and candy. The April 1, 2020 acquisition of Give & Go added incremental net revenues of $390 million and the July 16, 2019 acquisition of a majority interest in Perfect Snacks added net revenues of $55 million in 2020. Higher net pricing was driven by biscuits, chocolate and candy, partially offset by lower net pricing in gum. Unfavorable currency impact was due to the strength of the U.S. dollar relative to the Canadian dollar.Segment operating income increased $136 million (9.4%), primarily due to favorable volume/mix, higher net pricing and the impact of acquisitions. These favorable items were partially offset by higher advertising and consumer promotion costs, intangible asset impairment charges, higher other selling, general and administrative expenses (including incremental COVID-19 related costs), higher raw material costs, lapping the benefit from prior-year pension participation changes and higher costs incurred for the Simplify to Grow Program.56Table of ContentsCritical Accounting EstimatesWe prepare our consolidated financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP. The preparation of these financial statements requires the use of estimates, judgments and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the periods presented. Actual results could differ from those estimates and assumptions. Note 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, to the consolidated financial statements includes a summary of the significant accounting policies we used to prepare our consolidated financial statements. We have discussed the selection and disclosure of our critical accounting policies and estimates with our Audit Committee. The following is a review of our most significant assumptions and estimates.Goodwill and Indefinite-Life Intangible Assets:We test goodwill and indefinite-life intangible assets for impairment on an annual basis on July 1. We assess goodwill impairment risk throughout the year by performing a qualitative review of entity-specific, industry, market and general economic factors affecting our goodwill reporting units. We review our operating segment and reporting unit structure for goodwill testing annually or as significant changes in the organization occur. Annually, we may perform qualitative testing, or depending on factors such as prior-year test results, current year developments, current risk evaluations and other practical considerations, we may elect to do quantitative testing instead. In our quantitative testing, we compare a reporting unit’s estimated fair value with its carrying value. We estimate a reporting unit’s fair value using a discounted cash flow method which incorporates planned growth rates, market-based discount rates and estimates of residual value. This year, for our Europe and North America reporting units, we used a market-based, weighted-average cost of capital of 6.4% to discount the projected cash flows of those operations. For our Latin America and AMEA reporting units, we used a risk-rated discount rate of 9.4%. Estimating the fair value of individual reporting units requires us to make assumptions and estimates regarding our future plans and industry and economic conditions based on available information. Given the uncertainty of the global economic environment and the impact of COVID-19, those estimates could be significantly different than future performance. If the carrying value of a reporting unit’s net assets exceeds its fair value, we would recognize an impairment charge for the amount by which the carrying value exceeds the reporting unit's fair value.In 2021, 2020 and 2019, there were no impairments of goodwill. In connection with our 2021 annual impairment testing, each of our reporting units had sufficient fair value in excess of carrying value. While all reporting units passed our annual impairment testing, if planned business performance expectations are not met or specific valuation factors outside of our control, such as discount rates, change significantly, then the estimated fair values of a reporting unit or reporting units might decline and lead to a goodwill impairment in the future.Annually, we assess indefinite-life intangible assets for impairment by performing a qualitative review and assessing events and circumstances that could affect the fair value or carrying value of these assets. If significant potential impairment risk exists for a specific asset, we quantitatively test it for impairment by comparing its estimated fair value with its carrying value. We determine estimated fair value using planned growth rates, market-based discount rates and estimates of royalty rates. If the carrying value of the asset exceeds its estimated fair value, the asset is impaired and its carrying value is reduced to the estimated fair value.During 2021, we recorded $32 million of intangible asset impairment charges related to a biscuit brand in North America. The impairment charges were calculated as the excess of the carrying value over the estimated fair value of the intangible assets on a global basis and were recorded within asset impairment and exit costs. We use several accepted valuation methods, including relief of royalty, excess earnings and excess margin, that utilize estimates of future sales, earnings growth rates, royalty rates and discount rates in determining a brand's global fair value. We also identified eight brands with $1,146 million of aggregate book value as of December 31, 2021 that each had a fair value in excess of book value of 10% or less. We continue to monitor our brand performance, particularly in light of the significant uncertainty due to the COVID-19 pandemic and related impacts to our business. If the brand earnings expectations are not met or specific valuation factors outside of our control, such as discount rates, change significantly, then a brand or brands could become impaired in the future. In 2020, we recorded $144 million of intangible asset impairment charges related to gum, chocolate, biscuits and candy brands, with $83 million in North America, $53 million in Europe, $5 million in AMEA and $3 million in Latin America. In 2019, we recorded $57 million of intangible asset impairment charges related to gum, chocolate, biscuits and candy brands, with $39 million in Europe, $15 million in AMEA and $3 million in Latin America.Refer to Note 6, Goodwill and Intangible Assets, for additional information.57Table of ContentsTrade and Marketing Programs:We promote our products with trade and sales incentives as well as marketing and advertising programs. These programs include, but are not limited to, new product introduction fees, discounts, coupons, rebates and volume-based incentives as well as cooperative advertising, in-store displays and consumer marketing promotions. Trade and sales incentives are recorded as a reduction to revenues based on amounts estimated due to customers and consumers at the end of a period. We base these estimates principally on historical utilization and redemption rates. For interim reporting purposes, advertising and consumer promotion expenses are charged to operations as a percentage of volume, based on estimated sales volume and estimated program spending. We do not defer costs on our year-end consolidated balance sheet and all marketing and advertising costs are recorded as an expense in the year incurred.Employee Benefit Plans:We sponsor various employee benefit plans throughout the world. These include primarily pension plans and postretirement healthcare benefits. For accounting purposes, we estimate the pension and postretirement healthcare benefit obligations utilizing assumptions and estimates for discount rates; expected returns on plan assets; expected compensation increases; employee-related factors such as turnover, retirement age and mortality; and health care cost trends. We review our actuarial assumptions on an annual basis and make modifications to the assumptions based on current rates and trends when appropriate. Our assumptions also reflect our historical experiences and management’s best judgment regarding future expectations. These and other assumptions affect the annual expense and obligations recognized for the underlying plans.As permitted by U.S. GAAP, we generally amortize the effect of changes in the assumptions over future periods. The cost or benefit of plan changes, such as increasing or decreasing benefits for prior employee service (prior service cost), is deferred and included in expense on a straight-line basis over the average remaining service period of the employees expected to receive benefits.Since pension and postretirement liabilities are measured on a discounted basis, the discount rate significantly affects our plan obligations and expenses. For plans that have assets held in trust, the expected return on plan assets assumption affects our pension plan expenses. The assumptions for discount rates and expected rates of return and our process for setting these assumptions are described in Note 11, Benefit Plans, to the consolidated financial statements.While we do not anticipate further changes in the 2021 assumptions for our U.S. and non-U.S. pension and postretirement health care plans, as a sensitivity measure, a fifty-basis point change in our discount rates or the expected rate of return on plan assets would have the following effects, increase/(decrease), on our annual benefit plan costs: As of December 31, 2021 U.S. PlansNon-U.S. PlansFifty-Basis-PointFifty-Basis-Point IncreaseDecreaseIncreaseDecrease (in millions)Effect of change in discount rate on pension costs$(1)$2 $(21)$68 Effect of change in expected rate of return on plan assets on pension costs(8)8 (54)54 Effect of change in discount rate on postretirement health care costs1 — — — See additional information on our employee benefit plans in Note 11, Benefit Plans.Income Taxes:As a global company, we calculate and provide for income taxes in each tax jurisdiction in which we operate. The provision for income taxes includes the amounts payable or refundable for the current year, the effect of deferred taxes and impacts from uncertain tax positions. Our provision for income taxes is significantly affected by shifts in the geographic mix of our pre-tax earnings across tax jurisdictions, changes in tax laws and regulations, tax planning opportunities available in each tax jurisdiction and the ultimate outcome of various tax audits.58Table of ContentsDeferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between the financial statement and tax bases of our assets and liabilities and for operating losses and tax credit carryforwards. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates that will apply to taxable income in the years in which those differences are expected to be recovered or settled. Valuation allowances are established for deferred tax assets when it is more likely than not that a tax benefit will not be realized.We believe our tax positions comply with applicable tax laws and that we have properly accounted for uncertain tax positions. We recognize tax benefits in our financial statements from uncertain tax positions only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained by the taxing authorities based on the technical merits of the position. The amount we recognize is measured as the largest amount of benefit that is greater than 50 percent likely of being realized upon resolution. We evaluate uncertain tax positions on an ongoing basis and adjust the amount recognized in light of changing facts and circumstances, such as the progress of a tax audit or expiration of a statute of limitations. We believe the estimates and assumptions used to support our evaluation of uncertain tax positions are reasonable. However, final determination of historical tax liabilities, whether by settlement with tax authorities, judicial or administrative ruling or due to expiration of statutes of limitations, could be materially different from estimates reflected on our consolidated balance sheet and historical income tax provisions. The outcome of these final determinations could have a material effect on our provision for income taxes, net earnings or cash flows in the period in which the determination is made.See Note 16, Income Taxes, for further discussion of the impacts from Swiss tax reform in our financial statements, as well as additional information on our effective tax rate, current and deferred taxes, valuation allowances and unrecognized tax benefits.Contingencies:See Note 14, Commitments and Contingencies, to the consolidated financial statements.New Accounting Guidance:See Note 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, to the consolidated financial statements for a discussion of new accounting standards.59Table of ContentsLiquidity and Capital Resources We believe that cash from operations, our revolving credit facilities, short-term borrowings and our authorized long-term financing will continue to provide sufficient liquidity for our working capital needs, planned capital expenditures and future payments of our contractual, tax and benefit plan obligations and payments for acquisitions, share repurchases and quarterly dividends. We expect to continue to utilize our commercial paper program and international credit lines as needed. We continually evaluate long-term debt issuances to meet our short- and longer-term funding requirements. We also use intercompany loans with our international subsidiaries to improve financial flexibility. Our investments in JDE Peet's and KDP also provide us additional flexibility. Overall, we do not expect negative effects to our funding sources that would have a material effect on our liquidity, and to date, we have been successful in raising financing as needed, including during the pandemic, and generally on favorable terms. However, in connection with the COVID-19 pandemic or otherwise, if a serious economic or credit market crisis ensues, it could have a material adverse effect on our liquidity, results of operations and financial condition.Our most significant ongoing short-term cash requirements relate primarily to funding operations (including expenditures for raw materials, labor, manufacturing and distribution, trade and promotions, advertising and marketing, tax liabilities, benefit plan obligations and lease expenses) as well as periodic expenditures for acquisitions, shareholder returns (such as dividend payments and share repurchases) and property, plant and equipment. Long-term cash requirements primarily relate to funding long-term debt repayments (refer to Note 9, Debt and Borrowing Arrangements), our U.S. tax reform transition tax liability and deferred taxes (refer to Note 16, Income Taxes), our long-term benefit plan obligations (refer to Note 11, Benefit Plans) and commodity-related purchase commitments and derivative contracts (refer to Note 10, Financial Instruments). We generally fund short- and long-term cash requirements with cash from operating activities as well as cash proceeds from short- and long-term debt financing (refer to Debt below). We generally do not use equity to fund our ongoing obligations.Cash Flow:We believe our ability to generate substantial cash from operating activities and readily access capital markets and secure financing at competitive rates are key strengths and give us significant flexibility to meet our short and long-term financial commitments. Our cash flow activity over the last three years is noted below:202120202019Net cash provided by operating activities$4,141 $3,964 $3,965 Net cash (used in)/provided by investing activities$(26)$500 $(960)Net cash used in financing activities$(4,069)$(2,215)$(2,787)Net Cash Provided by Operating Activities:The increase in net cash provided by operating activities in 2021 was due primarily to higher earnings and lower working capital requirements, partially offset by higher tax payments and lower dividends received from our equity method investments. Net cash provided by operating activities was largely flat in 2020 relative to 2019 as higher cash tax payments in 2020 (primarily related to sales of KDP and JDE Peet's shares and the resolution of several indirect tax matters under a tax amnesty program in India) and the payment of costs associated with the JDE Peet's transaction in 2020 were largely offset by working capital improvements. Net Cash Used in/Provided by Investing Activities:Net cash from investing activities was lower in 2021 due primarily to lower cash proceeds from partial sales of our equity method investment shares (refer to Note 7, Equity Method Investments) and higher capital expenditures, partially offset by less cash paid for acquisitions in 2021 for Hu, Grenade and Gourmet Food than in 2020 for Give & Go (refer to Note 2, Acquisitions and Divestitures). The increase in net cash provided by investing activities in 2020 relative to 2019 was primarily due to cash received from the sale of shares in the JDE Peet's and KDP offerings and lower capital expenditures, partially offset by cash paid to acquire a majority interest in Give & Go. Capital expenditures were $965 million in 2021, $863 million in 2020 and $925 million in 2019. We continue to make capital expenditures primarily to modernize manufacturing facilities and support new product and productivity initiatives. We expect 2022 capital expenditures to be up to $1.2 billion, including capital expenditures in connection 60Table of Contentswith our Simplify to Grow Program and for funding our strategic priorities. We expect to continue to fund these expenditures with cash from operations.Net Cash Used in Financing Activities:The increase in cash used in financing activities was primarily due to higher amounts of net long-term debt repayments, higher share repurchases and higher dividends paid in 2021 than in 2020. The decrease in net cash used in financing activities in 2020 relative to 2019 was primarily due to higher net debt issuances and lower share repurchases, partially offset by higher dividends paid and lower proceeds from stock option exercises in 2020. Chipita AcquisitionOn January 3, 2022, we closed on our acquisition of Chipita S.A. The cash consideration for Chipita totaled €1.3 billion ($1.5 billion) and we assumed and substantially paid down €0.4 billion ($0.4 billion) of Chipita's debt in January for a total purchase price of approximately €1.7 billion ($1.9 billion). Cash paid for the business was raised from cash from operations and by issuing long-term debt in the third quarter of 2021. Refer to Note 2, Acquisitions and Divestitures, and Note 9, Debt and Borrowing Arrangements, for additional details.Supply Chain FinancingAs part of our continued efforts to improve our working capital efficiency, we have worked with our suppliers over the past several years to optimize our terms and conditions, which include the extension of payment terms. Our current payment terms with a majority of our suppliers are from 30 to 180 days, which we deem to be commercially reasonable. We also facilitate voluntary supply chain financing (“SCF”) programs through several participating financial institutions. Under these programs, our suppliers, at their sole discretion, determine invoices that they want to sell to participating financial institutions. Our suppliers’ voluntary inclusion of invoices in SCF programs has no bearing on our payment terms or amounts due. Our responsibility is limited to making payments based upon the agreed-upon contractual terms. No guarantees are provided by the Company or any of our subsidiaries under the SCF programs and we have no economic interest in the suppliers’ decision to participate in the SCF programs. Amounts due to our suppliers that elected to participate in the SCF program are included in accounts payable in our consolidated balance sheet. We have been informed by the participating financial institutions that as of December 31, 2021, and December 31, 2020, $2.5 billion and $2.1 billion, respectively, of our accounts payable to suppliers that participate in the SCF programs are outstanding.Guarantees:As discussed in Note 14, Commitments and Contingencies, we enter into third-party guarantees primarily to cover the long-term obligations of our vendors. As part of these transactions, we guarantee that third parties will make contractual payments or achieve performance measures. At December 31, 2021, we had no material third-party guarantees recorded on our consolidated balance sheet. Guarantees do not have, and we do not expect them to have, a material effect on our liquidity.Debt:The nature and amount of our long-term and short-term debt and the proportionate amount of each varies as a result of current and expected business requirements, market conditions and other factors. Due to seasonality, in the first and second quarters of the year, our working capital requirements grow, increasing the need for short-term financing. The second half of the year typically generates higher cash flows. As such, we may issue commercial paper or secure other forms of financing throughout the year to meet short-term working capital or other financing needs.Refer to Note 9, Debt and Borrowing Arrangements, for a projection of long-term debt scheduled to mature (including current maturities and finance leases) in future periods. In the next 12 months, we expect to repay approximately $1.7 billion of maturing long-term debt including: $1.2 billion in July 2022 and $0.5 billion in September 2022. We fund ongoing debt maturities and other long-term obligations using cash on hand or we may refinance obligations with long-term debt or short-term financing (such as our commercial paper borrowings) depending on financing available, timing considerations, flexibility to raise funding and the cost of financing.During December 2021, our Board of Directors approved a new $7.0 billion long-term financing authority to replace the prior $6.0 billion authority. As of December 31, 2021, all $7.0 billion of the long-term financing authorization remained available.Our total debt was $19.5 billion at December 31, 2021 and $20.0 billion at December 31, 2020. Our debt-to-capitalization ratio was 0.41 at December 31, 2021 and 0.42 at December 31, 2020. The weighted-average term of 61Table of Contentsour outstanding long-term debt was 9.5 years at December 31, 2021 and 7.4 years at December 31, 2020. Our average daily commercial borrowings were $0.5 billion in 2021, $2.3 billion in 2020 and $4.1 billion in 2019. We had commercial paper borrowings of $0.2 billion at December 31, 2021 and no commercial paper borrowings outstanding as of December 31, 2020. We expect to continue to use cash or commercial paper to finance various short-term financing needs. As of December 31, 2021, we continued to be in compliance with our debt covenants. One of our subsidiaries, MIHN, has outstanding debt. Refer to Note 9, Debt and Borrowing Arrangements. The operations held by MIHN generated approximately 73.5% (or $21.1 billion) of the $28.7 billion of consolidated net revenue during fiscal year 2021 and represented approximately 79.2% (or $22.4 billion) of the $28.3 billion of net assets as of December 31, 2021.Refer to Note 9, Debt and Borrowing Arrangements, for more information on our debt and debt covenants.Commodity TrendsWe regularly monitor worldwide supply, commodity cost and currency trends so we can cost-effectively secure ingredients, packaging and fuel required for production. During 2021, the primary drivers of the increase in our aggregate commodity costs were higher foreign currency transaction costs on imported materials, as well as increased costs for edible oils, packaging, sugar, cocoa, grains, dairy and other ingredients.A number of external factors such as the current COVID-19 pandemic, climate and weather conditions, commodity, transportation and labor market conditions, currency fluctuations and the effects of governmental agricultural or other programs affect the cost and availability of raw materials and agricultural materials used in our products. We address higher commodity costs and currency impacts primarily through hedging, higher pricing and manufacturing and overhead cost control. We use hedging techniques to limit the impact of fluctuations in the cost of our principal raw materials; however, we may not be able to fully hedge against commodity cost changes, such as dairy, where there is a limited ability to hedge, and our hedging strategies may not protect us from increases in specific raw material costs. Due to competitive or market conditions, planned trade or promotional incentives, fluctuations in currency exchange rates or other factors, our pricing actions may also lag commodity cost changes temporarily.As a result of international supply chain, transportation and labor market disruptions and generally highercommodity, transportation and labor costs in the second half of 2021, we expect price volatility and a higher aggregate cost environment to continue in 2022. While the costs of our principal raw materials fluctuate, we believe there will continue to be an adequate supply of the raw materials we use and that they will generally remain available.Equity and DividendsStock Plans:See Note 12, Stock Plans, to the consolidated financial statements for more information on our stock plans and grant activity during 2019-2021.Share Repurchases:See Note 13, Capital Stock, to the consolidated financial statements and Item 5, Market for Registrant’s Common Equity, Related Stockholder Matters and Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities – Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities, for more information on our share repurchase program. As of December 31, 2021, our Board of Directors has authorized share repurchases up to $23.7 billion through December 31, 2023. Under this program, we have repurchased approximately $20.0 billion of shares through December 31, 2021 ($2.1 billion in 2021, $1.4 billion in 2020, $1.5 billion in 2019, $2.0 billion in 2018, $2.2 billion in 2017, $2.6 billion in 2016, $3.6 billion in 2015, $1.9 billion in 2014 and $2.7 billion in 2013), at a weighted-average cost of $41.95 per share. The number of shares that we ultimately repurchase under our share repurchase program may vary depending on numerous factors, including share price and other market conditions, our ongoing capital allocation planning, levels of cash and debt balances, other demands for cash, such as acquisition activity, general economic or business conditions and board and management discretion. Additionally, our share repurchase activity during any particular period may fluctuate. We may accelerate, suspend, delay or discontinue our share repurchase program at any time, without notice.62Table of ContentsDividends:We paid dividends of $1,826 million in 2021, $1,678 million in 2020 and $1,542 million in 2019. On July 27, 2021, the Finance Committee, with authorization delegated from our Board of Directors, declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.35 per share of Class A Common Stock, an increase of 11 percent, which would be $1.40 per common share on an annualized basis. In 2020, our quarterly cash dividend increased from $0.285 to $0.315 per share of Class A Common Stock, an increase of 11 percent, and in 2019, our quarterly cash dividend increased from $0.26 to $0.285 per share of Class A Common Stock, an increase of 10 percent. The declaration of dividends is subject to the discretion of our Board of Directors and depends on various factors, including our net earnings, financial condition, cash requirements, future prospects and other factors that our Board of Directors deems relevant to its analysis and decision making.For U.S. income tax purposes only, the Company has determined that 100% of the distributions paid to its shareholders in 2021 are characterized as a qualified dividend paid from U.S. earnings and profits. Shareholders should consult their tax advisors for a full understanding of the tax consequences of the receipt of dividends.63Table of ContentsNon-GAAP Financial MeasuresWe use non-GAAP financial information and believe it is useful to investors as it provides additional information to facilitate comparisons of historical operating results, identify trends in our underlying operating results and provide additional insight and transparency on how we evaluate our business. We use non-GAAP financial measures to budget, make operating and strategic decisions and evaluate our performance. We have detailed the non-GAAP adjustments that we make in our non-GAAP definitions below. The adjustments generally fall within the following categories: acquisition and divestiture activities, gains and losses on intangible asset sales and non-cash impairments, major program restructuring activities, constant currency and related adjustments, major program financing and hedging activities and other major items affecting comparability of operating results. We believe the non-GAAP measures should always be considered along with the related U.S. GAAP financial measures. We have provided the reconciliations between the GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures below, and we also discuss our underlying GAAP results throughout our Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations in this Form 10-K.Our primary non-GAAP financial measures are listed below and reflect how we evaluate our current and prior-year operating results. As new events or circumstances arise, these definitions could change. When our definitions change, we provide the updated definitions and present the related non-GAAP historical results on a comparable basis (1).•“Organic Net Revenue” is defined as net revenues excluding the impacts of acquisitions, divestitures (2) and currency rate fluctuations (3). We also evaluate Organic Net Revenue growth from emerging markets and developed markets.•Our emerging markets include our Latin America region in its entirety; the AMEA region, excluding Australia, New Zealand and Japan; and the following countries from the Europe region: Russia, Ukraine, Türkiye, Kazakhstan, Georgia, Poland, Czech Republic, Slovak Republic, Hungary, Bulgaria, Romania, the Baltics and the East Adriatic countries. •Our developed markets include the entire North America region, the Europe region excluding the countries included in the emerging markets definition, and Australia, New Zealand and Japan from the AMEA region.•“Adjusted Operating Income” is defined as operating income excluding the impacts of the Simplify to Grow Program (4); gains or losses (including non-cash impairment charges) on goodwill and intangible assets; divestiture (2) or acquisition gains or losses, divestiture-related costs (2), acquisition-related costs, and acquisition integration costs and contingent consideration adjustments (2); the operating results of divestitures (2); remeasurement of net monetary position (5); mark-to-market impacts from commodity, forecasted currency and equity method investment transaction derivative contracts (6); impact from resolution of tax matters (7); CEO transition remuneration (8); impact from pension participation changes (9); initial impacts from enacted tax law changes (10); and costs associated with the JDE Peet's transaction. We also present “Adjusted Operating Income margin,” which is subject to the same adjustments as Adjusted Operating Income. We also evaluate growth in our Adjusted Operating Income on a constant currency basis (3).•“Adjusted EPS” is defined as diluted EPS attributable to Mondelēz International from continuing operations excluding the impacts of the items listed in the Adjusted Operating Income definition as well as losses on debt extinguishment and related expenses; gains or losses on interest rate swaps no longer designated as accounting cash flow hedges due to changed financing and hedging plans, net earnings from divestitures (2); and gains or losses on equity method investment transactions. Similarly, within Adjusted EPS, our equity method investment net earnings exclude our proportionate share of our investees’ significant operating and non-operating items (11). We also evaluate growth in our Adjusted EPS on a constant currency basis (3).(1) When items no longer impact our current or future presentation of non-GAAP operating results, we remove these items from our non-GAAP definitions. In the second quarter of 2021, we added to the non-GAAP definitions the exclusion of initial impacts from enacted tax law changes (refer to footnote (10) below). In the third quarter of 2021, we also added the exclusion of contingent consideration adjustments (refer to footnote (2) below) and the mark-to-market impacts from equity method investment transaction derivatives contracts (refer to footnote (6) below). (2) Divestitures include completed sales of businesses (including the partial or full sale of an equity method investment) and exits of major product lines upon completion of a sale or licensing agreement. As we record our share of KDP and JDE Peet’s ongoing earnings on a one-quarter lag basis, any KDP or JDE Peet’s ownership reductions are reflected as divestitures within our non-GAAP results the following quarter. During the third quarter of 2021, we began to exclude the impact of certain adjustments made to our acquisition contingent consideration liabilities that were recorded at the date of acquisition. We made this adjustment to better facilitate comparisons of our underlying operating performance across periods. See Note 2, Acquisitions and Divestitures, and Note 7, Equity Method Investments, for information on acquisitions and divestitures impacting the comparability of our results.64Table of Contents(3) Constant currency operating results are calculated by dividing or multiplying, as appropriate, the current-period local currency operating results by the currency exchange rates used to translate the financial statements in the comparable prior-year period to determine what the current-period U.S. dollar operating results would have been if the currency exchange rate had not changed from the comparable prior-year period.(4) Non-GAAP adjustments related to the Simplify to Grow Program reflect costs incurred that relate to the objectives of our program to transform our supply chain network and organizational structure. Costs that do not meet the program objectives are not reflected in the non-GAAP adjustments.(5) During the third quarter of 2018, as we began to apply highly inflationary accounting for Argentina (refer to Note 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies), we excluded the remeasurement gains or losses related to remeasuring net monetary assets or liabilities in Argentina during the period to be consistent with our prior accounting for these remeasurement gains/losses for Venezuela when it was subject to highly inflationary accounting prior to deconsolidation in 2015. (6) We exclude unrealized gains and losses (mark-to-market impacts) from outstanding commodity and forecasted currency and equity method investment transaction derivative from our non-GAAP earnings measures. The mark-to-market impacts of commodity and forecasted currency transaction derivatives are excluded until such time that the related exposures impact our operating results. Since we purchase commodity and forecasted currency transaction contracts to mitigate price volatility primarily for inventory requirements in future periods, we make this adjustment to remove the volatility of these future inventory purchases on current operating results to facilitate comparisons of our underlying operating performance across periods. We exclude equity method investment transaction derivative contract settlements as they represent protection of value for future divestitures.(7) See Note 14, Commitments and Contingencies – Tax Matters, for additional information.(8) On November 20, 2017, Dirk Van de Put succeeded Irene Rosenfeld as CEO of Mondelēz International in advance of her retirement at the end of March 2018. In order to incent Mr. Van de Put to join us, we provided him compensation with a total combined target value of $42.5 million to make him whole for incentive awards he forfeited or grants that were not made to him when he left his former employer. The compensation we granted took the form of cash, deferred stock units, performance share units and stock options. In connection with Irene Rosenfeld’s retirement, we made her outstanding grants of performance share units for the 2016-2018 and 2017-2019 performance cycles eligible for continued vesting and approved a $0.5 million salary for her service as Chairman from January through March 2018. We refer to these elements of Mr. Van de Put’s and Ms. Rosenfeld’s compensation arrangements together as “CEO transition remuneration.” We are excluding amounts we expense as CEO transition remuneration from our non-GAAP results because those amounts are not part of our regular compensation program and are incremental to amounts we would have incurred as ongoing CEO compensation. As a result, in 2017, we excluded amounts expensed for the cash payment to Mr. Van de Put and partial vesting of his equity grants. In 2018, we excluded amounts paid for Ms. Rosenfeld’s service as Chairman and partial vesting of Mr. Van de Put’s and Ms. Rosenfeld’s equity grants. In 2019, we excluded amounts related to the partial vesting of Mr. Van de Put’s equity grants. During the first quarter of 2020, Mr. Van de Put's equity grants became fully vested.(9) The impact from pension participation changes represents the charges incurred when employee groups are withdrawn from multiemployer pension plans and other changes in employee group pension plan participation. We exclude these charges from our non–GAAP results because those amounts do not reflect our ongoing pension obligations. See Note 11, Benefit Plans, for more information on the multiemployer pension plan withdrawal.(10) We have excluded the initial impacts from enacted tax law changes. Initial impacts include items such as the remeasurement of deferred tax balances and the transition tax from the 2017 U.S. tax reform. Previously, we only excluded the initial impacts from more material tax reforms, specifically the impacts of the 2019 Swiss tax reform and 2017 U.S. tax reform. We exclude initial impacts from enacted tax law changes from our Adjusted EPS as they do not reflect our ongoing tax obligations under the enacted tax law changes. Refer to Note 16, Income Taxes, for more information on the impact of Swiss and U.S. tax reform.(11) We have excluded our proportionate share of our equity method investees’ significant operating and non-operating items such as acquisition and divestiture related costs, restructuring program costs and initial impacts from enacted tax law changes, in order to provide investors with a comparable view of our performance across periods. Although we have shareholder rights and board representation commensurate with our ownership interests in our equity method investees and review the underlying operating results and significant operating and non-operating items each reporting period, we do not have direct control over their operations or resulting revenue and expenses. Our use of equity method investment net earnings on an adjusted basis is not intended to imply that we have any such control. Our GAAP “diluted EPS attributable to Mondelēz International from continuing operations” includes all of the investees’ significant operating and non-operating items.We believe that the presentation of these non-GAAP financial measures, when considered together with our U.S. GAAP financial measures and the reconciliations to the corresponding U.S. GAAP financial measures, provides you with a more complete understanding of the factors and trends affecting our business than could be obtained absent these disclosures. Because non-GAAP financial measures vary among companies, the non-GAAP financial measures presented in this report may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies. Our use of these non-GAAP financial measures is not meant to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for any U.S. GAAP financial measures. A limitation of these non-GAAP financial measures is they exclude items detailed below that have an impact on our U.S. GAAP reported results. The best way this limitation can be addressed is by evaluating our non-GAAP financial measures in combination with our U.S. GAAP reported results and carefully evaluating the following tables that reconcile U.S. GAAP reported figures to the non-GAAP financial measures in this Form 10-K.65Table of ContentsOrganic Net Revenue:Applying the definition of “Organic Net Revenue”, the adjustments made to “net revenues” (the most comparable U.S. GAAP financial measure) were to exclude the impact of currency, acquisitions and divestitures. We believe that Organic Net Revenue reflects the underlying growth from the ongoing activities of our business and provides improved comparability of results. We also evaluate our Organic Net Revenue growth from emerging markets and developed markets, and these underlying measures are also reconciled to U.S. GAAP below.

Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk. As we operate globally, we are primarily exposed to currency exchange rate, commodity price and interest rate market risks. We monitor and manage these exposures as part of our overall risk management program. Our risk management program focuses on the unpredictability of financial markets and seeks to reduce the potentially adverse effects that the volatility of these markets may have on our operating results.During 2020, the COVID-19 pandemic and related global response significantly impacted economic activity and markets around the world. National and local governments imposed preventative or protective restrictions on travel and business operations and advised or required citizens to remain at home. Temporary closures of businesses were ordered and numerous other businesses temporarily closed voluntarily. The impact of the global pandemic and response has had a material unfavorable impact on global markets, including commodity, currency and capital markets. While some of these markets such as the U.S. and other major stock markets and certain currencies have rebounded significantly in the second and third quarters of 2020, these markets are likely to continue to remain volatile while the situation continues. An economic or credit crisis could occur and impair credit availability and our ability to raise capital when needed. A disruption in the financial markets may have a negative effect on our derivative counterparties and could impair our banking or other business partners, on whom we rely for access to capital and as counterparties for a number of our derivative contracts. We are actively working to mitigate these risks and we largely employed existing strategies that are described below to mitigate these market risks related to currency, commodity and interest rate risks.We principally utilize derivative instruments to reduce significant, unanticipated earnings fluctuations that may arise from volatility in currency exchange rates, commodity prices and interest rates. For additional information on our derivative activity and the types of derivative instruments we use to hedge our currency exchange, commodity price and interest rate exposures, see Note 10, Financial Instruments.Many of our non-U.S. subsidiaries operate in functional currencies other than the U.S. dollar. Fluctuations in currency exchange rates create volatility in our reported results as we translate the balance sheets, operating results and cash flows of these subsidiaries into the U.S. dollar for consolidated reporting purposes. The translation of non-U.S. dollar denominated balance sheets and statements of earnings of our subsidiaries into the U.S. dollar for consolidated reporting generally results in a cumulative translation adjustment to other comprehensive income within equity. A stronger U.S. dollar relative to other functional currencies adversely affects our consolidated earnings and net assets while a weaker U.S. dollar benefits our consolidated earnings and net assets. While we hedge significant forecasted currency exchange transactions as well as certain net assets of non-U.S. operations and other currency impacts, we cannot fully predict or eliminate volatility arising from changes in currency exchange rates on our consolidated financial results. See Consolidated Results of Operations and Results of Operations by Operating Segment under Discussion and Analysis of Historical Results for currency exchange effects on our financial results. Throughout our discussion and analysis of results, we isolate currency impacts and supplementally provide net revenues, operating income and diluted earnings per share on a constant currency basis. For additional information on the impact of currency policies, recent currency devaluations and highly inflationary accounting on our financial condition and results of operations, also see Note 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies – Currency Translation and Highly Inflationary Accounting.We also continually monitor the market for commodities that we use in our products. Input costs may fluctuate widely due to international demand, weather conditions, government policy and regulation and unforeseen conditions such as the current COVID-19 global pandemic. Refer to Recent Developments and Significant Items Affecting Comparability and Financial Outlook above for updates on recent supply chain, transportation, labor and other disruptions that are increasing operating costs and impacting our results. To manage input cost volatility and inflation, we enter into forward purchase agreements and other derivative financial instruments. We also pursue productivity and cost saving measures and take pricing actions when necessary to mitigate the impact of higher input costs on earnings.We regularly evaluate our variable and fixed-rate debt as well as current and expected interest rates in the markets in which we raise capital. Our primary exposures include movements in U.S. Treasury rates, corporate credit spreads, commercial paper rates as well as limited debt tied to London Interbank Offered Rates (“LIBOR”). The last publication date of LIBOR rates against various currencies by the Financial Conduct Authority in the United Kingdom was December 31, 2021, with the publication of certain USD rates being phased out after June 30, 2023. We did not have a significant impact to our financial position from the phase out of LIBOR, nor do we expect a significant impact from the remaining phase out given our current mix of variable and fixed-rate debt. We periodically use interest rate swaps and forward interest rate contracts to achieve a desired proportion of variable 71Table of Contentsversus fixed rate debt based on current and projected market conditions. For more information on our 2020 debt activity, see Note 9, Debt and Borrowing Arrangements.See Note 10, Financial Instruments, for more information on our derivative activity. Value at Risk:We use a value at risk (“VAR”) computation to estimate: 1) the potential one-day loss in the fair value of our interest rate-sensitive financial instruments; and 2) the potential one-day loss in pre-tax earnings of our currency and commodity price-sensitive derivative financial instruments. The VAR analysis was done separately for our currency exchange, fixed income and commodity risk portfolios as of each quarter end during the periods presented below. The instruments included in the VAR computation were currency exchange forwards and options for currency exchange risk, debt and swaps for interest rate risk, and commodity forwards, futures and options for commodity risk. Excluded from the computation were anticipated transactions, currency trade payables and receivables, and net investments in non-U.S. subsidiaries, which the above-mentioned instruments are intended to hedge.The VAR model assumes normal market conditions, a 95% confidence interval and a one-day holding period. A parametric delta-gamma approximation technique was used to determine the expected return distribution in interest rates, currencies and commodity prices for the purpose of calculating the fixed income, currency exchange and commodity VAR, respectively. The parameters used for estimating the expected return distributions were determined by observing interest rate, currency exchange and commodity price movements over the prior quarter for the calculation of VAR amounts at December 31, 2021 and 2020, and over each of the four prior quarters for the calculation of average VAR amounts during each year. The values of currency and commodity options do not change on a one-to-one basis with the underlying currency or commodity and were valued accordingly in the VAR computation.As of December 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020, the estimated potential one-day loss in fair value of our interest rate-sensitive instruments, primarily debt, and the estimated potential one-day loss in pre-tax earnings from our currency and commodity instruments, as calculated in the VAR model, were: Pre-Tax Earnings ImpactFair Value Impact At 12/31/21AverageHighLowAt 12/31/21AverageHighLow (in millions)Instruments sensitive to:Interest rates$135 $104 $135 $79 Foreign currency rates$11 $11 $13 $9 Commodity prices52 41 61 24 Pre-Tax Earnings ImpactFair Value Impact At 12/31/20AverageHighLowAt 12/31/20AverageHighLow (in millions)Instruments sensitive to:Interest rates$91 $142 $308 $76 Foreign currency rates$16 $20 $31 $16 Commodity prices6 25 42 6 This VAR computation is a risk analysis tool designed to statistically estimate the maximum expected daily loss, under the specified confidence interval and assuming normal market conditions, from adverse movements in interest rates, currency exchange rates and commodity prices. The computation does not represent actual losses in fair value or earnings we will incur, nor does it consider the effect of favorable changes in market rates. We cannot predict actual future movements in market rates and do not present these VAR results to be indicative of future movements in market rates or to be representative of any actual impact that future changes in market rates may have on our future financial results.72Table of Contents",2023-12-30 19:00:42.811292
1103982,MDLZ,"Mondelez International, Inc.",2023,"Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of OperationsThe following discussion and analysis contains forward-looking statements. It should be read in conjunction with the other sections of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, including the consolidated financial statements and related notes contained in Forward-Looking Statements and Item 1A, Risk Factors.Overview of Business and StrategyOur core business is making and selling chocolate, biscuits and baked snacks, with additional businesses in adjacent, locally relevant categories including gum & candy, cheese & grocery and powdered beverages around the world.We aim to be the global leader in snacking. Our strategy is to drive long-term growth by focusing on four strategic priorities: accelerating consumer-centric growth, driving operational excellence, creating a winning growth culture and scaling sustainable snacking. We believe the successful implementation of our strategic priorities and leveraging of our attractive global footprint, strong core of iconic global and local brands, marketing, sales, distribution and cost excellence capabilities, and top talent with a growth mindset, will drive consistent top- and bottom-line growth, enabling us to continue to create long-term value for our shareholders. For more detailed information on our business and strategy, refer to Item 1, Business.Recent Developments and Significant Items Affecting ComparabilityMacroeconomic environmentWe continue to observe significant market uncertainty, increasing inflationary pressures, supply constraints, exchange rate volatility as well as ongoing effects from the COVID-19 pandemic. Throughout the pandemic, we experienced an overall increase in demand and revenue growth as consumers increased their food purchases for in-home consumption in some markets, while parts of our business were negatively affected by related lockdowns and restrictions. Additionally, global supply chain, transportation and labor issues escalated and we experienced significantly higher operating costs, including higher overall raw material, transportation, labor and energy costs that have continued to rise.Our overall outlook for future snacks revenue growth remains strong; however, we anticipate ongoing volatility in response to COVID-related risks and supply chain issues, including labor and transportation constraints. We will continue to proactively manage our business in response to the evolving global economic environment and related uncertainty and business risks while also prioritizing and supporting our employees and customers. We continue to take steps to mitigate impacts to our supply chain, operations, technology and assets.War in UkraineIn February 2022, Russia began a military invasion of Ukraine. For the safety of our employees, we stopped production and closed our facilities in Ukraine; since then we have been gradually restoring operations, continuing to take steps to protect the safety of our employees and partially re-opening our two plants. We are providing all of our employees with compensation and with help in securing shelter in neighboring countries, where required and needed. We have also made cash and in-kind donations to several humanitarian aid organizations in the region.In March 2022, our two Ukrainian manufacturing facilities in Trostyanets and Vyshhorod were significantly damaged.During the remainder of 2022, the war continued through parts of Ukraine. We continue to make targeted repairs on both our plants. We relaunched our systems and implemented additional safety and security measures. In late June, we partially reopened the Vyshhorod plant and restarted limited potato chip production and in late November, we reopened the Trostyanets plant and restarted limited chocolate production. See Note 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies - War in Ukraine, to the condensed consolidated financial statements, and refer to Items Affecting Comparability of Financial Results for additional information.As a food company, we continue to work to support the continuity of food supply and provide packaged foods to consumers. We have suspended new capital investments and our advertising spending in Russia, but as a food company with more than 2,500 employees in the country, we have not ceased operations given we believe we play a role in the continuity of the food supply. We are complying and will comply with applicable international sanctions 30Table of Contentsand other measures that have been or may be imposed on Russian entities. We continue to evaluate the situation in Ukraine and Russia and our ability to control our operating activities and businesses on an ongoing basis, and we continue to consolidate both our Ukrainian and Russian subsidiaries. Prior to the onset of the war, Ukraine generated 0.5% and Russia generated 2.9% of 2021 consolidated net revenues and in 2022, Ukraine generated 0.3% and Russia generated 4.0% of consolidated net revenue. Our Russian business has grown as a result of the recent strengthening of the Russian ruble versus the U.S. dollar, underlying trends of consumers toward snack and packaged food categories and increased price. The combination of pricing, volume growth, suspension of advertising and ruble strength has resulted in a significant increase in the profitability of the Russian business and contributed to the growth of our consolidated performance. Our decision to suspend new capital investments in Russia has not had a material impact on our ability to meet demand within our Russian business during 2022. We believe the war in Ukraine has had a negative impact on our business throughout the rest of our Europe operating segment, but the impact of this is difficult to quantify. We cannot predict if the recent strength in our Russian business will continue in the future. We provide more information on risks related to the war in Ukraine in our Financial Outlook and Commodity Trends section, Item 3, Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk, and under Item 1A, Risk Factors.Acquisitions and DivestituresDuring 2022, we completed the following acquisitions to strategically complement and expand our existing portfolio:•Ricolino, a confectionery business with products sold primarily in Mexico•Clif Bar & Company (“Clif Bar”), a leading U.S. maker of nutritious energy bars with organic ingredients•Chipita Global S.A. (""Chipita""), a high-growth leader in the central and Eastern European croissant and baked snacks categoryAdditionally in 2022, we announced our intention to divest our developed market gum and global Halls candy businesses and in Q4 2022, we announced an agreement to sell the developed market gum business with an anticipated closing of Q4 2023, subject to relevant antitrust approvals and closing conditions.Refer to Note 2, Acquisitions and Divestitures, and Liquidity and Capital Resources for additional details.Equity Method Investment TransactionsJDE Peet’s Transactions In 2022, we sold approximately 18.6 million of our shares back to JDE Peet’s, which reduced our ownership interest by approximately 3% to 19.8%. We recorded a loss of €8 million ($8 million). In 2021, we issued €300 million exchangeable bonds. If all bonds were redeemed in exchange for shares, this would represent approximately 8.5 million shares or approximately 9% of our equity interest in JDE Peet's. In 2020, we exchanged our 26.4% ownership interest in JDE for a 26.5% equity interest in JDE Peet’s, which was then taken public. During the initial public offering, we sold approximately 11.1 million shares, recording a pre-tax gain of $131 million and a $250 million tax expense and reducing our ownership interest to 22.9%.Keurig Dr Pepper Transactions:In 2021, we sold approximately 42.7 million shares, which reduced our ownership interest by 3.0% to 5.3%. We recorded a pre-tax gain of $768 million (or $581 million after-tax). In 2020, we sold approximately 73.4 million shares, which reduced our ownership interest by 5.2% to 8.4%. We recorded a pre-tax gain of $865 million (or $662 million after-tax).For additional information, refer to Note 7, Equity Method Investments and Note 10, Financial Instruments.Highly Inflationary AccountingTürkiye. During the first quarter of 2022, we concluded that Türkiye became a highly inflationary economy for accounting purposes. As of April 1, 2022, we began to apply highly inflationary accounting for our subsidiaries operating in Türkiye.See Note 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies – Currency Translation and Highly Inflationary Accounting for additional details.31Table of ContentsU.K. advertising and promotion banIn the United Kingdom, a ban on specific types of TV and online advertising of food containing levels of fat, sugar or salt above specified thresholds is expected to go into effect in October 2025, and new measures restricting certain promotions are expected to go into effect in October 2023. Restrictions on in-store placement of some of those products went into effect in October 2022. Although we are unable to estimate precisely the impact of the restrictions, they did not have a significant impact on our consolidated financial statements in 2022.TaxesWe continue to monitor existing and potential future tax reform around the world. On August 16, 2022, the U.S. enacted the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022, which, among other things, implements a 15% minimum tax on book income of certain large corporations, a 1% excise tax on net stock repurchases and several tax incentives to promote clean energy. Based on our initial analysis of the provisions, we expect to meet the criteria of a large corporation but we do not believe this legislation will have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements. We will continue to evaluate it as additional guidance and clarification becomes available. We also continue to monitor countries’ progress toward enactment of the Organization of Economic Cooperation and Development’s model rules on a global minimum tax. During December 2022, the European Union reached agreement on the introduction of a minimum tax directive requiring each member state to enact local legislation. Additionally, South Korea became the first country to enact minimum tax rules, which will be effective for fiscal years beginning on or after January 1, 2024. These specific actions did not impact our consolidated financial statements in 2022 but future enacted legislation in this area could have a material effect on us, if enacted.Summary of Results •Net revenues were approximately $31.5 billion in 2022 and $28.7 billion in 2021, an increase of 9.7% in 2022 and an increase of 8.0% in 2021. In both 2022 and 2021, our net revenue growth continued to reflect increased demand for most of our snack category products in both our emerging and developed markets. –Net revenues increased in 2022, driven by higher net pricing, incremental net revenues from our acquisitions of Chipita, Clif Bar and Ricolino in 2022 and Gourmet Foods and Grenade in 2021 and favorable volume/mix, partially offset by a significant impact from unfavorable currency translation, as the U.S. dollar strengthened relative to most currencies we operate in compared to exchange rates in the prior year and the impact of divestitures.–Net revenues increased in 2021, driven by favorable volume/mix, higher net pricing, a significant impact from favorable currency translation, as most currencies we operate in strengthened against the U.S. dollar compared to exchange rates in the prior year, and incremental net revenues from our acquisitions of Gourmet Foods, Grenade and Hu in 2021 and Give & Go in 2020. •Organic Net Revenue increased 12.3% to $32.2 billion in 2022 and increased 5.1% to $27.9 billion in 2021. Organic Net Revenue increased in both 2022 and 2021 due to higher net pricing and favorable volume/mix. Organic Net Revenue is on a constant currency basis and excludes revenue from acquisitions and divestitures. We use Organic Net Revenue as it provides improved year-over-year comparability of our underlying operating results (see the definition of Organic Net Revenue and our reconciliation with net revenues within Non-GAAP Financial Measures appearing later in this section).•Diluted EPS attributable to Mondelēz International decreased 35.5% to $1.96 in 2022 and increased 23.1% to $3.04 in 2021. –Diluted EPS decreased in 2022 driven by lapping prior-year net gains on equity method transactions, unfavorable year-over-year mark-to-market impacts from currency and commodity derivatives, the impact from the European Commission legal matter, higher acquisition-related costs, incremental costs incurred due to the war in Ukraine, higher acquisition integration costs and contingent consideration adjustments, higher intangible asset impairment charges, lower net earnings from divestitures, higher remeasurement loss of net monetary position and inventory step-up charges incurred in 2022, partially offset by an increase in Adjusted EPS, lower Simplify to Grow program costs, lower negative impacts from enacted tax law changes, lower equity method investee items, 2017 malware incident net recoveries and lower negative impact from pension participation changes. –Diluted EPS increased in 2021 driven by an increase in Adjusted EPS, lapping prior-year costs associated with the JDE Peet’s transaction, favorable year-over-year mark-to-market impacts from currency and commodity derivatives, lower intangible asset impairment charges, lapping the prior-32Table of Contentsyear loss on interest rate swaps, lower losses on debt extinguishment and related expenses, lower Simplify to Grow program costs and a net benefit from acquisition integration costs and contingent consideration adjustments. These factors were partially offset by a lower gain on equity method investment transactions, higher initial impacts from enacted tax law changes, lower net earnings from divestitures, lapping the prior-year benefit from the resolution of tax matters and higher impact from pension participation changes.–Adjusted EPS increased 3.5% to $2.95 in 2022 and increased 12.2% to $2.85 in 2021. On a constant currency basis, Adjusted EPS increased 11.9% to $3.19 in 2022 and increased 8.7% to $2.76 in 2021. –Adjusted EPS increased in 2022, driven by operating gains and fewer shares outstanding, partially offset by unfavorable currency translation, higher interest expense and lower equity method investment earnings.–Adjusted EPS increased in 2021, driven by operating gains, favorable currency translation, fewer shares outstanding, higher equity method investment earnings and lower interest expense, partially offset by higher taxes primarily due to a lower net benefit from non-recurring discrete tax items.Adjusted EPS and Adjusted EPS on a constant currency basis are non-GAAP financial measures. We use these measures as they provide improved year-over-year comparability of our underlying results (see the definition of Adjusted EPS and our reconciliation with diluted EPS within Non-GAAP Financial Measures appearing later in this section).Financial OutlookWe seek to achieve profitable, long-term growth and manage our business to attain this goal using our key operating metrics: Organic Net Revenue, Adjusted Operating Income and Adjusted EPS. We use these non-GAAP financial metrics and related computations, particularly growth in profit dollars, to evaluate and manage our business and to plan and make near- and long-term operating and strategic decisions. As such, we believe these metrics are useful to investors as they provide supplemental information in addition to our U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (“U.S. GAAP”) financial results. We believe it is useful to provide investors with the same financial information that we use internally to make comparisons of our historical operating results, identify trends in our underlying operating results and evaluate our business. We believe our non-GAAP financial measures should always be considered in relation to our GAAP results. We have provided reconciliations between our GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures in Non-GAAP Financial Measures, which appears later in this section.In addition to monitoring our key operating metrics, we monitor a number of developments and trends that could impact our revenue and profitability objectives:Demand – We monitor consumer spending and our market share within the food and beverage categories in which we sell our products. Core snacks categories continued to expand due to the continued growth of snacking as a consumer behavior around the world. As part of our strategic plan, we seek to drive category growth by leveraging our local and consumer-focused commercial approach, making investments in our brand and snacks portfolio, building strong routes to market in both emerging and developed markets and improving our availability across multiple channels. We believe these actions will help drive demand in our categories and strengthen our positions across markets.Long-Term Demographics and Consumer Trends – Snack food consumption is highly correlated to GDP growth, urbanization of populations and rising discretionary income levels associated with a growing middle class, particularly in emerging markets. We believe that snacks continue to be a source of comfort as well as excitement and variety for consumers. Social media increasingly helps consumers find food trends, inspiration and connection on their social media and other feeds. Consumers are also interested in buying snacks conveniently, whether through same-day delivery apps, shipped sources or different retail settings. Many consumers also continue to prioritize sustainability in their purchase decisions, valuing sustainably sourced ingredients, low carbon footprint preparation and lower waste packaging. We seek to continue to offer snacks that meet consumer needs and preferences and align with our strategic priorities.Pricing – Our net revenue growth and profitability may be affected as we adjust prices to address new conditions, such as increasing input and operating costs due to supply, transportation and labor constraints and higher cost trends. We adjust our product prices based on a number of variables including market factors, transportation, logistics and changes in our product input costs, and we have increased prices to control costs given recent significant cost inflation.33Table of ContentsOperating Costs – Our operating costs include raw materials, labor, selling, general and administrative expenses, taxes, currency impacts and financing costs. We manage these costs through cost saving and productivity initiatives, sourcing and hedging programs, pricing actions, refinancing and tax planning. To remain competitive on our operating structure, we continue to work on programs to expand our profitability, such as our Simplify to Grow Program, which is designed to bring about significant reductions in our operating cost structure in both our supply chain and overhead costs. We experienced significantly higher operating costs, including higher overall raw material, transportation, labor and fuel costs that have continued to rise.34Table of ContentsDiscussion and Analysis of Historical ResultsItems Affecting Comparability of Financial ResultsThe following table includes significant income or (expense) items that affected the comparability of our results of operations and our effective tax rates.

Developed markets net revenues increased 3.9% and developed markets Organic Net Revenue increased 7.0%. Emerging markets net revenues increased 20.3% and emerging markets Organic Net Revenue increased 22.0%.

Overall, we continued to see increased demand for our snack category products. Organic Net Revenue growth was driven by higher net pricing and favorable volume/mix. Higher net pricing in all regions was due to the benefit of carryover pricing from 2021 as well as the effects of input cost-driven pricing actions taken during 2022. Favorable volume/mix was driven by AMEA, Latin America and North America, primarily due to strong volume gains across our snack category products, while volume/mix was essentially flat in Europe. The November 1, 2022 acquisition of Ricolino added incremental net revenues of $98 million (constant currency basis), the August 1, 2022 acquisition of Clif Bar added incremental net revenues of $361 million, the January 3, 2022 acquisition of Chipita added incremental net revenues of $720 million (constant currency basis), the April 1, 2021 acquisition of Gourmet Food added incremental net revenues of $15 million (constant currency basis) and the March 25, 2021 acquisition of Grenade added incremental net revenues of $22 million (constant currency basis). Unfavorable currency impacts decreased net revenues by $1,905 million, primarily due to the strength of the U.S. dollar relative to most currencies, including the euro, British pound sterling, Argentinean peso, Turkish lira, Australian dollar, Indian rupee, Polish zloty, Chinese yuan and Swedish krona, partially offset by the strength of a few currencies relative to the U.S. dollar, primarily the Russian ruble, Brazilian real and Mexican peso. The impact of divestitures resulted in a year-over-year reduction in net revenues of $56 million. Refer to Note 2, Acquisitions and Divestitures, for more information.36Table of ContentsOperating Income – Operating income decreased $1,119 million (24.0%) to $3,534 million in 2022, Adjusted Operating Income (1) increased $264 million (5.5%) to $5,029 million and Adjusted Operating Income on a constant currency basis increased $583 million (12.2%) to $5,348 million due to the following:OperatingIncomeChange (in millions) Operating Income for the Year Ended December 31, 2021$4,653 Simplify to Grow Program (2)319 Intangible asset impairment charges (3)32 Mark-to-market gains from derivatives (4)(279)Acquisition integration costs and contingent consideration adjustments (5)(40)Acquisition-related costs (5)25 Net gain on acquisition and divestitures (5)(8)Divestiture-related costs (5)22 Operating income from divestiture (5)(15)Remeasurement of net monetary position (6)13 Impact from pension participation changes (7)48 Impact from resolution of tax matters (8)(5)Adjusted Operating Income (1) for the Year Ended December 31, 2021$4,765 Higher net pricing2,754 Higher input costs(1,931)Favorable volume/mix218 Higher selling, general and administrative expenses(474)Lower amortization of intangible assets8 Impact from acquisitions (5)56 Fixed asset and other impairment charges(48)Total change in Adjusted Operating Income (constant currency) (1)583 12.2 % Unfavorable currency translation(319)Total change in Adjusted Operating Income (1)264 5.5 %Adjusted Operating Income (1) for the Year Ended December 31, 2022$5,029 Simplify to Grow Program (2)(122)Intangible asset impairment charges (3)(101)Mark-to-market losses from derivatives (4)(326)Acquisition integration costs and contingent consideration adjustments (5)(136)Inventory step-up (5)(25)Acquisition-related costs (5)(330)Divestiture-related costs (5)(18)Operating income from divestiture (5)4 2017 Malware incident net recoveries37 European Commission legal matter (8)(318)Incremental costs due to war in Ukraine (9)(121)Remeasurement of net monetary position (6)(40)Impact from pension participation changes (7)1 Operating Income for the Year Ended December 31, 2022$3,534 (24.0)%(1)Refer to the Non-GAAP Financial Measures section at the end of this item.(2)Refer to Note 8, Restructuring Program, for more information.(3)Refer to Note 6, Goodwill and Intangible Assets, for more information.(4)Refer to Note 10, Financial Instruments, Note 18, Segment Reporting, and Non-GAAP Financial Measures at the end of this item for more information on the unrealized gains/losses on commodity and forecasted currency transaction derivatives.(5)Refer to Note 2, Acquisitions and Divestitures, for more information on the November 1, 2022 acquisition of Ricolino, August 1, 2022 acquisition of Clif Bar, January 3, 2022 acquisition of Chipita, April 1, 2021 acquisition of Gourmet Food, March 25, 2021 acquisition of a 37Table of Contentsmajority interest in Grenade, January 4, 2021 acquisition of the remaining 93% of equity in Hu and April 1, 2020 acquisition of a significant majority interest in Give & Go.(6)Refer to Note 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies – Currency Translation and Highly Inflationary Accounting, for information on our application of highly inflationary accounting for Argentina and Türkiye.(7)Refer to Note 11, Benefit Plans, for more information.(8)Refer to Note 14, Commitments and Contingencies – Tax Matters, for more information.(9)Refer to Note 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies – War in Ukraine, for more information.During 2022, we realized higher net pricing and favorable volume/mix, which was largely offset by increased input costs. Higher net pricing, which included the carryover impact of pricing actions taken in 2021 as well as the effects of input cost-driven pricing actions taken during 2022, was reflected in all regions. Overall, volume/mix benefited from strong volume growth due to continued increased demand for our snack category products. Favorable volume/mix was driven by AMEA and Latin America, which was slightly offset by unfavorable volume/mix in North America and Europe. The increase in input costs was driven by higher raw material costs as well as higher manufacturing costs. Higher raw material costs were in part due to higher dairy, packaging, edible oils, energy, grains, sugar, nuts and other ingredients costs as well as unfavorable year-over-year currency exchange transaction costs on imported materials, partially offset by lower cocoa costs. Total selling, general and administrative expenses increased $1,121 million from 2021, due to a number of factors noted in the table above, including in part, the impact from the European Commission legal matter, the impact of acquisitions, higher acquisition-related costs, higher acquisition integration costs and contingent consideration adjustments, higher remeasurement loss of net monetary position, higher divestiture-related costs, incremental costs due to the war in Ukraine and lapping the prior-year favorable impact from the resolution of a tax matter, which were partially offset by a favorable currency impact related to expenses, lapping the prior-year unfavorable impact from pension participation changes, incremental expenses associated with the 2017 malware incident net recoveries and lower implementation costs incurred for the Simplify to Grow Program. Excluding these factors, selling, general and administrative expenses increased $474 million from 2021. The increase was driven primarily by higher overheads, in part due to increased investments in route-to-market capabilities, and higher advertising and consumer promotion costs. Unfavorable currency changes decreased operating income by $319 million primarily due to the strength of the U.S. dollar relative to most currencies, including the euro, British pound sterling, Turkish lira, Australian dollar, Indian rupee, Polish zloty, Egyptian pound and Chinese yuan, partially offset by the strength of a few currencies relative to the U.S. dollar, including the Russian ruble and Brazilian real.Operating income margin decreased from 16.2% in 2021 to 11.2% in 2022. The decrease in operating income margin was driven primarily by the year-over-year unfavorable change in mark-to-market gains/(losses) from currency and commodity hedging activities, the impact from the European Commission legal matter, higher acquisition-related costs, higher acquisition integration costs and contingent consideration adjustments, lower Adjusted Operating Income margin, incremental costs due to the war in Ukraine, higher intangible asset impairment charges, higher remeasurement of net monetary position and inventory step-up charges incurred in 2022, partially offset by lower costs for the Simplify to Grow Program, lapping the prior-year unfavorable impact from pension participation changes, lower divestiture-related costs and the impact of 2017 malware incident net recoveries. Adjusted Operating Income margin decreased from 16.6% in 2021 to 16.0% in 2022. The decrease was driven primarily by higher raw material costs, unfavorable product mix and the impact of acquisitions, partially offset by higher net pricing and overhead cost leverage.38Table of ContentsNet Earnings and Earnings per Share Attributable to Mondelēz International – Net earnings attributable to Mondelēz International of $2,717 million decreased by $1,583 million (36.8%) in 2022.

Overall, we continued to see increased demand for our snack category products, though parts of our business were not yet back to pre-pandemic levels. In developed markets, increased food purchases for in-home consumption continued to drive net revenue growth, partially offset by declines in some markets as they lapped strong volume growth in 2020 resulting from increased consumer demand due to the pandemic. In emerging markets, we lapped the negative initial impacts we experienced from the pandemic in 2020, with strong revenue growth in 2021 across most of our key markets, though some markets remained challenged. In addition, sales of our gum and candy products grew as out-of-home consumption continued to recover, as did our world travel business as global travel improved, though still below pre-pandemic levels. Favorable currency translation and incremental net revenues from acquisitions also added to revenue growth in 2021.Organic Net Revenue growth was driven by favorable volume/mix and higher net pricing. Favorable volume/mix in Europe, AMEA and Latin America was primarily driven by strong volume gains as we lapped the significant negative impacts of the pandemic in many of our key markets. This was partially offset by unfavorable volume/mix in North America as the region lapped very strong prior-year volume growth from significant food purchases for in-home consumption due to the pandemic. Higher net pricing in all regions was due to the benefit of carryover pricing from 2020 as well as the effects of input cost-driven pricing actions taken during 2021. Favorable currency impacts increased net revenues by $472 million, primarily due to the strength of several currencies relative to the U.S. dollar, including the euro, British pound sterling, Chinese yuan, Australian dollar, Canadian dollar, South African rand and Mexican peso, partially offset by the strength of the U.S. dollar relative to several currencies, including the Argentinean peso, Brazilian real and Turkish lira. The April 1, 2021 acquisition of Gourmet Food added incremental net revenues of $47 million (constant currency basis), the March 25, 2021 acquisition of Grenade added 41Table of Contentsincremental net revenues of $63 million (constant currency basis), the January 4, 2021 acquisition of Hu added incremental net revenues of $38 million and the April 1, 2020 acquisition of Give & Go added incremental net revenues of $106 million in 2021. The packaged seafood business, which was part of our April 1, 2021 acquisition of Gourmet Food but divested on November 1, 2021, added incremental net revenues of $35 million prior to its divestiture. In addition, businesses divested in 2022 and 2021 added incremental revenues of $46 million in 2021.

Higher net pricing, which included the carryover impact of pricing actions taken in 2020 as well as the effects of input cost-driven pricing actions taken during 2021, was reflected in all regions. Favorable volume/mix was driven by Europe, AMEA and Latin America, which was partially offset by unfavorable volume/mix in North America. Overall, volume/mix benefited from volume gains as we lapped the significant negative impacts of the pandemic in many of our key markets, while in North America, we lapped high volume growth in 2020 from significant food purchases for in-home consumption due to the pandemic. The increase in input costs was driven by higher raw material costs, partially offset by lower manufacturing costs driven by productivity and lower year-over-year incremental COVID-19 related costs. Higher raw material costs were in part due to higher foreign currency transaction costs on imported materials, as well as increased costs for edible oils, packaging, sugar, cocoa, grains, dairy and other ingredients. Total selling, general and administrative expenses increased $165 million from 2020, due to a number of factors noted in the table above, including in part, an unfavorable currency impact related to expenses, incremental expenses from acquisitions, the impact from pension participation changes, lower benefits from the resolution of tax matters and higher acquisition-related costs, which were partially offset by lower implementation costs incurred for the Simplify to Grow Program, lapping prior-year costs associated with the JDE Peet's transaction and a net benefit from acquisition integration costs and contingent consideration adjustments. Excluding these factors, selling, general and administrative expenses increased $134 million from 2020. The increase was driven primarily by higher advertising and consumer promotion costs, partially offset by lower overhead spending including lower year-over-year incremental COVID-19 related costs. Favorable currency changes increased operating income by $120 million, primarily due to the strength of several currencies relative to the U.S. dollar, including the British pound sterling, euro, Chinese yuan. Australian dollar and Canadian dollar, partially offset by the strength of the U.S. dollar relative to several currencies, including the Argentinean peso, Brazilian real and Turkish lira.Operating income margin increased from 14.5% in 2020 to 16.2% in 2021. The increase in operating income margin was driven primarily by the favorable year-over-year change in mark-to-market gains/(losses) from currency and commodity hedging activities, lower intangible asset impairment charges, lower Simplify to Grow program costs, a net benefit from acquisition integration costs and contingent consideration adjustments and lapping prior-year costs associated with the JDE Peet's transaction, partially offset by the impact from pension participation changes, higher divestiture-related costs and higher acquisition-related costs. Adjusted Operating Income margin for 2021 was flat to 2020 at 16.6%. Adjusted Operating Income margin was unchanged as higher net pricing, lower manufacturing costs due to productivity and lower year-over-year incremental COVID-19 costs, and lower selling, general and administrative costs were offset by higher raw material costs, unfavorable product mix and higher advertising and consumer promotion costs.43Table of ContentsNet Earnings and Earnings per Share Attributable to Mondelēz International – Net earnings attributable to Mondelēz International of $4,300 million increased by $745 million (21.0%) in 2021.

Higher net pricing was reflected across all categories, driven primarily by Argentina, Brazil and Mexico. Favorable volume/mix reflected strong volume growth as the region continued to see increased demand for our snack category products. Favorable volume/mix was driven by gains in gum, biscuits & baked snacks, chocolate, candy and cheese & grocery, partially offset by a decline in refreshment beverages. The November 1, 2022 acquisition of Ricolino added incremental net revenues of $98 million (constant currency basis) in 2022. Unfavorable currency impacts were primarily due to the strength of the U.S. dollar relative to several currencies in the region, primarily the Argentinean peso, partially offset by the strength of several currencies relative to the U.S. dollar, primarily the Brazilian real and Mexican peso. The impact of divestitures resulted in a year-over-year decline in net revenues of $21 million.Segment operating income increased $127 million (48.7%), primarily due to higher net pricing, favorable volume/mix, lower manufacturing costs due to productivity, lower divestiture-related costs and lower costs incurred for the Simplify to Grow Program. These favorable items were partially offset by higher raw material costs, higher other selling, general and administrative expenses, higher advertising and consumer promotion costs, higher remeasurement loss on net monetary position, acquisition integration costs incurred in 2022, the impact of divestitures, inventory step-up charges incurred in 2022 and lapping a prior-year favorable impact from the resolution of a tax matter.2021 compared with 2020:Net revenues increased $320 million (12.9%), due to higher net pricing (13.7 pp), favorable volume/mix (6.1 pp) and the impact of divestitures (0.3 pp), partially offset by unfavorable currency (7.2 pp).

The preparation of these financial statements requires the use of estimates, judgments and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the periods presented. Actual results could differ from those estimates and assumptions. Note 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, to the consolidated financial statements includes a summary of the significant accounting policies we used to prepare our consolidated financial statements. We have discussed the selection and disclosure of our critical accounting policies and estimates with our Audit Committee. The following is a review of our most significant assumptions and estimates.Goodwill and Indefinite-Life Intangible Assets:We test goodwill and indefinite-life intangible assets for impairment on an annual basis on July 1. We assess goodwill impairment risk throughout the year by performing a qualitative review of entity-specific, industry, market and general economic factors affecting our goodwill reporting units. We review our operating segment and reporting unit structure for goodwill testing annually or as significant changes in the organization occur. Annually, we may perform qualitative testing, or depending on factors such as prior-year test results, current year developments, current risk evaluations and other practical considerations, we may elect to do quantitative testing instead. In our quantitative testing, we compare a reporting unit’s estimated fair value with its carrying value. We estimate a reporting unit’s fair value using a discounted cash flow method which incorporates planned growth rates, market-based discount rates and estimates of residual value. This year, for our Europe and North America reporting units, we used a market-based, weighted-average cost of capital of 6.8% to discount the projected cash flows of those operations. For our Latin America and AMEA reporting units, we used a risk-rated discount rate of 9.8%. Estimating the fair value of individual reporting units requires us to make assumptions and estimates regarding our future plans and industry and economic conditions based on available information. Given the uncertainty of the global economic environment, those estimates could be significantly different than future performance. If the carrying value of a reporting unit’s net assets exceeds its fair value, we would recognize an impairment charge for the amount by which the carrying value exceeds the reporting unit's fair value.In 2022, 2021 and 2020, there were no impairments of goodwill. In connection with our 2022 annual impairment testing, each of our reporting units had sufficient fair value in excess of carrying value. While all reporting units passed our annual impairment testing, if planned business performance expectations are not met or specific valuation factors outside of our control, such as discount rates, change significantly, then the estimated fair values of a reporting unit or reporting units might decline and lead to a goodwill impairment in the future.Annually, we assess indefinite-life intangible assets for impairment by performing a qualitative review and assessing events and circumstances that could affect the fair value or carrying value of these assets. If significant potential impairment risk exists for a specific asset, we quantitatively test it for impairment by comparing its estimated fair value with its carrying value. We utilize estimates of future sales, earnings growth rates, royalty rates and discount rates in determining a brand’s global fair value. If the carrying value of the asset exceeds its estimated fair value, the asset is impaired and its carrying value is reduced to the estimated fair value.In 2022, we recorded $101 million of intangible asset impairment charges related to two biscuit brands in AMEA. The impairment charges were calculated as the excess of the carrying value over the estimated fair value of the intangible assets on a global basis and were recorded within asset impairment and exit costs. We use several accepted valuation methods, including Relief from Royalty, excess earnings and excess margin, that utilize estimates of future sales, earnings growth rates, royalty rates and discount rates in determining a brand's global fair value. We also identified eight brands with $1.5 billion of aggregate book value as of December 31, 2022 that each had a fair value in excess of book value of 10% or less. We believe our current plans for each of these brands reduce the risk of impairment in future periods, but if the brand earnings expectations are not met or specific valuation factors outside of our control, such as discount rates, change significantly, then a brand or brands could become impaired in the future. In 2021, we recorded a $32 million of intangible asset impairment charge related to one biscuit brand in North America. In 2020, we recorded $144 million of intangible asset impairment charges related to gum, chocolate, biscuits and candy brands, with $83 million in North America, $53 million in Europe, $5 million in AMEA and $3 million in Latin America. Refer to Note 6, Goodwill and Intangible Assets, for additional information.51Table of ContentsBusiness Combinations:The assets acquired and liabilities assumed upon the acquisition or consolidation of a business are recorded at fair value, with the residual of the purchase price allocated to goodwill. We engage third-party valuation specialists to assist management in determining the fair values of certain assets acquired and liabilities assumed. In determining fair value, we utilized various forms of the income approach, depending on the asset being valued. Such valuations require management to make significant judgments, estimates and assumptions, especially with respect to intangible assets. Management makes estimates of fair value based upon the best information available at the date of acquisition. These estimates are based upon historical experience and information obtained from the management of the acquired company and are inherently uncertain. Critical estimates in valuing certain of the intangible assets include, but are not limited to: expected future cash flows of the acquired business, discount and royalty rates and economic lives of customer relationships, trade names and fixed assets. Unanticipated events and circumstances may occur, which may affect the accuracy or validity of such assumptions or estimates.Further, certain of our acquisitions may include earn-out provisions or other forms of contingent consideration. As of the acquisition date, we record contingent consideration, as applicable, at the estimated fair value of expected future payments associated with the earn-out. Any changes to the recorded fair value of contingent consideration will be recognized as expenses or earnings in the period in which they occur. Such contingent consideration liabilities are based on best estimates of future expected payment obligations, which are subject to change due to many factors outside of our control. Changes to the estimate of expected future contingent consideration payments may occur, from time to time, due to various reasons, including changing discount rates as well as actual results differing from estimates and adjustments to the revenue or earnings assumptions used as the basis for the liability based on historical experience. Trade and Marketing Programs:We promote our products with trade and sales incentives as well as marketing and advertising programs. These programs include, but are not limited to, new product introduction fees, discounts, coupons, rebates and volume-based incentives as well as cooperative advertising, in-store displays and consumer marketing promotions. Trade and sales incentives are recorded as a reduction to revenues based on amounts estimated due to customers and consumers at the end of a period. We base these estimates principally on historical utilization and redemption rates. For interim reporting purposes, advertising and consumer promotion expenses are charged to operations as a percentage of volume, based on estimated sales volume and estimated program spending. We do not defer costs on our year-end consolidated balance sheets and all marketing and advertising costs are recorded as an expense in the year incurred.Employee Benefit Plans:We sponsor various employee benefit plans throughout the world. These include primarily pension plans and postretirement healthcare benefits. For accounting purposes, we estimate the pension and postretirement healthcare benefit obligations utilizing assumptions and estimates for discount rates; expected returns on plan assets; expected compensation increases; employee-related factors such as turnover, retirement age and mortality; and health care cost trends. We review our actuarial assumptions on an annual basis and make modifications to the assumptions based on current rates and trends when appropriate. Our assumptions also reflect our historical experiences and management’s best judgment regarding future expectations. These and other assumptions affect the annual expense and obligations recognized for the underlying plans.As permitted by U.S. GAAP, we generally amortize the effect of changes in the assumptions over future periods. The cost or benefit of plan changes, such as increasing or decreasing benefits for prior employee service (prior service cost), is deferred and included in expense on a straight-line basis over the average remaining service period of the employees expected to receive benefits.Since pension and postretirement liabilities are measured on a discounted basis, the discount rate significantly affects our plan obligations and expenses. For plans that have assets held in trust, the expected return on plan assets assumption affects our pension plan expenses. The assumptions for discount rates and expected rates of return and our process for setting these assumptions are described in Note 11, Benefit Plans, to the consolidated financial statements.52Table of ContentsWhile we do not anticipate further changes in the 2022 assumptions for our U.S. and non-U.S. pension and postretirement health care plans, as a sensitivity measure, a fifty-basis point change in our discount rates or the expected rate of return on plan assets would have the following effects, increase/(decrease), on our annual benefit plan costs: As of December 31, 2022 U.S. PlansNon-U.S. PlansFifty-Basis-PointFifty-Basis-Point IncreaseDecreaseIncreaseDecrease (in millions)Effect of change in discount rate on pension costs$(4)$2 $(12)$18 Effect of change in expected rate of return on plan assets on pension costs(8)8 (36)36 Effect of change in discount rate on postretirement health care costs— (1)— — See additional information on our employee benefit plans in Note 11, Benefit Plans.Income Taxes:As a global company, we calculate and provide for income taxes in each tax jurisdiction in which we operate. The provision for income taxes includes the amounts payable or refundable for the current year, the effect of deferred taxes and impacts from uncertain tax positions. Our provision for income taxes is significantly affected by shifts in the geographic mix of our pre-tax earnings across tax jurisdictions, changes in tax laws and regulations, tax planning opportunities available in each tax jurisdiction and the ultimate outcome of various tax audits.Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between the financial statement and tax bases of our assets and liabilities and for operating losses and tax credit carryforwards. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates that will apply to taxable income in the years in which those differences are expected to be recovered or settled. Valuation allowances are established for deferred tax assets when it is more likely than not that a tax benefit will not be realized.We believe our tax positions comply with applicable tax laws and that we have properly accounted for uncertain tax positions. We recognize tax benefits in our financial statements from uncertain tax positions only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained by the taxing authorities based on the technical merits of the position. The amount we recognize is measured as the largest amount of benefit that is greater than 50 percent likely of being realized upon resolution. We evaluate uncertain tax positions on an ongoing basis and adjust the amount recognized in light of changing facts and circumstances, such as the progress of a tax audit or expiration of a statute of limitations. We believe the estimates and assumptions used to support our evaluation of uncertain tax positions are reasonable. However, final determination of historical tax liabilities, whether by settlement with tax authorities, judicial or administrative ruling or due to expiration of statutes of limitations, could be materially different from estimates reflected on our consolidated balance sheets and historical income tax provisions. The outcome of these final determinations could have a material effect on our provision for income taxes, net earnings or cash flows in the period in which the determination is made.See Note 16, Income Taxes, for additional information on our effective tax rate, current and deferred taxes, valuation allowances and unrecognized tax benefits.Contingencies:See Note 14, Commitments and Contingencies, to the consolidated financial statements.New Accounting Guidance:See Note 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, to the consolidated financial statements for a discussion of new accounting standards.53Table of ContentsLiquidity and Capital Resources We believe that cash from operations, our revolving credit facilities, short-term borrowings and our authorized long-term financing will continue to provide sufficient liquidity for our working capital needs, planned capital expenditures and future payments of our contractual, tax and benefit plan obligations and payments for acquisitions, share repurchases and quarterly dividends. We expect to continue to utilize our commercial paper program and international credit lines as needed. We continually evaluate long-term debt issuances to meet our short- and longer-term funding requirements. We also use intercompany loans with our international subsidiaries to improve financial flexibility. Our investments in JDE Peet's and KDP also provide us additional flexibility. Overall, we do not expect negative effects to our funding sources that would have a material effect on our liquidity, and we continue to monitor our operations in Europe and related effects from the war in Ukraine. To date, we have been successful in generating cash and raising financing as needed. However, if a serious economic or credit market crisis ensues or other adverse developments arise, it could have a material adverse effect on our liquidity, results of operations and financial condition.Our most significant ongoing short-term cash requirements relate primarily to funding operations (including expenditures for raw materials, labor, manufacturing and distribution, trade and promotions, advertising and marketing, tax liabilities, benefit plan obligations and lease expenses) as well as periodic expenditures for acquisitions, shareholder returns (such as dividend payments and share repurchases), property, plant and equipment and any significant one-time non-operating items. Long-term cash requirements primarily relate to funding long-term debt repayments (refer to Note 9, Debt and Borrowing Arrangements), our U.S. tax reform transition tax liability and deferred taxes (refer to Note 16, Income Taxes), our long-term benefit plan obligations (refer to Note 11, Benefit Plans) and commodity-related purchase commitments and derivative contracts (refer to Note 10, Financial Instruments). We generally fund short- and long-term cash requirements with cash from operating activities as well as cash proceeds from short- and long-term debt financing (refer to Debt below). We generally do not use equity to fund our ongoing obligations.For a full discussion related to the financial condition for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2020, including a year-to-year comparison between 2021 and 2020, see Part II, Item 7 - Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2021.Cash Flow:We believe our ability to generate substantial cash from operating activities and readily access capital markets and secure financing at competitive rates are key strengths and give us significant flexibility to meet our short and long-term financial commitments. Our cash flow activity over the last three years is noted below:202220212020Net cash provided by operating activities$3,908 $4,141 $3,964 Net cash (used in)/provided by investing activities$(4,888)$(26)$500 Net cash used in financing activities$(456)$(4,069)$(2,215)Net Cash Provided by Operating Activities:The decrease in net cash provided by operating activities in 2022 was primarily due to increased year-over-year working capital requirements, as the increase in accounts receivable and inventories was offset by increases in other liabilities. This is largely a result of business growth and acquisitions during the year. Net Cash Used in/Provided by Investing Activities:The increase in net cash used in investing activities was largely driven by higher cash payments for acquisitions, including $1.4 billion cash consideration paid for the Chipita acquisition during January 2022, $2.6 billion cash consideration paid for the Clif Bar acquisition during August 2022 and $1.3 billion cash consideration paid for the Ricolino acquisition in November 2022 relative to $833 million paid in the prior-year to acquire Gourmet Food, Grenade and Hu (refer to Note 2, Acquisitions and Divestitures), as well as lower proceeds from sales of equity method investments than in the prior-year period (refer to Note 7, Equity Method Investments), partially offset by proceeds from the settlement and replacement of net investment hedge derivative contracts. 54Table of ContentsCapital expenditures were $906 million in 2022, $965 million in 2021 and $863 million in 2020. We continue to make capital expenditures primarily to modernize manufacturing facilities and support new product and productivity initiatives. We expect 2023 capital expenditures to be up to $1.2 billion, including capital expenditures in connection with our Simplify to Grow Program and for funding our strategic priorities. We expect to continue to fund these expenditures with cash from operations.Net Cash Used in Financing Activities:The decrease in net cash used in financing activities was primarily due to lower net debt repayments with higher proceeds from borrowings in 2022 as we refinanced debt during the first quarter of 2022 with lower interest rate debt and we lapped higher net long-term debt repayments in the prior-year.Dividends:We paid dividends of $1,985 million in 2022, $1,826 million in 2021 and $1,678 million in 2020. On July 26, 2022, the Audit Committee, with authorization delegated from our Board of Directors, declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.385 per share of Class A Common Stock, an increase of 10 percent, which would be $1.54 per common share on an annualized basis. The declaration of dividends is subject to the discretion of our Board of Directors and depends on various factors, including our net earnings, financial condition, cash requirements, future prospects and other factors that our Board of Directors deems relevant to its analysis and decision making.For U.S. income tax purposes only, the Company has determined that 100% of the distributions paid to its shareholders in 2022 are characterized as a qualified dividend paid from U.S. earnings and profits. See Note 13, Capital Stock, to the consolidated financial statements and Item 5, Market for Registrant’s Common Equity, Related Stockholder Matters and Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities – Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities, for information on our share repurchase program.Supply Chain FinancingAs part of our continued efforts to improve our working capital efficiency, we have worked with our suppliers over the past several years to optimize our terms and conditions, which include the extension of payment terms. Our current payment terms with a majority of our suppliers are from 30 to 180 days, which we deem to be commercially reasonable. We also facilitate voluntary supply chain financing (“SCF”) programs through several participating financial institutions. Under these programs, our suppliers, at their sole discretion, determine invoices that they want to sell to participating financial institutions. Our suppliers’ voluntary inclusion of invoices in SCF programs has no bearing on our payment terms or amounts due. Our responsibility is limited to making payments based upon the agreed-upon contractual terms. No guarantees are provided by the Company or any of our subsidiaries under the SCF programs and we have no economic interest in the suppliers’ decision to participate in the SCF programs. Amounts due to our suppliers that elected to participate in the SCF program are included in accounts payable in our consolidated balance sheets. We have confirmed with participating financial institutions that as of December 31, 2022, and December 31, 2021, $2.4 billion and $2.5 billion, respectively, of our accounts payable to suppliers that participate in the SCF programs are outstanding.Guarantees:As discussed in Note 14, Commitments and Contingencies, we enter into third-party guarantees primarily to cover the long-term obligations of our vendors. As part of these transactions, we guarantee that third parties will make contractual payments or achieve performance measures. At December 31, 2022, we had no material third-party guarantees recorded on our consolidated balance sheets. Guarantees do not have, and we do not expect them to have, a material effect on our liquidity.Debt:The nature and amount of our long-term and short-term debt and the proportionate amount of each varies as a result of current and expected business requirements, market conditions and other factors. Due to seasonality, in the first and second quarters of the year, our working capital requirements grow, increasing the need for short-term financing. The second half of the year typically generates higher cash flows. As such, we may issue commercial paper or secure other forms of financing throughout the year to meet short-term working capital or other financing needs.55Table of ContentsRefer to Note 9, Debt and Borrowing Arrangements, for a projection of long-term debt scheduled to mature (including current maturities and finance leases) in future periods. In the next 12 months, we expect to repay approximately $0.3 billion of maturing long-term debt. We fund ongoing debt maturities and other long-term obligations using cash on hand or we may refinance obligations with long-term debt or short-term financing (such as our commercial paper borrowings) depending on financing available, timing considerations, flexibility to raise funding and the cost of financing.At its July 2022 meeting, the Board of Directors approved a new $2 billion long-term financing authorization that replaced the prior long-term financing authorization of $7 billion. As of December 31, 2022, $1.5 billion of the long-term financing authorization remained available.Our total debt was $22.9 billion at December 31, 2022 and $19.5 billion at December 31, 2021. Our debt-to-capitalization ratio was 0.46 at December 31, 2022 and 0.41 at December 31, 2021. The weighted-average term of our outstanding long-term debt was 8.2 years at December 31, 2022 and 9.5 years at December 31, 2021. Our average daily commercial borrowings were $1.6 billion in 2022, $0.5 billion in 2021 and $2.3 billion in 2020. We had commercial paper borrowings of $2.2 billion at December 31, 2022 and $0.2 billion at December 31, 2021. We expect to continue to use cash or commercial paper to finance various short-term financing needs. As of December 31, 2022, we continued to be in compliance with our debt covenants. One of our subsidiaries, Mondelez International Holdings Netherlands B.V. (“MIHN”), has outstanding debt. Refer to Note 9, Debt and Borrowing Arrangements. The operations held by MIHN generated approximately 72.4% (or $22.8 billion) of the $31.5 billion of consolidated net revenue during fiscal year 2022 and represented approximately 84.0% (or $22.6 billion) of the $26.9 billion of net assets as of December 31, 2022.Refer to Note 9, Debt and Borrowing Arrangements, for more information on our debt and debt covenants.Commodity TrendsWe regularly monitor worldwide supply, commodity cost and currency trends so we can cost-effectively secure ingredients, packaging and fuel required for production. During 2022, the primary drivers of the increase in our aggregate commodity costs were higher dairy, packaging, edible oils, energy, grains, sugar, nuts and other ingredient costs as well as unfavorable year-over-year currency exchange transaction costs on imported materials, partially offset by lower cocoa costs.A number of external factors such as the current macroeconomic environment, including global inflation, effects of the war in Ukraine, climate and weather conditions, commodity, transportation and labor market conditions, currency fluctuations and the effects of governmental agricultural or other programs affect the cost and availability of raw materials and agricultural materials used in our products. We address higher commodity costs and currency impacts primarily through hedging, higher pricing and manufacturing and overhead cost control. We use hedging techniques to limit the impact of fluctuations in the cost of our principal raw materials; however, we may not be able to fully hedge against commodity cost changes, such as dairy, where there is a limited ability to hedge, and our hedging strategies may not protect us from increases in specific raw material costs. Due to competitive or market conditions, planned trade or promotional incentives, fluctuations in currency exchange rates or other factors, our pricing actions may also lag commodity cost changes temporarily.As a result of international supply chain, transportation and labor market disruptions and generally highercommodity, transportation and labor costs, we expect price volatility and a higher aggregate cost environment to continue. While the costs of our principal raw materials fluctuate, we believe there will continue to be an adequate supply of the raw materials we use and that they will generally remain available.56Table of ContentsNon-GAAP Financial MeasuresWe use non-GAAP financial information and believe it is useful to investors as it provides additional information to facilitate comparisons of historical operating results, identify trends in our underlying operating results and provide additional insight and transparency on how we evaluate our business. We use non-GAAP financial measures to budget, make operating and strategic decisions and evaluate our performance. We have detailed the non-GAAP adjustments that we make in our non-GAAP definitions below. The adjustments generally fall within the following categories: acquisition and divestiture activities, gains and losses on intangible asset sales and non-cash impairments, major program restructuring activities, constant currency and related adjustments, major program financing and hedging activities and other major items affecting comparability of operating results. We believe the non-GAAP measures should always be considered along with the related U.S. GAAP financial measures. We have provided the reconciliations between the GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures below, and we also discuss our underlying GAAP results throughout our Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations in this Form 10-K.Our primary non-GAAP financial measures are listed below and reflect how we evaluate our current and prior-year operating results. As new events or circumstances arise, these definitions could change. When our definitions change, we provide the updated definitions and present the related non-GAAP historical results on a comparable basis (1).•“Organic Net Revenue” is defined as net revenues excluding the impacts of acquisitions, divestitures (2) and currency rate fluctuations (3). We also evaluate Organic Net Revenue growth from emerging markets and developed markets.•Our emerging markets include our Latin America region in its entirety; the AMEA region, excluding Australia, New Zealand and Japan; and the following countries from the Europe region: Russia, Ukraine, Türkiye, Kazakhstan, Georgia, Poland, Czech Republic, Slovak Republic, Hungary, Bulgaria, Romania, the Baltics and the East Adriatic countries. •Our developed markets include the entire North America region, the Europe region excluding the countries included in the emerging markets definition, and Australia, New Zealand and Japan from the AMEA region.•“Adjusted Operating Income” is defined as operating income excluding the impacts of the Simplify to Grow Program (4); gains or losses (including non-cash impairment charges) on goodwill and intangible assets; divestiture (2) or acquisition gains or losses, divestiture-related costs (5), acquisition-related costs (6), and acquisition integration costs and contingent consideration adjustments (7); inventory step-up charges (8); the operating results of divestitures (2); remeasurement of net monetary position (9); mark-to-market impacts from commodity, forecasted currency and equity method investment transaction derivative contracts (10); impact from resolution of tax matters (11); 2017 malware incident net recoveries; incremental costs due to the war in Ukraine (12); impact from the European Commission legal matter (13); impact from pension participation changes (14); and costs associated with the JDE Peet's transaction. We also present “Adjusted Operating Income margin,” which is subject to the same adjustments as Adjusted Operating Income. We also evaluate growth in our Adjusted Operating Income on a constant currency basis (3).•“Adjusted EPS” is defined as diluted EPS attributable to Mondelēz International from continuing operations excluding the impacts of the items listed in the Adjusted Operating Income definition as well as losses on debt extinguishment and related expenses; gains or losses on interest rate swaps no longer designated as accounting cash flow hedges due to changed financing and hedging plans, net earnings from divestitures (2); initial impacts from enacted tax law changes (15); and gains or losses on equity method investment transactions. Similarly, within Adjusted EPS, our equity method investment net earnings exclude our proportionate share of our investees’ significant operating and non-operating items (16). We also evaluate growth in our Adjusted EPS on a constant currency basis (3).(1) When items no longer impact our current or future presentation of non-GAAP operating results, we remove these items from our non-GAAP definitions. In the first quarter of 2022, we added to the non-GAAP definitions the exclusion of incremental costs due to the war in Ukraine (refer to footnote (12) below), in the second quarter of 2022, we added to the non-GAAP definitions the exclusion of costs incurred associated with our publicly-announced processes to sell businesses (refer to footnote (5) below) and in the third quarter of 2022, we added to the non-GAAP definitions the exclusion of inventory step-up charges associated with acquisitions (refer to footnote (8) below). In the fourth quarter of 2022, we added to the non-GAAP definitions the exclusion of the impact from the European Commission legal matter (refer to footnote (13) below).(2) Divestitures include completed sales of businesses (including the partial or full sale of an equity method investment) and exits of major product lines upon completion of a sale or licensing agreement. As we record our share of KDP and JDE Peet’s ongoing earnings on a one-quarter lag basis, any KDP or JDE Peet’s ownership reductions are reflected as divestitures within our non-GAAP results the following quarter. During the third quarter of 2021, we began to exclude the impact of certain adjustments made 57Table of Contentsto our acquisition contingent consideration liabilities that were recorded at the date of acquisition. We made this adjustment to better facilitate comparisons of our underlying operating performance across periods. See Note 2, Acquisitions and Divestitures, and Note 7, Equity Method Investments, for information on acquisitions and divestitures impacting the comparability of our results.(3) Constant currency operating results are calculated by dividing or multiplying, as appropriate, the current-period local currency operating results by the currency exchange rates used to translate the financial statements in the comparable prior-year period to determine what the current-period U.S. dollar operating results would have been if the currency exchange rate had not changed from the comparable prior-year period.(4) Non-GAAP adjustments related to the Simplify to Grow Program reflect costs incurred that relate to the objectives of our program to transform our supply chain network and organizational structure. Costs that do not meet the program objectives are not reflected in the non-GAAP adjustments.(5) Divestiture-related costs, which includes costs incurred in relation to the preparation and completion of our divestitures as defined in footnote (2), also includes costs incurred associated with our publicly-announced processes to sell businesses. We exclude these items to better facilitate comparisons of our underlying operating performance across periods. (6) Acquisition-related costs, which includes transaction costs such as third party advisor, investment banking and legal fees, also includes one-time compensation expense related to the buyout of non-vested ESOP shares and realized gains or losses from hedging activities associated with acquisition funds. We exclude these items to better facilitate comparisons of our underlying operating performance across periods.(7) Acquisition integration costs and contingent consideration adjustments include one-time costs related to the integration of acquisitions as well as any adjustments made to the fair market value of contingent compensation liabilities that have been previously booked for earn-outs related to acquisitions that do not relate to employee compensation expense. We exclude these items to better facilitate comparisons of our underlying operating performance across periods. (8) In the third quarter of 2022, we began to exclude the one-time inventory step-up charges associated with acquired companies related to the fair market valuation of the acquired inventory. We exclude this item to better facilitate comparisons of our underlying operating performance across periods.(9) In connection with our applying highly inflationary accounting (refer to Note 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies), for Argentina (beginning in the third quarter of 2018) and Türkiye (beginning in the second quarter of 2022), we exclude the related remeasurement gains or losses related to remeasuring net monetary assets or liabilities denominated in the local currency to the U.S. dollar during the periods presented to be consistent with our prior accounting for these remeasurement gains/losses for Venezuela when it was subject to highly inflationary accounting prior to deconsolidation in 2015. (10) We exclude unrealized gains and losses (mark-to-market impacts) from outstanding commodity and forecasted currency and equity method investment transaction derivative from our non-GAAP earnings measures. The mark-to-market impacts of commodity and forecasted currency transaction derivatives are excluded until such time that the related exposures impact our operating results. Since we purchase commodity and forecasted currency transaction contracts to mitigate price volatility primarily for inventory requirements in future periods, we make this adjustment to remove the volatility of these future inventory purchases on current operating results to facilitate comparisons of our underlying operating performance across periods. We exclude equity method investment transaction derivative contract settlements as they represent protection of value for future divestitures.(11) See Note 14, Commitments and Contingencies – Tax Matters, for additional information.(12) In February 2022, Russia began a military invasion of Ukraine and we stopped our production and closed our facilities in Ukraine. We began to incur incremental costs directly related to the war including asset impairments, such as property and inventory losses, higher expected allowances for uncollectible accounts receivable and committed compensation. We have isolated and exclude these costs and related impacts from our operating results to facilitate evaluation and comparisons of our ongoing results. Incremental costs related to increasing operations in other primarily European facilities are not included with these costs.(13) In the fourth quarter of 2022, we began to exclude the impact from the European Commission legal matter. In November 2019, the European Commission informed us that it initiated an investigation into our alleged infringement of European Union competition law through certain practices allegedly restricting cross-border trade within the European Economic Area. On January 28, 2021, the European Commission announced it had taken the next procedural step in its investigation and opened formal proceedings. We have been cooperating with the investigation and are currently engaged in discussions with the European Commission in an effort to reach a negotiated, proportionate resolution to this matter. As of December 31. 2022, we recorded an estimate of the possible cost to resolve this matter. Due to the unique nature of this matter, we believe it to be infrequent and unusual and therefore exclude it to better facilitate comparisons of our underlying operating performance across periods. Refer to Note 14, Commitments and Contingencies – Tax Matters, for additional information.(14) The impact from pension participation changes represents the charges incurred when employee groups are withdrawn from multiemployer pension plans and other changes in employee group pension plan participation. We exclude these charges from our non–GAAP results because those amounts do not reflect our ongoing pension obligations. See Note 11, Benefit Plans, for more information on the multiemployer pension plan withdrawal.(15) We have excluded the initial impacts from enacted tax law changes. Initial impacts include items such as the remeasurement of deferred tax balances and the transition tax from the 2017 U.S. tax reform. Previously, we only excluded the initial impacts from more material tax reforms, specifically the impacts of the 2019 Swiss tax reform and 2017 U.S. tax reform. We exclude initial impacts from enacted tax law changes from our Adjusted EPS as they do not reflect our ongoing tax obligations under the enacted tax law changes. Refer to Note 16, Income Taxes, for more information.(16) We have excluded our proportionate share of our equity method investees’ significant operating and non-operating items such as acquisition and divestiture related costs, restructuring program costs and initial impacts from enacted tax law changes, in order to provide investors with a comparable view of our performance across periods. Although we have shareholder rights and board representation commensurate with our ownership interests in our equity method investees and review the underlying operating results and significant operating and non-operating items each reporting period, we do not have direct control over their operations or resulting revenue and expenses. Our use of equity method investment net earnings on an adjusted basis is not intended to imply that we have any such control. Our GAAP “diluted EPS attributable to Mondelēz International from continuing operations” includes all of the investees’ significant operating and non-operating items.We believe that the presentation of these non-GAAP financial measures, when considered together with our U.S. GAAP financial measures and the reconciliations to the corresponding U.S. GAAP financial measures, provides you with a more complete understanding of the factors and trends affecting our business than could be obtained absent 58Table of Contentsthese disclosures. Because non-GAAP financial measures vary among companies, the non-GAAP financial measures presented in this report may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies. Our use of these non-GAAP financial measures is not meant to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for any U.S. GAAP financial measures. A limitation of these non-GAAP financial measures is they exclude items detailed below that have an impact on our U.S. GAAP reported results. The best way this limitation can be addressed is by evaluating our non-GAAP financial measures in combination with our U.S. GAAP reported results and carefully evaluating the following tables that reconcile U.S. GAAP reported figures to the non-GAAP financial measures in this Form 10-K.Organic Net Revenue:Applying the definition of “Organic Net Revenue”, the adjustments made to “net revenues” (the most comparable U.S. GAAP financial measure) were to exclude the impact of currency, acquisitions and divestitures.

Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk. As we operate globally, we are primarily exposed to currency exchange rate, commodity price and interest rate market risks. We monitor and manage these exposures as part of our overall risk management program. Our risk management program focuses on the unpredictability of financial markets and seeks to reduce the potentially adverse effects that the volatility of these markets may have on our operating results.We principally utilize derivative instruments to reduce significant, unanticipated earnings fluctuations that may arise from volatility in currency exchange rates, commodity prices and interest rates. For additional information on our derivative activity and the types of derivative instruments we use to hedge our currency exchange, commodity price and interest rate exposures, see Note 10, Financial Instruments.Many of our non-U.S. subsidiaries operate in functional currencies other than the U.S. dollar. Fluctuations in currency exchange rates create volatility in our reported results as we translate the balance sheets, operating results and cash flows of these subsidiaries into the U.S. dollar for consolidated reporting purposes. The translation of non-U.S. dollar denominated balance sheets and statements of earnings of our subsidiaries into the U.S. dollar for consolidated reporting generally results in a cumulative translation adjustment to other comprehensive income within equity. A stronger U.S. dollar relative to other functional currencies adversely affects our consolidated earnings and net assets while a weaker U.S. dollar benefits our consolidated earnings and net assets. While we hedge significant forecasted currency exchange transactions as well as certain net assets of non-U.S. operations and other currency impacts, we cannot fully predict or eliminate volatility arising from changes in currency exchange rates on our consolidated financial results. See Consolidated Results of Operations and Results of Operations by Operating Segment under Discussion and Analysis of Historical Results for currency exchange effects on our financial results. Throughout our discussion and analysis of results, we isolate currency impacts and supplementally provide net revenues, operating income and diluted earnings per share on a constant currency basis. For additional information on the impact of currency policies, recent currency devaluations and highly inflationary accounting on our financial condition and results of operations, also see Note 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies – Currency Translation and Highly Inflationary Accounting.We also continually monitor the market for commodities that we use in our products. Input costs may fluctuate widely due to international demand, weather conditions, government policy and regulation and the macroeconomic environment. Refer to Recent Developments and Significant Items Affecting Comparability and Financial Outlook above for updates on recent supply chain, transportation, labor and other disruptions that are increasing operating costs and impacting our results. To manage input cost volatility and inflation, we enter into forward purchase agreements and other derivative financial instruments. We also pursue productivity and cost saving measures and take pricing actions when necessary to mitigate the impact of higher input costs on earnings.We regularly evaluate our variable and fixed-rate debt as well as current and expected interest rates in the markets in which we raise capital. Our primary exposures include movements in U.S. Treasury rates, corporate credit spreads, commercial paper rates as well as limited debt tied to London Interbank Offered Rates (“LIBOR”). The last publication date of LIBOR rates against various currencies by the Financial Conduct Authority in the United Kingdom was December 31, 2021, with the publication of certain USD rates being phased out after June 30, 2023. We did not have a significant impact to our financial position from the phase out of LIBOR, nor do we expect a significant impact from the remaining phase out given our current mix of variable and fixed-rate debt. We periodically use interest rate swaps and forward interest rate contracts to achieve a desired proportion of variable versus fixed rate debt based on current and projected market conditions. For more information on our debt activity, see Note 9, Debt and Borrowing Arrangements.See Note 10, Financial Instruments, for more information on our derivative activity. Value at Risk:We use a value at risk (“VAR”) computation to estimate: 1) the potential one-day loss in the fair value of our interest rate-sensitive financial instruments; and 2) the potential one-day loss in pre-tax earnings of our currency and commodity price-sensitive derivative financial instruments. The VAR analysis was done separately for our currency exchange, fixed income and commodity risk portfolios as of each quarter end during the periods presented below. The instruments included in the VAR computation were currency exchange forwards and options for currency exchange risk, debt and swaps for interest rate risk, and commodity forwards, futures and options for commodity risk. Excluded from the computation were anticipated transactions, currency trade payables and receivables, and net investments in non-U.S. subsidiaries, which the above-mentioned instruments are intended to hedge.64Table of ContentsThe VAR model assumes normal market conditions, a 95% confidence interval and a one-day holding period. A parametric delta-gamma approximation technique was used to determine the expected return distribution in interest rates, currencies and commodity prices for the purpose of calculating the fixed income, currency exchange and commodity VAR, respectively. The parameters used for estimating the expected return distributions were determined by observing interest rate, currency exchange and commodity price movements over the prior quarter for the calculation of VAR amounts at December 31, 2022 and 2021, and over each of the four prior quarters for the calculation of average VAR amounts during each year. The values of currency and commodity options do not change on a one-to-one basis with the underlying currency or commodity and were valued accordingly in the VAR computation.As of December 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021, the estimated potential one-day loss in fair value of our interest rate-sensitive instruments, primarily debt, and the estimated potential one-day loss in pre-tax earnings from our currency and commodity instruments, as calculated in the VAR model, were: Pre-Tax Earnings ImpactFair Value Impact At 12/31/22AverageHighLowAt 12/31/22AverageHighLow (in millions)Instruments sensitive to:Interest rates$196 $201 $232 $169 Foreign currency rates$20 $23 $30 $20 Commodity prices63 75 118 51 Pre-Tax Earnings ImpactFair Value Impact At 12/31/21AverageHighLowAt 12/31/21AverageHighLow (in millions)Instruments sensitive to:Interest rates$135 $104 $135 $79 Foreign currency rates$11 $11 $13 $9 Commodity prices52 41 61 24 This VAR computation is a risk analysis tool designed to statistically estimate the maximum expected daily loss, under the specified confidence interval and assuming normal market conditions, from adverse movements in interest rates, currency exchange rates and commodity prices. The computation does not represent actual losses in fair value or earnings we will incur, nor does it consider the effect of favorable changes in market rates. We cannot predict actual future movements in market rates and do not present these VAR results to be indicative of future movements in market rates or to be representative of any actual impact that future changes in market rates may have on our future financial results.65Table of Contents",2023-12-30 19:00:49.832562

It should be read in conjunction with the other sections of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, including the consolidated financial statements and related notes contained in Item 8, “Forward-looking Statements” and “Risk Factors” contained in Item 1A. Description of the Company We manufacture and market primarily snack food and beverage products, including biscuits (cookies, crackers and salted snacks), chocolate, gum & candy, coffee & powdered beverages and various cheese & grocery products. We have operations in more than 80 countries and sell our products in approximately 165 countries. Over the last several years, we have been expanding geographically and building our presence in the fast-growing snacking category. At the same time, we continued to invest in product quality, marketing and innovation behind our iconic brands, while implementing a series of cost saving initiatives. We expect our global snacks businesses will build upon our strong presence across numerous fast-growing markets, categories and channels including the high-margin instant consumption channel. We plan to target industry-leading revenue growth, leverage our cost structure through supply chain reinvention, productivity programs, overhead streamlining, volume growth and improved product mix to drive margin gains and grow earnings per share in the top-tier of our peer group. Business and Segment Reorganization Effective as of January 1, 2013, we reorganized our operations and management into five reportable operating segments: • Latin America • Asia Pacific • Eastern Europe, Middle East & Africa (“EEMEA”) • Europe • North America We changed and flattened our operating structure to reflect our greater concentration of operations in emerging markets and to further enhance collaboration across regions, expedite decision making and drive greater efficiencies to fuel our growth. Coincident with the change in segment structure, segment operating income for our North America region also changed to include all U.S. pension plan expenses, a portion of which was previously excluded from segment operating results evaluated by management as the costs were centrally managed. See Note 17, Segment Reporting, for additional segment information. Our segment results reflect the change in segment structure for all periods presented. Spin-Off of Kraft Foods Group On October 1, 2012, we completed the spin-off of our North American grocery business, Kraft Foods Group, Inc. (“Kraft Foods Group”), to our shareholders (the “Spin-Off”). The divested Kraft Foods Group business is presented as a discontinued operation on the consolidated statements of earnings for all periods presented. The Kraft Foods Group other comprehensive earnings, changes in equity and cash flows are included within our consolidated statements of comprehensive earnings, equity and cash flows through October 1, 2012. See Note 2, Divestitures and Acquisition, for more information on the Spin-Off of Kraft Foods Group. Revision of Financial Statements In finalizing our 2013 results, we identified certain out-of-period, non-cash income tax-related errors in prior interim and annual periods. These errors are not material to any previously reported financial results; however, we have revised our first through third quarter 2013 and prior-year financial statements in this filing to reflect these items in the appropriate periods. The net effect of the revision was to lower tax expense in years prior to 2013. The impact of the revision to 2013 results through the third quarter was a $59 million reduction of net earnings related to both current and prior-year corrections. The impact of the revision to fiscal years prior to 2013 was an increase in cumulative net earnings of $94 million. For additional details of the adjustments, see Note 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies – Revision of Financial Statements. The following discussion and analysis relates to revised after-tax results for all periods presented. 21 Table of Contents While we corrected these errors and they were not material to any previously reported financial statements, we have determined that there was a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of our annual or interim financial statements may not have been prevented or detected on a timely basis due to control deficiencies in our internal controls. Thus, management has determined that the control deficiencies constitute a material weakness. Because we have identified this material weakness, we have implemented additional procedures to verify the reliability of our accounting for income taxes. Based on the additional procedures, we believe that the consolidated financial statements included in this report are fairly stated in all material respects in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. For additional information on the procedures and controls we are implementing to address the material weakness, see Item 9A, Controls and Procedures. Summary of Results and Significant Highlights • Net revenues increased 0.8% to $35.3 billion in 2013 and decreased 2.2% to $35.0 billion in 2012. • Organic Net Revenues increased 3.9% to $35.9 billion in 2013 and increased 4.4% to $36.3 billion in 2012. Organic Net Revenues is a non-GAAP financial measure we use to evaluate our underlying results (see the definition of Organic Net Revenues and our reconciliation with net revenues within Non-GAAP Financial Measures appearing later in this section). Organic Net Revenues excludes the impact of currency, acquisitions, divestitures and accounting calendar changes. • Diluted EPS attributable to Mondelēz International increased 28.1% to $2.19 in 2013 and decreased 14.9% to $1.71 in 2012. Excluding the results of discontinued operations, our diluted EPS attributable to Mondelēz International from continuing operations increased 46.6% to $1.29 in 2013 and decreased 11.1% to $0.88 in 2012. • Adjusted EPS increased 7.1% to $1.51 in 2013 and increased 0.7% to $1.41 in 2012. On a constant currency basis, Adjusted EPS increased 13.5% to $1.60 in 2013 and increased 5.0% to $1.47 in 2012. Adjusted EPS is a non-GAAP financial measure we use to evaluate our underlying results (see the definition of Adjusted EPS and our reconciliation with diluted EPS within Non-GAAP Financial Measures appearing later in this section). Adjusted EPS includes diluted EPS attributable to Mondelēz International from continuing operations and excludes the following items discussed below: Spin-Off Costs and related costs, 2012-2014 Restructuring Program costs, Integration Program costs and other acquisition integration costs, a benefit from the resolution of a Cadbury acquisition-related indemnification, the loss on debt extinguishment and related expenses, net gain on acquisition and divestitures, acquisition-related costs and net earnings from divestitures. We also evaluate Adjusted EPS on a constant currency basis. • On February 6, 2014, we completed a cash tender offer and retired $1.6 billion of our long-term U.S. dollar debt. In connection with retiring this debt, during the first quarter of 2014, we recorded a $495 million loss on debt extinguishment and related expenses related to the amount we paid to retire the debt in excess of its carrying value and from recognizing unamortized discounts and deferred financing costs in earnings at the time of the debt extinguishment. • On January 16, 2014, we issued $3.0 billion of U.S. dollar notes that generated approximately $3.0 billion of net cash proceeds, which were used in part to fund the February 2014 tender offer and for other general corporate purposes. In January 2014, we also recorded approximately $18 million of discounts and deferred financing costs, which will be amortized into interest expense over the life of the notes. • On December 18, 2013, we completed a cash tender offer and retired $3.4 billion of our long-term U.S. dollar debt. We recorded a $612 million loss on debt extinguishment and related expenses related to the amount we paid to retire the debt in excess of its carrying value and from recognizing unamortized discounts and deferred financing costs in earnings at the time of the debt extinguishment. • On December 11, 2013, we issued €2.4 billion of Euro-denominated notes, or approximately $3.3 billion in U.S. dollars as of December 31, 2013. We received net proceeds of €2,381 million, or $3,239 million in U.S. dollars, which were used to partially fund the December 2013 tender offer. We also recorded approximately $27 million of discounts and deferred financing costs, which will be amortized into interest expense over the life of the notes. 22 Table of Contents • During 2013, our Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of $7.7 billion of our Common Stock under a share repurchase program. During 2013, we repurchased $2.7 billion, or 82.8 million shares of Common Stock at an average cost of $33.09 per share. The repurchases include $1.5 billion of shares acquired through an accelerated share repurchase program we initiated in December 2013. All share repurchases were funded through available cash, including cash from the resolution of the Starbucks arbitration described below, and commercial paper issuances. As of December 31, 2013, we have $5.0 billion in remaining share repurchase capacity. • In December 2013, a dispute over a license and supply agreement between Starbucks Coffee Company (“Starbucks”) and Kraft Foods Group was resolved when an independent arbitrator issued a decision and Final Award that resulted in Starbucks paying $2.8 billion for its unilateral termination of the agreement. The dispute arose within the Kraft Foods Group discontinued operation and was directed to Mondelēz International as part of the Spin-Off recapitalization plans. The net $1.6 billion after-tax gain on the resolution of the arbitration was recorded in earnings from discontinued operations in the fourth quarter of 2013. See Item 3, Legal Proceedings, and Notes 2, Divestitures and Acquisition, and 12, Commitments and Contingencies, for additional information. • On October 1, 2013, $1 billion of our 5.125% U.S. dollar notes and $800 million of our 5.250% U.S. dollar notes matured. The notes and accrued interest to date were paid with cash on hand and the issuance of commercial paper. • In August 2013, we resolved an outstanding Cadbury-acquisition related indemnification and recorded a favorable pre-tax earnings impact of $385 million ($363 million net of tax). See Items affecting Comparability of Financial Results and Note 12, Commitments and Contingencies, for more information. • On May 8, 2013, $1 billion of our 2.625% U.S. dollar notes matured. The notes and accrued interest to date were paid with cash on hand and the issuance of commercial paper. • On February 11, 2013, $750 million of our 6.00% U.S. dollar notes matured and were paid with cash on hand. • In February 2013, we recorded a $54 million unfavorable foreign currency charge related to the devaluation of our net monetary assets in Venezuela. We also incurred net unfavorable devaluation-related foreign currency impacts within our pre-tax earnings of $67 million during the year ended December 31, 2013 related to translating the earnings of our Venezuelan subsidiary to the U.S. dollar at the new exchange rate. As of December 31, 2013, our net monetary assets denominated in the Venezuelan bolivar were $257 million. Should the bolivar be devalued further, it would result in a charge to our net earnings in the period of devaluation. See our Results of Operations by Reportable Segment later in this section and Note 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies - Foreign Currency, including Highly Inflationary Accounting, for more information. Financial Outlook We develop long-term plans and targets to achieve sustainable, profitable growth over time. Our long-term financial targets include: • Organic Net Revenue growth at or above expected category growth • Adjusted Operating Income growth of high single-digits on a constant currency basis • Double-digit Adjusted EPS growth on a constant currency basis Refer to Non-GAAP Financial Measures appearing later in this section for more information on these measures. In 2014, we expect Organic Net Revenues to grow approximately 4 percent, which is at or above the growth of our categories. We expect low double-digit growth in Adjusted Operating Income at constant currency, fueled by our focused efforts to reduce overheads, restructure our global supply chain and improve product mix, while continuing to invest in emerging markets. We anticipate this increase will result in an Adjusted Operating Income margin in the high 12 percent range and will be the primary lever in delivering Adjusted EPS of $1.73 to $1.78, up double digits on a constant currency basis. Our 2014 Adjusted EPS outlook reflects constant currency at average 2013 currency rates. Any fluctuation from the 2013 average currency rates is outside of our 2014 outlook. 23 Table of Contents We monitor the following factors and trends that we expect could impact our near- and long-term revenues and profitability. Long-Term Demographics and Consumer Trends – Snack food consumption is highly correlated to GDP growth, urbanization of the population and rising discretionary income levels associated with a growing middle class. Over the long-term, we expect these trends to continue leading to growth in key consumer behaviors including increased snacking occasions, greater use of convenience food and migrating to more frequent, smaller meals. Demand – We monitor consumer spending and our market share within the food and beverage categories in which we sell our products. In 2013, our Organic Net Revenues grew faster than the global categories as we expanded market share in a number of the categories. Growth in the global categories slowed from approximately 6% in 2012 to under 4% in 2013. The slowdown in category growth is expected to impact our near-term net revenue growth and we have reflected this in our Organic Net Revenue outlook for 2014. We believe the slowdown in category growth, particularly in emerging markets, is temporary, as we expect category growth to return to levels more in line with the expected growth of emerging markets and consumer spending. We continue to make investments in our brands and build strong routes to market to address the needs of consumers in emerging and developed markets. In doing so, we anticipate stimulating demand in the categories and growing our position in these markets. Volatility of Global Markets – Our growth strategy depends in part on our ability to expand our operations, particularly in emerging markets. Some of these markets have greater political and economic volatility and vulnerability to infrastructure and labor disruptions as we saw this past year in some of the markets in which we sell our products, including China, Russia, Brazil, Turkey, Venezuela and Argentina. The volatility affects demand for products and requires frequent changes in how we operate our business. While there will likely be continued volatility across these and other markets in which we sell, we will continue to invest in these markets as we believe the emerging markets in particular will deliver significant growth over time. Competition – Our competitors continue to grow their global operations and routes to market and low-cost local manufacturers are also expanding their production capacities in the markets in which we sell our products. Competitors may significantly reduce prices or offer other incentives as we saw with products such as coffee this past year. We continually evaluate the competitive environment and market conditions and bring new products and innovations to market. We also adjust our pricing, trade and promotional programs to compete and continue to focus on growing our market share. Pricing – We adjust our product prices based on a number of variables including demand, the competitive environment and changes in our input costs. Our net revenue growth or profitability may be affected as we adjust prices to address new conditions. This past year, we generally increased prices modestly in response to higher commodity costs and other factors. But in certain categories such as coffee, we significantly decreased our prices as the cost of coffee beans fell significantly over 2013. This had a 0.8 percentage point (pp) negative impact on our Organic Net Revenue growth in 2013. In 2014, for the commodities we purchase, we anticipate slightly higher aggregate commodity costs and expect to adjust our prices accordingly. Operating Costs – Our operating costs include raw materials, labor, selling and marketing costs, general and administrative expenses, taxes, currency impacts and financing costs. We manage these costs through cost saving and productivity initiatives, sourcing and hedging programs, pricing actions, refinancing and tax planning. We continue to work on various programs to expand our profitability and margins. As reflected in our 2014 outlook, we expect to achieve double-digit growth in our Adjusted Operating Income and Adjusted EPS on a constant currency basis. This reflects a number of cost saving programs we have put in place, including our supply chain reinvention program and 2012-2014 Restructuring Program, among others. Currency – As a global company with 83% of our net revenues generated outside the United States, we are exposed to changes in global economic conditions and currency movements. We work to mitigate our currency exposure by hedging a portion of our currency exchange business transactions as well as our investments in overseas operations. However, we may not be able to effectively hedge against currency risks in all the countries and currencies in which we operate due to factors including limited markets for hedging currency transactions and current monetary policies and restrictions of countries such as Venezuela and Argentina. While we work to mitigate our exposure to currency-related risks, global market volatility, actions by foreign governments and other factors outside our control could lead to unfavorable currency impacts on our earnings. Financing Costs – We regularly evaluate our variable and fixed-rate debt and recently refinanced $6.4 billion of our long-term U.S. dollar-denominated debt for lower cost long-term Euro and U.S. dollar-denominated debt. We continue to use lower cost short and long-term debt to finance our ongoing working capital, capital and other investments, dividends and share repurchases. Our weighted-average interest rate on our debt as of December 31, 2013 was 4.8%, down from 5.8% as of December 31, 2012. Following the January 16, 2014 $3.0 billion note issuance and completion of the February 6, 2014 tender offer and retirement of $1.6 billion of our long-term debt, our weighted-average interest rate on our debt was 4.3%. 24 Table of Contents Discussion and Analysis of Historical Results Items Affecting Comparability of Financial Results Spin-Off of Kraft Foods Group On October 1, 2012 (the “Distribution Date”), we completed the Spin-Off of Kraft Foods Group to our shareholders. The divested Kraft Foods Group business is presented as a discontinued operation on the consolidated statements of earnings for all periods presented. The Kraft Foods Group other comprehensive earnings, changes in equity and cash flows are included within our consolidated statements of comprehensive earnings, equity and cash flows through October 1, 2012. See Note 2, Divestitures and Acquisition, to the consolidated financial statements for additional information. A summary of results related to the discontinued operation of Kraft Foods Group within our historical results is presented below: Fourth Quarter Ended Nine Months Ended Year Ended December 31, 2013 October 1, 2012 December 31, 2011 (in millions) Net revenues – $ 13,768 $ 18,555 Earnings before income taxes $ 2,522 $ 2,266 $ 2,892 Provision for income taxes 919 778 1,082 Earnings from discontinued operations, net of income taxes $ 1,603 $ 1,488 $ 1,810 The results of the Kraft Foods Group discontinued operation exclude certain corporate and business unit costs which were historically allocated to Kraft Foods Group and continued at Mondelēz International after the Spin-Off. These costs include primarily corporate overheads, information systems and sales force support. On a pre-tax basis, through the date of the Spin-Off, these costs were $150 million for the nine months ended October 1, 2012 and $236 million for the year ended December 31, 2011. Interest expense relating to debt Kraft Foods Group incurred or assumed through October 1, 2012 has been included in the results from discontinued operations for all periods presented and as follows: Nine Months EndedOctober 1, 2012 Year EndedDecember 31, 2011 (in millions) $6.0 billion note issuance in June 2012 $ 70 $ – $3.6 billion notes exchanged in July 2012 171 226 $0.4 billion debt transferred in October 2012 24 31 Capital leases and other 13 10 $ 278 $ 267 25 Table of Contents On October 1, 2012, we divested the following assets and liabilities which net to $4,358 million, or $4,111 million net of cash retained by Kraft Foods Group on the Distribution Date (in millions): Assets Cash $ 247 Receivables 1,685 Inventories, net 2,099 Deferred income taxes 338 Other current assets 168 Property, plant and equipment, net 4,211 Goodwill 11,911 Intangible assets, net 2,632 Prepaid pension assets 16 Other assets 856 $ 24,163 Liabilities Current portion of long-term debt $ 6 Accounts payable 1,798 Accrued marketing 463 Accrued employment costs 190 Other current liabilities 751 Long-term debt 9,965 Deferred income taxes 874 Accrued pension costs 2,026 Accrued postretirement health care costs 3,316 Other liabilities 416 $ 19,805 Net assets divested in the Spin-Off $ 4,358 Additionally, $4,308 million of accumulated other comprehensive losses primarily related to the pension and other benefit plan net liabilities transferred to Kraft Foods Group and $89 million of unearned compensation recorded within additional paid in capital were distributed to Kraft Foods Group. In total, we recorded a distribution of $8,755 million to our shareholders in connection with the Spin-Off of Kraft Foods Group. In order to implement the Spin-Off, we entered into certain agreements with Kraft Foods Group to effect our legal and structural separation, govern the relationship between us, and allocate various assets, liabilities and obligations between us, including, among other things, employee benefits, intellectual property and tax-related assets and liabilities (see Note 15, Income Taxes, for additional information on the current and deferred tax assets and liabilities transferred or retained in the Spin-Off). In addition to executing the Spin-Off in the manner provided in the agreements, in November 2012, pursuant to these agreements, we paid Kraft Foods Group $163 million related to targeted cash flows (together with the $247 million of cash divested on the Distribution Date, totaling $410 million of cash transferred to Kraft Foods Group in connection with the Spin-Off). To facilitate the management, including final payment and resolution, of certain obligations, Kraft Foods Group retained certain of our North American net trade payables and receivables. We also retained approximately $140 million of workers’ compensation liabilities for claims incurred by Kraft Foods Group employees prior to the Spin-Off. In November 2012, we paid Kraft Foods Group $95 million to cash settle the net trade payables and receivables and which are also reflected in table above. In March 2013, we collected $55 million from Kraft Foods Group related to the cash settlement of stock awards held by our respective employees at the time of the Spin-Off as further described in Note 11, Stock Plans, to the consolidated financial statements. Our results from continuing operations include one-time Spin-Off transaction, transition and financing and related costs (“Spin-Off Costs”) we have incurred to date. We recorded Spin-Off Costs of $62 million in 2013, $1,053 million in 2012 and $46 million in 2011. We expect to incur approximately $30 million of remaining Spin-Off Costs in 2014 related primarily to customer service and logistics, information systems and processes, as well as legal costs associated with revising intellectual property and other long-term agreements. 26 Table of Contents In December 2013, a dispute over a license and supply agreement between Starbucks and Kraft Foods Group was resolved when an independent arbitrator issued a decision and Final Award that resulted in Starbucks paying $2.8 billion for its unilateral termination of the agreement. The dispute arose within the Kraft Foods Group discontinued operation and was directed to Mondelēz International as part of the Spin-Off recapitalization plans. The net $1.6 billion after-tax gain on the resolution of the arbitration was recorded in earnings from discontinued operations in the fourth quarter of 2013. See Item 3, Legal Proceedings, and Notes 2, Divestitures and Acquisition, and 12, Commitments and Contingencies, for additional information. Acquisition, Other Divestitures and Sales of Property On February 22, 2013, we acquired the remaining interest in a biscuit operation in Morocco, which is now a wholly-owned subsidiary within our EEMEA segment. We paid net cash consideration of $119 million, consisting of a $155 million purchase price net of cash acquired of $36 million. Prior to the acquisition, our interest in the operation was accounted for under the equity method. As a result of obtaining a controlling interest, we consolidated the operation and recorded the fair value of acquired assets (including identifiable intangible assets of $48 million), the liabilities assumed and goodwill of $209 million. We also recorded a pre-tax gain of $22 million related to the remeasurement of our previously-held equity interest in the operation to fair value in accordance with U.S. GAAP. Acquisition costs of $7 million were included within selling, general and administrative expenses and interest and other expense, net during the year ended December 31, 2013. The operating results of the acquisition were not material to our condensed consolidated financial statements during the periods presented. In 2013, we completed several divestitures primarily in our EEMEA and Europe segments which generated cash proceeds of $60 million and pre-tax gains of $8 million. The divestitures included a salty snacks business in Turkey, a confectionery business in South Africa and a chocolate business in Spain. In 2012, we completed several divestitures within our Europe segment that generated cash proceeds of $200 million and pre-tax gains of $107 million. The divestitures primarily included a dinners and sauces grocery business in Germany and Belgium and a canned meat business in Italy. The aggregate operating results of the 2013 and 2012 divestitures were not material to our financial statements in any of the periods presented. In 2013, we sold properties in Italy, the United Kingdom and Norway within our Europe segment and in India within our Asia Pacific segment. The Europe property sales generated $29 million in pre-tax net gains and $37 million of cash proceeds. We also have a $52 million receivable related to the United Kingdom property sale. The India property sale generated a $39 million pre-tax gain and $53 million of cash proceeds. The gains were recorded within selling, general and administrative expenses and cash proceeds were recorded in cash flows from other investing activities in the year ended December 31, 2013. In 2012, we also sold property in Russia and Turkey within our EEMEA segment. The Russia property sale generated a $55 million pre-tax gain and $72 million of cash proceeds and the Turkey property sale generated a $22 million pre-tax gain and $29 million of cash proceeds. The gains were recorded within selling, general and administrative expenses and the cash proceeds were recorded in cash flows from other investing activities in the year ended December 31, 2012. 2012-2014 Restructuring Program In 2012, our Board of Directors approved $1.5 billion of restructuring and related implementation costs (“2012-2014 Restructuring Program”) reflecting primarily severance, asset disposals and other manufacturing-related one-time costs. The primary objective of the restructuring and implementation activities was to ensure that both Mondelēz International and Kraft Foods Group were each set up to operate efficiently and execute on our respective business strategies upon separation and in the future. Of the $1.5 billion of anticipated 2012-2014 Restructuring Program costs, we retained approximately $925 million and Kraft Foods Group retained the balance of the program. Since inception, we have incurred $440 million of our estimated $925 million total 2012-2014 Restructuring Program charges. We recorded restructuring charges of $267 million in 2013 and $102 million in 2012 within asset impairment and exit costs. We also incurred implementation costs of $63 million in 2013 and $8 million in 2012, which were recorded within cost of sales and selling, general and administrative expenses. See Note 6, 2012-2014 Restructuring Program, and Note 10, Benefit Plans, for additional information. 27 Table of Contents Integration Program As a result of our combination with Cadbury Limited (formerly, Cadbury plc or “Cadbury”) in 2010, we launched an integration program (the “Integration Program”) to realize expected annual cost savings of approximately $750 million by the end of 2013 and revenue synergies from investments in distribution, marketing and product development. We achieved cost savings of approximately $800 million one year ahead of schedule and achieved our planned revenue synergies by December 31, 2013. To achieve the expected annual cost savings and synergies and integrate the two businesses, we incurred total integration charges of approximately $1.5 billion through the end of 2013 and have now completed the Integration Program. We recorded Integration Program charges of $216 million in 2013, $185 million in 2012 and $521 million in 2011. At December 31, 2013, we had an accrued liability of $145 million related to the Integration Program, of which, $101 million was recorded within other current liabilities and $44 million, primarily related to leased facilities no longer in use, was recorded within other long-term liabilities. During 2012, we refined our estimate of 2010 Integration Program charges by $45 million primarily related to planned and announced position eliminations that did not occur within our Europe segment. The reversal was based on final negotiations with local workers councils, the majority of which were concluded in April 2012. We recorded Integration Program charges in operations as a part of selling, general and administrative expenses primarily within our Europe, EEMEA, Asia Pacific and Latin America segments, as well as within general corporate expenses. See Note 7, Integration Program and Cost Savings Initiatives, to the consolidated financial statements for additional information. Cost Savings Initiatives Cost savings initiatives generally include exit, disposal and other project costs outside of our Integration Program and 2012-2014 Restructuring Program and consist of the following specific initiatives: • In 2013, we recorded a $20 million charge primarily within the segment operating income of Latin America related to severance benefits provided to terminated employees and one-time charges and within the segment operating income of North America related to supply chain reinvention team expenses. • In 2012, we recorded a $21 million charge primarily within the segment operating income of Europe related to severance benefits provided to terminated employees and charges in connection with the reorganization within the Europe and EEMEA segments (the “Europe reorganization”). • In 2011, we recorded a $61 million charge primarily within the segment operating income of Europe related to severance benefits provided to terminated employees and charges in connection with the Europe reorganization. We also reversed approximately $15 million of cost savings initiative program costs across the North America, Europe and EEMEA segments. Accounting Calendar Changes in 2013 and 2011 The majority of our operating subsidiaries report results as of the last calendar day of the period. In connection with moving toward a common consolidation date across the Company, in the first quarter of 2013, we changed the consolidation date for our Europe segment. The change in the consolidation date for our Europe segment had a favorable impact of $37 million on net revenues and $6 million on operating income in 2013. At this time, primarily our North American operating subsidiaries report results as of the last Saturday of the period. Prior to these changes, in 2012 and 2011, the majority of our operating subsidiaries reported results as of the last Saturday of the year. In 2011, the last Saturday of the year fell on December 31, so our 2011 results included one more week of operating results (“53rd week”) than 2013 or 2012, which each had 52 weeks. In 2011, we also changed the consolidation dates for certain operations of our Europe, Latin America and EEMEA segments. Previously, these operations primarily reported results two weeks prior to the end of the period. Subsequent to the 2011 changes, the majority of our Europe segment reported results as of the last Saturday of each period and certain operations within our Latin America and EEMEA segments began to report results as of the last calendar day of the period or the last Saturday of the period. These changes and the 53rd week in 2011 resulted in a favorable impact to net revenues of $679 million and a favorable impact of $93 million to operating income in 2011. We believe these changes will improve business planning and financial reporting by better matching the close dates of the operating subsidiaries and bringing the reporting date closer to the period-end date. As the effect to prior-period results was not material, we have not revised prior-period results. 28 Table of Contents Tender Offer On December 18, 2013, we completed a cash tender offer and retired $3.4 billion of our long-term U.S. dollar debt. We recorded a $612 million loss on debt extinguishment and related expenses due primarily to the amount we paid to retire the debt in excess of its carrying value and from recognizing unamortized discounts and deferred financing costs in earnings at the time of the debt extinguishment. See Note 8, Debt and Borrowing Arrangements, for additional information. Benefit from Indemnification Resolution As part of our 2010 Cadbury acquisition, we became the responsible party for tax matters under the Cadbury Schweppes Plc and Dr Pepper Snapple Group, Inc. (“DPSG”) Tax Sharing and Indemnification Agreement dated May 1, 2008 (“Tax Indemnity”) for certain 2007 and 2008 transactions relating to the demerger of Cadbury’s Americas Beverage business. A U.S. federal tax audit of DPSG for the 2006-2008 tax years was concluded with the IRS in August 2013. As a result, we recorded a favorable after-tax impact of $363 million due to the reversal of the accrued liability in excess of the amount we paid to DPSG under the Tax Indemnity. We recorded $336 million in selling, general and administrative expenses, $49 million in interest and other expense, net, and $22 million of tax expense in the year ended December 31, 2013. Provision for Income Taxes Our income tax provision could be significantly affected by a shift in pre-tax income between foreign jurisdictions, from foreign jurisdictions to the U.S. or by changes in foreign or U.S. tax laws and regulations that apply to the earnings of foreign subsidiaries as well as other factors. Our 2013 effective tax rate of 2.5% was favorably impacted by the mix of pre-tax income in various foreign jurisdictions, net tax benefits from discrete one-time events and the non-taxable portion of the Cadbury acquisition related indemnification resolution, partially offset by an unfavorable tax law change. The $299 million of discrete one-time events primarily related to favorable tax audit settlements and expirations of statutes of limitations in several jurisdictions and the net reduction of U.K. deferred tax liabilities resulting from tax legislation enacted during 2013 that reduced U.K. corporate income tax rates. Our 2012 revised effective tax rate of 9.5% was favorably impacted by the mix of pre-tax income in various foreign jurisdictions and net tax benefits from discrete one-time tax events, partially offset by non-deductible expenses. The $140 million of discrete one-time events primarily related to the net reduction of U.K. deferred tax liabilities resulting from tax legislation enacted during 2012 that reduced U.K. corporate income tax rates and net favorable tax audit settlements. Our 2011 revised effective tax rate of 6.2% was favorably impacted by the mix of pre-tax income in various foreign jurisdictions and net tax benefits of $253 million from discrete one-time events, primarily from the net reduction of U.K. deferred tax liabilities resulting from tax legislation enacted in 2011 that reduced U.K. corporate income tax rates, the net favorable impact from tax audit developments during the year, the reversal of valuation allowances on certain foreign deferred tax assets that are now expected to be realized and adjustments to taxes payable as a result of tax return filings. 29 Table of Contents Consolidated Results of Operations The following discussion compares our consolidated results of operations for 2013 with 2012 and 2012 with 2011. 2013 compared with 2012 For the Years EndedDecember 31, 2013 2012 $ change % change (in millions, except per share data) Net revenues $ 35,299 $ 35,015 $ 284 0.8 % Operating income 3,971 3,637 334 9.2 % Earnings from continuing operations 2,332 1,606 726 45.2 % Net earnings attributable toMondelēz International 3,915 3,067 848 27.6 % Diluted earnings per share fromcontinuing operations attributable toMondelēz International 1.29 0.88 0.41 46.6 % Diluted earnings per share attributable toMondelēz International 2.19 1.71 0.48 28.1 % Net Revenues – Net revenues increased $284 million (0.8%) to $35,299 million in 2013, and Organic Net Revenues(1) increased $1,338 million (3.9%) to $35,938 million. The changes in net revenues and Organic Net Revenue are detailed below: Change in net revenues (by percentage point) Favorable volume/mix 3.4pp Higher net pricing 0.5pp Total change in Organic Net Revenues(1) 3.9% Unfavorable foreign currency (2.4)pp Impact of divestitures (1.0)pp Impact of acquisition 0.2pp Impact of accounting calendar change 0.1pp Total change in net revenues 0.8% (1) Please see the Non-GAAP Financial Measures section at the end of this item. Organic Net Revenues growth was driven by favorable volume/mix and higher net pricing. Favorable volume/mix was driven primarily by higher shipments across all segments except Asia Pacific. Higher net pricing in Latin America, primarily related to Venezuela, Argentina and Brazil, and in North America was partially offset by lower net pricing in Europe, Asia Pacific and EEMEA, primarily due to lower coffee prices. Unfavorable foreign currency decreased net revenues by $837 million, due primarily to the devaluation of the Venezuelan bolivar and the strength of the U.S. dollar relative to most foreign currencies, including the Brazilian real, Argentinean peso, Australian dollar, Indian rupee, Japanese yen and South African rand, partially offset by the strength of the euro relative the U.S. dollar. The impact of divestitures resulted in a year-over-year decrease in net revenues of $345 million. In addition, the acquisition of a biscuit operation in Morocco added $91 million in net revenues and the accounting calendar change in Europe added $37 million in net revenues in 2013. 30 Table of Contents Operating Income - Operating income increased $334 million (9.2%) to $3,971 million in 2013, Adjusted Operating Income(1) decreased $1 million (0.0%) to $4,213 million and Adjusted Operating Income (on a constant currency basis)(1) increased $199 million (4.7%) to $4,413 million due to the following: Operating Income Change (in millions) (percentage point) Operating Income for the Year Ended December 31, 2012 $ 3,637 Spin-Off Costs 444 10.6pp Integration Program costs 140 3.0pp 2012-2014 Restructuring Program costs 110 2.3pp Spin-Off pension expense adjustment (2) 68 1.7pp Acquisition-related costs 1 – Net gain on divestitures (107 ) (2.5)pp Operating income from divestitures (79 ) (1.7)pp Adjusted Operating Income for the Year Ended December 31, 2012 (1) $ 4,214 Favorable volume/mix 495 11.6pp Higher net pricing 157 3.7pp Higher input costs (333 ) (7.9)pp Higher selling, general and administrative expenses (246 ) (5.7)pp Gains on sales of property in 2013 68 1.6pp Gains on sales of property in 2012 (77 ) (1.8)pp Change in unrealized gains/losses on hedging activities 61 1.4pp Intangible asset impairment charge in 2012 52 1.3pp Impact from acquisition 16 0.4pp Impact of accounting calendar changes 6 0.1pp Total change in Adjusted Operating Income (constant currency) (1) 199 4.7% Unfavorable foreign currency - translation (146 ) (3.4)pp Unfavorable foreign currency - Venezuela net monetary assets (54 ) (1.3)pp Total change in Adjusted Operating Income (1) 0.0% Adjusted Operating Income for the Year Ended December 31, 2013 (1) $ 4,213 Benefit from indemnification resolution 336 9.3pp Integration Program and other integration costs (220 ) (5.0)pp Spin-Off Costs (62 ) (1.5)pp 2012-2014 Restructuring Program costs (330 ) (7.8)pp Net gain on acquisition and divestitures 30 0.7pp Operating income from divestitures 6 0.1pp Acquisition-related costs (2 ) – Operating Income for the Year Ended December 31, 2013 $ 3,971 9.2% (1) Please see the Non-GAAP Financial Measures section at the end of this item. (2) Represents the estimated annual benefit plan expense associated with certain benefit plan obligations transferred to Kraft Foods Group in the Spin-Off. Favorable volume/mix was driven primarily by volume gains across all segments except for Asia Pacific. During 2013, increased input costs outpaced higher net pricing. The increase in input costs was driven by higher raw material costs, in part due to higher foreign exchange transaction costs on imported materials, partially offset by lower manufacturing costs. Higher net pricing in Latin America and North America was partially offset by lower net pricing in Europe, Asia Pacific and EEMEA, primarily due to lower coffee pricing. Total selling, general and administrative expenses decreased $497 million from 2012, due in part to lower Spin-Off Costs, a benefit from the resolution of the Cadbury acquisition-related indemnification, a favorable foreign currency impact net of the negative impact from the devaluation of our net monetary assets in Venezuela, gains on the sales of properties in 2013 and the impact of businesses divested in 2013 and 2012, which were partially offset by gains on sales of properties in 2012, higher Integration Program costs, higher 2012-2014 Restructuring Program costs and the inclusion of expenses related to the acquired biscuit operations in Morocco. Excluding these factors, selling, general and administrative expenses increased $246 million from 2012, driven primarily by higher overhead costs in emerging markets, including investments in sales capabilities and route-to-market expansion in emerging markets, the 2012 reversal of reserves carried over from the Cadbury acquisition in 2010 and no longer required, prior-year proceeds from insurance settlements and higher advertising and consumer promotion costs in Asia Pacific, EEMEA and Latin America. In 2013, we divested properties in Europe and India and recorded pre-tax gains of $68 million. In 2012, we divested properties in Russia and Turkey and recorded pre-tax gains of $77 million. The change in unrealized gains/(losses) added $61 million in operating income for 2013. Within asset impairment and exit costs, we also recorded in 2012 an asset impairment charge of $52 million related to a trademark in Japan. The acquisition of a biscuit operation in Morocco added $16 million in operating income for 2013. Accounting calendar changes that went into effect in Europe in the first quarter of 2013 increased operating income by $6 million. Unfavorable foreign currency decreased operating income by $200 million, due primarily to the devaluation of the Venezuelan bolivar (including the $54 million devaluation of our net monetary assets in Venezuela) and the strength of the U.S. dollar relative to most foreign currencies, including the Brazilian real, Argentinean peso, Indian rupee, Japanese yen, South African rand and Russian ruble, partially offset by the strength of the euro relative to the U.S. dollar. Operating income margin increased from 10.4% in 2012 to 11.2% in 2013. Adjusted Operating Income margin decreased from 12.2% in 2012 to 12.0% in 2013. The decrease in Adjusted Operating Income margin was driven primarily by a modest decline in gross margin, due to the timing of price increases to cover rising foreign exchange transaction costs on imported raw materials in the second half of the year, and the unfavorable currency impact due to the devaluation of our net monetary assets in Venezuela, partially offset by the benefit of leverage on our selling, general and administrative expenses. 31 Table of Contents Net Earnings and Earnings per Share Attributable to Mondelēz International – Net earnings attributable to Mondelēz International of $3,915 million increased by $848 million (27.6%) in 2013.

(2) Spin-Off costs include $62 million of pre-tax Spin-Off Costs in selling, general and administrative expense in 2013 and $444 million of pre-tax Spin-Off Costs in selling, general and administrative expense and $609 million of pre-tax Spin-Off Costs in interest expense in 2012. (3) Represents interest expense associated with the assumed reduction of $6 billion of our debt on January 1, 2011 from the utilization of funds received from the $6 billion of notes Kraft Foods Group issued in 2012 in connection with our Spin-Off capitalization plan. Note during the year ended December 31, 2012, a portion of the $6 billion of debt was retired. As such, we adjusted interest expense during this period as if this debt had been repaid on January 1, 2012 to ensure consistency of our assumption and related results. (4) Represents the estimated annual benefit plan expense associated with certain benefit plan obligations transferred to Kraft Foods Group in the Spin-Off. (5) Excludes the favorable foreign currency impact on interest expense related to our foreign denominated debt, the change in interest expense included in Spin-Off Costs and the change in interest expense associated with the assumed reduction of $6 billion of our debt on January 1, 2012 from the utilization of funds received from the $6 billion of notes Kraft Foods Group issued directly and cash proceeds distributed to us in June 2012 in connection with our Spin-Off capitalization plan. (6) On December 18, 2013, we completed a cash tender offer and retired $3.4 billion of outstanding long term debt. We recorded a pre-tax loss on debt extinguishment and related expenses of $612 million within interest expense for the amount paid to retire the debt in excess of its carrying value and from recognizing unamortized discounts and deferred financing costs in earnings at the time of the debt extinguishment. (7) As part of our 2010 Cadbury acquisition, we became the responsible party for tax matters under the Cadbury Schweppes Plc and Dr Pepper Snapple Group, Inc. (“DPSG”) Tax Sharing and Indemnification Agreement dated May 1, 2008 (“Tax Indemnity”) for certain 2007 and 2008 transactions relating to the demerger of Cadbury’s Americas Beverage business. A U.S. federal tax audit of DPSG for the 2006-2008 tax years was concluded with the IRS in August 2013. As a result, we recorded a favorable pre-tax impact of $385 million ($363 million net of tax) in 2013 due to the reversal of the accrued liability in excess of the amount we paid to DPSG under the Tax Indemnity. 32 Table of Contents 2012 compared with 2011 For the Years EndedDecember 31, 2012 2011 $ change % change (in millions, except per share data) Net revenues $ 35,015 $ 35,810 $ (795 ) (2.2% ) Operating income 3,637 3,498 139 4.0% Earnings from continuing operations 1,606 1,764 (158 ) (9.0% ) Net earnings attributable toMondelēz International 3,067 3,554 (487 ) (13.7% ) Diluted earnings per share fromcontinuing operations attributable toMondelēz International 0.88 0.99 (0.11 ) (11.1% ) Diluted earnings per share attributable toMondelēz International 1.71 2.01 (0.30 ) (14.9% ) Net Revenues – Net revenues decreased $795 million (2.2%) to $35,015 million in 2012, and Organic Net Revenues(1) increased $1,531 million (4.4%) to $36,347 million. The changes in net revenues and Organic Net Revenue are detailed below: Change in net revenues (by percentage point) Higher net pricing 3.3pp Favorable volume/mix 1.1pp Total change in Organic Net Revenues (1) 4.4% Unfavorable foreign currency (4.4)pp Impact of accounting calendar changes (including the 53rd week of shipments) (2.0)pp Impact of divestitures (0.2)pp Total change in net revenues (2.2)% (1) Please see the Non-GAAP Financial Measures section at the end of this item. Organic Net Revenue growth was driven by higher net pricing and favorable volume/mix. Higher net pricing, including the impact of pricing actions from the prior year, was realized across all reportable segments as we increased pricing to offset higher input costs. Favorable volume/mix was driven by higher shipments in Asia Pacific, EEMEA and Europe, partially offset by lower shipments in North America, driven primarily by the completion of a co-manufacturing agreement from a previous divestiture, and Latin America. Unfavorable foreign currency decreased net revenues by $1,576 million, due primarily to the strength of the U.S. dollar relative to most foreign currencies, primarily the euro, Brazilian real, Indian rupee, Argentinean peso, South African rand, Russian ruble and Mexican peso. Accounting calendar changes in 2011 resulted in a year-over-year decrease in net revenues of $679 million. The impact of divestitures also resulted in a year-over-year decrease in net revenues of $72 million. 33 Table of Contents Operating Income – Operating income increased $139 million (4.0%) to $3,637 million in 2012, Adjusted Operating Income(1) increased $138 million (3.4%) to $4,235 million and Adjusted Operating Income (on a constant currency basis)(1) increased $291 million (7.1%) to $4,388 million due to the following: Operating Income Change (in millions) (percentage point) Operating Income for the Year Ended December 31, 2011 $ 3,498 Integration Program costs 521 14.7pp Spin-Off pension expense adjustment (2) 91 2.7pp Spin-Off Costs 46 1.4pp Operating income from divested businesses (59 ) (1.5)pp Adjusted Operating Income for the Year Ended December 31, 2011 (1) $4,097 Higher net pricing 1,132 28.4pp Higher input costs (598 ) (15.0)pp Favorable volume/mix 114 2.8pp Higher selling, general and administrative expenses (293 ) (7.2)pp Impact of accounting calendar changes (93 ) (2.5)pp Gain on sale of property 55 1.3pp Intangible asset impairment charge (52 ) (1.3)pp Change in unrealized gains/losses on hedging activities 37 0.9pp Other, net (11 ) (0.3)pp Total change in Adjusted Operating Income (constant currency) (1) 291 7.1% Unfavorable foreign currency (153 ) (3.7)pp Total change in Adjusted Operating Income 138 3.4% Adjusted Operating Income for the Year Ended December 31, 2012 (1) $ 4,235 Spin-Off Costs (444 ) (12.3)pp Integration Program costs (140 ) (3.4)pp 2012-2014 Restructuring Program costs (110 ) (3.0)pp Spin-Off pension expense adjustment (2) (68 ) (1.9)pp Acquisition-related costs (1 ) (0.1)pp Net gain on divestitures 107 2.6pp Operating income from divested businesses 58 1.4pp Operating Income for the Year Ended December 31, 2012 $ 3,637 4.0% (1) Please see the Non-GAAP Financial Measures section at the end of this item. (2) Represents the estimated annual benefit plan expense associated with certain benefit plan obligations transferred to Kraft Foods Group in the Spin-Off. The estimate of $91 million was based on market conditions and benefit plan assumptions as of January 1, 2012. For the year ended December 31, 2012, a prorated estimate of $68 million was reflected for the nine months prior to the Spin-Off and transfer of the benefit plan obligations to Kraft Foods Group. Higher net pricing, including the impact of pricing actions taken in the prior year, outpaced increased input costs during 2012. The increase in input costs was driven by higher raw material costs, partially offset by lower manufacturing costs. Favorable volume/mix was driven by strong contributions from Europe, Asia Pacific and EEMEA, partially offset by an unfavorable impact in North America and Latin America. Total selling, general and administrative expenses decreased $206 million from 2011, including the benefits from a favorable impact of foreign currency on expenses, lower Integration Program costs (including the reversal of previously accrued Integration Program charges primarily related to planned and announced position eliminations that did not occur), higher expenses in the prior year related to accounting calendar changes, divested businesses and a gain on the sale of a property in Russia, which were partially offset by the Spin-Off Costs and 2012-2014 Restructuring Program costs incurred in 2012. Excluding these factors, selling, general and administrative expenses increased $293 million from 2011, driven primarily by higher advertising and consumer promotion costs in each of the geographic units, partially offset by the reversal of reserves carried over from the Cadbury acquisition in 2010 and no longer required. Accounting calendar changes made in 2011 (including the 53rd week of shipments in 2011) decreased operating income by $93 million. In 2012, we divested property located in Russia and recorded a pre-tax gain of $55 million. In addition, we divested properties located in Turkey in 2012 and in 2011 which had an immaterial year-over-year impact on operating income. During 2012, we recorded $52 million related to a trademark impairment in Japan. The change in unrealized gains / (losses) on hedging activities increased operating income by $37 million, as we recognized gains of $1 million in 2012, versus losses of $36 million in 2011. Unfavorable foreign currency decreased operating income by $153 million, due primarily to the strength of the U.S. dollar relative to most foreign currencies, primarily the euro, Brazilian real, Argentinean peso and Indian rupee, partially offset by the impact of adjustments in the prior year related to the highly inflationary Venezuelan economy. Operating income margin increased, from 9.8% in 2011 to 10.4% in 2012. Adjusted Operating Income margin increased from 11.5% in 2011 to 12.2% in 2012. The increase in Adjusted Operating Income margin was due primarily to a modest increase in gross margin, reflecting the impact of pricing actions net of increased input costs and the favorable change in unrealized gains on hedging activities, and overhead leverage, partially offset by the impact of higher advertising and consumer promotion costs. 34 Table of Contents Net Earnings and Earnings per Share Attributable to Mondelēz International – Net earnings attributable to Mondelēz International of $3,067 million decreased by $487 million (13.7%) in 2012.

Note during the year ended December 31, 2012, a portion of the $6 billion of debt was retired.

We have presented our segment results reflecting the changes for all periods presented. We manage the operations within Latin America, Asia Pacific and EEMEA by location and Europe and North America by product category. The following discussion compares our segment results from continuing operations for the following periods: For the Years Ended December 31, 2013 2012 2011 (in millions) Net revenues: Latin America $ 5,382 $ 5,396 $ 5,403 Asia Pacific 4,952 5,164 4,864 EEMEA 3,915 3,735 3,836 Europe 14,059 13,817 14,874 North America 6,991 6,903 6,833 Net revenues $ 35,299 $ 35,015 $ 35,810 Earnings from continuing operations before income taxes: Operating income: Latin America $ 570 $ 769 $ 759 Asia Pacific 512 657 682 EEMEA 379 506 433 Europe 1,699 1,762 1,586 North America 889 781 787 Unrealized gains / (losses) on hedging activities 62 1 (36 ) General corporate expenses (287 ) (728 ) (488 ) Amortization of intangibles (217 ) (217 ) (225 ) Benefit from indemnification resolution 336 – – Net gain on acquisition and divestitures 30 107 – Acquisition-related costs (2 ) (1 ) – Operating income 3,971 3,637 3,498 Interest and other expense, net (1,579 ) (1,863 ) (1,618 ) Earnings from continuing operations before income taxes $ 2,392 $ 1,774 $ 1,880 As discussed in Note 17, Segment Reporting, we use segment operating income to evaluate segment performance and allocate resources. We believe it is appropriate to disclose this measure to help investors analyze segment performance and trends. Coincident with the change in reportable segment structure, segment operating income for our North America region also changed to include all U.S. pension plan expenses, a portion of which was previously excluded from segment operating results evaluated by management as the costs were centrally managed. Segment operating income excludes unrealized gains and losses on hedging activities (which are a component of cost of sales), general corporate expenses (which are a component of selling, general and administrative expenses), amortization of intangibles, the benefit from the Cadbury acquisition-related indemnification resolution (which is a component of selling, general and administrative expenses), gains and losses on divestitures and acquisitions and acquisition-related costs (which are a component of 36 Table of Contents selling, general and administrative expenses) in all periods presented. We exclude unrealized gains and losses on hedging activities, general corporate expenses, amortization of intangibles, the benefit from the Cadbury acquisition-related indemnification resolution, gains and losses on divestitures and acquisitions and acquisition-related costs from segment operating income in order to provide better transparency of our segment operating results. Furthermore, we centrally manage interest and other expense, net. Accordingly, we do not present these items by segment because they are excluded from the segment profitability measure that management reviews. In connection with our 2012-2014 Restructuring Program, we recorded restructuring charges of $267 million in 2013 and $102 million in 2012 in operations, as a part of asset impairment and exit costs. We also recorded implementation costs of $63 million in 2013 and $8 million in 2012 in operations, as a part of cost of sales and selling, general and administrative expenses. These charges were recorded primarily within our EEMEA, Europe and North America segments. We recorded Integration Program charges of $216 million in 2013, $185 million in 2012 and $521 million in 2011. At December 31, 2013, $101 million of our net Integration Program liability was recorded within other current liabilities and $44 million, primarily related to leased facilities no longer in use, was recorded within other long-term liabilities. During 2012, within our Europe segment, we refined our estimate of 2010 Integration Program charges by $45 million primarily related to planned and announced position eliminations that did not occur upon concluding the majority of local workers council negotiations in April 2012. We recorded charges in the Integration Program in operations, as a part of selling, general and administrative expenses primarily within our Europe, Asia Pacific, Latin America and EEMEA segments as well as within general corporate expenses. In 2012, we recorded a $44 million benefit within our Europe segment related to the reversal of reserves carried over from the Cadbury acquisition in 2010 which was subsequently determined to not be required. In 2013, we acquired the remaining interest in a biscuit operation in Morocco, which is now a wholly-owned subsidiary within our EEMEA segment. We incurred acquisition-related costs of $7 million, which were recorded within selling, general and administrative expenses and interest and other expense, net. In 2013, we also recorded integration charges of $4 million within the segment operating income of EEMEA related to our acquisition of a biscuit operation in Morocco. We recorded these charges in selling, general and administrative expenses within our EEMEA segment. There were no significant acquisitions in 2012 or 2011. In 2013, we received cash proceeds of $60 million and pre-tax gains of $8 million for divestitures in Turkey, South Africa and Spain. In 2012, we completed several divestitures within our Europe segment which generated cash proceeds of $200 million and pre-tax gains of $107 million. The divestitures primarily included a dinners and sauces grocery business in Germany and Belgium and a canned meat business in Italy. In 2011, there were no significant divestitures. In 2013, we sold properties in Italy, the United Kingdom and Norway within our Europe segment and in India within our Asia Pacific segment. The Europe property sales generated $29 million in pre-tax net gains and $37 million of cash proceeds. We also have a $52 million receivable related to the United Kingdom property sale. The India property sale generated a $39 million pre-tax gain and $53 million of cash proceeds. The gains were recorded within selling, general and administrative expenses and cash proceeds were recorded in cash flows from other investing activities in the year ended December 31, 2013. In 2012, we sold property in Russia and Turkey within our EEMEA segment. The Turkey property sale generated a $22 million pre-tax gain and $29 million of cash proceeds and the Russia property sale generated a $55 million pre-tax gain and $72 million of cash proceeds. The gains were recorded within selling, general and administrative expenses and the cash proceeds from the sales were recorded in cash flows from other investing activities. On February 8, 2013, the Venezuelan government announced the devaluation of the official Venezuelan bolivar exchange rate from 4.30 bolivars to 6.30 bolivars to the U.S. dollar and the elimination of the second-tier, government-regulated SITME exchange rate previously applied to value certain types of transactions. In connection with the announced changes, we recorded a $54 million unfavorable foreign currency charge related to the devaluation of our net monetary assets in Venezuela. The charge was recorded in selling, general and administrative expenses within our Latin America segment. We also incurred net unfavorable devaluation-related foreign currency impacts within our pre-tax earnings of $67 million during the year ended December 31, 2013 related to translating the earnings of our Venezuelan subsidiary to the U.S. dollar at the new exchange rate. During 2012 and 2011, we recorded immaterial foreign currency impacts in connection with highly inflationary accounting for Venezuela. 37 Table of Contents On March 19, 2013, the Venezuelan government announced a new auction-based currency transaction program referred to as SICAD. SICAD allows entities in specific sectors to bid for U.S. dollars to be used for specified import transactions. The minimum exchange rate to be offered under SICAD is 6.30 bolivars to the U.S. dollar. As of the week ended December 30, 2013, the published SICAD rate offered was 11.30 bolivars to the U.S. dollar. To date, availability of U.S. dollars at either exchange rate continues to be limited. On January 24, 2014, the Venezuelan government announced the expansion of the SICAD auction program to prospective dividends and royalties and new profit margin controls. As our Venezuelan subsidiaries declare dividends or pay royalties in the future, based on the availability of U.S. dollars exchanged under the SICAD program, the realized exchange losses on payments made in U.S. dollars would be recognized in earnings. On profit level controls, we continue to evaluate the announced measures and will look to protect net revenues and profitability. In light of the current difficult macroeconomic environment in Venezuela, we continue to monitor and actively manage our investment and exposures in Venezuela. In 2013, our net revenues in Venezuela were approximately $800 million. At December 31, 2013, our net monetary assets denominated in the Venezuelan bolivar were $257 million in U.S. dollars applying the official exchange rate. If the official exchange rate were to devalue further or if the currently less favorable SICAD exchange rate were extended to apply to a greater portion of our net monetary assets in Venezuela, we could recognize a material devaluation charge in earnings. We continue to monitor the currency developments in Venezuela and take protective measures against currency devaluation such as converting monetary assets into non-monetary assets which we can use in our business. On January 23, 2014, the Central Bank of Argentina adjusted its currency policy, removed its currency stabilization measures and allowed the Argentine peso exchange rate to float relative to the U.S. dollar. The value of the Argentine peso relative to the U.S. dollar fell by 15% on that day, and further volatility in the exchange rate is likely. At this time, based on the current state of Argentine currency rules and regulations, the business environment remains challenging, however, we do not expect the existing controls and restrictions to have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations. In 2013, our net revenues in Argentina were approximately $800 million. We continue to monitor developments in Argentina and explore additional measures to protect our operations and net monetary position there. Net changes in unrealized gains / (losses) relate to currency and commodity hedging activity and were $62 million in 2013, $1 million in 2012 and $(36) million in 2011. Once the unrealized gains or losses become realized and the hedged item affects earnings, the realized gains or losses are reclassified to segment operating income. The 2013 decrease in general corporate expenses was due primarily to lower Spin-Off Costs and lower corporate functions and project expenses. Spin-Off Costs decreased $345 million from $407 to $62 million and corporate functions and project expenses decreased $69 million from $277 million to $208 million. The 2012 increase in general corporate expenses was due primarily to $407 million of Spin-Off Costs recorded within general corporate expenses, partially offset by lower Integration Program costs. As part of our 2010 Cadbury acquisition, we became the responsible party for tax matters under the Cadbury Schweppes Plc and Dr Pepper Snapple Group, Inc. (“DPSG”) Tax Sharing and Indemnification Agreement dated May 1, 2008 (“Tax Indemnity”) for certain 2007 and 2008 transactions relating to the demerger of Cadbury’s Americas Beverage business. A U.S. federal tax audit of DPSG for the 2006-2008 tax years was concluded with the IRS in August 2013. As a result, we recorded a favorable impact of $336 million in selling, general and administrative expenses and $49 million in interest and other expense, net for a total pre-tax impact of $385 million ($363 million net of tax) in 2013 due to the reversal of the accrued liability in excess of the amount we paid to DPSG under the Tax Indemnity. The 2013 decrease in interest and other expense, net was due primarily to the absence of Spin-Off Costs within interest expense as we recorded $609 million of Spin-Off Costs within interest expense in 2012, a reduction of long-term debt and a benefit from the Cadbury acquisition-related indemnification resolution. This was partially offset by a loss on debt extinguishment and related expenses of $612 million recorded within interest expense. The 2012 increase in interest and other expense, net was due primarily to $609 million of Spin-Off Costs recorded within interest expense, partially offset by a 2011 loss of $157 million related to several interest rate swaps that were settled in 2011, as well as lower long-term debt interest expense. 38 Table of Contents Latin America For the Years EndedDecember 31, 2013 2012 $ change % change (in millions) Net revenues $ 5,382 $ 5,396 $ (14 ) (0.3%) Segment operating income 570 769 (199 ) (25.9%) For the Years EndedDecember 31, 2012 2011 $ change % change (in millions) Net revenues $ 5,396 $ 5,403 $ (7 ) (0.1%) Segment operating income 769 759 10 1.3% 2013 compared with 2012: Net revenues decreased $14 million (0.3%), due to unfavorable foreign currency (12.6 pp), mostly offset by higher net pricing (11.4 pp) and favorable volume/mix (0.9 pp).

We have discussed the selection and disclosure of our critical accounting policies and estimates with our Audit Committee. The following is a review of the more significant assumptions and estimates, as well as the accounting policies we used to prepare our consolidated financial statements. Principles of Consolidation: The consolidated financial statements include Mondelēz International, as well as our wholly owned and majority owned subsidiaries. We account for investments in which we exercise significant influence (20%-50% ownership interest) under the equity method of accounting. We use the cost method of accounting for investments in which we have an ownership interest of less than 20% and in which we do not exercise significant influence. Noncontrolling interest in subsidiaries consists of the equity interest of noncontrolling investors in consolidated subsidiaries of Mondelēz International. All intercompany transactions are eliminated. Accounting Calendar Changes: In 2013, the majority of our operating subsidiaries report results as of the last calendar day of the period. In connection with moving to this common consolidation date, in the first quarter of 2013, we changed the consolidation date for our Europe segment from the last Saturday of each period to the last calendar day of each period. The change in the consolidation date for our Europe segment had a favorable impact of $37 million on net revenues and $6 million on operating income in 2013. At this time, primarily our North American operating subsidiaries continue to report results as of the last Saturday of the period. Prior to these changes, in 2012 and 2011, the majority of our operating subsidiaries reported results as of the last Saturday of the year. In 2011, the last Saturday of the year also fell on December 31, and so our 2011 results included one more week of operating results (“53rd week”) than 2013 or 2012, which each had 52 weeks. In 2011, we also changed the consolidation dates for certain operations of our Europe, Latin America and EEMEA segments. Previously, these operations primarily reported results two weeks prior to the end of the period. Subsequent to the 2011 changes, the majority of our Europe segment reported results as of the last Saturday of each period and certain operations within our Latin America and EEMEA segments began to report results as of the last calendar day of the period or the last Saturday of the period. These changes and the 53rd week in 2011 resulted in a favorable impact to net revenues of $679 million and a favorable impact of $93 million to operating income in 2011. We believe these changes will improve business planning and financial reporting by better matching the close dates of the operating subsidiaries and bringing the reporting dates closer to the period-end date. As the effect to prior-period results was not material, we have not revised prior-period results. Use of Estimates: We prepare our consolidated financial statements in accordance with U.S. GAAP, which require us to make estimates and assumptions that affect a number of amounts in our consolidated financial statements. Significant accounting policy elections, estimates and assumptions include, among others, pension and benefit plan assumptions, valuation assumptions of goodwill and intangible assets, useful lives of long-lived assets, marketing program accruals, insurance and self-insurance reserves and income taxes. We base our estimates on historical experience and other assumptions that we believe are reasonable. If actual amounts differ from estimates, we include the revisions in our consolidated results of operations in the period the actual amounts became known. Historically, the aggregate differences, if any, between our estimates and actual amounts in any year have not had a material effect on our consolidated financial statements. Inventories: Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market. We value all our inventories using the average cost method. We also record inventory allowances for overstocked and obsolete inventories due to ingredient and packaging changes. Long-Lived Assets: We review long-lived assets, including amortizable intangible assets, for impairment when conditions exist that indicate the carrying amount of the assets may not be fully recoverable. We perform undiscounted operating cash flow analyses to determine if an impairment exists. When testing for impairment of assets held for use, we group assets and liabilities at the lowest level for which cash flows are separately identifiable. If an impairment is determined to exist, the loss is calculated based on estimated fair value. Impairment losses on assets to be disposed of, if any, are based on the estimated proceeds to be received, less costs of disposal. 44 Table of Contents In connection with our 2012-2014 Restructuring Program, we recorded impairment charges of $91 million in 2013 and $18 million in 2012. Goodwill and Non-Amortizable Intangible Assets: We test goodwill and non-amortizable intangible assets for impairment at least annually on October 1. We assess goodwill impairment risk by first performing a qualitative review of entity-specific, industry, market and general economic factors for each reporting unit. If significant potential goodwill impairment risk exists for a specific reporting unit, we apply a two-step quantitative test. The first step compares the reporting unit’s estimated fair value with its carrying value. We estimate a reporting unit’s fair value using a 20-year projection of discounted cash flows which incorporates planned growth rates, market-based discount rates and estimates of residual value. For reporting units within our North America and Europe geographic units, we used a market-based, weighted-average cost of capital of 6.6% to discount the projected cash flows of those operations. For our Latin America, Asia Pacific and EEMEA reporting units, we used a risk-rated discount rate of 9.6%. Estimating the fair value of individual reporting units requires us to make assumptions and estimates regarding our future plans, industry and economic conditions and our actual results and conditions may differ over time. If the carrying value of a reporting unit’s net assets exceeds its fair value, the second step is applied to measure the difference between the carrying value and implied fair value of goodwill. If the carrying value of goodwill exceeds its implied fair value, the goodwill is considered impaired and reduced to its implied fair value. In 2013, 2012 and 2011, there were no impairments of goodwill. In connection with our 2013 annual impairment testing, we noted one reporting unit which was more sensitive to near-term changes in discounted cash flow assumptions: U.S. Confections with $2,177 million of goodwill as of December 31, 2013 and fair value in excess of its carrying value of net assets of 12%. While the reporting unit passed the first step of the impairment test, if the segment operating income or another valuation assumption were to deteriorate significantly in the future, it could adversely affect the estimated fair value. If we are unsuccessful in our plans to increase the profitability of this business, the estimated fair value could decline and lead to a potential goodwill impairment in the future. We test non-amortizable intangible assets for impairment by first performing a qualitative review by assessing events and circumstances that could affect the fair value or carrying value of the indefinite-lived intangible asset. If significant potential impairment risk exists for a specific non-amortizable intangible asset, we quantitatively test for impairment by comparing the fair value of each intangible asset with its carrying value. Fair value of non-amortizable intangible assets is determined using planned growth rates, market-based discount rates and estimates of royalty rates. If the carrying value of the asset exceeds its fair value, the intangible asset is considered impaired and is reduced to its estimated fair value. We record intangible asset impairment charges within asset impairment and exit costs. During our 2013 and 2011 reviews of non-amortizable intangible assets, there were no impairments identified. During our 2013 impairment testing, we noted 7 brands with $511 million of aggregate book value as of December 31, 2013 and fair value in excess of book value of 10% or less. While these intangible assets passed our annual impairment testing and though we believe that our current plans for each of these brands will allow them to continue to not be impaired, if expectations are not met or specific valuation factors outside of our control, such as discount rates, change significantly, then a brand or brands might become impaired in the future. In 2012, we recorded $52 million of charges related to a trademark on a Japanese chewing gum product within our Asia Pacific segment. Insurance and Self-Insurance: We use a combination of insurance and self-insurance for a number of risks, including workers’ compensation, general liability, automobile liability, product liability and our obligation for employee healthcare benefits. We estimate the liabilities associated with these risks by evaluating and making judgments about historical claims experience and other actuarial assumptions and the estimated impact on future results. Revenue Recognition: We recognize revenues when title and risk of loss pass to customers, which generally occurs upon shipment or delivery of goods. Revenues are recorded net of consumer incentives and trade promotions and include all shipping and handling charges billed to customers. Our shipping and handling costs are classified as part of cost of sales. A provision for product returns and allowances for bad debts is also recorded as reductions to revenues within the same period that the revenue is recognized. 45 Table of Contents Marketing and Research and Development: We promote our products with advertising, consumer incentives and trade promotions. These programs include, but are not limited to, discounts, coupons, rebates, in-store display incentives and volume-based incentives. We expense advertising costs either in the period the advertising first takes place or as incurred. Consumer incentive and trade promotion activities are recorded as a reduction to revenues based on amounts estimated due to customers and consumers at the end of a period. We base these estimates principally on historical utilization and redemption rates. For interim reporting purposes, advertising and consumer incentive expenses are charged to operations as a percentage of volume, based on estimated volume and related expense for the full year. We do not defer costs on our year-end consolidated balance sheet and all marketing costs are recorded as an expense in the year incurred. Advertising expense was $1,721 million in 2013, $1,815 million in 2012 and $1,860 million in 2011. We expense product research and development costs as incurred. Research and development expense was $471 million in 2013, $462 million in 2012 and $511 million in 2011. We record marketing and research and development expenses within selling, general and administrative expenses. Environmental Costs: Throughout the countries in which we do business, we are subject to local, national and multi-national environmental laws and regulations relating to the protection of the environment. We have programs across our business units designed to meet applicable environmental compliance requirements. In the United States, the laws and regulations include the Clean Air Act, the Clean Water Act, the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act and the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act (“CERCLA”). CERCLA imposes joint and severable liability on each potentially responsible party. As of December 31, 2013 and 2012, our subsidiaries were involved in one active proceeding in the U.S. under a state equivalent of CERCLA related to our current operations. As of December 31, 2013 and 2012, we had accrued an immaterial amount for environmental remediation. Based on information currently available, we believe that the ultimate resolution of the existing environmental remediation and our compliance with environmental laws and regulations will not have a material effect on our financial results. Employee Benefit Plans: We provide a range of benefits to our current and retired employees. Depending on jurisdictions, tenure, presence of a union, job level and other factors, these include pension benefits, postretirement health care benefits and postemployment benefits, consisting primarily of severance. We record amounts relating to these plans based on calculations specified by U.S. GAAP. These calculations require the use of various actuarial assumptions, such as discount rates, assumed rates of return on plan assets, compensation increases, turnover rates and health care cost trend rates. We review our actuarial assumptions on an annual basis and make modifications to the assumptions based on current rates and trends when appropriate. As permitted by U.S. GAAP, we generally amortize any effect of the modifications over future periods. We believe that the assumptions used in recording our plan obligations are reasonable based on our experience and advice from our actuaries. Refer to Note 10, Benefit Plans, to the consolidated financial statements for a discussion of the assumptions used. In connection with the Spin-Off, we transferred to Kraft Foods Group the plan liabilities and assets associated with the Kraft Foods Group active and retired employees and certain of our retired employees that previously participated in our North American benefit plans. At October 1, 2012, we transferred benefit plan liabilities of $12,218 million, pension plan assets of $6,550 million, accumulated other comprehensive losses, net of tax, of $3,810 million and $2,146 million of related deferred tax assets. We recorded the following amounts in earnings from continuing operations for employee benefit plans during the years ended December 31, 2013, 2012 and 2011: 2013 2012 2011 (in millions) U.S. pension plan cost $ 122 $ 168 $ 118 Non-U.S. pension plan cost 235 220 180 Postretirement health care cost 35 84 66 Postemployment benefit plan cost 11 15 49 Employee savings plan cost 66 74 62 Multiemployer pension plan contributions 32 28 27 Multiemployer medical plan contributions 18 18 16 Net expense for employee benefit plans $ 519 $ 607 $ 518 46 Table of Contents The 2013 net expense for employee benefit plans of $519 million decreased by $88 million and was primarily related to certain benefit plan obligations transferred to Kraft Foods Group in the Spin-Off and other 2012 one-time costs, partially offset by increased benefit plan expenses in 2013 due to lower discount rates. The 2012 net expense for employee benefit plans of $607 million increased by $89 million and was primarily related to higher amortization of the net loss from experience differences related to the U.S. and non-U.S. pension plans. We expect our 2014 net expense for employee benefit plans to decrease by approximately $95 million, primarily due to higher discount rates and favorable asset performance. In 2013, other comprehensive losses included $713 million of net actuarial pre-tax gains primarily related to the increase in the discount rate utilized to determine our pension plan benefit obligations at December 31, 2013 (90 basis point increase for U.S. plans and 19 basis point increase for non-U.S. plans) and favorable differences between our expected and actual return on pension plan assets, as well as the increase in the discount rate utilized to determine our postretirement benefit obligations at December 31, 2013 (90 basis point increase for U.S. plans and 73 basis point increase for our non-U.S. plans). In 2012, other comprehensive losses included $2,266 million of net actuarial pre-tax losses primarily related to the decrease in the discount rate utilized to determine our pension plan benefit obligations at December 31, 2012 (65 basis point decrease for U.S. plans and 81 basis point decrease for non-U.S. plans) and the decrease in the discount rate utilized to determine our postretirement benefit obligations at December 31, 2012 (50 basis point decrease for U.S. plans and 21 basis point decrease for non-U.S. plans). In 2011, other comprehensive losses included $2,333 million of net actuarial pre-tax losses primarily related to the decrease in the discount rate utilized to determine our pension plan benefit obligations at December 31, 2011 (68 basis point decrease for U.S. plans and 49 basis point decrease for non-U.S. plans), unfavorable differences between our expected and actual return on pension plan assets and the decrease in the discount rate utilized to determine our postretirement benefit obligations at December 31, 2011 (60 basis point decrease for U.S. plans and 73 basis point decrease for non-U.S. plans). In 2013, we contributed $178 million to our U.S. pension plans and $330 million to our non-U.S. pension plans. In addition, employees contributed $20 million to our non-U.S. plans. Of our 2013 pension contributions, $163 million was voluntary. We make contributions to our U.S. and non-U.S. pension plans primarily to the extent that they are tax deductible and do not generate an excise tax liability. In 2014, we estimate that our pension contributions will be $10 million to our U.S. plans and $309 million to our non-U.S. plans based on current tax laws. Of the total 2014 pension contributions, none is expected to be voluntary. Our actual contributions may be different due to many factors, including changes in tax and other benefit laws, significant differences between expected and actual pension asset performance or interest rates, or other factors. For salaried and non-union hourly employees hired in the U.S. after January 1, 2009, we discontinued benefits under our U.S. pension plans, and we replaced them with an enhanced company contribution to our employee savings plan. Additionally, we will be freezing the U.S. pension plans for current salaried and non-union hourly employees effective December 31, 2019. For our postretirement plans, our 2014 health care cost trend rate assumption decreased to 7.00% from 7.50% for our U.S. postretirement plans and decreased to 4.76% from 6.47% for our non-U.S. postretirement plans. We established these rates based upon our most recent experience as well as our expectation for health care trend rates going forward. We anticipate that our health care cost trend rate assumption will be 5.0% for U.S. plans by 2018 and 5.54% for non-U.S. plans by 2019. Assumed health care cost trend rates have a significant effect on the amounts reported for the health care plans. A one-percentage-point change in assumed health care cost trend rates would have the following effects on our costs and obligation as of December 31, 2013: One-Percentage-Point Increase Decrease (in millions) Effect on postretirement benefit obligation $ 66 $ (53 ) Effect on annual service and interest cost $ 6 $ (5 ) 47 Table of Contents Our 2014 discount rate assumption increased to 5.10% from 4.20% for our U.S. postretirement plans and increased to 4.81% from 4.08% for our non-U.S. postretirement plans. Our 2014 discount rate increased to 5.10% from 4.20% for our U.S. pension plans and increased to 4.00% from 3.81% for our non-U.S. pension plans. We model U.S., Canadian, Eurozone and United Kingdom discount rates using a portfolio of high quality, fixed-income debt instruments with durations that match the expected future cash flows of the benefit obligations. We developed the discount rates for the remaining non-U.S. plans from local bond indices that match local benefit obligations as closely as possible. Changes in our discount rates were primarily the result of changes in bond yields year-over-year. Our 2014 expected rate of return on plan assets remained constant at 7.75% for our U.S. pension plans. We determine our expected rate of return on plan assets from the plan assets’ historical long-term investment performance, current asset allocation and estimates of future long-term returns by asset class. We attempt to maintain our target asset allocation by rebalancing between asset classes as we make contributions and monthly benefit payments. Our 2014 expected rate of return on plan assets increased to 6.18% from 6.08% for our non-U.S. pension plans. We determine our expected rate of return on plan assets from the plan assets’ historical long-term investment performance, current asset allocation and estimates of future long-term returns by asset class. While we do not anticipate further changes in the 2014 assumptions for our U.S. and non-U.S. pension and postretirement health care plans, as a sensitivity measure, a fifty-basis point change in our discount rates or the expected rate of return on plan assets would have the following effects, increase / (decrease) in cost, as of December 31, 2013: U.S. Plans Non-U.S. Plans Fifty-Basis-Point Fifty-Basis-Point Increase Decrease Increase Decrease (in millions) Effect of change in discount rate onpension costs $ (16 ) $ 17 $ (36 ) $ 57 Effect of change in expected rate ofreturn on plan assets on pension costs (4 ) 4 (35 ) 35 Effect of change in discount rate onpostretirement health care costs (3 ) 4 (1 ) 1 Financial Instruments: We use certain financial instruments to manage our foreign currency exchange rate, commodity price and interest rate risks. We monitor and manage these exposures as part of our overall risk management program which focuses on the unpredictability of financial markets and seeks to reduce the potentially adverse effects that the volatility of these markets may have on our operating results. A principal objective of our risk management strategies is to reduce significant, unanticipated earnings fluctuations that may arise from volatility in foreign currency exchange rates, commodity prices and interest rates, principally through the use of derivative instruments. We use a combination of primarily foreign currency forward contracts, futures, options and swaps; commodity forward contracts, futures and options; and interest rate swaps to manage our exposure to cash flow variability, protect the value of our existing foreign currency assets and liabilities and protect the value of our debt. See Note 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, and Note 9, Financial Instruments, to the consolidated financial statements for more information on the types of derivative instruments we use. We record derivative financial instruments at fair value in our consolidated balance sheets within other current assets or other current liabilities due to their relatively short-term duration. Cash flows from derivative instruments are classified in the consolidated statements of cash flows based on the nature of the derivative instrument. Changes in the fair value of a derivative that is designated as a cash flow hedge, to the extent that the hedge is effective, are recorded in accumulated other comprehensive earnings / (losses) and reclassified to earnings when the hedged item affects earnings. Changes in fair value of economic hedges and the ineffective portion of all hedges are recognized in current period earnings. Changes in the fair value of a derivative that is designated as a fair value hedge, along with the changes in the fair value of the related hedged asset or liability, are recorded in earnings in the same period. We use foreign currency denominated debt to hedge a portion of our net investment in foreign operations against adverse movements in exchange rates, with changes in the value of the debt recorded within currency translation adjustment in accumulated other comprehensive earnings / (losses). 48 Table of Contents In order to qualify for hedge accounting, a specified level of hedging effectiveness between the derivative instrument and the item being hedged must exist at inception and throughout the hedged period. We must also formally document the nature of and relationship between the derivative and the hedged item, as well as our risk management objectives, strategies for undertaking the hedge transaction and method of assessing hedge effectiveness. Additionally, for a hedge of a forecasted transaction, the significant characteristics and expected term of the forecasted transaction must be specifically identified, and it must be probable that the forecasted transaction will occur. If it is no longer probable that the hedged forecasted transaction will occur, we would recognize the gain or loss related to the derivative in earnings. When we use derivatives, we are exposed to credit and market risks. Credit risk exists when a counterparty to a derivative contract might fail to fulfill its performance obligations under the contract. We minimize our credit risk by entering into transactions with counterparties with high quality, investment grade credit ratings, limiting the amount of exposure with each counterparty and monitoring the financial condition of our counterparties. We also maintain a policy of requiring that all significant, non-exchange traded derivative contracts with a duration of one year or longer are governed by an International Swaps and Derivatives Association master agreement. Market risk exists when the value of a derivative or other financial instrument might be adversely affected by changes in market conditions and foreign currency exchange rates, commodity prices, or interest rates. We manage market risk by limiting the types of derivative instruments and derivative strategies we use and the degree of market risk that we plan to hedge through the use of derivative instruments. Income Taxes: We recognize tax benefits in our financial statements when uncertain tax positions are assessed more likely than not to be sustained upon audit. The amount we recognize is measured as the largest amount of benefit that is greater than 50 percent likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement. We recognize deferred tax assets for deductible temporary differences, operating loss carryforwards and tax credit carryforwards. Deferred tax assets are reduced by a valuation allowance if it is more likely than not that some portion, or all, of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. Contingencies See Note 12, Commitments and Contingencies, to the consolidated financial statements. New Accounting Guidance See Note 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, to the consolidated financial statements for a discussion of new accounting standards. 49 Table of Contents Commodity Trends We purchase and use large quantities of commodities, including sugar and other sweeteners, coffee, cocoa, wheat, corn products, soybean and vegetable oils and dairy. In addition, we purchase and use significant quantities of packaging materials to package our products and natural gas, fuels and electricity for our factories and warehouses. We regularly monitor worldwide supply and cost trends of these commodities so we can cost-effectively secure ingredients and packaging required for production. Significant cost items in biscuits, chocolate, gum, candy and many powdered beverage products are sugar and cocoa. We purchase sugar and cocoa on world markets, and the quality and availability of supply and changes in foreign currencies affect the prices of these commodities. Cocoa bean and cocoa butter costs rose significantly in the second half of 2013 due to growing demand for chocolate combined with the threat of reduced supply because of poor weather conditions in some of the major cocoa producing countries. Significant cost items in our biscuit products are grains (primarily wheat, corn and soybean oil). In recent years, grain costs have been affected largely by the burgeoning global demand for food, livestock feed and biofuels such as ethanol and biodiesel, as well as other factors such as weather. The most significant cost item in coffee products is green coffee beans, which we purchase on world markets as well as from local grower cooperatives. Green coffee bean prices are affected by the quality and availability of supply, changes in the value of the U.S. dollar in relation to other currencies and consumer demand for coffee products. In 2013, coffee bean costs fell dramatically primarily due to increased supply and bumper crops in a few of the major coffee producing countries such as Brazil. Significant cost items in packaging include cardboards, resins and plastics, and our energy costs include natural gas, electricity and diesel fuel. We purchase these packaging and energy commodities on world markets and within the countries where we operate. Supply and changes in foreign currencies affect the prices of these commodities. During 2013, the primary drivers of the increase in our aggregate commodity costs were increased dairy, packaging, grains and oils and local raw material costs as well as higher foreign exchange costs on our commodity purchases. These costs were partially offset by lower coffee bean costs in 2013. We generally price to protect gross profit dollars. We address higher commodity costs and currency impacts primarily through higher pricing, hedging, and manufacturing and overhead cost control. In particular for the coffee category, we adjust our prices and pass through changes in green coffee costs, which affect our net revenues but generally do not affect our bottom-line profitability over time. Our pricing actions may lag commodity cost changes temporarily as competitive or market conditions, planned trade or promotional incentives, or other factors could affect the timing of pricing decisions. We expect price volatility and a slightly higher aggregate cost environment to continue over the remainder of 2014. A number of external factors such as weather conditions, commodity market conditions, currency fluctuations and the effects of governmental agricultural programs affect the cost of raw materials and agricultural materials used in our products. We also use hedging techniques to limit the impact of fluctuations in the cost of our principal raw materials. However, we do not fully hedge against changes in commodity costs and our hedging strategies may not protect us from increases in specific raw material costs. While the costs of our principal raw materials fluctuate, we believe there will continue to be an adequate supply of the raw materials we use and that they will generally remain available from numerous sources. However, any significant constraints in the supply of key commodities may limit our ability to grow our net revenues for a period of time. 50 Table of Contents Liquidity and Capital Resources We believe that our cash from operations, our new $4.5 billion revolving credit facility (which supports our commercial paper program) and our authorized long-term financing will provide sufficient liquidity to meet our working capital needs, planned capital expenditures, future contractual obligations, share repurchases and payment of our anticipated quarterly dividends. We continue to maintain investment grade credit ratings on our debt. We continue to utilize our commercial paper program, primarily uncommitted international credit lines and long-term debt issuances for regular funding requirements. We also use intercompany loans with foreign subsidiaries to improve financial flexibility. Overall, we do not expect any negative effects to our funding sources that would have a material effect on our liquidity, including the indefinite reinvestment of our foreign earnings. The cash flow activity of the Kraft Foods Group discontinued operation, which was divested on October 1, 2012, is included within our consolidated cash flow results for periods prior to October 1, 2012. Net Cash Provided by Operating Activities: Operating activities provided net cash of $6,410 million in 2013, $3,923 million in 2012 and $4,520 million in 2011. The increase in operating cash flows in 2013 relative to 2012 was primarily related to the receipt of $2.6 billion of net cash received from the resolution of the Starbucks arbitration, lower spending on Spin-Off Costs and the 2012-2014 Restructuring Program, lengthening of days payables are outstanding, increased collection of receivables and lower interest payments. The decrease in operating cash flows in 2012 relative to 2011 was primarily related to higher spending associated with Spin-Off Costs and the 2012-2014 Restructuring Program, partially offset by lower net working capital costs (primarily related to favorable inventory positions due to higher inventory costs in 2011 and favorable accounts payable positions, partially offset by increased receivables). Net Cash Used in Investing Activities: Net cash used in investing activities was $1,483 million in 2013, $1,687 million in 2012 and $1,728 million in 2011. The decrease in net cash used in investing activities in 2013 relative to 2012 related to payments made to Kraft Foods Group in 2012 related to the Spin-Off, partially offset by cash paid, net of cash received, in connection with the 2013 acquisition of a biscuit operation in Morocco and lower proceeds on divestitures in 2013. The decrease in net cash used in investing activities in 2012 relative to 2011 related to proceeds received from our divested businesses and lower capital expenditures in the current year, partially offset by cash transferred to Kraft Foods Group related to the Spin-Off. Capital expenditures, which were funded by operating activities and include expenditures for Kraft Foods Group in all periods prior to October 1, 2012, were $1,622 million in 2013, $1,610 million in 2012 and $1,771 million in 2011. The 2013 capital expenditures were made primarily to modernize manufacturing facilities and support new product and productivity initiatives. We expect 2014 capital expenditures to be up to $2.0 billion, including capital expenditures required for investments in systems and the 2012-2014 Restructuring Program. We expect to continue to fund these expenditures from operations. Net Cash (Used in) / Provided by Financing Activities: Net cash used in financing activities was $6,645 million in 2013, $204 million provided in 2012 and $3,175 million used in 2011. The decrease in net cash provided by financing activities in 2013 relative to 2012 was primarily due to lower net proceeds from the issuance of long-term debt, higher re-payment of long-term debt and repurchase of Common Stock, partially offset by lower dividend payments reflecting our new capital structure and dividend rate following the Spin-Off and higher short-term borrowings. The increase in net cash provided by financing activities in 2012 relative to 2011 was primarily due to higher proceeds from the issuance of long-term debt (including notes issued by Kraft Foods Group in June 2012 for which we retained the proceeds), offset by higher long-term debt repayments. The net cash used in 2011 primarily related to $2,043 million in dividends paid, $1,114 million in long-term debt repayments and $565 million in repayments of short-term borrowings, partially offset by $492 million in primarily proceeds from stock option exercises within other financing activities. Borrowing Arrangements: On October 11, 2013, we entered into a revolving credit agreement for a $4.5 billion five-year senior unsecured revolving credit facility. The agreement replaced our former revolving credit agreement, which was terminated upon the signing of the new agreement. The revolving credit agreement includes a covenant that we maintain a minimum shareholders’ equity of at least $24.6 billion, excluding accumulated other comprehensive earnings / (losses) and the cumulative effects of any changes in accounting principles. At December 31, 2013, we met the covenant as our minimum shareholders’ equity was $35.3 billion. The revolving credit agreement also contains customary representations, covenants and events of default. However, there are no credit rating triggers, provisions or other financial covenants that could require us to post collateral as security. We intend to use the revolving credit facility for general corporate purposes, including for working capital purposes and to support our commercial paper program. As of December 31, 2013, no amounts were drawn on the facility. 51 Table of Contents Some of our international subsidiaries maintain primarily uncommitted credit lines to meet short-term working capital needs. Collectively, these credit lines amounted to $2.4 billion at December 31, 2013 and 2012. Borrowings on these lines amounted to $226 million at December 31, 2013 and $274 million at December 31, 2012. Long-term Debt: Our total debt was $17.1 billion at December 31, 2013 and $19.4 billion at December 31, 2012. Our debt-to-capitalization ratio was 0.35 at December 31, 2013 and 0.38 at December 31, 2012. At December 31, 2013, the weighted-average term of our outstanding long-term debt was 9.8 years. On February 6, 2014, we completed a cash tender offer and retired $1.56 billion of our long-term U.S. dollar debt consisting of: • $393 million of our 7.000% Notes due in August 2037 • $382 million of our 6.875% Notes due in February 2038 • $250 million of our 6.875% Notes due in January 2039 • $535 million of our 6.500% Notes due in February 2040 We financed the repurchase of these notes, including the payment of accrued interest and other costs incurred, from net proceeds received from the $3.0 billion notes issuance on January 16, 2014. In connection with retiring this debt, during the first quarter of 2014, we recorded a $492 million loss on extinguishment of debt within interest expense related to the amount we paid to retire the debt in excess of its carrying value and from recognizing unamortized discounts and deferred financing costs in earnings at the time of the debt extinguishment. We also recognized $2.5 million in interest expense related to interest rate cash flow hedges which were deferred in accumulated other comprehensive losses and recognized into earnings over the life of the debt. Upon extinguishing the debt, the deferred cash flow hedge amounts were recorded in earnings. On January 16, 2014, we issued $3.0 billion of U.S. dollar notes, consisting of: • $400 million of floating rate notes which bear interest at a rate equal to three-month LIBOR plus 0.52% and mature on February 1, 2019 • $850 million of 2.250% fixed rate notes which mature on February 1, 2019 • $1,750 million of 4.000% fixed rate notes which mature on February 1, 2024 We received net proceeds of $2,982 million that were used in part to fund the February 2014 tender offer and for other general corporate purposes. We recorded approximately $18 million of discounts and deferred financing costs, which will be amortized into interest expense over the life of the notes. On December 18, 2013, we completed a cash tender offer and retired $3.4 billion of our long-term U.S. dollar debt consisting of: • $910 million of our 6.500% Notes due in August 2017 • $729 million of our 6.125% Notes due in February 2018 • $334 million of our 6.125% Notes due in August 2018 • $1,467 million of our 5.375% Notes due in February 2020 We financed the repurchase of these notes, including the payment of accrued interest and other costs, with net proceeds received from the €2.4 billion notes issuance on December 11, 2013, cash on hand and commercial paper issuances. We recorded a $608 million loss on extinguishment of debt within interest expense related to the amount we paid to retire the debt in excess of its carrying value and from recognizing unamortized discounts and deferred financing costs in earnings at the time of the debt extinguishment. We also recognized $4 million in interest expense related to interest rate cash flow hedges which were deferred in accumulated other comprehensive losses and recognized into earnings over the life of the debt. Upon extinguishing the debt, the deferred cash flow hedge amounts were recorded in earnings. On December 11, 2013, we issued €2.4 billion of Euro notes, or approximately $3.3 billion in U.S. dollars as of December 31, 2013, consisting of: • €400 million (or $550 million) of floating rate notes which bear interest at a rate equal to three-month EURIBOR plus 0.50% and mature on June 11, 2015 • €750 million (or $1,031 million) of 1.125% fixed rate notes which mature on January 26, 2017 • €1,250 million (or $1,718 million) of 2.375% fixed rate notes which mature on January 26, 2021 We received net proceeds of €2,381 million, or $3,239 million in U.S. dollars, on December 11, 2013, that were used to partially fund the December 2013 tender offer. We also recorded approximately $27 million of discounts and deferred financing costs, which will be amortized into interest expense over the life of the notes. On October 1, 2013, $1 billion of our 5.125% U.S. dollar notes and $800 million of our 5.250% U.S. dollar notes matured. The notes and accrued interest to date were paid with cash on hand and the issuance of commercial paper. 52 Table of Contents On May 8, 2013, $1 billion of our 2.625% U.S. dollar notes matured. The notes and accrued interest to date were paid with cash on hand and the issuance of commercial paper. On February 11, 2013, $750 million of our 6.00% U.S. dollar notes matured. The notes and accrued interest to date were paid with cash on hand. On October 2, 2012, our $150 million Canadian dollar variable rate loan matured. The loan and accrued interest to date were repaid with cash from operations. On October 1, 2012, approximately $10 billion of our U.S. dollar debt on our balance sheet at September 30, 2012 was transferred to or retained by Kraft Foods Group. As described below, the debt primarily included: $6.0 billion of senior unsecured notes issued on June 4, 2012; $3.6 billion of debt exchanged on July 18, 2012; and $400 million migrated on October 1, 2012. See Note 2, Divestitures and Acquisition, for more information regarding the Spin-Off and liabilities transferred. On October 1, 2012, in connection with the Spin-Off and related debt capitalization plan, a $400 million 7.55% senior unsecured U.S. dollar note was retained by Kraft Foods Group. No cash was generated from the transaction. On July 18, 2012, we completed a debt exchange in which $3.6 billion of our U.S. dollar debt held by third-party note holders was exchanged for notes issued by Kraft Foods Group in order to migrate debt to Kraft Foods Group in connection with our Spin-Off capitalization plan. No cash was generated from the exchange and we incurred one-time financing costs of $18 million which we recorded in interest expense. As a result of the exchange, we retired the following debt: • $596 million of our 6.125% Notes due in February 2018 • $439 million of our 6.125% Notes due in August 2018 • $900 million of our 5.375% Notes due in February 2020 • $233 million of our 6.875% Notes due in January 2039 • $290 million of our 6.875% Notes due in February 2038 • $185 million of our 7.000% Notes due in August 2037 • $170 million of our 6.500% Notes due in November 2031 • $787 million of our 6.500% Notes due in 2040 On June 4, 2012, Kraft Foods Group issued $6.0 billion of senior unsecured U.S. dollar notes and distributed $5.9 billion of net proceeds to us in connection with the Spin-Off capitalization plan. We used the proceeds to pay $3.6 billion of outstanding commercial paper borrowings and expect to use the remaining cash proceeds to pay down additional debt over time or for general corporate purposes. This debt and approximately $260 million of related deferred financing costs were retained by Kraft Foods Group in the Spin-Off. On June 1, 2012, $900 million of our 6.25% U.S. dollar notes matured. The notes and accrued interest to date were repaid using primarily commercial paper borrowings which were subsequently repaid from the $5.9 billion of net proceeds received from the Kraft Foods Group $6.0 billion notes issuance on June 4, 2012. On March 20, 2012, €2.0 billion of our 5.75% Euro bonds matured. The bonds and accrued interest to date were repaid using proceeds from the issuance of commercial paper which was subsequently repaid in June 2012 as discussed above. On January 10, 2012, we issued $800 million of floating rate U.S. dollar notes which bear interest at a rate equal to three-month LIBOR plus 0.875%. We received net proceeds of $798.8 million from the issuance. The notes were set to mature on July 10, 2013 or subject to a mandatory redemption tied to the public announcement of the Record Date for the Spin-Off. After announcing the Record Date, on September 24, 2012, the notes were redeemed at a redemption price equal to 100% of the aggregate principal amount of the notes, or $800 million, plus accrued interest of $2 million from cash on hand. We expect to continue to comply with our long-term debt covenants. Refer to Note 8, Debt and Borrowing Arrangements, for further details of these debt offerings. From time to time, we refinance long-term and short-term debt. The nature and amount of our long-term and short-term debt and the proportionate amount of each varies as a result of future business requirements, market conditions and other factors. As of December 31, 2013, we had $7.9 billion remaining in long-term financing authority from our Board of Directors. 53 Table of Contents In the next twelve months, $997 billion of long-term debt becomes due as follows: $500 million in February 2014 and $497 million in December 2014. We expect to fund these repayments with cash from operations and the issuance of commercial paper. Equity and Dividends Stock Plans: See Note 11, Stock Plans, to the consolidated financial statements for more information on our stock plans, awards activity during 2013, 2012 and 2011, and stock award modifications related to the Spin-Off. Share Repurchases: During 2013, our Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of $7.7 billion of our Common Stock. On March 12, 2013, our Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of up to the lesser of 40 million shares or $1.2 billion of our Common Stock through March 12, 2016. On August 6, 2013, our Audit Committee, with authorization from the Board of Directors, increased the repurchase program capacity to $6.0 billion of Common Stock repurchases and extended the expiration date to December 31, 2016. On December 3, 2013, our Board of Directors increased the repurchase program capacity by $1.7 billion to $7.7 billion. Repurchases under the program are determined by management and are wholly discretionary. During 2013, we repurchased 82.8 million shares of Common Stock at an average cost of $33.09 per share, or an aggregate cost of $2.7 billion. The share repurchases include $1.5 billion of shares repurchased through an accelerated share repurchase program initiated on December 3, 2013. All share repurchases were funded through available cash, including cash from the resolution of the Starbucks arbitration (see Notes 12, Commitments and Contingencies, and 2, Divestitures and Acquisition, discussion of the Resolution of Starbucks Arbitration), and commercial paper issuances. The repurchased shares are held in treasury. As of December 31, 2013, we have $5.0 billion in remaining share repurchase capacity. We intend to continue to use a portion of our cash for share repurchases. The number of shares that we ultimately repurchase under our share repurchase program may vary depending on numerous factors, including share price and other market conditions, our ongoing capital allocation planning, levels of cash and debt balances, other demands for cash, such as acquisition activity, general economic or business conditions and board and management discretion. Additionally, our share repurchase activity during any particular period may fluctuate. We may accelerate, suspend, delay or discontinue the stock repurchase program at any time, without notice. Dividends: We paid dividends of $943 million in 2013, $2,058 million in 2012 and $2,043 million in 2011. Immediately following the Spin-Off of Kraft Foods Group on October 1, 2012, our share of the Kraft Foods Inc. annual dividend rate was $0.52 per common share. On August 6, 2013, our Audit Committee, with authorization from the Board of Directors, raised our quarterly dividend to $0.14 per common share or $0.56 per common share on an annual basis. The declaration of dividends is subject to the discretion of our Board of Directors and depends on various factors, including our net earnings, financial condition, cash requirements, future prospects and other factors that our Board of Directors deems relevant to its analysis and decision making. 54 Table of Contents Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements and Aggregate Contractual Obligations We have no off-balance sheet arrangements other than the guarantees and contractual obligations that are discussed below. Guarantees: As discussed in Note 12, Commitments and Contingencies, we enter into third-party guarantees primarily to cover the long-term obligations of our vendors. As part of these transactions, we guarantee that third parties will make contractual payments or achieve performance measures. At December 31, 2013, we had no material third-party guarantees recorded on our consolidated balance sheet. In addition, at December 31, 2013, we were contingently liable for $601 million of guarantees related to our own performance. These include letters of credit and guarantees related to the payment of custom duties and taxes. As part of our 2010 Cadbury acquisition, we became the responsible party for tax matters under the Cadbury Schweppes Plc and Dr Pepper Snapple Group, Inc. (“DPSG”) Tax Sharing and Indemnification Agreement dated May 1, 2008 (“Tax Indemnity”) for certain 2007 and 2008 transactions relating to the demerger of Cadbury’s Americas Beverage business. A U.S. federal tax audit of DPSG for the 2006-2008 tax years was concluded with the IRS in August 2013. As a result, we recorded a favorable impact of $336 million in selling, general and administrative expenses and $49 million in interest and other expense, net for a total pre-tax impact of $385 million ($363 million net of tax) in 2013 due to the reversal of the accrued liability in excess of the amount we paid to DPSG under the Tax Indemnity. Guarantees do not have, and we do not expect them to have, a material effect on our liquidity. Aggregate Contractual Obligations: The following table summarizes our contractual obligations at December 31, 2013. Payments Due Total 2014 2015-16 2017-18 2019 andThereafter (in millions) Debt (1) $ 15,511 $ 998 $ 3,479 $ 3,352 $ 7,682 Interest expense (2) 9,412 719 1,354 1,095 6,244 Capital leases 2 1 1 – – Operating leases (3) 886 240 303 207 136 Purchase obligations: (4) Inventory and production costs 7,095 4,296 1,550 913 336 Other 1,198 1,052 112 34 – 8,293 5,348 1,662 947 336 Other long-term liabilities (5) 701 25 61 94 521 Total $ 34,805 $ 7,331 $ 6,860 $ 5,695 $ 14,919 (1) Amounts include the expected cash payments of our total debt excluding capital leases which are presented separately in the table above. The amounts also exclude $28 million of unamortized non-cash bond premiums or discounts recorded in total debt. (2) Amounts represent the expected cash payments of our interest expense on our long-term debt. Interest calculated on our euro notes was forecasted using the euro to U.S. dollar exchange rate as of December 31, 2013. Interest on our British pound sterling notes was forecasted using the British pound sterling to U.S. dollar exchange rate as of December 31, 2013. An insignificant amount of interest expense was excluded from the table for a portion of our other foreign currency obligations due to the complexities involved in forecasting expected interest payments. (3) Operating leases represent the minimum rental commitments under non-cancelable operating leases. (4) Purchase obligations for inventory and production costs (such as raw materials, indirect materials and supplies, packaging, co-manufacturing arrangements, storage and distribution) are commitments for projected needs to be utilized in the normal course of business. Other purchase obligations include commitments for marketing, advertising, capital expenditures, information technology and professional services. Arrangements are considered purchase obligations if a contract specifies all significant terms, including fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased, a pricing structure and approximate timing of the transaction. Most arrangements are cancelable without a significant penalty and with short notice (usually 30 days). Any amounts reflected on the consolidated balance sheet as accounts payable and accrued liabilities are excluded from the table above. (5) Other long-term liabilities include estimated future benefit payments for our postretirement health care plans through December 31, 2023 of $181 million. We are unable to reliably estimate the timing of the payments beyond 2023; as such, they are excluded from the above table. There are also another $113 million of various other long-term liabilities that are expected to be paid over the next 5 years. In addition, the following long-term liabilities included on the consolidated balance sheet are excluded from the table above: accrued pension costs, income taxes, insurance accruals and other accruals. We are unable to reliably estimate the timing of the payments (or contributions beyond 2014, in the case of accrued pension costs) for these items. We currently expect to make approximately $319 million in contributions to our pension plans in 2014. We also expect that our net pension cost will decrease to approximately $263 million in 2014. The decrease is primarily due to lower discount rates and better-than-expected asset performance. As of December 31, 2013, our total liability for income taxes, including uncertain tax positions and associated accrued interest and penalties, was $1,540 million. We currently estimate payments of approximately $539 million related to these positions over the next 12 months. 55 Table of Contents Non-GAAP Financial Measures We use non-GAAP financial information and believe it is useful to investors as it provides additional information to facilitate comparisons of historical operating results, identify trends in our underlying operating results and provide additional transparency on how we evaluate our business. We use certain non-GAAP financial measures to budget, make operating and strategic decisions and evaluate our performance. We disclose non-GAAP financial measures so that you have the same financial data that we use to assist you in making comparisons to our historical operating results and analyzing our underlying performance. Our non-GAAP financial measures reflect how we evaluate our operating results currently. As new events or circumstances arise, these definitions could change over time: • “Organic Net Revenues” which is defined as net revenues excluding the impact of acquisitions, divestitures (including businesses under sale agreements and exits of major product lines under a sale or licensing agreement), Integration Program costs, accounting calendar changes (including a 53rd week in 2011) and foreign currency rate fluctuations. • “Adjusted Operating Income” which is defined as operating income excluding the impact of Spin-Off Costs, pension costs related to obligations transferred in the Spin-Off, the 2012-2014 Restructuring Program, the Integration Program and other acquisition integration costs, the benefit from the Cadbury acquisition-related indemnification resolution, gains / losses on divestitures or acquisitions, acquisition-related costs and the operating results of divestitures (including businesses under sale agreements and exits of major product lines under a sale or licensing agreement). We also evaluate growth in our Adjusted Operating Income on a constant currency basis. • “Adjusted EPS” (previously referred to as “Operating EPS”) which is defined as diluted EPS attributable to Mondelēz International from continuing operations excluding the impact of Spin-Off Costs, pension costs related to the obligations transferred in the Spin-Off, the 2012-2014 Restructuring Program, the Integration Program and other acquisition integration costs, the benefit from the Cadbury acquisition-related indemnification resolution, losses on debt extinguishment and related expenses, the residual tax benefit impact from the resolution of the Starbucks arbitration, gains / losses on divestitures and acquisitions, acquisition-related costs and net earnings from divestitures (including business under sale agreements and exits of major product lines under a sale or licensing agreement), and including an interest expense adjustment related to the Spin-Off transaction. We also evaluate growth in our Adjusted EPS on a constant currency basis. We believe that the presentation of these non-GAAP financial measures, when considered together with our U.S. GAAP financial measures and the reconciliations to the corresponding U.S. GAAP financial measures, provides you with a more complete understanding of the factors and trends affecting our business than could be obtained absent these disclosures. Because non-GAAP financial measures may vary among other companies, the non-GAAP financial measures presented in our Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations section may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies. Our use of these non-GAAP financial measures is not meant to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for any U.S. GAAP financial measure. A limitation of these non-GAAP financial measures is they exclude items detailed below which have an impact on our U.S. GAAP reported results. The best way this limitation can be addressed is by evaluating our non-GAAP financial measures in combination with our U.S. GAAP reported results and carefully evaluating the following tables which reconcile U.S. GAAP reported figures to the non-GAAP financial measures in this Form 10-K. Because GAAP financial measures on a forward-looking basis are neither accessible nor deemed to be significantly different from the non-GAAP financial measures, and reconciling information is not available without unreasonable effort, we have not provided this information in connection with the non-GAAP financial measures in our Financial Outlook. 56 Table of Contents Organic Net Revenues Using the definition of “Organic Net Revenues” above, the only adjustments made to “net revenues” (the most comparable U.S. GAAP financial measure) were to exclude the impact of acquisitions, divestitures, Integration Program costs, accounting calendar changes (including the 53rd week in 2011) and foreign currency. We believe that Organic Net Revenues better reflects the underlying growth from the ongoing activities of our business and provides improved comparability of results.

Note during the year ended December 31, 2012, a portion of the $6 billion of debt was retired. As such, we adjusted interest expense during this period as if this debt had been repaid on January 1, 2012 to ensure consistency of our assumption and related results. 59 Table of Contents Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk. As we operate globally, we use certain financial instruments to manage our foreign currency exchange rate, commodity price and interest rate risks. We monitor and manage these exposures as part of our overall risk management program. Our risk management program focuses on the unpredictability of financial markets and seeks to reduce the potentially adverse effects that the volatility of these markets may have on our operating results. We maintain foreign currency, commodity price and interest rate risk management policies that principally use derivative instruments to reduce significant, unanticipated earnings fluctuations that may arise from volatility in foreign currency exchange rates, commodity prices and interest rates. We also sell commodity futures to unprice future purchase commitments, and we occasionally use related futures to cross-hedge a commodity exposure. We are not a party to leveraged derivatives and, by policy, do not use financial instruments for speculative purposes. Refer to Note 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, and Note 9, Financial Instruments, to the consolidated financial statements for further details of our foreign currency, commodity price and interest rate risk management policies, the types of derivative instruments we use to hedge those exposures and currency risks associated with highly inflationary economies. Value at Risk: We use a value at risk (“VAR”) computation to estimate: 1) the potential one-day loss in the fair value of our interest rate-sensitive financial instruments; and 2) the potential one-day loss in pre-tax earnings of our foreign currency and commodity price-sensitive derivative financial instruments. We included our debt; foreign currency forwards and futures, swaps and options; and commodity futures, forwards and options in our VAR computation. Excluded from the computation were anticipated transactions, foreign currency trade payables and receivables, and net investments in foreign subsidiaries, which the abovementioned instruments are intended to hedge. We made the VAR estimates assuming normal market conditions, using a 95% confidence interval. We used a “variance / co-variance” model to determine the observed interrelationships between movements in interest rates and various currencies. These interrelationships were determined by observing interest rate and forward currency rate movements over the prior quarter for the calculation of VAR amounts at December 31, 2013 and 2012, and over each of the four prior quarters for the calculation of average VAR amounts during each year. The values of foreign currency and commodity options do not change on a one-to-one basis with the underlying currency or commodity, and were valued accordingly in the VAR computation. As of December 31, 2013, the estimated potential one-day loss in fair value of our interest rate-sensitive instruments, primarily debt, and the estimated potential one-day loss in pre-tax earnings from our foreign currency and commodity instruments, as calculated in the VAR model, were: Pre-Tax Earnings Impact Fair Value Impact At 12/31/13 Average High Low At 12/31/13 Average High Low (in millions) Instruments sensitive to: Interest rates $ 44 $ 70 $ 112 $ 44 Foreign currency rates $ 28 $ 19 $ 28 $ 13 Commodity prices 25 18 25 14 Pre-Tax Earnings Impact Fair Value Impact At 12/31/12 Average High Low At 12/31/12 Average High Low (in millions) Instruments sensitive to: Interest rates $ 80 $ 133 $ 172 $ 80 Foreign currency rates $ 10 $ 17 $ 24 $ 10 Commodity prices 19 44 60 19 With the Spin-Off, a significant portion of our primarily U.S. derivative instruments were divested in the fourth quarter of 2012. The impacts presented in the table above have not been recast to reflect the divestiture for periods prior to the Spin-Off as it is impracticable to do so. This VAR computation is a risk analysis tool designed to statistically estimate the maximum probable daily loss from adverse movements in interest rates, foreign currency rates and commodity prices under normal market conditions. The computation does not represent actual losses in fair value or earnings we will incur, nor does it consider the effect of favorable changes in market rates. We cannot predict actual future movements in such market rates and do not present these VAR results to be indicative of future movements in such market rates or to be representative of any actual impact that future changes in market rates may have on our future financial results. 60 Table of Contents",2023-12-30 19:01:12.701555
1103982,MDLZ,"Mondelez International, Inc.",2015,"Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. The following discussion and analysis contains forward-looking statements. It should be read in conjunction with the other sections of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, including the consolidated financial statements and related notes contained in Item 8, “Forward-Looking Statements” and “Risk Factors” contained in Item 1A. Description of the Company We manufacture and market primarily snack food and beverage products, including biscuits (cookies, crackers and salted snacks), chocolate, gum & candy, coffee & powdered beverages and various cheese & grocery products. We have operations in more than 80 countries and sell our products in approximately 165 countries. Over the last several years, we have been expanding geographically and building our presence in the snacking category. At the same time, we continued to invest in product quality, marketing and innovation behind our iconic brands, while implementing a series of cost saving initiatives. Our goals are to achieve industry-leading revenue growth over time along with the higher expected growth rates of advantaged snack categories; leverage our cost structure through supply chain reinvention, productivity programs, overhead streamlining, volume growth and improved product mix to drive margin gains; and grow earnings per share in the top-tier of our peer group. Planned Coffee Business Transactions On May 7, 2014, we announced that we entered into an agreement to combine our wholly owned coffee portfolio (outside of France) with D.E Master Blenders 1753 B.V. (“DEMB”). In conjunction with this transaction, Acorn Holdings B.V. (“AHBV”), owner of DEMB, has also made a binding offer to receive our coffee business in France. The parties have also invited our partners in certain joint ventures to join the new company. Upon completion of all proposed transactions, we expect to receive cash of approximately €4 billion and a 49 percent equity interest in the new company, to be called Jacobs Douwe Egberts (“JDE”). AHBV will hold a majority share in the proposed combined company and will have a majority of the seats on the board, which will be chaired by current DEMB Chairman Bart Becht. We will have certain minority rights. AHBV is owned by an investor group led by JAB Holding Company s.à r.l. The transactions (collectively, the “JDE coffee transactions”) remain subject to regulatory approvals and the completion of employee information and consultation requirements. We continue to expect the transactions to be completed in 2015, subject to closing conditions, including regulatory approvals. In December 2014, the European Commission announced its intention to further evaluate the proposed transaction against EU antitrust regulations in order to make a final determination on merger clearance, which we currently expect in the second half of 2015. We and DEMB also continue to undertake consultations with Works Councils and employee representatives as required in connection with the transactions. In connection with the expected receipt of approximately €4 billion upon closing, we entered into currency exchange forward contracts in the second quarter of 2014 to lock in an expected U.S. dollar value of approximately $5 billion. As of December 31, 2014, the forward contracts were recorded as derivative assets within other current assets and through December 31, 2014, we recognized $628 million of unrealized gains related to the hedges within interest and other expense, net. On February 11, 2015, we monetized the forward contracts and recorded an additional realized gain of $311 million in the first quarter of 2015, for a total realized gain of $939 million. We also entered into new currency exchange forward contracts to continue to lock in an expected U.S. dollar value of approximately $5 billion from the transactions. Based on changes in the euro/U.S. dollar exchange rate, the actual closing date of the planned JDE coffee transactions and the settlement dates of the hedges or other hedges we may put into place, the actual amount of U.S. dollars we receive could change. In addition to the hedges, we have also incurred incremental expenses related to readying our coffee businesses for the planned transactions that totaled $77 million through December 31, 2014 and were recorded within selling, general and administrative expenses of our Europe and EEMEA segments and within our general corporate expenses. For additional information on the JDE coffee transactions, see Note 2, Divestitures and Acquisitions—Planned Coffee Business Transactions. 21 Table of Contents 2014-2018 Restructuring Program On May 6, 2014, our Board of Directors approved a $3.5 billion restructuring program, comprised of approximately $2.5 billion in cash costs and $1 billion in non-cash costs (the “2014-2018 Restructuring Program”), and up to $2.2 billion of capital expenditures. The primary objective of the 2014-2018 Restructuring Program is to reduce our operating cost structure in both our supply chain and overhead costs. We expect the 2014-2018 Restructuring Program to generate annualized savings of at least $1.5 billion by the program’s completion at the end of 2018. Lower overheads and accelerated supply chain cost reductions are each expected to generate roughly half of the total incremental savings. We expect to incur the majority of the program’s charges in 2015 and 2016 and to complete the program by year-end 2018. In 2014, we recorded restructuring and related implementation charges of $381 million under this program. For additional information on the 2014-2018 Restructuring Program, see Note 6, Restructuring Programs. S ummary of Results • Net revenues decreased 3.0% to $34.2 billion in 2014 and increased 0.8% to $35.3 billion in 2013. Net revenues in 2014 were significantly affected by unfavorable currency translation as the U.S. dollar strengthened against most currencies in which we operate. • Organic Net Revenue increased 2.4% to $36.0 billion in 2014 and increased 3.9% to $35.9 billion in 2013. Organic Net Revenue is a non-GAAP financial measure we use to evaluate our underlying results (see the definition of Organic Net Revenue and our reconciliation with net revenues within Non-GAAP Financial Measures appearing later in this section). • Diluted EPS attributable to Mondelēz International decreased 41.6% to $1.28 in 2014 and increased 28.1% to $2.19 in 2013. Excluding the results of discontinued operations, our diluted EPS attributable to Mondelēz International from continuing operations decreased 0.8% to $1.28 in 2014 and increased 46.6% to $1.29 in 2013. A number of significant items also affected the comparability of our reported results, as further described in the Discussion and Analysis of Historical Results appearing later in this section and in the notes to the consolidated financial statements. • Adjusted EPS increased 14.3% to $1.76 in 2014 and increased 7.7% to $1.54 in 2013. On a constant currency basis, Adjusted EPS increased 23.4% to $1.90 in 2014 and increased 11.9% to $1.60 in 2013. Adjusted EPS is a non-GAAP financial measure we use to evaluate our underlying results (see the definition of Adjusted EPS and our reconciliation with diluted EPS within Non-GAAP Financial Measures appearing later in this section). Financial Outlook We seek to achieve top-tier financial performance. We manage our business to achieve this goal using a number of operating metrics including Organic Net Revenue, Adjusted Operating Income and Adjusted EPS. (Refer to Non-GAAP Financial Measures appearing later in this section for more information on these measures.) Additional metrics that we use or monitor include product quality measures, category growth, market share performance, pricing net of commodity costs, net commodity inflation, volume growth, Power Brand Organic Net Revenue growth, gross and net productivity savings, brand support and related investments, capital spending, cash conversion cycle, free cash flow, return on invested capital and shareholder returns. We also monitor a number of factors and trends that we expect may impact our near- and long-term revenues and profitability objectives: Long-Term Demographics and Consumer Trends – Snack food consumption is highly correlated to GDP growth, urbanization of the population and rising discretionary income levels associated with a growing middle class particularly in emerging markets. Over the long-term, we expect these trends to continue leading to growth in key consumer behaviors, including increased snacking occasions, greater use of convenience food and migration to more frequent, smaller meals. In the near term, lower GDP growth, high unemployment and weak consumer confidence in Europe and emerging markets has slowed category and our growth. Demand – We monitor consumer spending and our market share within the food and beverage categories in which we sell our products. Growth in the global categories slowed from approximately 4% in 2013 to 3.6% in 2014. We believe the slowdown in category growth will continue to affect our near-term net revenue growth, but we expect the slowdown, particularly in emerging markets, to be temporary. We expect category growth to return to levels more in line with the expected growth of emerging markets and consumer spending in those markets. We continue to make investments in our brands and build strong routes to market to address the needs of consumers in emerging and developed markets. In doing so, we anticipate stimulating demand in our categories and growing our position in these markets. 22 Table of Contents Volatility of Global Markets – Our growth strategy depends in part on our ability to expand our operations, particularly in emerging markets. Some of these markets have greater political and economic volatility and vulnerability to infrastructure and labor disruptions as we experienced this past year in markets including Russia, Ukraine, Venezuela and Argentina. Volatility in these markets affects demand for and the costs of our products and requires frequent changes in how we operate our business. There will likely be continued volatility across these and other markets in which we sell. As such, we are focused on aggressively managing our costs currently as we continue to invest in brand building and routes to market. Competition – We operate in highly competitive markets that include global, regional and local competitors. Our advantaged geographic footprint, operating scale and portfolio of brands have all significantly contributed to building our market-leading positions across most of the product categories in which we sell. To grow and maintain our market positions, we focus on product quality, bringing new products and innovations to market and effectively meeting consumer needs and preferences. We pursue significant growth opportunities such as expanding our global operations and growing our portfolio of Power Brands and innovative products. We continue to optimize our manufacturing and other operations and invest in our brands through ongoing research and development, advertising and marketing consumer promotions. Pricing – We adjust our product prices based on a number of variables including demand, the competitive environment and changes in our product input costs. Our net revenue growth and profitability may be affected as we adjust prices to address new conditions. In 2014, we generally increased prices in response to higher commodity costs, currency and other market factors. In 2015, we continue to expect higher aggregate commodity and related costs and anticipate adjusting our prices in response to changing market conditions. Price competition or delayed price increases by competitors or customers also affected our net revenues in 2014 and may continue to affect net revenues or market share in the near term until the market adjusts to the changes in input costs and other market conditions. In 2015, we plan to address some of these issues and improve our revenue mix by discontinuing certain low margin, customer-specific product lines, discontinuing certain low-margin licensed products and continuing to simplify our portfolio of SKUs. Operating Costs – Our operating costs include raw materials, labor, selling, general and administrative expenses, taxes, currency impacts and financing costs. We manage these costs through cost saving and productivity initiatives, sourcing and hedging programs, pricing actions, refinancing and tax planning. We continue to work on various programs to expand our profitability and margins, such as our 2014-2018 Restructuring Program designed to bring about significant reductions in our operating cost structure in both our supply chain and overhead costs. Currency – As a global company with over 80% of our net revenues generated outside the United States, we are exposed to changes in global economic conditions and currency movements. In 2014, as the U.S. dollar strengthened relative to other currencies in which we operate and as several countries experienced significant declines in or devaluations of their currency, these currency movements had a significant negative effect on our reported results of operations. Our 2014 net revenues were $34.2 billion, down 3.0% from 2013, including a negative 5.1 percentage point impact from currency translation. While we have net investment hedges in the form of local currency denominated debt to offset the translation of certain of our overseas investments, we generally do not hedge against currency translation. We primarily seek to hedge against economic losses on cross-currency transactions. Due to limited markets for hedging currency transactions and other factors, we may not be able to effectively hedge all of our cross-currency transaction risks. During 2014, we recognized $167 million of currency devaluation charges in pretax earnings related to the remeasurement of our net monetary assets in Venezuela. The economy, monetary policies and other business restrictions in Venezuela, as well as in other countries such as Argentina and Russia, have created a challenging business environment in which to operate, and our ability to hedge against currency-related economic losses may be limited. While we work to mitigate our exposure to these currency risks, factors such as continued global market volatility, actions by foreign governments, political uncertainty and other external developments could lead to further unfavorable currency impacts in the future. Financing Costs – We regularly evaluate our variable and fixed-rate debt. We continue to use lower cost short- and long-term debt to finance our ongoing working capital, capital expenditures and other investments, dividends and share repurchases. In the first quarter of 2014 and fourth quarter of 2013, we retired $5 billion of our long-term U.S. dollar-denominated debt and issued lower-cost long-term euro and U.S. dollar-denominated debt. Our weighted-average interest rate on our total debt as of December 31, 2014 was 4.3%, down from 4.8% as of December 31, 2013 and down from 5.8% as of December 31, 2012. 23 Table of Contents Discussion and Analysis of Historical Results Items Affecting Comparability of Financial Results The following table includes significant income or (expense) items that affected the comparability of our pre-tax results of operations and our effective tax rates.

The change in net revenues and Organic Net Revenue are detailed below: 2014 Change in net revenues (by percentage point) Higher net pricing 4.5pp Unfavorable volume/mix (2.1)pp Total change in Organic Net Revenue(1) 2.4% Unfavorable currency (5.1)pp Impact of divestitures (0.2)pp Impact of accounting calendar change (0.1)pp Impact of acquisition – Total change in net revenues (3.0)% (1) Please see the Non-GAAP Financial Measures section at the end of this item. Organic Net Revenue growth was driven by higher net pricing, partially offset by unfavorable volume/mix. Overall, net pricing was up as we realized the effects of input cost-driven pricing actions implemented over the course of the year. Higher net pricing was reflected primarily in Latin America, EEMEA, Europe and Asia Pacific. Unfavorable volume/mix was driven primarily by Europe, Asia Pacific and Latin America. In addition to price elasticity, the decline was largely due to a slow response by competitors to higher input costs as well as the impact of price-related customer disruptions in Europe. Unfavorable currency impacts decreased net revenues by $1,806 million, due primarily to the devaluation of the Venezuelan bolivar and the strength of the U.S. dollar relative to several currencies, including the Argentinean peso, Russian ruble, Brazilian real and Ukrainian hryvnya, partially offset by the strength of the British pound sterling relative to the U.S. dollar. The impact of divestitures completed in 2013 resulted in a year-over-year decrease in net revenues of $70 million and included a salty snacks business in Turkey, a confectionery business in South Africa and a chocolate business in Spain. The accounting calendar change made in Europe in 2013 resulted in a year-over-year decrease in net revenues of $38 million. The acquisition of a biscuit operation in Morocco on February 22, 2013 added $14 million in incremental net revenues this year for the period prior to the anniversary date of the acquisition. 25 Table of Contents Operating Income – Operating income decreased $729 million (18.4%) to $3,242 million in 2014, Adjusted Operating Income (1) increased $149 million (3.5%) to $4,416 million and Adjusted Operating Income on a constant currency basis (1) increased $436 million (10.2%) to $4,703 million due to the following: Operating Income Change (in millions) (percentage point) Operating Income for the Year Ended December 31, 2013 $ 3,971 Spin-Off Costs 62 1.8pp 2012-2014 Restructuring Program costs 330 8.7pp Integration Program and other acquisition integration costs 220 5.6pp Benefit from indemnification resolution (336 ) (8.7)pp Remeasurement of net monetary assets in Venezuela 54 1.3pp Gains on acquisition and divestitures, net (30 ) (0.7)pp Operating income from divestitures (6 ) (0.2)pp Acquisition-related costs 2 – Adjusted Operating Income (1) for the Year Ended December 31, 2013 $ 4,267 Higher net pricing 1,594 37.4pp Higher input costs (971 ) (22.8)pp Unfavorable volume/mix (354 ) (8.3)pp Lower selling, general and administrative expenses 313 7.3pp Change in unrealized gains / (losses) on hedging activities (174 ) (4.1)pp Gains on sale of property in 2013 (68 ) (1.5)pp VAT-related settlements 84 2.0pp Gain on sale of property in 2014 7 0.1pp Impact from acquisition 3 0.1pp Other, net 2 – Total change in Adjusted Operating Income (constant currency) (1) 436 10.2% Unfavorable currency - translation (287 ) (6.7)pp Total change in Adjusted Operating Income (1) 149 3.5% Adjusted Operating Income (1) for the Year Ended December 31, 2014 $ 4,416 Spin-Off Costs (35 ) (0.9)pp 2012-2014 Restructuring Program costs (459 ) (11.5)pp 2014-2018 Restructuring Program costs (381 ) (9.6)pp Integration Program and other acquisition integration costs 4 0.1pp Remeasurement of net monetary assets in Venezuela (167 ) (4.2)pp Intangible asset impairment charges (57 ) (1.6)pp Costs associated with the JDE coffee transactions (77 ) (2.0)pp Acquisition-related costs (2 ) – Operating Income for the Year Ended December 31, 2014 $ 3,242 (18.4)% (1) Please see the Non-GAAP Financial Measures section at the end of this item. During 2014, higher net pricing outpaced increased input costs. Higher net pricing was reflected across all segments. The increase in input costs was driven by higher raw material costs, in part due to higher currency exchange transaction costs on imported materials, partially offset by lower manufacturing costs. Unfavorable volume/mix was driven by Latin America, Asia Pacific and Europe, partially offset by gains in EEMEA and North America. 26 Table of Contents Total selling, general and administrative expenses decreased $222 million from 2013, due to a number of factors noted in the table above, including in part, a favorable currency impact, lower Integration Program costs, value-added tax (“VAT”)-related settlements in 2014, lower Spin-Off Costs, 2013 business divestitures and a gain on a sale of property in 2014. Items that increased selling, general and administrative expenses included a 2013 benefit received related to the resolution of a Cadbury acquisition indemnification, increased devaluation charges related to our net monetary assets in Venezuela, costs incurred for the 2014-2018 Restructuring Program, costs incurred in 2014 related to the JDE coffee transactions, gains on property sales in 2013 and higher 2012-2014 Restructuring Program costs. Excluding the factors noted above, selling, general and administrative expenses decreased $313 million from 2013, driven primarily by lower overhead costs and lower advertising and consumer promotion costs. Overhead costs fell as a result of continued cost reduction efforts. Advertising and consumer promotion costs were lower due primarily to savings from consolidating media providers, reductions in non-working media costs and efficiencies gained by shifting spending to lower-cost, digital media outlets, while we increased our spending on our Power Brands and maintained working media spending. The change in unrealized gains / (losses) decreased operating income by $174 million in 2014. In 2014, the net unrealized losses on primarily commodity hedging activity were $112 million, as compared to net unrealized gains of $62 million in 2013 related to currency and commodity hedging activity. In 2013, we recorded pre-tax gains of $68 million related to sales of properties in India and Europe. In 2014, we recorded a benefit of $84 million related to VAT-related settlements in Latin America. In 2014, we recorded a pre-tax gain of $7 million related to the sale of a property in Europe. The acquisition of a biscuit operation in Morocco on February 22, 2013 added $3 million in incremental operating income in 2014 for the period prior to the anniversary of the acquisition. Unfavorable currency impacts decreased operating income by $287 million, due primarily to the devaluation of the Venezuelan bolivar in 2013 and 2014 and the strength of the U.S. dollar relative to several currencies, including the Argentinean peso, Brazilian real, Russian ruble and Ukrainian hryvnya, partially offset by the strength of the British pound sterling relative to the U.S. dollar. Operating income margin decreased from 11.2% in 2013 to 9.5% in 2014. The decrease in operating income margin was driven primarily by costs incurred for the 2014-2018 Restructuring Program, the year-over-year negative impact of the benefit from the resolution of the Cadbury acquisition-related indemnification recorded in 2013, higher costs for the 2012-2014 Restructuring Program, the impact from the devaluation of our net monetary assets in Venezuela and costs incurred related to the JDE coffee transactions, partially offset by lower Integration Program costs. Adjusted Operating Income margin increased from 12.1% in 2013 to 12.9% in 2014. The increase in Adjusted Operating Income margin was driven primarily by lower overhead costs from continued cost reduction efforts and lower advertising and consumer promotion costs due primarily to current year productivity initiatives, partially offset by a decline in gross profit margin due entirely to the unfavorable impact of unrealized gains / (losses) on currency and commodity hedging activities. 27 Table of Contents Net Earnings and Earnings per Share Attributable to Mondelēz International – Net earnings attributable to Mondelēz International of $2,184 million in 2014 decreased by $1,731 million (44.2%) due primarily to the results of the discontinued operations in the prior year.

Organic Net Revenue growth was driven by favorable volume/mix and higher net pricing. Favorable volume/mix was driven primarily by higher shipments across all segments except Asia Pacific. Higher net pricing in Latin America, primarily related to Venezuela, Argentina and Brazil, and in North America was partially offset by lower net pricing in Europe, Asia Pacific and EEMEA, primarily due to lower coffee prices. Unfavorable currency decreased net revenues by $837 million, due primarily to the devaluation of the Venezuelan bolivar and the strength of the U.S. dollar relative to most currencies, including the Brazilian real, Argentinean peso, Australian dollar, Indian rupee, Japanese yen and South African rand, partially offset by the strength of the euro relative the U.S. dollar. The impact of divestitures resulted in a year-over-year decrease in net revenues of $345 million. In addition, the acquisition of a biscuit operation in Morocco added $91 million in net revenues and the accounting calendar change in Europe added $37 million in net revenues in 2013. 30 Table of Contents Operating Income – Operating income increased $334 million (9.2%) to $3,971 million in 2013, Adjusted Operating Income (1) increased $1 million (0.0%) to $4,267 million and Adjusted Operating Income on a constant currency basis (1) increased $147 million (3.4%) to $4,413 million due to the following: Operating Income Change (in millions) (percentage point) Operating Income for the Year Ended December 31, 2012 $ 3,637 Spin-Off Costs 444 10.5pp 2012-2014 Restructuring Program costs 110 2.3pp Integration Program costs 140 3.0pp Spin-Off pension expense adjustment (2) 68 1.7pp Intangible asset impairment charge 52 1.5pp Gains on divestitures, net (107 ) (2.4)pp Acquisition-related costs 1 – Operating income from divestitures (79 ) (1.7)pp Adjusted Operating Income (1) for the Year Ended December 31, 2012 $ 4,266 Higher net pricing 157 3.7pp Higher input costs (333 ) (7.9)pp Favorable volume/mix 495 11.6pp Higher selling, general and administrative expenses (246 ) (5.7)pp Change in unrealized gains / (losses) on hedging activities 61 1.4pp Gains on sales of property in 2013 68 1.6pp Gains on sales of property in 2012 (77 ) (1.8)pp Impact from acquisition 16 0.4pp Impact of accounting calendar changes 6 0.1pp Total change in Adjusted Operating Income (constant currency) (1) 147 3.4% Unfavorable currency - translation (146 ) (3.4)pp Total change in Adjusted Operating Income 1 (0.0)% Adjusted Operating Income (1) for the Year Ended December 31, 2013 $ 4,267 Spin-Off Costs (62 ) (1.5)pp 2012-2014 Restructuring Program costs (330 ) (7.7)pp Integration Program and other integration costs (220 ) (5.0)pp Benefit from indemnification resolution 336 9.3pp Remeasurement of net monetary assets in Venezuela (54 ) (1.5)pp Gains on acquisition and divestitures, net 30 0.7pp Acquisition-related costs (2 ) (0.1)pp Operating income from divestitures 6 0.1pp Operating Income for the Year Ended December 31, 2013 $ 3,971 9.2% (1) Please see the Non-GAAP Financial Measures section at the end of this item. (2) Represents the estimated annual benefit plan expense associated with certain benefit plan obligations transferred to Kraft Foods Group, Inc. in the Spin-Off. Favorable volume/mix was driven primarily by volume gains across all segments except Asia Pacific. Higher net pricing in Latin America and North America was partially offset by lower net pricing in Europe, Asia Pacific and EEMEA, primarily due to lower coffee pricing. During 2013, increased input costs outpaced higher net pricing. The increase in input costs was driven by higher raw material costs, in part due to higher currency exchange transaction costs on imported materials, partially offset by lower manufacturing costs. Total selling, general and administrative expenses decreased $497 million from 2012, due in part to lower Spin-Off Costs, a benefit from the resolution of the Cadbury acquisition-related indemnification, a favorable currency impact net of the negative impact from the devaluation of our net monetary assets in Venezuela, gains on the sales of properties in 2013 and the impact of businesses divested in 2013 and 2012, which were partially offset by gains on sales of properties in 2012, higher Integration Program costs, higher 2012-2014 Restructuring Program costs and the inclusion of expenses related to the acquired biscuit operations in Morocco. 31 Table of Contents Excluding the factors noted above, selling, general and administrative expenses increased $246 million from 2012, driven primarily by higher overhead costs in emerging markets, including investments in sales capabilities and route-to-market expansion in emerging markets, the 2012 reversal of reserves carried over from the Cadbury acquisition in 2010 and no longer required, prior-year proceeds from insurance settlements and higher advertising and consumer promotion costs in Asia Pacific, EEMEA and Latin America. The change in unrealized gains / (losses) added $61 million in operating income for 2013. In 2013, the net unrealized gains were $62 million, as compared to net unrealized gains of $1 million in 2012. In 2013, we recorded pre-tax gains of $68 million related to sales of properties in India and Europe. In 2012, we recorded pre-tax gains of $77 million related to sales of properties in Russia and Turkey. The acquisition of a biscuit operation in Morocco added $16 million in operating income for 2013. Accounting calendar changes that went into effect in Europe in the first quarter of 2013 increased operating income by $6 million. Unfavorable currency impacts decreased operating income by $146 million, due primarily to the devaluation of the Venezuelan bolivar and the strength of the U.S. dollar relative to most currencies, including the Brazilian real, Argentinean peso, Indian rupee, Japanese yen, South African rand and Russian ruble, partially offset by the strength of the euro relative to the U.S. dollar. Operating income margin increased from 10.4% in 2012 to 11.2% in 2013. The increase in operating income margin was driven primarily by lower Spin-Off Costs and the benefit from the resolution of the Cadbury acquisition-related indemnification, partially offset by higher costs for the 2012-2014 Restructuring Program, lower Integration Program costs, a negative impact from divestitures and the unfavorable impact from the devaluation of our net monetary assets in Venezuela. Adjusted Operating Income margin decreased from 12.3% in 2012 to 12.1% in 2013. The decrease in Adjusted Operating Income margin was driven primarily by a modest decline in gross margin, due to the timing of price increases to cover rising currency exchange transaction costs on imported raw materials in the second half of the year, partially offset by the benefit of leverage on our selling, general and administrative expenses. 32 Table of Contents Net Earnings and Earnings per Share Attributable to Mondelēz International – Net earnings attributable to Mondelēz International of $3,915 million increased by $848 million (27.6%) in 2013.

Beginning in 2015, within each region, we also manage by product category. In the historical periods presented and discussed below, we managed our operations within Latin America, Asia Pacific and EEMEA by location and within Europe and North America by location and product category. We use segment operating income to evaluate segment performance and allocate resources. We believe it is appropriate to disclose this measure to help investors analyze segment performance and trends. See Note 17, Segment Reporting, for additional information on our segments and Items Affecting Comparability of Financial Results earlier in this section for items affecting our segment operating results. Our segment net revenues and earnings for the following historical periods were: For the Years Ended December 31, 2014 2013 2012 (in millions) Net revenues: Latin America $ 5,153 $ 5,382 $ 5,396 Asia Pacific 4,605 4,952 5,164 EEMEA 3,638 3,915 3,735 Europe 13,912 14,059 13,817 North America 6,936 6,991 6,903 Net revenues $ 34,244 $ 35,299 $ 35,015 For the Years Ended December 31, 2014 2013 2012 (in millions) Earnings from continuing operations before income taxes: Operating income: Latin America $ 475 $ 570 $ 769 Asia Pacific 385 512 657 EEMEA 327 379 506 Europe 1,770 1,699 1,762 North America 922 889 781 Unrealized gains / (losses) on hedging activities (112 ) 62 1 General corporate expenses (317 ) (287 ) (728 ) Amortization of intangibles (206 ) (217 ) (217 ) Benefit from indemnification resolution – 336 – Gains on acquisition and divestitures, net – 30 107 Acquisition-related costs (2 ) (2 ) (1 ) Operating income 3,242 3,971 3,637 Interest and other expense, net (688 ) (1,579 ) (1,863 ) Earnings from continuing operations before income taxes $ 2,554 $ 2,392 $ 1,774 35 Table of Contents Latin America For the Years EndedDecember 31, 2014 2013 $ change % change (in millions) Net revenues $ 5,153 $ 5,382 $ (229 ) (4.3 )% Segment operating income 475 570 (95 ) (16.7 )% For the Years EndedDecember 31, 2013 2012 $ change % change (in millions) Net revenues $ 5,382 $ 5,396 $ (14 ) (0.3 )% Segment operating income 570 769 (199 ) (25.9 )% 2014 compared with 2013: Net revenues decreased $229 million (4.3%), due to unfavorable currency (19.4 pp) and unfavorable volume/mix (4.2 pp), partially offset by higher net pricing (19.3 pp). Unfavorable currency impacts were due primarily to the Venezuelan bolivar devaluation and the strength of the U.S. dollar relative to the Argentinean peso and Brazilian real. Unfavorable volume/mix was driven primarily by Mexico, Venezuela and Argentina, partially offset by gains in Brazil and the Western Andean countries. Higher net pricing was reflected primarily in the higher inflationary countries of Venezuela and Argentina, as well as in Brazil and Mexico. Segment operating income decreased $95 million (16.7%), due primarily to higher raw material costs, unfavorable currency, unfavorable volume/mix, the year-over-year net impact from the remeasurement of net monetary assets in Venezuela, costs incurred for the 2014-2018 Restructuring Program and higher advertising and consumer promotion costs. These unfavorable items were partially offset by higher net pricing, lower manufacturing costs, the absence of Integration Program costs in 2014, lower other selling, general and administrative expenses (including $84 million related primarily to VAT-related settlements) and lower 2012-2014 Restructuring Program costs. 2013 compared with 2012: Net revenues decreased $14 million (0.3%), due to unfavorable currency (12.6 pp), mostly offset by higher net pricing (11.4 pp) and favorable volume/mix (0.9 pp). Unfavorable currency was due primarily to the Venezuelan bolivar devaluation and the strength of the U.S. dollar relative to the Brazilian real and Argentinean peso, partially offset by the strength of the Mexican peso relative to the U.S. dollar. Higher net pricing was reflected across the entire region except in Mexico. Favorable volume/mix was driven primarily by Brazil, partially offset by volume/mix declines in Argentina and Venezuela. Segment operating income decreased $199 million (25.9%), due primarily to higher raw material costs, unfavorable currency including the $54 million impact from the devaluation of net monetary assets in Venezuela, higher other selling, general and administrative expenses (including prior-year proceeds from an insurance settlement), higher manufacturing costs, higher 2012-2014 Restructuring Program costs, and higher advertising and consumer promotion costs. These unfavorable items were partially offset by higher net pricing and lower Spin-Off Costs. 36 Table of Contents Asia Pacific For the Years EndedDecember 31, 2014 2013 $ change % change (in millions) Net revenues $ 4,605 $ 4,952 $ (347 ) (7.0)% Segment operating income 385 512 (127 ) (24.8)% For the Years EndedDecember 31, 2013 2012 $ change % change (in millions) Net revenues $ 4,952 $ 5,164 $ (212 ) (4.1)% Segment operating income 512 657 (145 ) (22.1)% 2014 compared with 2013: Net revenues decreased $347 million (7.0%), due to unfavorable volume/mix (5.7 pp) and unfavorable currency (4.2 pp), partially offset by higher net pricing (2.9 pp). Unfavorable volume/mix was driven primarily by China, Australia/New Zealand, Indonesia, Malaysia and the Philippines, partially offset by gains in India. Unfavorable currency impacts were due primarily to the strength of the U.S. dollar relative to the Australian dollar, Indian rupee, Indonesian rupiah and Japanese yen. Higher net pricing was primarily due to India, Indonesia, the Philippines, Australia/New Zealand and China. Segment operating income decreased $127 million (24.8%), due primarily to higher raw material costs, unfavorable volume/mix, an intangible asset impairment charge related to a biscuit trademark, higher 2012-2014 Restructuring Program costs, 2014-2018 Restructuring Program costs and unfavorable currency. These unfavorable items were partially offset by higher net pricing, lower manufacturing costs, lower advertising and consumer promotion costs, the absence of Integration Program costs in 2014 and lower other selling, general and administrative expenses (including an unfavorable year-over-year impact from the 2013 gain on a sale of property in India). 2013 compared with 2012: Net revenues decreased $212 million (4.1%), due to unfavorable currency (4.7 pp) and lower net pricing (1.9 pp) partially offset by favorable volume/mix (2.5 pp). Unfavorable currency was due primarily to the strength of the U.S. dollar relative to the Australian dollar, Indian rupee and Japanese yen. Lower net pricing was reflected in the region’s developed markets, partially offset by higher net pricing in the region’s emerging markets, primarily in India, the Philippines and Thailand. Favorable volume/mix was driven by the region’s emerging markets, primarily India, China, the Philippines and Malaysia, as well as in the region’s developed markets of Australia/New Zealand. Segment operating income decreased $145 million (22.1%), due primarily to higher raw material costs, lower net pricing, unfavorable currency, higher other selling, general and administrative expenses (including investments in sales capabilities and route-to-market expansion, the impacts of a gain on sale of property in India and prior-year proceeds from an insurance settlement) and higher advertising and consumer promotion costs. These unfavorable items were partially offset by lower manufacturing costs, a 2012 asset impairment charge related to a trademark in Japan, lower Spin-Off Costs and favorable volume/mix. 37 Table of Contents EEMEA For the Years EndedDecember 31, 2014 2013 $ change % change (in millions) Net revenues $ 3,638 $ 3,915 $ (277 ) (7.1)% Segment operating income 327 379 (52 ) (13.7)% For the Years EndedDecember 31, 2013 2012 $ change % change (in millions) Net revenues $ 3,915 $ 3,735 $ 180 4.8% Segment operating income 379 506 (127 ) (25.1)% 2014 compared with 2013: Net revenues decreased $277 million (7.1%), due to unfavorable currency (13.4 pp) and the impact of divestitures (0.5 pp), partially offset by higher net pricing (5.7 pp), favorable volume/mix (0.8 pp) and the impact of the February 2013 acquisition of a biscuit operation in Morocco (0.3 pp). Unfavorable currency impacts were due to the strength of the U.S. dollar relative to most currencies in the region, primarily the Russian ruble, Ukrainian hryvnya, South African rand and Turkish lira. Divestitures completed in 2013 resulted in a $20 million decline in net revenues. Higher net pricing was reflected across most of the segment, primarily in Russia, Ukraine and Turkey. Favorable volume/mix was driven primarily by Russia, the Gulf Cooperation Council (“GCC”) countries and Turkey. The acquisition of a biscuit operation in Morocco in February 2013 added $14 million in incremental net revenues for 2014 for the period prior to the anniversary date of the acquisition. Segment operating income decreased $52 million (13.7%), due primarily to higher raw material costs, unfavorable currency, higher 2012-2014 Restructuring Program costs, costs incurred for the 2014-2018 Restructuring Program and costs associated with the JDE coffee transactions. These unfavorable items were partially offset by higher net pricing, lower manufacturing costs, lower Integration Program and other acquisition integration costs, favorable volume/mix, the impact of 2013 divestitures and lower advertising and consumer promotion costs. 2013 compared with 2012: Net revenues increased $180 million (4.8%), due to favorable volume/mix (11.0 pp) and the impact of the acquisition of a biscuit operation in Morocco (2.5 pp), partially offset by unfavorable currency (4.7 pp), the impact of divestitures in Turkey and South Africa (2.2 pp) and lower net pricing (1.8 pp). Favorable volume/mix was driven primarily by Russia, Ukraine, Egypt, West Africa, Central and East Africa and South Africa. Unfavorable currency was due to the strength of the U.S. dollar relative to most currencies in the region, including the South African rand, Russian ruble and Egyptian pound. Lower net pricing was reflected primarily in Russia and Ukraine, due to lower coffee and chocolate pricing, partially offset by higher net pricing in the GCC countries, South Africa and Egypt. Segment operating income decreased $127 million (25.1%), due primarily to higher other selling, general and administrative expenses (including investments in sales capabilities and route-to-market expansion and a write-off of a $15 million VAT receivable that is no longer realizable), the 2012 gains on the sales of property in Russia and Turkey, lower net pricing, higher raw material costs, higher Integration Program and Morocco biscuit acquisition integration costs, unfavorable currency, higher advertising and consumer promotion costs, higher 2012-2014 Restructuring Program costs and the impact of divestitures in Turkey and South Africa. These unfavorable items were partially offset by favorable volume/mix, lower manufacturing costs and the impact from the acquisition in Morocco. 38 Table of Contents Europe For the Years EndedDecember 31, 2014 2013 $ change % change (in millions) Net revenues $ 13,912 $ 14,059 $ (147 ) (1.0)% Segment operating income 1,770 1,699 71 4.2% For the Years EndedDecember 31, 2013 2012 $ change % change (in millions) Net revenues $ 14,059 $ 13,817 $ 242 1.8% Segment operating income 1,699 1,762 (63 ) (3.6)% 2014 compared with 2013: Net revenues decreased $147 million (1.0%), due to unfavorable volume/mix (2.3 pp), the impact of the prior year’s accounting calendar change (0.2 pp) and the impact of divestitures (0.0 pp), partially offset by higher net pricing (1.3 pp) and favorable currency (0.2 pp). Unfavorable volume/mix was driven by lower shipments across all categories. The decline was due to pricing-related elasticity across the region and certain pricing-related customer disruptions. The accounting calendar change made in 2013 resulted in a year-over-year decrease in net revenues of $38 million. In addition, divestitures completed in 2013 resulted in an $11 million decline in net revenues. Higher net pricing was driven by chocolate and cheese & grocery, partially offset by lower net pricing in all other categories, primarily biscuits and coffee. Favorable currency impacts primarily reflected the strength of the British pound sterling relative to the U.S. dollar, partially offset by the strength of the U.S. dollar against the Swedish krona, the euro and Norwegian krone. Segment operating income increased $71 million (4.2%), due primarily to lower manufacturing costs, higher net pricing, lower Integration Program costs (including the reversal of a prior-year accrual), lower advertising and consumer promotion costs and lower other selling, general and administrative expenses (net of the unfavorable year-over-year impact from the 2013 gains on the sales of property in the United Kingdom, Norway and Italy, and the benefit from a 2014 gain on a sale of property in the United Kingdom). These favorable items were partially offset by higher raw material costs (primarily higher cocoa costs), costs incurred for the 2014-2018 Restructuring Program, unfavorable volume mix, higher 2012-2014 Restructuring Program costs, costs associated with the JDE coffee transactions, an intangible asset impairment charge related to a candy trademark and the year-over-year impact from last year’s accounting calendar change. 2013 compared with 2012: Net revenues increased $242 million (1.8%), due to favorable volume/mix (3.2 pp), favorable currency (2.1 pp) and the impact of an accounting calendar change (0.3 pp), partially offset by lower pricing (2.4 pp) and the impact of current and prior-year divestitures (1.4 pp). Favorable volume/mix was driven by higher shipments in chocolate, biscuits and coffee, partially offset by lower shipments in gum & candy and cheese & grocery. Favorable currency primarily reflected the strength of the euro, Swedish krona and Polish zloty relative to the U.S. dollar, partially offset by the strength of the U.S. dollar relative to the British pound sterling. Lower net pricing was driven primarily by lower coffee prices. Segment operating income decreased $63 million (3.6%), due primarily to lower net pricing, higher 2012-2014 Restructuring Program costs, the impact of current and prior-year divestitures and higher Integration Program costs (partially due to the reversal of $45 million of charges due to the outcome of labor negotiations in April 2012). These unfavorable items were partially offset by favorable volume/mix, lower manufacturing costs, favorable currency, lower other selling, general and administrative expenses (including the impacts of gains on the sales of property in the United Kingdom, Norway and Italy and a $44 million reversal in 2012 of reserves carried over from the Cadbury acquisition in 2010 no longer required), lower advertising and consumer promotion costs, the impact of an accounting calendar change and lower raw material costs (primarily coffee). 39 Table of Contents North America For the Years EndedDecember 31, 2014 2013 $ change % change (in millions) Net revenues $ 6,936 $ 6,991 $ (55 ) (0.8)% Segment operating income 922 889 33 3.7% For the Years EndedDecember 31, 2013 2012 $ change % change (in millions) Net revenues $ 6,991 $ 6,903 $ 88 1.3% Segment operating income 889 781 108 13.8% 2014 compared with 2013: Net revenues decreased $55 million (0.8%), due to unfavorable currency (1.0 pp) and the impact of divestitures (0.6 pp), partially offset by favorable volume/mix (0.7 pp) and higher net pricing (0.1 pp).

These favorable items were partially offset by higher 2012-2014 Restructuring Program costs, higher raw material costs, and the impact of a current and prior-year divestitures. 40 Table of Contents Critical Accounting Estimates We prepare our condensed consolidated financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP. The preparation of these financial statements requires the use of estimates, judgments and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the periods presented. Actual results could differ from those estimates and assumptions. Note 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, to the consolidated financial statements includes a summary of the significant accounting policies we used to prepare our consolidated financial statements. We have discussed the selection and disclosure of our critical accounting policies and estimates with our Audit Committee. The following is a review of our most significant assumptions and estimates. Goodwill and Non-Amortizable Intangible Assets: We test goodwill and non-amortizable intangible assets for impairment on an annual basis in the fourth quarter. We assess goodwill impairment risk throughout the year by performing a qualitative review of entity-specific, industry, market and general economic factors affecting the reporting units with goodwill. Annually, we may perform qualitative testing, or depending on factors such as prior-year test results, current year developments, current risk evaluations and other practical considerations, we may elect to do quantitative testing instead. Quantitative impairment testing consists of a two-step evaluation. The first step compares a reporting unit’s estimated fair value with its carrying value. We estimate a reporting unit’s fair value using a discounted cash flow method which incorporates planned growth rates, market-based discount rates and estimates of residual value. This year, for reporting units in our Europe and North America segments, we used a market-based, weighted-average cost of capital of 6.9% to discount the projected cash flows of those operations. For our Latin America, Asia Pacific and EEMEA reporting units, we used a risk-rated discount rate of 9.9%. Estimating the fair value of individual reporting units requires us to make assumptions and estimates regarding our future plans and industry and economic conditions, and our actual results and conditions may differ over time. If the carrying value of a reporting unit’s net assets exceeds its fair value, we apply the second step to measure the difference between the carrying value and implied fair value of goodwill. If the carrying value of goodwill exceeds its implied fair value, the goodwill is impaired and its carrying value is reduced to the implied fair value of the goodwill. On January 1, 2014, an organizational change occurred within our North America region from a country and product category structure to a regional product category structure. As a result, our North America region now has two instead of four reporting units. For any reporting units that were reorganized, the goodwill was allocated to the new reporting unit structure based on relative fair values of the related business units. In 2014, 2013 and 2012, all reporting units passed our annual goodwill impairment testing. If expectations are not met or specific valuation factors outside of our control, such as discount rates, change significantly, then the estimated fair value of a reporting unit or reporting units might decline and lead to a goodwill impairment in the future. We test non-amortizable intangible assets for impairment by performing a qualitative review and assessing events and circumstances that could affect the fair value or carrying value of the indefinite-lived intangible assets. If significant potential impairment risk exists for a specific asset, we quantitatively test it for impairment by comparing its estimated fair value with its carrying value. Estimated fair value is determined using planned growth rates, market-based discount rates and estimates of royalty rates. If the carrying value of the asset exceeds its estimated fair value, the asset is impaired and its carrying value is reduced to the estimated fair value. During our 2014 review of non-amortizable intangible assets, we recorded $57 million of impairment charges related to two trademarks. In both cases, the impairments arose due to lower than expected product growth and decisions made in the fourth quarter to redirect support for the products to other regional brands. We recorded a $48 million charge related to a biscuit trademark in our Asia Pacific segment and a $9 million charge related to a candy trademark in our Europe segment. The impairment charges were calculated as the excess of the carrying value over the estimated fair value of the intangible assets on a global basis and were recorded within asset impairment and exit costs. We primarily use a relief of royalty valuation method, which utilizes estimates of future sales, growth rates, royalty rates and discount rates in determining a brand’s global fair value. During our 2014 intangible asset impairment review, we also noted three brands with $341 million of aggregate book value as of December 31, 2014 that each had a fair value in excess of book value of 10% or less. While these intangible assets passed our annual impairment testing and we believe our current plans for each of these brands will allow them to continue to not be impaired, if expectations are not met or specific valuation factors outside of our control, such as discount rates, change significantly, then a brand or brands could become impaired in the future. Refer also to Note 5, Goodwill and Intangible Assets, for additional information. 41 Table of Contents Trade and marketing programs: We promote our products with advertising, marketing, sales incentives and trade promotions. These programs include, but are not limited to, cooperative advertising, in-store displays, consumer promotions, new product introduction fees, discounts, coupons, rebates and volume-based incentives. We expense advertising costs either in the period the advertising first takes place or as incurred. Sales incentive and trade promotion activities are recorded as a reduction to revenues based on amounts estimated due to customers and consumers at the end of a period. We base these estimates principally on historical utilization and redemption rates. For interim reporting purposes, advertising expenses and sales incentives are charged to operations as a percentage of volume, based on estimated volume and estimated program spending. We do not defer costs on our year-end consolidated balance sheet and all marketing costs are recorded as an expense in the year incurred. Employee Benefit Plans: We sponsor various employee benefit plans throughout the world. These include primarily pension plans and postretirement healthcare benefits. For accounting purposes, we estimate the pension and post-retirement healthcare benefit obligations utilizing assumptions and estimates for discount rates; expected returns on plan assets; expected compensation increases; employee-related factors such as turnover, retirement age and mortality (during 2014, we applied the new mortality tables in accounting for our U.S. pension plans); and health care cost trends. We review our actuarial assumptions on an annual basis and make modifications to the assumptions based on current rates and trends when appropriate. Our assumptions also reflect our historical experiences and management’s best judgment regarding future expectations. These and other assumptions affect the annual expense and obligations recognized for the underlying plans. As permitted by U.S. GAAP, we generally amortize the effect of changes in the assumptions over future periods. The cost or benefit of plan changes, such as increasing or decreasing benefits for prior employee service (prior service cost), is deferred and included in expense on a straight-line basis over the average remaining service period of the employees expected to receive benefits. Since pension and post-retirement liabilities are measured on a discounted basis, the discount rate significantly affects our plan obligations and expenses. The expected return on plan assets assumption affects our pension plan expenses, since many of our pension plans are partially funded. The assumptions for discount rates and expected rates of return and our process for setting these assumptions are described in Note 10, Benefit Plans, to the consolidated financial statements. While we do not anticipate further changes in the 2015 assumptions for our U.S. and non-U.S. pension and postretirement health care plans, as a sensitivity measure, a fifty-basis point change in our discount rates or the expected rate of return on plan assets would have the following effects, increase / (decrease), on our annual benefit plan costs: As of December 31, 2014 U.S. Plans Non-U.S. Plans Fifty-Basis-Point Fifty-Basis-Point Increase Decrease Increase Decrease (in millions) Effect of change in discount rate onpension costs $ (13 ) $ 14 $ (56 ) $ 82 Effect of change in expected rateof return on plan assets on pension costs (5 ) 5 (41 ) 41 Effect of change in discount rate onpostretirement health care costs (3 ) 3 (1 ) 1 Income Taxes: As a global company, we calculate and provide for income taxes in each tax jurisdiction in which we operate. The provision for income taxes includes the amounts payable or refundable in the current year, the effect of deferred taxes and impacts from uncertain tax positions. Our provision for income taxes is significantly affected by shifts in the geographic mix of our pre-tax earnings across tax jurisdictions, changes in tax laws and regulations, tax planning opportunities available in each tax jurisdiction and the ultimate outcome of various tax audits. 42 Table of Contents Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between the financial statement and tax bases of our assets and liabilities and for operating losses and tax credit carryforwards. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates that will apply to taxable income in the years in which those differences are expected to be recovered or settled. Valuation allowances are established for deferred tax assets when it is more likely than not that a tax benefit will not be realized. We recognize tax benefits in our financial statements from uncertain tax positions only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by tax authorities based on the technical merits of the position. The amount we recognize is measured as the largest benefit that has a greater than 50 percent likelihood of being realized upon settlement. We evaluate uncertain tax positions on an ongoing basis and adjust the related tax liabilities or assets in light of changing facts and circumstances, such as the progress of a tax audit or expiration of a statute of limitations. We believe the estimates and assumptions used to support our evaluation of uncertain tax positions are reasonable. However, final determination of historical tax liabilities, either by settlement with tax authorities or expiration of statutes of limitations, could be materially different from estimates reflected on our consolidated balance sheet and historical income tax provisions. The outcome of these final determinations could have a material effect on our provision for income taxes, net earnings or cash flows in the period in which the determination is made. We believe our tax positions comply with applicable tax laws and that we have adequately accounted for uncertain tax positions. No taxes have been provided on undistributed foreign earnings that are planned to be indefinitely reinvested. If future events, such as material changes in long-term investment requirements, necessitate that these earnings be distributed, an additional provision for taxes may apply, which could materially affect our future effective tax rate. See Note 15, Income Taxes, for additional information on our effective tax rate, current and deferred taxes, valuation allowances and unrecognized tax benefits. Contingencies: See Note 11, Commitments and Contingencies, to the consolidated financial statements. New Accounting Guidance: See Note 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, to the consolidated financial statements for a discussion of new accounting standards. Commodity Trends We regularly monitor worldwide supply, commodity cost and currency trends so we can cost-effectively secure ingredients, packaging and fuel required for production. During 2014, the primary drivers of the increase in our aggregate commodity costs were increased cocoa, dairy, packaging, energy and coffee bean costs and higher currency-related costs on our commodity purchases, partially offset by lower costs for sugar and grains and oils due primarily to hedging. A number of external factors such as weather conditions, commodity market conditions, currency fluctuations and the effects of governmental agricultural or other programs affect the cost and availability of raw materials and agricultural materials used in our products. We address higher commodity costs and currency impacts primarily through hedging, higher pricing and manufacturing and overhead cost control. We use hedging techniques to limit the impact of fluctuations in the cost of our principal raw materials; however, we may not be able to fully hedge against commodity cost changes, and our hedging strategies may not protect us from increases in specific raw material costs. We generally also price to protect gross profit dollars. Due to competitive or market conditions, planned trade or promotional incentives, or other factors, our pricing actions may lag commodity cost changes temporarily. We expect price volatility and a slightly higher aggregate cost environment to continue in 2015. While the costs of our principal raw materials fluctuate, we believe there will continue to be an adequate supply of the raw materials we use and that they will generally remain available from numerous sources. 43 Table of Contents Liquidity and Capital Resources We believe that cash from operations, our $4.5 billion revolving credit facility and our authorized long-term financing will provide sufficient liquidity for our working capital needs, planned capital expenditures, future contractual obligations, share repurchases and payment of our anticipated quarterly dividends. We expect to maintain investment grade credit ratings on our debt. We continue to utilize our commercial paper program, primarily uncommitted international credit lines and long-term debt issuances for regular funding requirements. We also use intercompany loans with our international subsidiaries to improve financial flexibility. Overall, we do not expect any negative effects to our funding sources that would have a material effect on our liquidity, including the indefinite reinvestment of our earnings outside of the United States. In Venezuela, we consider all undistributed earnings to be indefinitely reinvested and access to cash of $278 million in Venezuela to be limited due to the uncertain economic and political environment. We do not expect this limitation to have a material adverse effect on our liquidity. Refer to Note 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies – Currency Translation and Highly Inflationary Accounting, for additional information. The cash flow activity of the Kraft Foods Group, Inc. discontinued operation, which was divested on October 1, 2012, is included within our consolidated cash flow results for periods prior to October 1, 2012. Net Cash Provided by Operating Activities: Operating activities provided net cash of $3,562 million in 2014, $6,410 million in 2013 and $3,923 million in 2012. The decrease in operating cash flows in 2014 relative to 2013 was primarily related to our receipt of $2.6 billion of net cash from the resolution of the Starbucks arbitration in 2013 and higher related income taxes paid in 2014 and lower relative working capital cash improvements than in 2013, as we decreased our cash conversion cycle (a metric that measures working capital efficiency and utilizes days sales outstanding, days inventory on hand and days payables outstanding) by 10 days in 2014 as compared to a 13 day reduction in 2013. These year-over-year decreases were partially offset by lower interest payments in 2014 following the debt refinancing in the first quarter of 2014 and the fourth quarter of 2013. The increase in operating cash flows in 2013 relative to 2012 was primarily related to the receipt of the $2.6 billion from the Starbucks arbitration resolution, lower spending on Spin-Off Costs and the 2012-2014 Restructuring Program, lengthening of days payables outstanding, increased collection of receivables and lower interest payments. Net Cash Used in Investing Activities: Net cash used in investing activities was $1,642 million in 2014, $1,483 million in 2013 and $1,687 million in 2012. The increase in net cash used in investing activities in 2014 relates to lower cash inflows in 2014 to offset higher capital expenditures in 2014. In 2013, we received higher cash proceeds from property sales, net proceeds from divestitures and cash from Kraft Foods Group, Inc. in connection with the Spin-Off, partially offset by cash we paid for an acquisition in Morocco. The decrease in net cash used in investing activities in 2013 relative to 2012 related to payments made to Kraft Foods Group, Inc. in 2012 in connection with the Spin-Off, partially offset by cash we paid for the acquisition in Morocco and lower proceeds from divestitures in 2013. Capital expenditures were $1,642 million in 2014, $1,622 million in 2013 and $1,610 million in 2012. The 2014 capital expenditures were funded from operating activities and were made primarily to modernize manufacturing facilities and support new product and productivity initiatives. We expect 2015 capital expenditures to be up to $1.8 billion, including capital expenditures required for investments in systems and the 2014-2018 Restructuring Program. We expect to continue to fund these expenditures from operations. Net Cash (Used in) / Provided by Financing Activities: Net cash used in or provided by financing activities was $2,688 million used in 2014, $6,687 million used in 2013 and $204 million provided in 2012. The decrease in net cash used in financing activities in 2014 relative to 2013 was primarily due to significantly lower long-term debt repayments and lower share repurchases in 2014, offset in part by decreased proceeds from the issuance of long-term debt and other short-term borrowings and higher dividend payments in 2014. The decrease in net cash provided by financing activities in 2013 relative to 2012 was primarily due to lower net proceeds from the issuance of long-term debt, higher re-payment of long-term debt and repurchases of Common Stock, partially offset by lower dividend payments reflecting our new capital structure and dividend rate following the Spin-Off and higher short-term borrowings. 44 Table of Contents Debt: From time to time we refinance long-term and short-term debt. The nature and amount of our long-term and short-term debt and the proportionate amount of each varies as a result of current and expected business requirements, market conditions and other factors. Generally, in the first and second quarters of the year, our working capital requirements grow, increasing the need for short-term financing. The third and fourth quarters of the year typically generate higher cash flows. As such, we may issue commercial paper or secure other forms of financing throughout the year to meet short-term working capital needs. In February 2014, our Board of Directors approved a $5 billion long-term financing authority that remains available as of December 31, 2014. In the next 12 months, $1,513 million of long-term debt will mature as follows: $1,029 million in March 2015 and €400 million ($484 million as of December 31, 2014) in June 2015. We expect to fund these repayments with cash from operations and the issuance of commercial paper or additional debt. Our total debt was $16.7 billion at December 31, 2014 and $17.1 billion at December 31, 2013. Our debt-to-capitalization ratio was 0.38 at December 31, 2014 and 0.35 at December 31, 2013. At December 31, 2014, the weighted-average term of our outstanding long-term debt was 7.7 years. Our average daily commercial borrowings were $1.9 billion in 2014, $1.0 billion in 2013 and $1.0 billion in 2012. We expect to continue to comply with our long-term debt covenants. Refer to Note 8, Debt and Borrowing Arrangements, for more information on our debt and debt covenants. Equity and Dividends Stock Plans: See Note 12, Stock Plans, to the consolidated financial statements for more information on our stock plans, grant activity during 2014, 2013 and 2012, and stock award modifications related to the Spin-Off. Share Repurchases: See Note 13, Capital Stock, to the consolidated financial statements for more information on our share repurchase and accelerated share repurchase programs. We intend to continue to use a portion of our cash for share repurchases. Under our current Board of Directors’ authorization to repurchase up to $7.7 billion of our Common Stock through December 31, 2016, we have repurchased $4.6 billion ($1.9 billion in 2014 and $2.7 billion in 2013) of shares, with $3.1 billion of share repurchase capacity remaining. The number of shares that we ultimately repurchase under our share repurchase program may vary depending on numerous factors, including share price and other market conditions, our ongoing capital allocation planning, levels of cash and debt balances, other demands for cash, such as acquisition activity, general economic or business conditions and board and management discretion. Additionally, our share repurchase activity during any particular period may fluctuate. We may accelerate, suspend, delay or discontinue our share repurchase program at any time, without notice. Dividends: We paid dividends of $964 million in 2014, $943 million in 2013 and $2,058 million in 2012. Immediately following the Spin-Off of Kraft Foods Group, Inc. on October 1, 2012, our annual dividend rate changed to $0.52 per common share. On August 6, 2013, our Audit Committee, with authorization from our Board of Directors, approved an 8% increase in the quarterly dividend to $0.14 per common share or $0.56 per common share on an annual basis. On August 5, 2014, our Audit Committee, with authorization from our Board of Directors, approved a 7% increase in the quarterly dividend to $0.15 per common share or $0.60 per common share on an annual basis. The declaration of dividends is subject to the discretion of our Board of Directors and depends on various factors, including our net earnings, financial condition, cash requirements, future prospects and other factors that our Board of Directors deems relevant to its analysis and decision making. 45 Table of Contents Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements and Aggregate Contractual Obligations We have no significant off-balance sheet arrangements other than the contractual obligations discussed below. Guarantees: As discussed in Note 11, Commitments and Contingencies, we enter into third-party guarantees primarily to cover the long-term obligations of our vendors. As part of these transactions, we guarantee that third parties will make contractual payments or achieve performance measures. At December 31, 2014, we had no material third-party guarantees recorded on our consolidated balance sheet. In addition, at December 31, 2014, we were contingently liable for $743 million of guarantees related to our own performance. These include letters of credit and guarantees related to the payment of custom duties and taxes. Guarantees do not have, and we do not expect them to have, a material effect on our liquidity. Aggregate Contractual Obligations: The following table summarizes our contractual obligations at December 31, 2014. Payments Due Total 2015 2016-17 2018-19 2020 andThereafter (in millions) Debt (1) $ 15,381 $ 1,513 $ 3,254 $ 2,947 $ 7,667 Interest expense (2) 6,939 700 1,224 877 4,138 Capital leases 24 17 7 – – Operating leases (3) 1,080 309 409 231 131 Purchase obligations: (4) Inventory and production costs 6,544 3,935 1,664 811 134 Other 1,378 1,051 320 7 – 7,922 4,986 1,984 818 134 Other long-term liabilities (5) 666 43 126 190 307 Total $ 32,012 $ 7,568 $ 7,004 $ 5,063 $ 12,377 (1) Amounts include the expected cash payments of our long-term debt excluding capital leases, which are presented separately in the table above. The amounts also exclude $(10) million of net unamortized non-cash bond premiums and discounts and mark-to-market adjustments related to our interest rate swaps recorded in total debt. (2) Amounts represent the expected cash payments of our interest expense on our long-term debt. Interest calculated on our euro and British pound sterling notes were forecasted using currency exchange rates as of December 31, 2014. An insignificant amount of interest expense was excluded from the table for a portion of our other non-U.S. debt obligations due to the complexities involved in forecasting expected interest payments. (3) Operating lease payments represent the minimum rental commitments under non-cancelable operating leases. (4) Purchase obligations for inventory and production costs (such as raw materials, indirect materials and supplies, packaging, co-manufacturing arrangements, storage and distribution) are commitments for projected needs to be utilized in the normal course of business. Other purchase obligations include commitments for marketing, advertising, capital expenditures, information technology and professional services. Arrangements are considered purchase obligations if a contract specifies all significant terms, including fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased, a pricing structure and approximate timing of the transaction. Most arrangements are cancelable without a significant penalty and with short notice (usually 30 days). Any amounts reflected on the consolidated balance sheet as accounts payable and accrued liabilities are excluded from the table above. (5) Other long-term liabilities include estimated future benefit payments for our postretirement health care plans through December 31, 2024 of $203 million. We are unable to reliably estimate the timing of the payments beyond 2024; as such, they are excluded from the above table. There are also another $280 million of various other long-term liabilities that are expected to be paid over the next 5 years. In addition, the following long-term liabilities included on the consolidated balance sheet are excluded from the table above: accrued pension costs, income taxes, insurance accruals and other accruals. We are unable to reliably estimate the timing of the payments (or contributions beyond 2015, in the case of accrued pension costs) for these items. We currently expect to make approximately $529 million in contributions to our pension plans in 2015. We also expect that our net pension cost will increase to approximately $321 million in 2015. The increase is primarily due to lower discount rates offset by favorable beginning of the year asset levels and planned contributions. As of December 31, 2014, our total liability for income taxes, including uncertain tax positions and associated accrued interest and penalties, was $1,041 million. We currently estimate payments of approximately $133 million related to these positions over the next 12 months. 46 Table of Contents Non-GAAP Financial Measures We use non-GAAP financial information and believe it is useful to investors as it provides additional information to facilitate comparisons of historical operating results, identify trends in our underlying operating results and provide additional transparency on how we evaluate our business. We use certain non-GAAP financial measures to budget, make operating and strategic decisions and evaluate our performance. We disclose non-GAAP financial measures so that you have the same financial data that we use to assist you in making comparisons to our historical operating results and analyzing our underlying performance. Our non-GAAP financial measures reflect how we evaluate our current and prior-year operating results. As new events or circumstances arise, these definitions could change over time: • “Organic Net Revenue” is defined as net revenues excluding the impact of acquisitions, divestitures (including businesses under sale agreements and exits of major product lines under a sale or licensing agreement), Integration Program costs, accounting calendar changes and currency rate fluctuations. • “Adjusted Operating Income” is defined as operating income excluding the impact of Spin-Off Costs, pension costs related to obligations transferred in the Spin-Off, the 2012-2014 Restructuring Program, the 2014-2018 Restructuring Program, the Integration Program and other acquisition integration costs, the remeasurement of net monetary assets in Venezuela, the benefit from the Cadbury acquisition-related indemnification resolution, incremental costs associated with the JDE coffee transactions, impairment charges related to goodwill and intangible assets, gains or losses on divestitures or acquisitions, acquisition-related costs and the operating results of divestitures (including businesses under sale agreements and exits of major product lines under a sale or licensing agreement). We also evaluate growth in our Adjusted Operating Income on a constant currency basis. • “Adjusted EPS” is defined as diluted EPS attributable to Mondelēz International from continuing operations excluding the impact of Spin-Off Costs, pension costs related to the obligations transferred in the Spin-Off, the 2012-2014 Restructuring Program, the 2014-2018 Restructuring Program, the Integration Program and other acquisition integration costs, the remeasurement of net monetary assets in Venezuela, the net benefit from the Cadbury acquisition-related indemnification resolution, losses on debt extinguishment and related expenses, the residual tax benefit impact from the resolution of the Starbucks arbitration, hedging gains or losses and incremental costs associated with the JDE coffee transactions, impairment charges related to goodwill and intangible assets, gains or losses on divestitures or acquisitions, acquisition-related costs and net earnings from divestitures (including businesses under sale agreements and exits of major product lines under a sale or licensing agreement), and including an interest expense adjustment related to the Spin-Off transaction. We also evaluate growth in our Adjusted EPS on a constant currency basis. We believe that the presentation of these non-GAAP financial measures, when considered together with our U.S. GAAP financial measures and the reconciliations to the corresponding U.S. GAAP financial measures, provides you with a more complete understanding of the factors and trends affecting our business than could be obtained absent these disclosures. Because non-GAAP financial measures may vary among other companies, the non-GAAP financial measures presented in this report may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies. Our use of these non-GAAP financial measures is not meant to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for any U.S. GAAP financial measure. A limitation of these non-GAAP financial measures is they exclude items detailed below that have an impact on our U.S. GAAP reported results. The best way this limitation can be addressed is by evaluating our non-GAAP financial measures in combination with our U.S. GAAP reported results and carefully evaluating the following tables that reconcile U.S. GAAP reported figures to the non-GAAP financial measures in this Form 10-K. 47 Table of Contents Organic Net Revenue Applying the definition of “Organic Net Revenue”, the adjustments made to “net revenues” (the most comparable U.S. GAAP financial measure) were to exclude the impact of currency, divestitures, an accounting calendar change in 2013 and acquisitions. We believe that Organic Net Revenue better reflects the underlying growth from the ongoing activities of our business and provides improved comparability of results.

Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk. As we operate globally, we are primarily exposed to currency exchange rate, commodity price and interest rate market risks. We monitor and manage these exposures as part of our overall risk management program. Our risk management program focuses on the unpredictability of financial markets and seeks to reduce the potentially adverse effects that the volatility of these markets may have on our operating results. We principally utilize derivative instruments to reduce significant, unanticipated earnings fluctuations that may arise from volatility in currency exchange rates, commodity prices and interest rates. For additional information on our derivative activity and the types of derivative instruments we use to hedge our currency exchange, commodity price and interest rate exposures, see Note 9, Financial Instruments. Many of our non-U.S. subsidiaries operate in functional currencies other than the U.S. dollar. Fluctuations in currency exchange rates create volatility in our reported results as we translate the balance sheets, operating results and cash flows of these subsidiaries into the U.S. dollar for consolidated reporting purposes. The translation of non-U.S. dollar denominated balance sheets and statements of earnings of our subsidiaries into the U.S. dollar for consolidated reporting generally results in a cumulative translation adjustment to other comprehensive income within equity. A stronger U.S. dollar relative to other functional currencies adversely affects our consolidated earnings and net assets while a weaker U.S. dollar benefits our consolidated earnings and net assets. While we hedge significant forecasted currency exchange transactions as well as certain net assets of non-U.S. operations and other currency impacts, we cannot fully predict or eliminate volatility arising from changes in currency exchange rates on our consolidated financial results. See Consolidated Results of Operations and Results of Operations by Reportable Segment under Discussion and Analysis of Historical Results for currency exchange effects on our financial results during 2014. For additional information on the impact of currency policies and the remeasurement of our Venezuelan net monetary assets on our financial condition and results of operations, also see Note 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies—Currency Translation and Highly Inflationary Accounting. We also continually monitor the market for commodities that we use in our products. Input costs may fluctuate widely due to international demand, weather conditions, government policy and regulation and unforeseen conditions. To manage the input cost volatility, we enter into forward purchase agreements and other derivative financial instruments. We also pursue productivity and cost saving measures and take pricing actions when necessary to mitigate the impact of higher input costs on earnings. We regularly evaluate our variable and fixed-rate debt as well as current and expected interest rates in the markets in which we raise capital. Our primary exposures include movements in U.S. Treasury rates, corporate credit spreads, London Interbank Offered Rates (“LIBOR”), Euro Interbank Offered Rate (“EURIBOR”) and commercial paper rates. We periodically use interest rate swaps and forward interest rate contracts to achieve a desired proportion of variable versus fixed rate debt based on current and projected market conditions. In addition to using interest rate derivatives to manage future interest payments, earlier this year and in the fourth quarter of 2013, we also retired $5 billion of our long-term debt and issued $6.3 billion of lower borrowing cost debt. Our weighted-average interest rate on our total debt as of December 31, 2014 was 4.3%, down from 4.8% as of December 31, 2013. Value at Risk: We use a value at risk (“VAR”) computation to estimate: 1) the potential one-day loss in the fair value of our interest rate-sensitive financial instruments; and 2) the potential one-day loss in pre-tax earnings of our currency and commodity price-sensitive derivative financial instruments. The VAR analysis was done separately for our currency exchange, fixed income and commodity risk portfolios as of each quarter end during 2014. The instruments included in the VAR computation were currency exchange forwards and options for currency exchange risk, debt and swaps for interest rate risk, and commodity forwards, futures and options for commodity risk. Excluded from the computation were anticipated transactions, currency trade payables and receivables, and net investments in non-U.S. subsidiaries, which the abovementioned instruments are intended to hedge. The VAR model assumes normal market conditions, a 95% confidence interval and a one-day holding period. A parametric delta-gamma approximation technique was used to determine the expected return distribution in interest rates, currencies and commodity prices for the purpose of calculating the fixed income, currency exchange and commodity VAR, respectively. The parameters used for estimating the expected return distributions were determined by observing interest rate, currency exchange, and commodity price movements over the prior quarter for the calculation of VAR amounts at December 31, 2014 and 2013, and over each of the four prior quarters for the calculation of average VAR amounts during each year. The values of currency and commodity options do not change on a one-to-one basis with the underlying currency or commodity and were valued accordingly in the VAR computation. 52 Table of Contents As of December 31, 2014, the estimated potential one-day loss in fair value of our interest rate-sensitive instruments, primarily debt, and the estimated potential one-day loss in pre-tax earnings from our currency and commodity instruments, as calculated in the VAR model, were: Pre-Tax Earnings Impact Fair Value Impact At 12/31/14 Average High Low At 12/31/14 Average High Low (in millions) Instruments sensitive to: Interest rates $ 50 $ 41 $ 50 $ 30 Foreign currency rates $ 51 $ 42 $ 58 $ 25 Commodity prices 26 28 38 19 Pre-Tax Earnings Impact Fair Value Impact At 12/31/13 Average High Low At 12/31/13 Average High Low (in millions) Instruments sensitive to: Interest rates $ 44 $ 70 $ 112 $ 44 Foreign currency rates $ 28 $ 19 $ 28 $ 13 Commodity prices 25 18 25 14 This VAR computation is a risk analysis tool designed to statistically estimate the maximum expected daily loss, under the specified confidence interval and assuming normal market conditions, from adverse movements in interest rates, currency exchange rates and commodity prices. The computation does not represent actual losses in fair value or earnings we will incur, nor does it consider the effect of favorable changes in market rates. We cannot predict actual future movements in market rates and do not present these VAR results to be indicative of future movements in market rates or to be representative of any actual impact that future changes in market rates may have on our future financial results. 53 Table of Contents",2023-12-30 19:01:10.147242
1103982,MDLZ,"Mondelez International, Inc.",2016,"Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. The following discussion and analysis contains forward-looking statements. It should be read in conjunction with the other sections of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, including the consolidated financial statements and related notes contained in Item 8, “Forward-Looking Statements” and “Risk Factors” contained in Item 1A. Description of the Company We manufacture and market primarily snack food products, including biscuits (cookies, crackers and salted snacks), chocolate, gum & candy and various cheese & grocery products, as well as powdered beverage products. We have operations in more than 80 countries and sell our products in 165 countries. Over the last several years, we have built a presence in the snacking category. We have expanded geographically and continue to invest in product quality, marketing and innovation behind our iconic brands while also implementing a series of cost saving initiatives. Our goals are to achieve industry-leading revenue growth over time driven by the higher expected growth rates of advantaged snack categories; leverage our cost structure through supply chain reinvention, productivity programs, overhead streamlining, volume growth and improved product mix to drive margin gains; and grow earnings per share in the top-tier of our peer group. Coffee Business Transactions On July 2, 2015, we completed transactions to combine our wholly owned coffee businesses (including our coffee portfolio in France) with those of D.E Master Blenders 1753 B.V. (“DEMB”) to create a new company, Jacobs Douwe Egberts or JDE. We currently hold a 43.5% equity interest in JDE and Acorn Holdings B.V. (“AHBV”), owner of DEMB, holds the remaining 56.5% equity interest. In connection with the contribution of our global coffee businesses to JDE, we recorded a pre-tax gain of $6.8 billion (or $6.6 billion after taxes) in 2015. We also recorded approximately $1.0 billion of pre-tax net gains related to hedging the expected cash proceeds from the transactions as described further below. The consideration we have received to date consists of €3.8 billion of cash ($4.2 billion U.S. dollars as of July 2, 2015), a 43.5% equity interest in JDE and $794 million in receivables (related to sales price adjustments and tax formation cost payments). During the third quarter of 2015, we also recorded $283 million of cash and receivables from JDE related to reimbursement of costs that we incurred in separating our coffee businesses. The cash and equity consideration we received at closing reflects that we retained our interest in a Korea-based joint venture, Dongsuh Foods Corporation. During the second quarter of 2015, we also completed the sale of our interest in a Japanese coffee joint venture, Ajinomoto General Foods, Inc. (“AGF”). In lieu of contributing our interest in the AGF joint venture to JDE, we contributed the net cash proceeds from the sale, and the transaction did not change the consideration received for our global coffee businesses. Please see Note 2, Divestitures and Acquisitions – Other Divestitures, Acquisitions and Sales of Property, for discussion of the divestiture of AGF. During the fourth quarter, we and JDE concluded negotiations of a sales price adjustment and completed the valuation of our investment in JDE. Primarily related to the negotiated resolution of the sales price adjustment in the fourth quarter, we recorded a $313 million reduction in the pre-tax gain on the coffee transaction, reducing the $7.1 billion estimated gain in the third quarter to the $6.8 billion final gain for 2015. As part of our sales price negotiations, we retained the right to collect future cash payments if certain estimated pension liabilities come in over an agreed amount in the future. As such, we may recognize additional income related to this negotiated term in the future. The final value of our investment in JDE on July 2, 2015 was €4.1 billion, or $4.5 billion. The fair value of the JDE investment was determined using both income-based and market-based valuation techniques. The discounted cash flow analysis reflected growth, discount and tax rates and other assumptions reflecting the underlying combined businesses and countries in which the combined coffee businesses operate. In connection with the expected receipt of cash in euros at the time of closing, we entered into a number of consecutive currency exchange forward contracts in 2014 and 2015 to lock in an equivalent expected value in U.S. dollars as of the date the coffee business transactions were first announced in May 2014. Cumulatively, we realized aggregate net gains 23 and received cash of approximately $1.0 billion on these hedging contracts that increased the cash we received in connection with the coffee business transactions from $4.2 billion in cash consideration received to $5.2 billion. In connection with these currency contracts and the transfer of the sale proceeds to our subsidiaries that deconsolidated net assets and shares, we recognized a net gain of $628 million in 2014 and a net gain of $436 million in 2015 within interest and other expense, net. For additional information on the JDE coffee transactions, see Note 2, Divestitures and Acquisitions. On December 18, 2015, AHBV and we agreed to provide JDE additional capital to pay down some of its debt with lenders. Our pro rata share of the capital increase was €499 million ($544 million U.S. dollars as of December 18, 2015) and was made in return for additional shares in JDE such that we retained our 43.5% interest in JDE following the capital increase. To fund our share of the capital increase, we contributed €460 million ($501 million) of JDE receivables and made a €39 million ($43 million) cash payment. On December 6, 2015, we agreed to make an investment in Keurig Green Mountain Inc. (“Keurig”), which is contingent upon the successful completion of a planned acquisition of Keurig by JAB Holding Co. (“JAB” and parent company of AHBV). Following the close of JAB’s planned acquisition of Keurig in early 2016, we intend to exchange a portion of our equity interest in JDE for an equity interest in Keurig. Following the exchange of shares, we expect our ownership in JDE to decrease to approximately 26.5% and our interest in Keurig to be somewhat lower. We expect to account for both investments under the equity method, resulting in our recognizing our share of their earnings within our earnings and our share of their dividends within our cash flows. Our governance rights in JDE will not change significantly and we will have similar governance rights in Keurig following the transaction. Our investment in Keurig will follow the acquisition of Keurig by JAB, which is expected to be completed by the end of the first quarter of 2016 or early in the second quarter. As our exchange of shares in JDE for the investment in Keurig is conditioned upon the actions of JAB and Keurig’s existing shareholders and is subject to further regulatory antitrust reviews, we have not reflected the portion of our investment in JDE that would be exchanged for the Keurig investment as assets held for sale as of December 31, 2015. Venezuela Deconsolidation Effective as of the close of the 2015 fiscal year, we concluded that we no longer met the accounting criteria for consolidation of our Venezuela subsidiaries due to a loss of control over our Venezuelan operations and an other-than-temporary lack of currency exchangeability. As of the close of the 2015 fiscal year, we deconsolidated and changed to the cost method of accounting for our Venezuelan operations. We recorded a $778 million pre-tax loss as we reduced the value of our cost method investment in Venezuela and all Venezuelan receivables held by our other subsidiaries to realizable fair value, resulting in full impairment. The recorded loss also included historical cumulative translation adjustments related to our Venezuelan operations that had previously been recorded in accumulated other comprehensive losses within equity. Beginning in 2016, we will no longer include net revenues, earnings or net assets from our Venezuelan subsidiaries within our consolidated financial statements. Under the cost method of accounting, we will recognize earnings only to the extent cash is received from our Venezuelan subsidiaries. Given the current and ongoing difficult economic, regulatory and business environment in Venezuela, there continues to be significant uncertainty related to our operations in Venezuela and we expect these conditions will continue for the foreseeable future. We will monitor the extent of our ability to control our Venezuelan operations and the liquidity and availability of U.S. dollars at different rates as our current situation in Venezuela may change over time and lead to consolidation at a future date. See below Discussion and Analysis of Historical Results – Items Affecting Comparability of Financial Results, and Note 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies – Currency Translation and Highly Inflationary Accounting: Venezuela, for more information on our historical Venezuela operating results, including the remeasurement losses and loss on deconsolidation. 24 Summary of Results • Net revenues decreased 13.5% to $29.6 billion in 2015 and decreased 3.0% to $34.2 billion in 2014. Net revenues in 2015 were significantly affected by unfavorable currency translation as the U.S. dollar strengthened against most currencies in which we operate compared to exchange rates in the prior year and the July 2, 2015 deconsolidation of our global coffee business. • Organic Net Revenue increased 3.7% to $31.6 billion in 2015 and increased 2.5% to $32.1 billion in 2014. Organic Net Revenue is a non-GAAP financial measure we use to evaluate our underlying results (see the definition of Organic Net Revenue and our reconciliation with net revenues within Non-GAAP Financial Measures appearing later in this section). • Diluted EPS attributable to Mondelēz International increased 246.9% to $4.44 in 2015 and decreased 41.6% to $1.28 in 2014. Excluding the results of discontinued operations in 2013, our diluted EPS attributable to Mondelēz International from continuing operations decreased 0.8% to $1.28 in 2014. A number of significant items also affected the comparability of our reported results, as further described in the Discussion and Analysis of Historical Results appearing later in this section and in the notes to the consolidated financial statements. • Adjusted EPS remained flat at $1.75 in 2015 and increased 13.6% to $1.75 in 2014. On a constant currency basis, Adjusted EPS increased 18.9% to $2.08 in 2015 and increased 22.7% to $1.89 in 2014. Adjusted EPS is a non-GAAP financial measure we use to evaluate our underlying results (see the definition of Adjusted EPS and our reconciliation with diluted EPS within Non-GAAP Financial Measures appearing later in this section). Financial Outlook We seek to achieve top-tier financial performance. We manage our business to achieve this goal using three key operating metrics: Organic Net Revenue, Adjusted Operating Income and Adjusted EPS. (Refer to Non-GAAP Financial Measures appearing later in this section for more information on these measures.) Additional metrics that we use or monitor include product quality measures, category growth, market share performance, margins, pricing net of commodity costs, net commodity inflation, volume growth, Power Brand Organic Net Revenue growth, gross and net productivity savings, brand support and related investments, capital spending, cash conversion cycle, free cash flow, return on invested capital and shareholder returns. We also monitor a number of factors and trends that we expect may impact our revenues and profitability objectives: Long-Term Demographics and Consumer Trends – Snack food consumption is highly correlated to GDP growth, urbanization of the population and rising discretionary income levels associated with a growing middle class, particularly in emerging markets. Over the long-term, we expect these trends to continue leading to growth in key consumer behaviors, including increased snacking occasions, greater use of convenience food and migration to more frequent, smaller meals. In the near term, low GDP growth, high unemployment and weak consumer confidence in Europe and emerging markets have slowed category and our growth. Demand – We monitor consumer spending and our market share within the food and beverage categories in which we sell our products. Growth in the global categories increased from approximately 3.6% in 2014 to 5.5% in 2015, and our Organic Net Revenue growth also increased from 2.5% in 2014 to 3.7% in 2015. Our Organic Net Revenue included a 90 basis point headwind from strategic decisions to improve revenue mix. In 2015, we began to improve our revenue mix by discontinuing certain low margin, customer-specific product lines, discontinuing certain low-margin licensed products and continuing to simplify our portfolio. We anticipate taking similar actions to optimize our portfolio in 2016. The improvement in global category growth was largely driven by price relating to higher commodity costs and currency-related inflationary impacts. Over the long-term, we expect category growth to return to levels more in line with historical growth rates when the macroeconomic environment in emerging markets recovers to a better balance between price and volume/mix. We continue to make investments in our brands and build strong routes to market to address the needs of consumers in emerging and developed markets. In doing so, we anticipate stimulating demand in our categories and growing our position in these markets. Volatility of Global Markets – Our growth strategy depends in part on our ability to expand our operations, particularly in emerging markets. Some of these markets have greater political and economic volatility and vulnerability to infrastructure and labor disruptions, as we experienced this past year in markets including Argentina, Brazil, Russia, Ukraine and 25 Venezuela. Volatility in these markets affects demand for and the costs of our products and requires frequent changes in how we operate our business. There will likely be continued volatility across these and other markets in which we sell. As such, we are focused on continuing to manage our costs and adjusting prices as needed to recover changing costs while we continue to invest in our global Power Brands and routes to market. Competition – We operate in highly competitive markets that include global, regional and local competitors. Our advantaged geographic footprint, operating scale and portfolio of brands have all significantly contributed to building our market-leading positions across most of the product categories in which we sell. To grow and maintain our market positions, we focus on product quality, bringing new products and innovations to market and effectively meeting consumer needs and preferences. We pursue growth opportunities such as expanding our global operations and growing our portfolio of Power Brands and innovative products. We continue to optimize our manufacturing and other operations and invest in our brands through ongoing research and development, advertising, marketing and consumer promotions. Pricing – We adjust our product prices based on a number of variables including demand, the competitive environment and changes in our product input costs. Our net revenue growth and profitability may be affected as we adjust prices to address new conditions. In 2015, we generally increased prices in response to higher commodity costs, currency and other market factors. In 2016, we anticipate that we will adjust our prices in response to changing market conditions. Price competition or delayed price increases by competitors or customers may continue to affect net revenues or market share in the near term as the market adjusts to the changes in input costs and other market conditions. Operating Costs – Our operating costs include raw materials, labor, selling, general and administrative expenses, taxes, currency impacts and financing costs. We manage these costs through cost saving and productivity initiatives, sourcing and hedging programs, pricing actions, refinancing and tax planning. We also continue to work on programs to expand our profitability and margins, such as our 2014-2018 Restructuring Program, which is designed to bring about significant reductions in our operating cost structure in both our supply chain and overhead costs. Currency – As a global company with nearly 80% of our net revenues generated outside the United States, we are exposed to changes in global economic conditions and currency movements. In the last three years, the U.S. dollar strengthened relative to other currencies in which we operate, and several countries experienced significant declines in or devaluations of their currency. These currency movements had a significant negative effect on our reported results of operations. Our 2015 net revenues were $29.6 billion, down 13.5% from 2014, including a negative 12.6 percentage point impact from currency translation. Our 2014 net revenues were $34.2 billion, down 3.0% from 2013, including a negative 5.2 percentage point impact from currency translation. In 2013, net revenues were $35.3 billion, up 0.8%, including a negative 2.4 percentage point impact from currency translation. While we have net investment hedges in the form of local currency denominated debt to offset the translation of certain of our overseas operations, we generally do not hedge against currency translation. We primarily seek to hedge against economic losses on cross-currency transactions. Due to limited markets for hedging currency transactions and other factors, we may not be able to effectively hedge all of our cross-currency transaction risks. We have historically also been exposed to currency devaluation risks impacting earnings particularly in connection with our Venezuela operations, which as of December 31, 2015 has been deconsolidated. See Note 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies – Currency Translation and Highly Inflationary Accounting: Venezuela, for more information. The economy, monetary policies and other business restrictions in Venezuela, as well as in other developing countries, have created a challenging business environment in which to operate, and our ability to hedge against currency-related economic losses may be limited. While we work to mitigate our exposure to these currency risks, factors such as continued global market volatility, actions by foreign governments, political uncertainty and other external developments could lead to further unfavorable currency impacts in the future. Financing Costs – We regularly evaluate our variable and fixed-rate debt. We continue to use lower cost short- and long-term debt to finance our ongoing working capital, capital expenditures and other investments, dividends and share repurchases. In 2015, 2014 and 2013, we repaid $15.6 billion of our long-term debt and issued lower-cost long-term euro, British pound sterling, Swiss franc and U.S. dollar-denominated debt. Our weighted-average interest rate on our total debt as of December 31, 2015 was 3.7%, down from 4.3% as of December 31, 2014 and down from 4.8% as of December 31, 2013. Refer to Note 8, Debt and Borrowing Arrangements, for additional debt activity in 2016. 26 Discussion and Analysis of Historical Results Items Affecting Comparability of Financial Results The following table includes significant income or (expense) items that affected the comparability of our pre-tax results of operations and our effective tax rates.

We recognized net gains of $405 million on these contracts during 2015 and net gains of $628 million in 2014. We also monetized additional hedges during July 2015 and realized net pre-tax gains of $17 million. In connection with transferring the funds to our subsidiaries that deconsolidated net assets and shares, we incurred additional currency gains of $14 million in 2015. (2) Includes the 2015 divestiture of AGF and the 2013 divestures of a salty snacks business in Turkey, a confectionary business in South Africa and a chocolate business in Spain and does not include the deconsolidation of our coffee businesses, which is presented separately in the table above. 27 Consolidated Results of Operations The following discussion compares our consolidated results of operations for 2015 with 2014 and 2014 with 2013. 2015 compared with 2014 For the Years EndedDecember 31, 2015 2014 $ change % change (in millions, except per share data) Net revenues $ 29,636 $ 34,244 $ (4,608) (13.5)% Operating income 8,897 3,242 5,655 174.4% Earnings from continuing operations 7,291 2,201 5,090 231.3% Net earnings attributable toMondelēz International 7,267 2,184 5,083 232.7% Diluted earnings per share attributable to Mondelēz International 4.44 1.28 3.16 246.9% Net Revenues – Net revenues decreased $4,608 million (13.5%) to $29,636 million in 2015, and Organic Net Revenue (1) increased $1,131 million (3.7%) to $31,599 million. Organic Net Revenue growth from Power Brands was 5.4% and from emerging markets was 10.6%. The underlying changes in net revenues and Organic Net Revenue are detailed below: 2015 Change in net revenues (by percentage point) Higher net pricing 6.8pp Unfavorable volume/mix (3.1)pp Total change in Organic Net Revenue(1) 3.7% Unfavorable currency (12.6)pp Historical coffee business(2) (5.4)pp Impact of acquisitions 0.5pp Impact of accounting calendar change 0.3pp Total change in net revenues (13.5)% (1) Please see the Non-GAAP Financial Measures section at the end of this item. (2) Includes our historical global coffee business prior to the July 2, 2015 coffee business transactions. Refer to Note 2, Divestitures and Acquisitions, and Non-GAAP Financial Measures appearing later in this section for more information. Organic Net Revenue growth was driven by higher net pricing, partially offset by unfavorable volume/mix. Net pricing was up as we realized the effects of input cost-driven pricing actions taken during the year. Higher net pricing was reflected across all segments. Unfavorable volume/mix was largely due to price elasticity as well as strategic decisions to exit certain low-margin product lines. Unfavorable volume/mix was reflected in all segments except North America. Unfavorable currency impacts decreased net revenues by $3,833 million, due primarily to the strength of the U.S. dollar relative to several currencies, including the euro, Brazilian real, Russian ruble, Venezuelan bolivar, Australian dollar and British pound sterling. The adjustment for deconsolidating our historical coffee business resulted in a year-over-year decrease in net revenues of $2,149 million for the year. The July 15, 2015 acquisition of a biscuit operation in Vietnam added $128 million in incremental net revenues (constant currency basis) for the year. The North America segment accounting calendar change resulted in a year-over-year increase in net revenues of $78 million for the year. The February 16, 2015 acquisition of the Enjoy Life Foods snack food business in North America added $37 million in incremental net revenues for the year. 28 Operating Income – Operating income increased $5,655 million (174.4%) to $8,897 million in 2015, Adjusted Operating Income (1) increased $172 million (4.7%) to $3,830 million and Adjusted Operating Income on a constant currency basis (1) increased $694 million (19.0%) to $4,352 million due to the following: Operating Income Change (in millions) (percentage point) Operating Income for the Year Ended December 31, 2014 $ 3,242 Spin-Off Costs (2) 35 1.3pp 2012-2014 Restructuring Program costs (3) 459 14.9pp 2014-2018 Restructuring Program costs (3) 381 14.7pp Integration Program and other acquisition integration costs (4) (4 ) (0.2)pp Remeasurement of net monetary assets in Venezuela (5) 167 6.9pp Intangible asset impairment charges (6) 57 2.2pp Costs associated with the coffee business transactions (7) 77 2.9pp Operating income from historical coffee business (8) (646 ) (21.9)pp Reclassification of equity method investment earnings (9) (104 ) (4.1)pp Operating income from divestiture (10) (8 ) (0.3)pp Acquisition-related costs (11) 2 0.1pp Adjusted Operating Income (1) for the Year Ended December 31, 2014 $ 3,658 Higher net pricing 2,066 56.5pp Higher input costs (840 ) (23.0)pp Unfavorable volume/mix (332 ) (9.1)pp Higher selling, general and administrative expenses (327 ) (8.9)pp Change in unrealized gains/losses on hedging activities 129 3.5pp Lower VAT-related settlements (54 ) (1.5)pp Gain on sale of property in 2014 (7 ) (0.2)pp Impact of accounting calendar change (5) 37 1.0pp Impact from acquisitions (11) 20 0.6pp Other, net 2 0.1pp Total change in Adjusted Operating Income (constant currency) (1) 694 19.0% Unfavorable currency - translation (522 ) (14.3)pp Total change in Adjusted Operating Income (1) 172 4.7% Adjusted Operating Income (1) for the Year Ended December 31, 2015 $ 3,830 2012-2014 Restructuring Program costs (3) 4 0.2pp 2014-2018 Restructuring Program costs (3) (1,002 ) (35.0)pp Acquisition integration costs (4) (9 ) (0.2)pp Remeasurement of net monetary assets in Venezuela (5) (11 ) (0.4)pp Loss on deconsolidation of Venezuela (5) (778 ) (24.0)pp Intangible asset impairment charges (6) (71 ) (2.2)pp Costs associated with the coffee business transactions (7) (278 ) (10.8)pp Operating income from historical coffee business (8) 342 13.2pp Gain on the coffee business transactions (7) 6,809 210.0pp Reclassification of equity method investment earnings (9) 51 2.1pp Operating income from divestiture (10) 5 0.2pp Gain on divestiture (10) 13 0.4pp Acquisition-related costs (11) (8 ) (0.3)pp Operating Income for the Year Ended December 31, 2015 $ 8,897 174.4% 29 (1) Refer to the Non-GAAP Financial Measures section at the end of this item.

(9) Historically, we have recorded income from equity method investments within our operating income as these investments operated as extensions of our base business. Beginning in the third quarter of 2015, to align with the accounting for JDE earnings, we began to record the earnings from our equity method investments in after-tax equity method investment earnings outside of operating income. In periods prior to July 2, 2015, we have reclassified the equity method earnings from Adjusted Operating Income to evaluate our operating results on a consistent basis. (10) Includes the divestiture of AGF that closed on April 23, 2015 and does not include the deconsolidation of our coffee businesses. The divestiture of AGF generated a pre-tax gain of $13 million and after-tax loss of $9 million in the second quarter. Refer to Note 2, Divestitures and Acquisitions, and Non-GAAP Financial Measures appearing later in this section for more information. (11) Refer to Note 2, Divestitures and Acquisitions, for more information on the acquisitions of a biscuit operation in Vietnam and Enjoy Life Foods. During 2015, higher net pricing outpaced increased input costs. Higher net pricing, due to input-cost driven pricing actions taken during the year, was reflected across all segments. The increase in input costs was driven by higher raw material costs, in part due to higher currency exchange transaction costs on imported materials, partially offset by lower manufacturing costs. Unfavorable volume/mix was reflected across all segments. Total selling, general and administrative expenses decreased $880 million from 2014, due to a number of factors noted in the table above, including in part, a favorable currency impact, the adjustment for deconsolidating our historical coffee business, lower devaluation charges related to our net monetary assets in Venezuela and the absence of 2012-2014 Restructuring Program costs. The decreases were partially offset by increases from higher costs incurred for the 2014-2018 Restructuring Program, costs associated with the coffee business transactions, lower value-added tax (“VAT”)-related settlements, the reclassification of equity method investment earnings, the impact of acquisitions and a gain on a sale of property in 2014. Excluding the factors noted above, selling, general and administrative expenses increased $327 million from 2014. The increase was driven primarily by higher advertising and consumer promotions support, particularly behind our Power Brands. Excluding the portion related to deconsolidating our historical coffee business, the change in unrealized gains / (losses) increased operating income by $129 million in 2015. In 2015, the net unrealized gains on currency and commodity hedging activity were $56 million ($96 million including coffee related activity), as compared to net unrealized losses of $73 million ($112 million including coffee related activity) in 2014 related to currency and commodity hedging activity. We recorded a benefit of $30 million in 2015 from VAT-related settlements in Latin America as compared to $84 million in 2014. Unfavorable currency impacts decreased operating income by $522 million, due primarily to the strength of the U.S. dollar relative to most currencies, including the euro, Brazilian real, Venezuelan bolivar, British pound sterling, Australian dollar and Russian ruble. Operating income margin increased from 9.5% in 2014 to 30.0% in 2015. The increase in operating income margin was driven primarily by the pre-tax gain on the coffee business transactions, an increase in our Adjusted Operating Income margin, the absence of 2012-2014 Restructuring Program costs and lower devaluation charges related to our net monetary assets in Venezuela. The items that increased operating income margin were partially offset by the loss on deconsolidation of Venezuela, higher costs incurred for the 2014-2018 Restructuring Program and costs associated with the coffee business transactions. Adjusted Operating Income margin increased from 12.0% in 2014 to 13.7% in 2015. The increase in Adjusted Operating Income margin was driven primarily by improved gross margin, reflecting productivity efforts and the year-over-year favorable impact of unrealized gains / (losses) on currency and commodity hedging activities, and improved overhead leverage from cost reduction programs, partially offset by increased advertising and consumer promotions support. 30 Net Earnings and Earnings per Share Attributable to Mondelēz International – Net earnings attributable to Mondelēz International of $7,267 million increased by $5,083 million (232.7%) in 2015.

(2) Includes our historical global coffee business prior to the July 2, 2015 coffee business transactions. Refer to Note 2, Divestitures and Acquisitions, and Non-GAAP Financial Measures appearing later in this section for more information. (3) Includes the 2013 divestures of a salty snacks business in Turkey, a confectionary business in South Africa and a chocolate business in Spain and does not include the deconsolidation of our coffee businesses. Refer to Note 2, Divestitures and Acquisitions, and Non-GAAP Financial Measures appearing later in this section for more information. Organic Net Revenue growth was driven by higher net pricing, partially offset by unfavorable volume/mix. Overall, net pricing was up as we realized the effects of input cost-driven pricing actions implemented over the course of the year. Higher net pricing was reflected primarily in Latin America, EEMEA, Europe and Asia Pacific. Unfavorable volume/mix was driven primarily by Europe, Asia Pacific and Latin America. In addition to price elasticity, the decline was largely due to a slow response by competitors to higher input costs as well as the impact of price-related customer disruptions in Europe. Unfavorable currency impacts decreased net revenues by $1,626 million, due primarily to the devaluation of the Venezuelan bolivar and the strength of the U.S. dollar relative to several currencies, including the Argentinean peso, Brazilian real, Russian ruble, Australian dollar and Ukrainian hryvnya, partially offset by the strength of the British pound sterling relative to the U.S. dollar. Our historical coffee business recorded a year-over-year decrease in net revenues of $128 million for the year. The impact of divestitures completed in 2013, including a salty snacks business in Turkey, a confectionery business in South Africa and a chocolate business in Spain, resulted in a year-over-year decrease in net revenues of $70 million. The accounting calendar change made in Europe in 2013 resulted in a year-over-year decrease in net revenues of $30 million. The acquisition of a biscuit operation in Morocco on February 22, 2013 added $14 million in incremental net revenues in 2014 for the period prior to the anniversary date of the acquisition. 33 Operating Income – Operating income decreased $729 million (18.4%) to $3,242 million in 2014, Adjusted Operating Income (1) increased $198 million (5.7%) to $3,658 million and Adjusted Operating Income on a constant currency basis (1) increased $446 million (12.9%) to $3,906 million due to the following: Operating Income Change (in millions) (percentage point) Operating Income for the Year Ended December 31, 2013 $ 3,971 Spin-Off Costs (2) 62 2.3pp 2012-2014 Restructuring Program costs (3) 330 11.4pp Integration Program and other acquisition integration costs (4) 220 7.2pp Benefit from indemnification resolution (5) (336 ) (11.5)pp Remeasurement of net monetary assets in Venezuela (6) 54 1.6pp Operating income from historical coffee business (7) (700 ) (17.7)pp Reclassification of equity method earnings (8) (101 ) (2.6)pp Gains on acquisition and divestitures, net (2) (30 ) (0.7)pp Operating income from divestitures (9) (12 ) (0.3)pp Acquisition-related costs (2) 2 – Adjusted Operating Income (1) for the Year Ended December 31, 2013 $ 3,460 Higher net pricing 1,582 45.8pp Higher input costs (971 ) (28.1)pp Unfavorable volume/mix (384 ) (11.1)pp Lower selling, general and administrative expenses 306 8.9pp Change in unrealized gains / (losses) on hedging activities (116 ) (3.3)pp Gains on sale of property in 2013 (2) (68 ) (2.0)pp VAT-related settlements 84 2.4pp Gains on sale of property in 2014 (2) 7 0.2pp Impact from acquisition (2) 3 0.1pp Other, net 3 – Total change in Adjusted Operating Income (constant currency) (1) 446 12.9% Unfavorable currency - translation (248 ) (7.2)pp Total change in Adjusted Operating Income (1) 198 5.7% Adjusted Operating Income (1) for the Year Ended December 31, 2014 $ 3,658 Spin-Off Costs (2) (35 ) (1.2)pp 2012-2014 Restructuring Program costs (3) (459 ) (14.3)pp 2014-2018 Restructuring Program costs (3) (381 ) (12.2)pp Integration Program and other acquisition integration costs (4) 4 0.1pp Remeasurement of net monetary assets in Venezuela (6) (167 ) (5.2)pp Intangible asset impairment charges (10) (57 ) (2.0)pp Costs associated with the coffee business transactions (11) (77 ) (2.5)pp Operating income from historical coffee business (7) 646 19.9pp Reclassification of equity method earnings (8) 104 3.3pp Operating income from divestitures (9) 8 0.3pp Acquisition-related costs (2) (2 ) – Operating Income for the Year Ended December 31, 2014 $ 3,242 (18.4)% (1) Refer to the Non-GAAP Financial Measures section at the end of this item.

(7) Includes our historical global coffee business prior to the July 2, 2015 coffee business transactions. Refer to Note 2, Divestitures and Acquisitions, and Non-GAAP Financial Measures appearing later in this section for more information. (8) Historically, we have recorded income from equity method investments within our operating income as these investments operated as extensions of our base business. Beginning in the third quarter of 2015, to align with the accounting for JDE earnings, we began to record the earnings from our equity method investments in after-tax equity method investment earnings outside of operating income. In periods prior to July 2, 2015, we have reclassified the equity method earnings from Adjusted Operating Income to evaluate our operating results on a consistent basis. (9) Includes the 2013 divestures of a salty snacks business in Turkey, a confectionary business in South Africa and a chocolate business in Spain and the 2013 acquisition of a biscuit operation in Morocco and does not include the deconsolidation of our coffee businesses. Refer to Note 2, Divestitures and Acquisitions, and Non-GAAP Financial Measures appearing later in this section for more information. (10) Refer to Note 5, Goodwill and Intangible Assets, for information on the impairment charges in 2014 recorded related to two trademarks. (11) Refer to Note 2, Divestitures and Acquisitions, for more information on the coffee business transactions. During 2014, higher net pricing outpaced increased input costs. Higher net pricing was reflected across all segments. The increase in input costs was driven by higher raw material costs, in part due to higher currency exchange transaction costs on imported materials, partially offset by lower manufacturing costs. Unfavorable volume/mix was driven by Latin America, Asia Pacific, Europe and EEMEA, partially offset by gains in North America. Total selling, general and administrative expenses decreased $222 million from 2013, due to a number of factors noted in the table above, including in part, a favorable currency impact, lower Integration Program costs, VAT-related settlements in 2014, lower costs associated with our historical coffee business, lower Spin-Off Costs, 2013 business divestitures and a gain on a sale of property in 2014. These decreases were more than offset by increases from a 2013 benefit received related to the resolution of a Cadbury acquisition indemnification, increased devaluation charges related to our net monetary assets in Venezuela, costs incurred for the 2014-2018 Restructuring Program, costs related to the coffee business transactions, gains on property sales in 2013 and higher 2012-2014 Restructuring Program costs. Excluding the factors noted above, selling, general and administrative expenses decreased $306 million from 2013, driven primarily by lower overhead costs and lower advertising and consumer promotion costs. Overhead costs fell as a result of continued cost reduction efforts. Advertising and consumer promotion costs were lower due primarily to savings from consolidating media providers, reductions in non-working media costs and efficiencies gained by shifting spending to lower-cost, digital media outlets, while we increased our spending on our Power Brands and maintained working media spending. Excluding the portion related to deconsolidating our historical coffee business, the change in unrealized gains / (losses) decreased operating income by $116 million in 2014. In 2014, the net unrealized losses on primarily commodity hedging activity were $73 million ($112 million including coffee-related activity), as compared to net unrealized gains of $43 million in 2013 ($62 million including coffee-related activity) related to currency and commodity hedging activity. In 2013, we recorded pre-tax gains of $68 million related to sales of properties in India and Europe. In 2014, we recorded a benefit of $84 million related to VAT-related settlements in Latin America. In 2014, we recorded a pre-tax gain of $7 million related to the sale of a property in Europe. The acquisition of a biscuit operation in Morocco on February 22, 2013 added $3 million in incremental operating income in 2014 for the period prior to the anniversary of the acquisition. Unfavorable currency impacts decreased operating income by $248 million, due primarily to the devaluation of the Venezuelan bolivar in 2013 and 2014 and the strength of the U.S. dollar relative to several currencies, including the Argentinean peso, Brazilian real, Australian dollar, Russian ruble and Canadian dollar, partially offset by the strength of the British pound sterling relative to the U.S. dollar. Operating income margin decreased from 11.2% in 2013 to 9.5% in 2014. The decrease in operating income margin was driven primarily by costs incurred for the 2014-2018 Restructuring Program, the year-over-year negative impact of the benefit from the resolution of the Cadbury acquisition-related indemnification recorded in 2013, higher costs for the 2012-2014 Restructuring Program, the impact from the devaluation of our net monetary assets in Venezuela and costs incurred associated with the coffee business transactions, partially offset by an increase in our Adjusted Operating Income margin and lower Integration Program costs. Adjusted Operating Income margin increased from 11.0% in 2013 to 12.0% in 2014. The increase in Adjusted Operating Income margin was driven primarily by lower overhead costs from continued cost reduction efforts and lower advertising and consumer promotion costs due primarily to productivity initiatives, partially offset by a decline in gross profit margin due entirely to the unfavorable impact of unrealized gains / (losses) on currency and commodity hedging activities. 35 Net Earnings and Earnings per Share Attributable to Mondelēz International – Net earnings attributable to Mondelēz International of $2,184 million in 2014 decreased by $1,731 million (44.2%) due primarily to the results of the discontinued operations in the prior year. Diluted EPS from continuing operations attributable to Mondelēz International was $1.28 in 2014, down $0.01 (0.8%) from $1.29 in 2013.

Results of Operations by Reportable Segment Our operations and management structure are organized into five reportable operating segments: • Latin America • Asia Pacific • EEMEA • Europe • North America We manage our operations by region to leverage regional operating scale, manage different and changing business environments more effectively and pursue growth opportunities as they arise in our key markets. Our regional management teams have responsibility for the business, product categories and financial results in the regions. Historically, we have recorded income from equity method investments within our operating income as these investments operated as extensions of our base business. Beginning in the third quarter of 2015, to align with the accounting for our deconsolidated coffee business and related investment in JDE, we began to record the earnings from our equity method investments in after-tax equity method investment earnings outside of segment operating income. For the six months ended December 31, 2015, after-tax equity method investment net earnings were less than $1 million on a combined basis. Earnings from equity method investments through July 2, 2015 recorded within segment operating income were $49 million in Asia Pacific, $3 million in EEMEA and $4 million in North America. For the year ended December 31, 2014 these earnings were $98 million in Asia Pacific, $6 million in EEMEA and $9 million in North America. For the year ended December 31, 2013 these earnings were $99 million in Asia Pacific, $7 million in EEMEA and $1 million in North America. See Note 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies – Principles of Consolidation, for additional information. In 2015, we also began to report stock-based compensation for our corporate employees, which was previously reported within our North America region, within general corporate expenses. We reclassified $32 million of corporate stock-based compensation expense out of the North America segment in 2015. We use segment operating income to evaluate segment performance and allocate resources. We believe it is appropriate to disclose this measure to help investors analyze segment performance and trends. See Note 17, Segment Reporting, for additional information on our segments and Items Affecting Comparability of Financial Results earlier in this section for items affecting our segment operating results. 37 Our segment net revenues and earnings for the following historical periods were: For the Years Ended December 31, 2015 2014 2013 (in millions) Net revenues: Latin America (1) $ 4,988 $ 5,153 $ 5,382 Asia Pacific (1) 4,360 4,605 4,952 EEMEA (1) 2,786 3,638 3,915 Europe (1) 10,528 13,912 14,059 North America 6,974 6,936 6,991 Net revenues $ 29,636 $ 34,244 $ 35,299 (1) On July 2, 2015, as part of the JDE coffee transactions, we deconsolidated our global coffee businesses primarily from our Europe, EEMEA and Asia Pacific segments. The impact of deconsolidating our coffee businesses on July 2, 2015 was $1,699 million in Europe, $413 million in EEMEA, $32 million in Asia Pacific and $5 million in Latin America on a year-over-year basis. Refer to Note 2, Divestitures and Acquisitions – Coffee Business Transactions, for more information.

Unfavorable currency impacts were due primarily to the strength of the U.S. dollar relative to most currencies in the region, including the Brazilian real, Venezuelan bolivar, Mexican peso and Argentinean peso. Unfavorable volume/mix was largely due to the impact of pricing-related elasticity as well as strategic decisions to exit certain low-margin product lines. Unfavorable volume/mix was driven by declines in refreshment beverages, cheese & grocery, chocolate and biscuits, partially offset by gains in gum & candy. The adjustment for deconsolidating our historical coffee business resulted in a year-over-year decrease in net revenues of $5 million. Higher net pricing was reflected across all categories. Both the unfavorable volume/mix and higher net pricing were driven primarily by the higher inflationary countries of Venezuela and Argentina, as well as Brazil. Segment operating income increased $10 million (2.1%), primarily due to higher net pricing, higher remeasurement losses in 2014 related to our net monetary assets in Venezuela, lower manufacturing costs and the absence of 2012-2014 Restructuring Program costs. These favorable items were partially offset by higher raw material costs, unfavorable currency, unfavorable volume/mix, higher other selling, general and administrative expenses (including lower year-over-year VAT-related settlements), higher advertising and consumer promotion costs and higher costs incurred for the 2014-2018 Restructuring Program and an intangible asset impairment charge in 2015 related to a biscuit trademark. 2014 compared with 2013: Net revenues decreased $229 million (4.3%), due to unfavorable currency (19.4 pp) and unfavorable volume/mix (4.2 pp), partially offset by higher net pricing (19.3 pp). Unfavorable currency impacts were due primarily to the Venezuelan bolivar devaluation and the strength of the U.S. dollar relative to the Argentinean peso and Brazilian real. Unfavorable volume/mix was driven by declines in all categories except biscuits. In addition, unfavorable volume/mix was driven primarily by Mexico, Venezuela and Argentina, partially offset by gains in Brazil and the Western Andean countries. Higher net pricing was reflected primarily in the higher inflationary countries of Venezuela and Argentina, as well as in Brazil and Mexico. Segment operating income decreased $95 million (16.7%), primarily due to higher raw material costs, unfavorable currency, unfavorable volume/mix, the year-over-year net impact from the remeasurement of net monetary assets in Venezuela, costs incurred for the 2014-2018 Restructuring Program and higher advertising and consumer promotion costs. These unfavorable items were partially offset by higher net pricing, lower manufacturing costs, the absence of Integration Program costs in 2014, lower other selling, general and administrative expenses (including $84 million related primarily to VAT-related settlements) and lower 2012-2014 Restructuring Program costs. 39 Asia Pacific For the Years EndedDecember 31, 2015 2014 $ change % change (in millions) Net revenues $ 4,360 $ 4,605 $ (245 ) (5.3)% Segment operating income 268 385 (117 ) (30.4)% For the Years EndedDecember 31, 2014 2013 $ change % change (in millions) Net revenues $ 4,605 $ 4,952 $ (347 ) (7.0)% Segment operating income 385 512 (127 ) (24.8)% 2015 compared with 2014: Net revenues decreased $245 million (5.3%), due to unfavorable currency (9.2 pp), unfavorable volume/mix (2.2 pp) and the adjustment for deconsolidating our historical coffee business (0.6 pp), partially offset by higher net pricing (3.9 pp) and the impact of an acquisition (2.8 pp). Unfavorable currency impacts were due primarily to the strength of the U.S. dollar relative to most currencies in the region, including the Australian dollar, Indian rupee and Japanese yen. Unfavorable volume/mix was due largely to the impact of pricing-related elasticity as well as strategic decisions to exit certain low-margin product lines. Unfavorable volume/mix was driven by declines in all categories except gum and biscuits. The adjustment for deconsolidating our historical coffee business resulted in a year-over-year decrease in net revenues of $32 million. Higher net pricing was reflected across all categories except refreshment beverages. The acquisition of a biscuit operation in Vietnam in July 2015 added net revenues of $128 million (constant currency basis). Segment operating income decreased $117 million (30.4%), primarily due to higher costs incurred for the 2014-2018 Restructuring Program, higher raw material costs, higher advertising and consumer promotion costs, unfavorable currency, the reclassification of equity method investment earnings, unfavorable volume/mix, higher other selling, general and administrative expenses (including a phase-out of a local tax incentive program), the adjustment for deconsolidating our historical coffee business and other divestiture, other acquisition-related integration costs and costs associated with the coffee business transactions. These unfavorable items were partially offset by higher net pricing, lower manufacturing costs, the absence of 2012-2014 Restructuring Program costs, the impact of the Vietnam acquisition and lower intangible asset impairment charges (related to candy and biscuit trademarks in 2015 and a biscuit trademark in 2014). 2014 compared with 2013: Net revenues decreased $347 million (7.0%), due to unfavorable volume/mix (5.7 pp), unfavorable currency (4.3 pp) and a decrease in our historical coffee business (0.4 pp), partially offset by higher net pricing (3.4 pp). Unfavorable volume/mix was driven by declines in all categories except gum. Unfavorable currency impacts were due primarily to the strength of the U.S. dollar relative to the Australian dollar, Indian rupee, Indonesian rupiah and Japanese yen. A decline in our historical coffee business resulted in a $28 million decrease in net revenues. Higher net pricing was reflected across all categories except gum and candy. Segment operating income decreased $127 million (24.8%), primarily due to higher raw material costs, unfavorable volume/mix, an intangible asset impairment charge related to a biscuit trademark, higher 2012-2014 Restructuring Program costs, costs incurred for the 2014-2018 Restructuring Program, the impact of our historical coffee business and unfavorable currency. These unfavorable items were partially offset by higher net pricing, lower manufacturing costs, lower advertising and consumer promotion costs, the absence of Integration Program costs in 2014 and lower other selling, general and administrative expenses (including an unfavorable year-over-year impact from the 2013 gain on a sale of property in India). 40 EEMEA For the Years EndedDecember 31, 2015 2014 $ change % change (in millions) Net revenues $ 2,786 $ 3,638 $ (852 ) (23.4)% Segment operating income 194 327 (133 ) (40.7)% For the Years EndedDecember 31, 2014 2013 $ change % change (in millions) Net revenues $ 3,638 $ 3,915 $ (277 ) (7.1)% Segment operating income 327 379 (52 ) (13.7)% 2015 compared with 2014: Net revenues decreased $852 million (23.4%), due to unfavorable currency (20.7 pp), the adjustment for deconsolidating our historical coffee business (8.7 pp) and unfavorable volume/mix (5.4 pp), partially offset by higher net pricing (11.4 pp). Unfavorable currency impacts were due to the strength of the U.S. dollar relative to most currencies in the region, primarily the Russian ruble, Ukrainian hryvnya and South African rand.

These unfavorable items were partially offset by higher net pricing, lower manufacturing costs and the absence of 2012-2014 Restructuring Program costs. 2014 compared with 2013: Net revenues decreased $277 million (7.1%), due to unfavorable currency (11.2 pp), unfavorable mix (0.7 pp), a decrease in our historical coffee business (0.6 pp) and the impact of divestitures (0.6 pp), partially offset by higher net pricing (5.6 pp) and the impact of the February 2013 acquisition of a biscuit operation in Morocco (0.4 pp). Unfavorable currency impacts were due to the strength of the U.S. dollar relative to most currencies in the region, primarily the Russian ruble, Ukrainian hryvnya, South African rand and Turkish lira. Unfavorable volume/mix was driven by declines in chocolate and refreshment beverages, partially offset by gains in biscuits, gum & candy and cheese & grocery. A decline in our historical coffee business resulted in a $71 million decrease in net revenues. Divestitures completed in 2013 resulted in a $20 million decline in net revenues. Higher net pricing was reflected across all categories except refreshment beverages. The acquisition of a biscuit operation in Morocco in February 2013 added $14 million in incremental net revenues for 2014 for the period prior to the anniversary date of the acquisition. Segment operating income decreased $52 million (13.7%), primarily due to higher raw material costs, higher 2012-2014 Restructuring Program costs, unfavorable currency, costs incurred for the 2014-2018 Restructuring Program, the impact of our historical coffee business, unfavorable volume/mix and costs associated with the JDE coffee transactions. These unfavorable items were partially offset by higher net pricing, lower manufacturing costs, lower Integration Program and other acquisition integration costs, lower advertising and consumer promotion costs and the impact of 2013 divestitures. 41 Europe For the Years EndedDecember 31, 2015 2014 $ change % change (in millions) Net revenues $ 10,528 $ 13,912 $ (3,384 ) (24.3)% Segment operating income 1,277 1,770 (493 ) (27.9)% For the Years EndedDecember 31, 2014 2013 $ change % change (in millions) Net revenues $ 13,912 $ 14,059 $ (147 ) (1.0)% Segment operating income 1,770 1,699 71 4.2% 2015 compared with 2014: Net revenues decreased $3,384 million (24.3%), due to unfavorable currency (13.6 pp), the adjustment for deconsolidating our historical coffee business (8.8 pp) and unfavorable volume/mix (2.7 pp), partially offset by higher net pricing (0.8 pp). Unfavorable currency impacts primarily reflected the strength of the U.S. dollar against most currencies in the region, including the euro and British pound sterling. The adjustment for deconsolidating our historical coffee business resulted in a year-over-year decrease in net revenues of $1,699 million. Unfavorable volume/mix was largely due to the impact of pricing-related elasticity as well as strategic decisions to exit certain low-margin product lines. Unfavorable volume/mix was driven by declines in chocolate, gum, refreshment beverages and cheese & grocery, partially offset by gains in biscuits and candy. Higher net pricing was driven by chocolate, partially offset by lower net pricing in biscuits, cheese & grocery, gum & candy and refreshment beverages. Segment operating income decreased $493 million (27.9%), primarily due to unfavorable currency, the adjustment for deconsolidating our historical coffee business, higher costs incurred for the 2014-2018 Restructuring Program, costs associated with the coffee business transactions, unfavorable volume/mix, higher raw material costs, higher advertising and consumer promotion costs and higher intangible asset impairment charges related to a candy trademark. These unfavorable items were partially offset by the lower manufacturing costs, absence of 2012-2014 Restructuring Program costs, higher net pricing and lower other selling, general and administrative expenses (net of the unfavorable year-over-year impact from the 2014 gain on a sale of property in the United Kingdom). 2014 compared with 2013: Net revenues decreased $147 million (1.0%), due to unfavorable volume/mix (2.8 pp), the impact of the prior year’s accounting calendar change (0.3 pp) and the impact of divestitures (0.1 pp), partially offset by higher net pricing (1.7 pp), favorable currency (0.4 pp) and the impact of our historical coffee business (0.1 pp). Unfavorable volume/mix was due to pricing-related elasticity across the region and certain pricing-related customer disruptions. Unfavorable volume/mix was driven by declines in all categories. The accounting calendar change made in 2013 resulted in a year-over-year decrease in net revenues of $30 million. In addition, divestitures completed in 2013 resulted in an $11 million decline in net revenues. Higher net pricing was driven by chocolate and cheese & grocery, partially offset by lower net pricing in all other categories. Favorable currency impacts primarily reflected the strength of the British pound sterling relative to the U.S. dollar, partially offset by the strength of the U.S. dollar against the Swedish krona, the euro and Norwegian krone. In addition, a decline in our historical coffee business, though at a lower rate than the rest of our European segment, resulted in a $29 million decrease in net revenues. Segment operating income increased $71 million (4.2%), primarily due to lower manufacturing costs, higher net pricing, lower other selling, general and administrative expenses (net of the unfavorable year-over-year impact from the 2013 gains on the sales of property in the United Kingdom, Norway and Italy, and the benefit from a 2014 gain on a sale of property in the United Kingdom) lower advertising and consumer promotion costs, lower Integration Program costs (including the reversal of a prior-year accrual) and the impact of our historical coffee business. These favorable items were partially offset by higher raw material costs (primarily higher cocoa costs), costs incurred for the 2014-2018 Restructuring Program, unfavorable volume mix, higher 2012-2014 Restructuring Program costs, costs associated with the coffee business transactions, an intangible asset impairment charge related to a candy trademark and the year-over-year impact from the accounting calendar change made in 2013. 42 North America For the Years EndedDecember 31, 2015 2014 $ change % change (in millions) Net revenues $ 6,974 $ 6,936 $ 38 0.5 % Segment operating income 1,105 922 183 19.8 % For the Years EndedDecember 31, 2014 2013 $ change % change (in millions) Net revenues $ 6,936 $ 6,991 $ (55 ) (0.8) % Segment operating income 922 889 33 3.7 % 2015 compared with 2014: Net revenues increased $38 million (0.5%), due to an accounting calendar change (1.2 pp), an acquisition (0.5 pp), favorable volume/mix (0.5 pp) and higher net pricing (0.3 pp), partially offset by unfavorable currency (2.0 pp). The change in North America’s accounting calendar added net revenues of $78 million. The acquisition of the Enjoy Life Foods snack food business in February 2015 added net revenues of $37 million. Favorable volume/mix was driven by gains in biscuits and candy, partially offset by declines in gum and chocolate. Higher net pricing was reflected in gum and chocolate, partially offset by lower net pricing in biscuits and candy. Unfavorable currency impact was due to the strength of the U.S. dollar relative to the Canadian dollar. Segment operating income increased $183 million (19.8%), primarily due to the absence of 2012-2014 Restructuring Program costs, lower manufacturing costs, lower other selling, general and administrative expenses (including the reclassification of corporate stock-based compensation), the impact of an accounting calendar change, higher net pricing and lower raw material costs. These favorable items were partially offset by higher costs incurred for the 2014-2018 Restructuring Program, unfavorable currency, higher advertising and consumer promotion costs, unfavorable volume/mix and the reclassification of equity method investment earnings. 2014 compared with 2013: Net revenues decreased $55 million (0.8%), due to unfavorable currency (1.0 pp) and the impact of divestitures (0.6 pp), partially offset by favorable volume/mix (0.7 pp) and higher net pricing (0.1 pp). Unfavorable currency impact was due to the strength of the U.S. dollar relative to the Canadian dollar. Divestitures completed in 2013 resulted in a $39 million decline in net revenues. Favorable volume/mix was driven primarily by gains in all categories except gum. Higher net pricing was reflected primarily in biscuits and gum, partially offset by lower net pricing in chocolate and candy. Segment operating income increased $33 million (3.7%), primarily due to lower raw material costs, lower other selling, general and administrative expenses (including higher equity method investment earnings), favorable volume/mix, lower 2012-2014 Restructuring Program costs, lower advertising and consumer promotion costs and higher net pricing. These favorable items were partially offset by costs incurred for the 2014-2018 Restructuring Program, higher manufacturing costs and the impact of divestitures. 43 Critical Accounting Estimates We prepare our consolidated financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP. The preparation of these financial statements requires the use of estimates, judgments and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the periods presented. Actual results could differ from those estimates and assumptions. Note 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, to the consolidated financial statements includes a summary of the significant accounting policies we used to prepare our consolidated financial statements. We have discussed the selection and disclosure of our critical accounting policies and estimates with our Audit Committee. The following is a review of our most significant assumptions and estimates. Goodwill and Non-Amortizable Intangible Assets: We test goodwill and non-amortizable intangible assets for impairment on an annual basis on October 1. We assess goodwill impairment risk throughout the year by performing a qualitative review of entity-specific, industry, market and general economic factors affecting our goodwill reporting units. We review our operating segment and reporting unit structure for goodwill testing annually or as significant changes in the organization occur. Annually, we may perform qualitative testing, or depending on factors such as prior-year test results, current year developments, current risk evaluations and other practical considerations, we may elect to do quantitative testing instead. Quantitative impairment testing consists of a two-step evaluation. The first step compares a reporting unit’s estimated fair value with its carrying value. We estimate a reporting unit’s fair value using a discounted cash flow method which incorporates planned growth rates, market-based discount rates and estimates of residual value. This year, for our Europe and North America reporting units, we used a market-based, weighted-average cost of capital of 6.8% to discount the projected cash flows of those operations. For our Latin America, Asia Pacific and EEMEA reporting units, we used a risk-rated discount rate of 9.8%. Estimating the fair value of individual reporting units requires us to make assumptions and estimates regarding our future plans and industry and economic conditions, and our actual results and conditions may differ over time. If the carrying value of a reporting unit’s net assets exceeds its fair value, we would apply a second step to measure the difference between the carrying value and implied fair value of goodwill. If the carrying value of goodwill exceeds its implied fair value, the goodwill is impaired and its carrying value is reduced to the implied fair value of the goodwill. On July 2, 2015, we deconsolidated our global coffee businesses from our Europe, EEMEA and Asia Pacific segments. Goodwill was deconsolidated from the impacted reporting units based on relative fair values of the coffee and remaining businesses. Intangible assets contributed with the coffee business transactions were specifically identified. We deconsolidated total goodwill of $1,664 million and intangible assets of less than $1 million during the third quarter of 2015. Refer to Note 2, Divestitures and Acquisitions – Coffee Business Transactions, for more information. In 2015, 2014 and 2013, there were no impairments of goodwill. In connection with our 2015 annual impairment testing, each of our reporting units had sufficient fair value in excess of carrying value. In connection with the deconsolidation of our Venezuelan operations on December 31, 2015, we tested our Latin America reporting unit and determined the remaining businesses excluding Venezuela had sufficient fair value in excess of carrying value, such that there were no impairments of goodwill. While all reporting units passed our annual impairment testing, if expectations are not met or specific valuation factors outside of our control, such as discount rates, change significantly, then the estimated fair values of a reporting unit or reporting units might decline and lead to a goodwill impairment in the future. Annually, we assess non-amortizable intangible assets for impairment by performing a qualitative review and assessing events and circumstances that could affect the fair value or carrying value of the indefinite-lived intangible assets. If significant potential impairment risk exists for a specific asset, we quantitatively test it for impairment by comparing its estimated fair value with its carrying value. Estimated fair value is determined using planned growth rates, market-based discount rates and estimates of royalty rates. If the carrying value of the asset exceeds its estimated fair value, the asset is impaired and its carrying value is reduced to the estimated fair value. During our 2015 annual testing of non-amortizable intangible assets, we recorded $71 million of impairment charges related to four trademarks. The impairments arose due to lower than expected product growth partly driven by decisions made in the fourth quarter to redirect support for the products to other regional and global brands and slowdowns in local economies. We recorded charges related to candy and biscuit trademarks of $44 million in Asia Pacific, $22 million in Europe and $5 million in Latin America. The impairment charges were calculated as the excess of the carrying value over the estimated fair value of the intangible assets on a global basis and were recorded within asset impairment and exit costs. We primarily use a relief of royalty valuation method, which utilizes estimates of future sales, growth rates, royalty 44 rates and discount rates in determining a brand’s global fair value. During our 2015 intangible asset impairment review, we noted seven brands, including the four impaired trademarks, with $598 million of aggregate book value as of December 31, 2015 that each had a fair value in excess of book value of 10% or less. While these intangible assets passed our annual impairment testing and we believe our current plans for each of these brands will allow them to continue to not be impaired, if expectations are not met or specific valuation factors outside of our control, such as discount rates, change significantly, then a brand or brands could become impaired in the future. In 2014, we recorded a $48 million charge related to a biscuit trademark in our Asia Pacific segment and a $9 million charge related to a candy trademark in our Europe segment. Additionally, in connection with the deconsolidation of our Venezuelan operations on December 31, 2015, we recorded $12 million of impairment charges within the loss on deconsolidation of Venezuela related to a biscuit trademark. Refer also to Note 5, Goodwill and Intangible Assets, for additional information. Trade and marketing programs: We promote our products with advertising, marketing, sales incentives and trade promotions. These programs include, but are not limited to, cooperative advertising, in-store displays, consumer promotions, new product introduction fees, discounts, coupons, rebates and volume-based incentives. We expense advertising costs either in the period the advertising first takes place or as incurred. Sales incentive and trade promotion activities are recorded as a reduction to revenues based on amounts estimated due to customers and consumers at the end of a period. We base these estimates principally on historical utilization and redemption rates. For interim reporting purposes, advertising expenses and sales incentives are charged to operations as a percentage of volume, based on estimated volume and estimated program spending. We do not defer costs on our year-end consolidated balance sheet and all marketing costs are recorded as an expense in the year incurred. Employee Benefit Plans: We sponsor various employee benefit plans throughout the world. These include primarily pension plans and postretirement healthcare benefits. For accounting purposes, we estimate the pension and post-retirement healthcare benefit obligations utilizing assumptions and estimates for discount rates; expected returns on plan assets; expected compensation increases; employee-related factors such as turnover, retirement age and mortality; and health care cost trends. We review our actuarial assumptions on an annual basis and make modifications to the assumptions based on current rates and trends when appropriate. Our assumptions also reflect our historical experiences and management’s best judgment regarding future expectations. These and other assumptions affect the annual expense and obligations recognized for the underlying plans. In 2016, we expect pension and postretirement medical costs to decrease by approximately $135 million to $185 million due to a combination of factors, including a decreased number of plan participants, changes in discount rates, company contributions to the plans and a change in our approach to measuring service and interest costs. For 2015, we measured service and interest costs utilizing a single weighted-average discount rate derived from the yield curve used to measure the plan obligations. For 2016, we elected to measure service and interest costs by applying the specific spot rates along that yield curve to the plans’ liability cash flows. We believe the new approach provides a more precise measurement of service and interest costs by aligning the timing of the plans’ liability cash flows to the corresponding spot rates on the yield curve. This change does not affect the measurement of our plan obligations nor the funded status of our plans. As permitted by U.S. GAAP, we generally amortize the effect of changes in the assumptions over future periods. The cost or benefit of plan changes, such as increasing or decreasing benefits for prior employee service (prior service cost), is deferred and included in expense on a straight-line basis over the average remaining service period of the employees expected to receive benefits. Since pension and post-retirement liabilities are measured on a discounted basis, the discount rate significantly affects our plan obligations and expenses. The expected return on plan assets assumption affects our pension plan expenses, since many of our pension plans are partially funded. The assumptions for discount rates and expected rates of return and our process for setting these assumptions are described in Note 10, Benefit Plans, to the consolidated financial statements. 45 While we do not anticipate further changes in the 2016 assumptions for our U.S. and non-U.S. pension and postretirement health care plans, as a sensitivity measure, a fifty-basis point change in our discount rates or the expected rate of return on plan assets would have the following effects, increase / (decrease), on our annual benefit plan costs: As of December 31, 2015 U.S. Plans Non-U.S. Plans Fifty-Basis-Point Fifty-Basis-Point Increase Decrease Increase Decrease (in millions) Effect of change in discount rate on pension costs $ (16 ) $ 18 $ (47 ) $ 58 Effect of change in expected rate of return on plan assets on pension costs (6 ) 6 (37 ) 37 Effect of change in discount rate on postretirement health care costs (5 ) 5 (1 ) 1 Income Taxes: As a global company, we calculate and provide for income taxes in each tax jurisdiction in which we operate. The provision for income taxes includes the amounts payable or refundable for the current year, the effect of deferred taxes and impacts from uncertain tax positions. Our provision for income taxes is significantly affected by shifts in the geographic mix of our pre-tax earnings across tax jurisdictions, changes in tax laws and regulations, tax planning opportunities available in each tax jurisdiction and the ultimate outcome of various tax audits. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between the financial statement and tax bases of our assets and liabilities and for operating losses and tax credit carryforwards. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates that will apply to taxable income in the years in which those differences are expected to be recovered or settled. Valuation allowances are established for deferred tax assets when it is more likely than not that a tax benefit will not be realized. We recognize tax benefits in our financial statements from uncertain tax positions only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by tax authorities based on the technical merits of the position. The amount we recognize is measured as the largest benefit that has a greater than 50 percent likelihood of being realized upon settlement. We evaluate uncertain tax positions on an ongoing basis and adjust the related tax liabilities or assets in light of changing facts and circumstances, such as the progress of a tax audit or expiration of a statute of limitations. We believe the estimates and assumptions used to support our evaluation of uncertain tax positions are reasonable. However, final determination of historical tax liabilities, either by settlement with tax authorities or expiration of statutes of limitations, could be materially different from estimates reflected on our consolidated balance sheet and historical income tax provisions. The outcome of these final determinations could have a material effect on our provision for income taxes, net earnings or cash flows in the period in which the determination is made. We believe our tax positions comply with applicable tax laws and that we have properly accounted for uncertain tax positions. No taxes have been provided on undistributed foreign earnings that are planned to be indefinitely reinvested. If future events, such as material changes in long-term investment requirements, necessitate that these earnings be distributed, an additional provision for taxes may apply, which could materially affect our future effective tax rate. See Note 15, Income Taxes, for additional information on our effective tax rate, current and deferred taxes, valuation allowances and unrecognized tax benefits. Contingencies: See Note 13, Commitments and Contingencies, to the consolidated financial statements. New Accounting Guidance: See Note 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, to the consolidated financial statements for a discussion of new accounting standards. 46 Commodity Trends We regularly monitor worldwide supply, commodity cost and currency trends so we can cost-effectively secure ingredients, packaging and fuel required for production. Prior to the July 2, 2015 coffee business transactions, increased costs for coffee beans were the highest driver of increased commodity costs for the first half of 2015. During 2015, the primary drivers of the increase in our aggregate commodity costs, excluding coffee, were increased costs for packaging, nuts, cocoa, energy, grains and oils and higher currency-related costs on our commodity purchases, partially offset by lower costs for dairy and sugar. A number of external factors such as weather conditions, commodity market conditions, currency fluctuations and the effects of governmental agricultural or other programs affect the cost and availability of raw materials and agricultural materials used in our products. We address higher commodity costs and currency impacts primarily through hedging, higher pricing and manufacturing and overhead cost control. We use hedging techniques to limit the impact of fluctuations in the cost of our principal raw materials; however, we may not be able to fully hedge against commodity cost changes, and our hedging strategies may not protect us from increases in specific raw material costs. Due to competitive or market conditions, planned trade or promotional incentives, fluctuations in currency exchange rates or other factors, our pricing actions may also lag commodity cost changes temporarily. We expect price volatility and a slightly higher aggregate cost environment to continue in 2016. While the costs of our principal raw materials fluctuate, we believe there will continue to be an adequate supply of the raw materials we use and that they will generally remain available from numerous sources. Liquidity and Capital Resources We believe that cash from operations, our $4.5 billion revolving credit facility and our authorized long-term financing will provide sufficient liquidity for our working capital needs, planned capital expenditures, future contractual obligations, share repurchases and payment of our anticipated quarterly dividends. We continue to utilize our commercial paper program, international credit lines and long-term debt issuances for regular funding requirements. We also use intercompany loans with our international subsidiaries to improve financial flexibility. Overall, we do not expect any negative effects to our funding sources that would have a material effect on our liquidity, including the indefinite reinvestment of our earnings outside of the United States. Net Cash Provided by Operating Activities: Operating activities provided net cash of $3,728 million in 2015, $3,562 million in 2014 and $6,410 million in 2013. Cash flows from operating activities in all years were impacted by our working capital improvements, primarily due to continually decreasing our cash conversion cycle (a metric that measures working capital efficiency and utilizes days sales outstanding, days inventory on hand and days payables outstanding) to negative 12 days in 2015, positive 10 days in 2014 and positive 20 days in 2013. Cash flows from operating activities were favorable in 2015 relative to 2014 primarily due to higher relative working capital cash improvements than in 2014 and significant tax payments in 2014 related to the $2.6 billion Starbucks arbitration award we received in late 2013, partially offset by higher contributions related to our pensions benefit plans. Cash flows from operating activities were unfavorable in 2014 relative to 2013 primarily related to our receipt of $2.6 billion of net cash from the resolution of the Starbucks arbitration in 2013 and higher related income taxes paid in 2014 and lower relative working capital cash improvements than in 2013, partially offset by lower interest payments in 2014 following the debt refinancing in the first quarter of 2014 and the fourth quarter of 2013. Net Cash Provided by / (Used in) Investing Activities: Net cash provided by investing activities was $2,649 million in 2015 and net cash used in investing activities was $1,642 million in 2014 and $1,483 million in 2013. The increase in net cash provided by investing activities in 2015 relative to 2014 primarily relates to $4.7 billion of proceeds, net of divested cash and transaction costs, from the contribution of our global coffee businesses and the divestiture of AGF, the cash receipt of $1.0 billion due to the settlement of currency exchange forward contracts related to our coffee business transactions and lower capital expenditures in 2015 of $128 million, partially offset by the $611 million reduction of cash due to the Venezuela deconsolidation, $501 million of contributed JDE receivables and a $43 million cash payment to fund a capital increase in JDE and $527 million of payments to acquire a biscuit operation in Vietnam and the Enjoy Life Foods snack food business in 2015. The increase in net cash used in investing activities in 2014 relative to 2013 relates to lower cash inflows to offset higher capital expenditures in 2014. In 2013, we received higher cash proceeds from property sales, net proceeds of $60 million from divestitures and $55 million in cash from Kraft Foods Group in connection with the Spin-Off, partially offset by $119 million of payments to acquire a biscuit operation in Morocco in 2013. 47 Capital expenditures were $1,514 million in 2015, $1,642 million in 2014 and $1,622 million in 2013. The 2015 capital expenditures were made primarily to modernize manufacturing facilities and support new product and productivity initiatives. We expect 2016 capital expenditures to be up to $1.5 billion, including capital expenditures required for investments in systems and the 2014-2018 Restructuring Program. We expect to continue to fund these expenditures from operations. Net Cash Used in Financing Activities: Net cash used in financing activities was $5,883 million in 2015, $2,688 million in 2014 and $6,687 million in 2013. The increase in net cash used in financing activities in 2015 relative to 2014 was primarily due to higher repayments of long-term debt in 2015 (including the tender offers and euro notes maturities), $1.9 billion of higher share repurchases and higher net short-term debt repayments, partially offset by higher proceeds received from long-term note issuances. The decrease in net cash used in financing activities in 2014 relative to 2013 was primarily due to significantly lower long-term debt repayments and lower share repurchases in 2014, offset in part by decreased proceeds from the issuance of long-term debt and other short-term borrowings and higher dividend payments in 2014. Debt: From time to time we refinance long-term and short-term debt. Refer to Note 8, Debt and Borrowing Arrangements, for details of our tender offers and debt issuances during 2015, 2014 and 2013. The nature and amount of our long-term and short-term debt and the proportionate amount of each varies as a result of current and expected business requirements, market conditions and other factors. Generally, in the first and second quarters of the year, our working capital requirements grow, increasing the need for short-term financing. The third and fourth quarters of the year typically generate higher cash flows. As such, we may issue commercial paper or secure other forms of financing throughout the year to meet short-term working capital needs. In July 2015, our Board of Directors approved a $5 billion long-term financing authority to replace the prior authority. As of December 31, 2015, we had $4 billion of long-term financing authority remaining. During 2016, $1,750 million of long-term debt matured in February. We funded this repayment with net proceeds from debt issuances in January 2016, cash from operations and the issuance of commercial paper. There are no other scheduled maturities of long-term debt within the 12 months following December 31, 2015. Our total debt was $15.4 billion at December 31, 2015 and $16.7 billion at December 31, 2014. Our debt-to-capitalization ratio was 0.35 at December 31, 2015 and 0.38 at December 31, 2014. At December 31, 2015, the weighted-average term of our outstanding long-term debt was 8.6 years. Our average daily commercial borrowings were $2.2 billion in 2015, $1.9 billion in 2014 and $1.0 billion in 2013. We expect to continue to comply with our long-term debt covenants. Refer to Note 8, Debt and Borrowing Arrangements, for more information on our debt and debt covenants. Equity and Dividends Stock Plans: See Note 11, Stock Plans, to the consolidated financial statements for more information on our stock plans and grant activity during 2015, 2014 and 2013. Share Repurchases: See Note 12, Capital Stock, to the consolidated financial statements for more information on our share repurchase and accelerated share repurchase programs. We intend to continue to use a portion of our cash for share repurchases. On July 29, 2015, our Finance Committee, with authorization delegated from our Board of Directors, approved an increase of $6.0 billion in the share repurchase program, raising the authorization to $13.7 billion of Common Stock repurchases, and extended the program through December 31, 2018. We repurchased $8.3 billion of shares ($3.6 billion in 2015, $1.9 billion in 2014 and $2.7 billion in 2013) through December 31, 2015. The number of shares that we ultimately repurchase under our share repurchase program may vary depending on numerous factors, including share price and other market conditions, our ongoing capital allocation planning, levels of cash and debt balances, other demands for cash, such as acquisition activity, general economic or business conditions and board and management discretion. Additionally, our share repurchase activity during any particular period may fluctuate. We may accelerate, suspend, delay or discontinue our share repurchase program at any time, without notice. 48 Dividends: We paid dividends of $1,008 million in 2015, $964 million in 2014 and $943 million in 2013. Immediately following the Spin-Off of Kraft Foods Group on October 1, 2012, our annual dividend rate changed to $0.52 per common share. On August 6, 2013, our Audit Committee, with authorization from our Board of Directors, approved an 8% increase in the quarterly dividend to $0.14 per common share or $0.56 per common share on an annual basis. On August 5, 2014, our Audit Committee, with authorization from our Board of Directors, approved a 7% increase in the quarterly dividend to $0.15 per common share or $0.60 per common share on an annual basis. On July 23, 2015, our Board of Directors approved a 13% increase in the quarterly dividend to $0.17 per common share or $0.68 per common share on an annual basis. The declaration of dividends is subject to the discretion of our Board of Directors and depends on various factors, including our net earnings, financial condition, cash requirements, future prospects and other factors that our Board of Directors deems relevant to its analysis and decision making. Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements and Aggregate Contractual Obligations We have no significant off-balance sheet arrangements other than the contractual obligations discussed below. Guarantees: As discussed in Note 13, Commitments and Contingencies, we enter into third-party guarantees primarily to cover the long-term obligations of our vendors. As part of these transactions, we guarantee that third parties will make contractual payments or achieve performance measures. At December 31, 2015, we had no material third-party guarantees recorded on our consolidated balance sheet. In addition, at December 31, 2015, we were contingently liable for $842 million of guarantees related to our own performance. These include letters of credit, surety bonds and guarantees related to the payment of custom duties and taxes. Guarantees do not have, and we do not expect them to have, a material effect on our liquidity. Aggregate Contractual Obligations: The following table summarizes our contractual obligations at December 31, 2015. Payments Due Total 2016 2017-18 2019-20 2021 andThereafter (in millions) Debt (1) $ 15,227 $ 1,750 $ 2,591 $ 2,077 $ 8,809 Interest expense (2) 5,465 505 878 668 3,414 Capital leases 5 5 – – – Operating leases (3) 994 311 347 209 127 Purchase obligations: (4) Inventory and production costs 5,172 2,833 2,014 316 9 Other 887 816 70 1 – 6,059 3,649 2,084 317 9 Other long-term liabilities (5) 575 31 105 242 197 Total $ 28,325 $ 6,251 $ 6,005 $ 3,513 $ 12,556 (1) Amounts include the expected cash payments of our long-term debt excluding capital leases, which are presented separately in the table above. The amounts also exclude $(70) million of net unamortized non-cash bond premiums and discounts and mark-to-market adjustments related to our interest rate swaps recorded in total debt. (2) Amounts represent the expected cash payments of our interest expense on our long-term debt. Interest calculated on our euro, British pound sterling and Swiss franc notes was forecasted using currency exchange rates as of December 31, 2015. An insignificant amount of interest expense was excluded from the table for a portion of our other non-U.S. debt obligations due to the complexities involved in forecasting expected interest payments. (3) Operating lease payments represent the minimum rental commitments under non-cancelable operating leases. 49 (4) Purchase obligations for inventory and production costs (such as raw materials, indirect materials and supplies, packaging, co-manufacturing arrangements, storage and distribution) are commitments for projected needs to be utilized in the normal course of business. Other purchase obligations include commitments for marketing, advertising, capital expenditures, information technology and professional services. Arrangements are considered purchase obligations if a contract specifies all significant terms, including fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased, a pricing structure and approximate timing of the transaction. Most arrangements are cancelable without a significant penalty and with short notice (usually 30 days). Any amounts reflected on the consolidated balance sheet as accounts payable and accrued liabilities are excluded from the table above. (5) Other long-term liabilities include estimated future benefit payments for our postretirement health care plans through December 31, 2025 of $197 million. We are unable to reliably estimate the timing of the payments beyond 2025; as such, they are excluded from the above table. There are also another $300 million of various other long-term liabilities that are expected to be paid over the next 5 years. In addition, the following long-term liabilities included on the consolidated balance sheet are excluded from the table above: accrued pension costs, income taxes, insurance accruals and other accruals. We are unable to reliably estimate the timing of the payments (or contributions beyond 2016, in the case of accrued pension costs) for these items. We currently expect to make approximately $449 million in contributions to our pension plans in 2016. As of December 31, 2015, our total liability for income taxes, including uncertain tax positions and associated accrued interest and penalties, was $1,046 million. We currently estimate payments of approximately $316 million related to these positions over the next 12 months. Non-GAAP Financial Measures We use non-GAAP financial information and believe it is useful to investors as it provides additional information to facilitate comparisons of historical operating results, identify trends in our underlying operating results and provide additional transparency on how we evaluate our business. We use certain non-GAAP financial measures to budget, make operating and strategic decisions and evaluate our performance. We disclose non-GAAP financial measures so that you have the same financial data that we use to assist you in making comparisons to our historical operating results and analyzing our underlying performance. Our primary non-GAAP financial measures reflect how we evaluate our current and prior-year operating results. As new events or circumstances arise, these definitions could change over time. • “Organic Net Revenue” is defined as net revenues excluding the impacts of acquisitions, divestitures (1), our historical global coffee business (2), Integration Program costs, accounting calendar changes and currency rate fluctuations. We also evaluate Organic Net Revenue growth from emerging markets and our Power Brands. • Our emerging markets include our Latin America and EEMEA regions in their entirety; the Asia Pacific region, excluding Australia, New Zealand and Japan; and the following countries from the Europe region: Poland, Czech Republic, Slovak Republic, Hungary, Bulgaria, Romania, the Baltics and the East Adriatic countries. • Our Power Brands include some of our largest global and regional brands such as Oreo, Chips Ahoy!, Ritz, TUC/Club Social and belVita biscuits; Cadbury Dairy Milk, Milka and Lacta chocolate; Trident gum; Hall’s candy; and Tang powdered beverages. • “Adjusted Operating Income” is defined as operating income excluding the impacts of Spin-Off Costs, pension costs related to the obligations transferred in the Spin-Off, the 2012-2014 Restructuring Program, the 2014-2018 Restructuring Program, the Integration Program and other acquisition integration costs, the remeasurement of net monetary assets in Venezuela, loss on deconsolidation of Venezuela, the benefit from the Cadbury acquisition-related indemnification resolution, incremental costs associated with the coffee business transactions, impairment charges related to goodwill and intangible assets, gains or losses on divestitures (1) or acquisitions, gain on the coffee business transactions (2), divestiture-related costs, acquisition-related costs, the operating results of divestitures (1), our historical global coffee business operating results (2) and equity method investment earnings historically reported within operating income (3). We also evaluate growth in our Adjusted Operating Income on a constant currency basis. • “Adjusted EPS” is defined as diluted EPS attributable to Mondelēz International from continuing operations excluding the impacts of Spin-Off Costs, pension costs related to the obligations transferred in the Spin-Off, the 2012-2014 Restructuring Program, the 2014-2018 Restructuring Program, the Integration Program and other acquisition integration costs, the remeasurement of net monetary assets in Venezuela, loss on deconsolidation of Venezuela, the net benefit from the Cadbury acquisition-related indemnification resolution, losses on debt extinguishment and related expenses, the residual tax benefit impact from the resolution of the Starbucks arbitration, hedging gains or losses and incremental costs associated with the coffee business transactions, impairment charges related to goodwill and intangible assets, gains or losses on interest rate swaps no longer designated as accounting cash flow hedges due to changed financing and hedging plans, gains or losses on divestitures (1) or acquisitions, gain on the coffee business transactions (2), divestiture-related costs, acquisition-related costs and net earnings from divestitures(1), and including an interest expense adjustment related to the 50 Spin-Off transaction. In addition, we have adjusted our equity method investment earnings for our proportionate share of their unusual or infrequent items, such as acquisition and divestiture-related costs and restructuring program costs, recorded by our JDE equity method investee. We also evaluate growth in our Adjusted EPS on a constant currency basis. (1) Divestitures include businesses under sale agreements for which we have cleared significant sale-related conditions such that the pending sale is probable as of the end of the reporting period and exits of major product lines under a sale or licensing agreement. See (2) below. (2) In connection with the global coffee business transactions that closed on July 2, 2015, because we exchanged our coffee interests for similarly-sized coffee interests in JDE (which, following the July 2, 2015 closing, is 43.5% of our historical and DEMB’s combined global coffee businesses), we have deconsolidated and not included our historical global coffee business results within divestitures in our non-GAAP financial measures and in the related Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. We continue to have an ongoing interest in the coffee business. Beginning in the third quarter of 2015, we have included the after-tax earnings of JDE and of our historical coffee business results within continuing results of operations. For Adjusted EPS, we have included these earnings in equity method investment earnings and have deconsolidated our historical coffee business results from Organic Net Revenue and Adjusted Operating Income to facilitate comparisons of past and future coffee operating results. (3) Historically, we have recorded income from equity method investments within our operating income as these investments operated as extensions of our base business. Beginning in the third quarter of 2015, we began to record the earnings from our equity method investments in after-tax equity method investment earnings outside of operating income following the deconsolidation of our coffee business. See Note 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies – Principles of Consolidation, for more information. In periods prior to July 2, 2015, we have reclassified the equity method earnings from our Adjusted Operating Income to after-tax equity method investment earnings within Adjusted EPS to be consistent with the deconsolidation of our coffee business results on July 2 and in order to evaluate our operating results on a consistent basis. We believe that the presentation of these non-GAAP financial measures, when considered together with our U.S. GAAP financial measures and the reconciliations to the corresponding U.S. GAAP financial measures, provides you with a more complete understanding of the factors and trends affecting our business than could be obtained absent these disclosures. Because non-GAAP financial measures may vary among other companies, the non-GAAP financial measures presented in this report may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies. Our use of these non-GAAP financial measures is not meant to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for any U.S. GAAP financial measure. A limitation of these non-GAAP financial measures is they exclude items detailed below that have an impact on our U.S. GAAP reported results. The best way this limitation can be addressed is by evaluating our non-GAAP financial measures in combination with our U.S. GAAP reported results and carefully evaluating the following tables that reconcile U.S. GAAP reported figures to the non-GAAP financial measures in this Form 10-K. 51 Organic Net Revenue Applying the definition of “Organic Net Revenue”, the adjustments made to “net revenues” (the most comparable U.S. GAAP financial measure) were to exclude the impact of currency, the adjustment for deconsolidating our historical coffee business, divestitures, acquisitions and accounting calendar changes. We believe that Organic Net Revenue better reflects the underlying growth from the ongoing activities of our business and provides improved comparability of results. We also evaluate our Organic Net Revenue growth from emerging markets and Power Brands, and these underlying measures are also reconciled to U.S. GAAP below.

Beginning in the third quarter of 2015, to align with the accounting for JDE earnings, we began to record the earnings from our equity method investments in after-tax equity method investment earnings outside of operating income. In periods prior to July 2, 2015, we have reclassified the equity method earnings from Adjusted Operating Income to evaluate our operating results on a consistent basis. (3) Includes the divestiture of AGF on April 23, 2015 and does not include the deconsolidation of our global coffee businesses or the gain on the coffee business transactions. The divestiture of AGF generated a pre-tax gain of $13 million and an after-tax loss of $9 million in the second quarter. Refer to Note 2, Divestitures and Acquisitions, and our non-GAAP definitions appearing earlier in this section for more information. (4) Includes the 2013 divestures of a salty snacks business in Turkey, a confectionary business in South Africa and a chocolate business in Spain and does not include the deconsolidation of our coffee businesses.

Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk. As we operate globally, we are primarily exposed to currency exchange rate, commodity price and interest rate market risks. We monitor and manage these exposures as part of our overall risk management program. Our risk management program focuses on the unpredictability of financial markets and seeks to reduce the potentially adverse effects that the volatility of these markets may have on our operating results. We principally utilize derivative instruments to reduce significant, unanticipated earnings fluctuations that may arise from volatility in currency exchange rates, commodity prices and interest rates. For additional information on our derivative activity and the types of derivative instruments we use to hedge our currency exchange, commodity price and interest rate exposures, see Note 9, Financial Instruments. Many of our non-U.S. subsidiaries operate in functional currencies other than the U.S. dollar. Fluctuations in currency exchange rates create volatility in our reported results as we translate the balance sheets, operating results and cash flows of these subsidiaries into the U.S. dollar for consolidated reporting purposes. The translation of non-U.S. dollar denominated balance sheets and statements of earnings of our subsidiaries into the U.S. dollar for consolidated reporting generally results in a cumulative translation adjustment to other comprehensive income within equity. A stronger U.S. dollar relative to other functional currencies adversely affects our consolidated earnings and net assets while a weaker U.S. dollar benefits our consolidated earnings and net assets. While we hedge significant forecasted currency exchange transactions as well as certain net assets of non-U.S. operations and other currency impacts, we cannot fully predict or eliminate volatility arising from changes in currency exchange rates on our consolidated financial results. See Consolidated Results of Operations and Results of Operations by Reportable Segment under Discussion and Analysis of Historical Results for currency exchange effects on our financial results during 2015. For additional information on the impact of currency policies, the deconsolidation of our Venezuelan operation and the historical remeasurement of our Venezuelan net monetary assets on our financial condition and results of operations, also see Note 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies—Currency Translation and Highly Inflationary Accounting. We also continually monitor the market for commodities that we use in our products. Input costs may fluctuate widely due to international demand, weather conditions, government policy and regulation and unforeseen conditions. To manage the input cost volatility, we enter into forward purchase agreements and other derivative financial instruments. We also pursue productivity and cost saving measures and take pricing actions when necessary to mitigate the impact of higher input costs on earnings. We regularly evaluate our variable and fixed-rate debt as well as current and expected interest rates in the markets in which we raise capital. Our primary exposures include movements in U.S. Treasury rates, corporate credit spreads, London Interbank Offered Rates (“LIBOR”), Euro Interbank Offered Rate (“EURIBOR”) and commercial paper rates. We periodically use interest rate swaps and forward interest rate contracts to achieve a desired proportion of variable versus fixed rate debt based on current and projected market conditions. In addition to using interest rate derivatives to manage future interest payments, during 2015, we retired $4.2 billion of our long-term debt and issued $4.5 billion of lower borrowing cost debt. Our weighted-average interest rate on our total debt as of December 31, 2015 was 3.7%, down from 4.3% as of December 31, 2014. Value at Risk: We use a value at risk (“VAR”) computation to estimate: 1) the potential one-day loss in the fair value of our interest rate-sensitive financial instruments; and 2) the potential one-day loss in pre-tax earnings of our currency and commodity price-sensitive derivative financial instruments. The VAR analysis was done separately for our currency exchange, fixed income and commodity risk portfolios as of each quarter end during 2015. The instruments included in the VAR computation were currency exchange forwards and options for currency exchange risk, debt and swaps for interest rate risk, and commodity forwards, futures and options for commodity risk. Excluded from the computation were anticipated transactions, currency trade payables and receivables, and net investments in non-U.S. subsidiaries, which the abovementioned instruments are intended to hedge. 57 The VAR model assumes normal market conditions, a 95% confidence interval and a one-day holding period. A parametric delta-gamma approximation technique was used to determine the expected return distribution in interest rates, currencies and commodity prices for the purpose of calculating the fixed income, currency exchange and commodity VAR, respectively. The parameters used for estimating the expected return distributions were determined by observing interest rate, currency exchange, and commodity price movements over the prior quarter for the calculation of VAR amounts at December 31, 2015 and 2014, and over each of the four prior quarters for the calculation of average VAR amounts during each year. The values of currency and commodity options do not change on a one-to-one basis with the underlying currency or commodity and were valued accordingly in the VAR computation. As of December 31, 2015, the estimated potential one-day loss in fair value of our interest rate-sensitive instruments, primarily debt, and the estimated potential one-day loss in pre-tax earnings from our currency and commodity instruments, as calculated in the VAR model, were: Pre-Tax Earnings Impact Fair Value Impact At 12/31/15 Average High Low At 12/31/15 Average High Low (in millions) Instruments sensitive to: Interest rates $ 56 $ 60 $ 78 $ 50 Foreign currency rates $ 16 $ 55 $ 103 $ 16 Commodity prices 15 23 31 15 Pre-Tax Earnings Impact Fair Value Impact At 12/31/14 Average High Low At 12/31/14 Average High Low (in millions) Instruments sensitive to: Interest rates $ 50 $ 41 $ 50 $ 30 Foreign currency rates $ 51 $ 42 $ 58 $ 25 Commodity prices 26 28 38 19 This VAR computation is a risk analysis tool designed to statistically estimate the maximum expected daily loss, under the specified confidence interval and assuming normal market conditions, from adverse movements in interest rates, currency exchange rates and commodity prices. The computation does not represent actual losses in fair value or earnings we will incur, nor does it consider the effect of favorable changes in market rates. We cannot predict actual future movements in market rates and do not present these VAR results to be indicative of future movements in market rates or to be representative of any actual impact that future changes in market rates may have on our future financial results. 58",2023-12-30 19:01:09.633772
1103982,MDLZ,"Mondelez International, Inc.",2017,"Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. The following discussion and analysis contains forward-looking statements. It should be read in conjunction with the other sections of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, including the consolidated financial statements and related notes contained in Item 8, “Forward-Looking Statements” and “Risk Factors” contained in Item 1A. Description of the Company We manufacture and market primarily snack food products, including biscuits (cookies, crackers and salted snacks), chocolate, gum & candy and various cheese & grocery products, as well as powdered beverage products. We have operations in more than 80 countries and sell our products in approximately 165 countries. We aim to deliver strong, profitable long-term growth by accelerating our core snacks business and expanding the reach of our Power Brands globally. Leveraging our Power brands and our innovation platforms, we plan to innovate boldly and connect with our consumers wherever they are, including new markets around the world, using both traditional and digital channels. As consumer consumption patterns change to more accessible, frequent and better-for-you snacking, we are enhancing the goodness of many of our brands (including providing simpler and wholesome ingredient-focused snacks), expanding the well-being offerings in our portfolio and inspiring consumers to snack mindfully by providing clear and simple nutrition information. As shopping expands further online, we are also working to grow our e-commerce platform and on-line presence with consumers. To fuel these investments, we have been working to optimize our cost structure. These efforts include reinventing our supply chain, including adding and upgrading to more efficient production lines, while reducing the complexity of our product offerings, ingredients and number of suppliers. We also continue to aggressively manage our overhead costs. We have embraced and embedded zero-based budgeting practices across the organization to identify potential areas of cost reductions and capture and sustain savings within our ongoing operating budgets. Through these actions, we’re leveraging our brands, platforms and capabilities to drive long-term value and return on investment for our shareholders. Coffee Business Transactions JDE Coffee Business Transactions: On July 2, 2015, we completed transactions to combine our wholly owned coffee businesses with those of DEMB to create a new company, JDE. At that time, our equity interest in JDE was 43.5% with the remaining 56.5% held by a subsidiary of Acorn Holdings B.V. (“AHBV,” owner of DEMB prior to July 2, 2015). In connection with these transactions, in 2015, we recorded a final pre-tax gain of $6.8 billion ($6.6 billion after-tax) from the deconsolidation of our legacy coffee businesses. We also recorded approximately $1.0 billion of cumulative pre-tax net gains ($436 million in 2015 and $628 million in 2014) and cash related to currency hedging in connection with the expected cash consideration to be received in euros. We received €3.8 billion of cash ($4.2 billion) as of July 2, 2015 and with the cash from hedging currency, we effectively received $5.2 billion of cash. On July 5, 2016, we also received from JDE an expected $275 million cash payment to settle a receivable for tax formation costs that were part of the initial sales price. As part of our final sales price negotiations, we also retained the right to collect future cash payments if certain estimated pension liabilities are realized over an agreed amount in the future. As such, we may recognize additional income related to this negotiated term in the future. As further described below, following the March 2016 exchange of JDE shares for an investment in Keurig and stock-based compensation activity at JDE during 2016, as of December 31, 2016, our equity interest in JDE was 26.4%. We recorded equity earnings of $100 million in 2016 and equity losses of $58 million in 2015 related to our investment in JDE. On June 30, 2016, we entered into agreements with AHBV and its affiliates to establish a new stock-based compensation arrangement tied to the issuance of JDE equity compensation awards to JDE employees. This arrangement replaced a temporary equity compensation program tied to the issuance of AHBV equity compensation to JDE employees. New Class C, D and E JDE shares were authorized and issued for investments made by JDE employees and to issue shares when JDE awards vest. As new shares of JDE are issued, the Class A and B ownership interests of JDE decrease. Under these arrangements, dilution of the JDE shares is limited to 2%. Based on estimated award achievement, we do not expect our JDE ownership interest to decrease below 26.27%. Following these stock-based compensation issuances, our ownership interest in JDE was 26.4% as of December 31, 2016. See Note 2, Divestitures and Acquisitions, for additional details on the JDE coffee business transactions. 22 Table of Contents Keurig Transaction: On March 3, 2016, a subsidiary of AHBV completed a $13.9 billion acquisition of all of the outstanding common stock of Keurig through a merger transaction. On March 7, 2016, we exchanged with a subsidiary of AHBV a portion of our equity interest in JDE with a carrying value of €1.7 billion (approximately $2.0 billion as of March 7, 2016) for an interest in Keurig with a fair value of $2.0 billion based on the merger consideration per share for Keurig. We recorded the difference between the fair value of Keurig and our basis in JDE shares as a $43 million gain on the equity method investment exchange. Following the exchange, our ownership interest in JDE became 26.5% and we owned a 24.2% interest in Keurig. Both AHBV and we hold our investments in Keurig through a combination of equity and shareholder loan interests, with the same pro-rata ownership of each. Our initial $2.0 billion investment in Keurig includes a $1.6 billion Keurig equity interest and a $0.4 billion shareholder loan receivable, which are reported on a combined basis within equity method investments on our consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2016. The shareholder loan has a 5.5% interest rate and is payable at the end of a seven-year term on February 27, 2023. Within equity earnings, we recorded equity earnings of $77 million and interest income from the shareholder loan of $20 million in 2016. Additionally, we received $14 million of interest payments on the shareholder loan and $4 million in dividends on our investment in Keurig in 2016. See Note 2, Divestitures and Acquisitions, for additional details on the Keurig transaction. Coffee Business Equity Earnings: We have reflected the results of our historical coffee businesses and equity earnings from JDE, Keurig and Dongsuh Foods Corporation (“DSF”) in our results from continuing operations as the coffee category continues to be a significant part of our net earnings and business strategy going forward. Historically, our coffee businesses and the income from equity method investments were recorded within our operating income as these businesses were part of our base business. While we retain an ongoing interest in coffee through equity method investments including JDE, Keurig and DSF, and we have significant influence with our equity method investments, we do not control these operations directly. As such, in the third quarter of 2015, we began to recognize equity method investment earnings, consisting primarily of investments in coffee businesses, outside of operating income. For periods prior to the third quarter of 2015, our historical coffee business and equity method investment earnings were included within our operating income. See Note 2, Divestitures and Acquisitions, for more information. Venezuela Deconsolidation Effective as of the close of the 2015 fiscal year, we concluded that we no longer met the accounting criteria for consolidation of our Venezuelan subsidiaries due to a loss of control over our Venezuelan operations and an other-than-temporary lack of currency exchangeability. At that time, we deconsolidated and changed to the cost method of accounting for our Venezuelan operations. We recorded a $778 million pre-tax loss on December 31, 2015 as we reduced the value of our cost method investment in Venezuela and all Venezuelan receivables held by our other subsidiaries to realizable fair value, resulting in full impairment. The recorded loss also included historical cumulative translation adjustments related to our Venezuelan operations that had previously been recorded in accumulated other comprehensive losses within equity. As of the start of 2016, we no longer include net revenues, earnings or net assets of our Venezuelan subsidiaries within our consolidated financial statements in our reported GAAP results (we exclude Venezuela in our non-GAAP results for all historical periods presented). Under the cost method of accounting, earnings are only recognized to the extent cash is received and we have not received any distributed cash from our Venezuela operations in 2016. Given the current and ongoing difficult economic, regulatory and business environment in Venezuela, there continues to be significant uncertainty related to our operations in Venezuela, and we expect these conditions will continue for the foreseeable future. We monitor the extent of our ability to control our Venezuelan operations and the liquidity and availability of cash and U.S. dollars needed to operate in Venezuela, as our current situation in Venezuela may change over time and lead to consolidation at a future date. See Discussion and Analysis of Historical Results – Items Affecting Comparability of Financial Results below, and Note 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies – Currency Translation and Highly Inflationary Accounting: Venezuela, for more information on our historical Venezuelan operating results, including the remeasurement losses and loss on deconsolidation. Summary of Results • Net revenues decreased 12.5% to $25.9 billion in 2016 and decreased 13.5% to $29.6 billion in 2015. Net revenues in 2016 were significantly affected by the deconsolidation of our historical coffee business, unfavorable currency translation as the U.S. dollar strengthened against most currencies in which we operate compared to exchange rates in the prior year, the deconsolidation of our historical Venezuelan operations and the year-over-year impact of the accounting calendar change in 2015. 23 Table of Contents • Organic Net Revenue increased 1.3% to $27.1 billion in 2016 and increased 1.4% to $30.1 billion in 2015 after recasting prior years to exclude the historical Venezuela deconsolidated operating results and historical operating results from a small 2016 divestiture in the Latin America region. Organic Net Revenue also excludes the impact of our historical global coffee business which was deconsolidated in the JDE coffee business transactions in July 2015. Organic Net Revenue is a non-GAAP financial measure and is on a constant currency basis. We use Organic Net Revenue as it provides improved year-over-year comparability of our underlying results (see the definition of Organic Net Revenue and our reconciliation with net revenues within Non-GAAP Financial Measures appearing later in this section). • Diluted EPS attributable to Mondelēz International decreased 76.4% to $1.05 in 2016 and increased 246.9% to $4.44 in 2015. The gain on the coffee business deconsolidation and other significant items affected the comparability of our reported results, as further described in the Discussion and Analysis of Historical Results appearing later in this section and in the notes to the consolidated financial statements. • Adjusted EPS increased 19.8% to $1.94 in 2016 and decreased 6.4% to $1.62 in 2015 after recasting prior years to exclude the historical Venezuela deconsolidated operating results, historical operating results from a small 2016 divestiture in the Latin America region and historical mark-to-market impacts. On a constant currency basis, Adjusted EPS increased 24.1% to $2.01 in 2016 and increased 9.8% to $1.90 in 2015. Adjusted EPS and Adjusted EPS on a constant currency basis are non-GAAP financial measures. We use these measures as they provide improved year-over-year comparability of our underlying results (see the definition of Adjusted EPS and our reconciliation with diluted EPS within Non-GAAP Financial Measures appearing later in this section). Financial Outlook We seek to achieve profitable, long-term growth and manage our business to attain this goal using our key operating metrics: Organic Net Revenue, Adjusted Operating Income and Adjusted EPS. We use these non-GAAP financial metrics and related computations such as margins internally to evaluate and manage our business and to plan and make near- and long-term operating and strategic decisions. As such, we believe these metrics are useful to investors as they provide supplemental information in addition to our U.S. GAAP financial results. We believe providing investors with the same financial information that we use internally ensures that investors have the same data to make comparisons of our historical operating results, identify trends in our underlying operating results and gain additional insight and transparency on how we evaluate our business. We believe our non-GAAP financial measures should always be considered in relation to our GAAP results and we have provided reconciliations between our GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures in Non-GAAP Financial Measures which appears later in this section. In addition to monitoring our key operating metrics, we monitor a number of developments or trends that could impact our revenue and profitability objectives. Long-Term Demographics and Consumer Trends – Snack food consumption is highly correlated to GDP growth, urbanization of the population and rising discretionary income levels associated with a growing middle class, particularly in emerging markets. Over the long-term, we expect these trends to continue leading to growth in consumer behaviors such as migration to more frequent, smaller meals and snacks and greater use of convenience foods. In the near term, low GDP growth, economic recessionary pressures, weak consumer confidence, a strong U.S. dollar and changing consumer trends have slowed category and our net revenue growth. We recognize these factors and the changing consumer trends such as the increasing emphasis on well-being, time compression, growing income disparity, digital revolution and an evolving retail landscape, and we are investing in our well-being snacks portfolio, product and marketing innovation and new routes to market including e-commerce to position ourselves for future growth. Demand – We monitor consumer spending and our market share within the food and beverage categories in which we sell our products. Growth in these global categories (excluding Venezuela) decreased from approximately 3.4% in 2015 to 2.4% in 2016. Over the long-term, we expect category growth to improve when the macroeconomic environment improves. We continue to make investments in our brand portfolio and build strong routes to market to address the needs of consumers in emerging and developed markets. In doing so, we anticipate driving demand in our categories and growing our position in these markets. Volatility of Global Markets – Our growth strategy depends in part on our ability to expand our operations, particularly in emerging markets. Some of these markets have greater political and economic volatility, vulnerability to infrastructure and labor disruptions and sensitivity to world oil and energy prices, as we noted this past year in markets including Brazil, Russia, India, China, Ukraine, the Middle East and Nigeria. Volatility in these markets affects demand for and the costs of our products and requires frequent changes in how we operate our business. We expect continued volatility across our markets, particularly emerging markets. As such, we are focused on investing in our global Power Brands and routes to market while we protect our margins through the management of costs and pricing. 24 Table of Contents Competition – We operate in highly competitive markets that include global, regional and local competitors. Our advantaged geographic footprint, operating scale and portfolio of brands have all significantly contributed to building our market-leading positions across most of the product categories in which we sell. To grow and maintain our market positions, we focus on meeting consumer needs and preferences through new product innovations and product quality. We also continue to optimize our manufacturing and other operations and invest in our brands through ongoing research and development, advertising, marketing and consumer promotions. Pricing – We adjust our product prices based on a number of variables including demand, the competitive environment and changes in our product input costs. Our net revenue growth and profitability may be affected as we adjust prices to address new conditions. In 2015 and 2016, we generally increased prices in response to higher commodity costs, currency and other market factors. In 2017, we anticipate that we will adjust our prices in response to changing market conditions. Price competition or delayed price increases by competitors or customers may continue to affect net revenues or market share in the near term as the market adjusts to the changes in input costs and other market conditions. Operating Costs – Our operating costs include raw materials, labor, selling, general and administrative expenses, taxes, currency impacts and financing costs. We manage these costs through cost saving and productivity initiatives, sourcing and hedging programs, pricing actions, refinancing and tax planning. We also continue to work on programs to expand our profitability and margins, such as our 2014-2018 Restructuring Program, which is designed to bring about significant reductions in our operating cost structure in both our supply chain and overhead costs. We also integrated our EEMEA business into our Europe and Asia Pacific segments effective October 1, 2016. We expect this change to have a favorable impact on our operating performance prospectively due to greater leverage of our European and AMEA regional businesses and resulting cost structure. We also began to re-negotiate collective bargaining agreements covering eight U.S. facilities that expired in February 2016. We continue to work toward reaching a new agreement and have plans to ensure business continuity during the re-negotiations. Currency – As a global company with 75.6% of our net revenues generated outside the United States, we are exposed to changes in global economic conditions and currency movements. In the last three years, the U.S. dollar has generally strengthened relative to other currencies in which we operate, and several countries experienced significant declines in or devaluations of their currency. These currency movements had a significant negative effect on our reported results of operations. Our 2016 net revenues were $25.9 billion, down 12.5% from 2015, including a negative 4.6 percentage point impact from currency translation. Our 2015 net revenues were $29.6 billion, down 13.5% from 2014, including a negative 12.6 percentage point impact from currency translation (and a 12.0 percentage point impact excluding currency impacts related to Venezuela). Our 2014 net revenues were $34.2 billion, down 3.0% from 2013, including a negative 5.2 percentage point impact from currency translation (and a 3.9 percentage point impact excluding currency impacts related to Venezuela). We have historically been exposed to currency devaluation risks impacting earnings particularly, but not only, in connection with our Venezuela operations that were deconsolidated at the close of the 2015 fiscal year. In the months following Brexit, there was significant volatility in the global stock markets and currency exchange rates, affecting the markets in which we conduct business. The value of the British pound sterling relative to the U.S. dollar declined significantly with further volatility in the exchange rate expected over the Brexit transition period. The devaluation of the British pound sterling negatively affected our translated results reported in U.S. dollars. To partially offset the translation of certain of our overseas operations, including the United Kingdom, we have net investment hedges in the form of local currency denominated debt. We generally do not hedge against currency translation and primarily seek to hedge against economic losses on cross-currency transactions. Due to limited markets for hedging currency transactions and other factors, we may not be able to effectively hedge all of our cross-currency transaction risks. The local economies, monetary policies and currency hedging availability can affect our ability to hedge against currency-related economic losses. While we work to mitigate our exposure to these currency risks, factors such as continued global and local market volatility, actions by foreign governments, political uncertainty, limited hedging opportunities and other factors could lead to further unfavorable currency impacts in the future. While we continue to monitor and work to safeguard our business, Brexit could adversely affect future demand for our products, our financial results and operations, and our relationships with customers, suppliers and employees in the short or long-term. We may not be able to fully offset the increased risks related to Brexit, which could impact profitability in the near-term or longer should these conditions continue. See Note 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies – Currency Translation and Highly Inflationary Accounting: Venezuela and United Kingdom, for related information. Financing Costs – We regularly evaluate our variable and fixed-rate debt. We continue to use lower-cost, short- and long-term debt to finance our ongoing working capital, capital expenditures and other investments, dividends and share repurchases. During 2016, we retired $6.2 billion of our long-term debt and related costs and issued lower-cost, long-term euro, Swiss franc and U.S. dollar-denominated debt. Our weighted-average interest rate on our total debt as of December 31, 2016 was 2.2%, down from 3.7% as of December 31, 2015 and down from 4.3% as of December 31, 2014. Refer to Note 7, Debt and Borrowing Arrangements, for additional debt activity in 2017. 25 Table of Contents Discussion and Analysis of Historical Results Items Affecting Comparability of Financial Results The following table includes significant income or (expense) items that affected the comparability of our pre-tax results of operations and our effective tax rates.

The adjustment for deconsolidating our historical coffee business resulted in a year-over-year decrease in net revenues of $1,627 million for 2016. Unfavorable currency impacts decreased net revenues by $1,244 million, due primarily to the strength of the U.S. dollar relative to several currencies, including the Argentinean peso, British pound sterling, Mexican peso, Brazilian real, Chinese yuan and Russian ruble. The deconsolidation of our historical Venezuelan operations resulted in a year-over-year decrease in net revenues of $1,217 million for 2016. The North America segment accounting calendar change in 2015 resulted in a year-over-year decrease in net revenues of $76 million for 2016. Our underlying Organic Net Revenue growth was driven by higher net pricing, partially offset by unfavorable volume / mix. Net pricing was up, which includes the benefit of carryover pricing from 2015 as well as the effects of input cost-driven pricing actions taken during 2016. Higher net pricing was reflected in Latin America and AMEA, partially offset by lower net pricing in Europe and North America. Unfavorable volume / mix was reflected in Latin America and AMEA, mostly offset by favorable volume / mix in Europe and North America. Unfavorable volume / mix in Latin America and AMEA was largely due to price elasticity as well as strategic decisions to exit certain low-margin product lines. The impact of acquisitions primarily includes the July 15, 2015 acquisition of a biscuit operation in Vietnam, which added $71 million of incremental net revenues for 2016, and the November 2, 2016 purchase of a license to manufacture, market and sell Cadbury-branded biscuits in additional key markets, which added $16 million of incremental net revenues for 2016. 28 Table of Contents Operating Income – Operating income decreased $6,328 million (71.1%) to $2,569 million in 2016, Adjusted Operating Income (1) increased $463 million (13.3%) to $3,953 million and Adjusted Operating Income on a constant currency basis (1) increased $639 million (18.3%) to $4,129 million due to the following: Operating Income Change (in millions) (percentage point) Operating Income for the Year Ended December 31, 2015 $ 8,897 2012-2014 Restructuring Program costs (2) (4 ) (0.1)pp 2014-2018 Restructuring Program costs (2) 1,002 32.2pp Operating income from Venezuelan subsidiaries (3) (281 ) (9.8)pp Remeasurement of net monetary assets in Venezuela (3) 11 0.3pp Loss on deconsolidation of Venezuela (3) 778 33.4pp Costs associated with the JDE coffee business transactions (4) 278 13.3pp Gain on the JDE coffee business transactions (4) (6,809 ) (94.1)pp Reclassification of historical coffee business operating income (5) (342 ) (15.3)pp Reclassification of equity method investment earnings (6) (51 ) (2.7)pp Operating income from divestiture (7) (8 ) (0.4)pp Gain on divestiture (7) (13 ) (0.4)pp Intangible asset impairment charges (8) 71 2.1pp Acquisition integration costs (9) 9 0.3pp Acquisition-related costs (9) 8 0.3pp Mark-to-market gains from derivatives (10) (56 ) (1.7)pp Adjusted Operating Income (1) for the Year Ended December 31, 2015 $ 3,490 Higher net pricing 415 12.0pp Higher input costs (126 ) (3.6)pp Unfavorable volume/mix (9 ) (0.3)pp Lower selling, general and administrative expenses 322 9.3pp Gains on sales of property (9) 46 1.3pp Higher VAT-related settlements 24 0.7pp Impact from acquisitions (9) 4 0.1pp Impact of accounting calendar change (11) (36 ) (1.2)pp Other (1 ) – Total change in Adjusted Operating Income (constant currency) (1) 639 18.3% Unfavorable currency - translation (176 ) (5.0)pp Total change in Adjusted Operating Income (1) 463 13.3% Adjusted Operating Income (1) for the Year Ended December 31, 2016 $ 3,953 2014-2018 Restructuring Program costs (2) (1,086 ) (33.3)pp Divestiture-related costs (12) (86 ) (2.5)pp Operating income from divestiture (7) 2 0.1pp Gain on divestiture (7) 9 0.3pp Gain on sale of intangible assets (9) 15 0.4pp Intangible asset impairment charges (8) (137 ) (3.8)pp Acquisition integration costs (9) (7 ) (0.2)pp Acquisition-related costs (9) (1 ) (0.1)pp Mark-to-market losses from derivatives (10) (94 ) (2.7)pp Other / rounding 1 – Operating Income for the Year Ended December 31, 2016 $ 2,569 (71.1)% (1) Refer to the Non-GAAP Financial Measures section at the end of this item.

Refer to Note 2, Divestitures and Acquisitions, and Non-GAAP Financial Measures appearing later in this section for more information. 29 Table of Contents (6) Historically, we recorded income from equity method investments within our operating income as these investments operated as extensions of our base business. Beginning in the third quarter of 2015, to align with the accounting for JDE earnings, we began to record the earnings from our equity method investments in equity method investment earnings outside of operating income. In periods prior to July 2, 2015, we have reclassified the equity method earnings from Adjusted Operating Income to evaluate our operating results on a consistent basis. (7) Refer to Note 2, Divestitures and Acquisitions, for more information on the April 23, 2015 divestiture of Ajinomoto General Foods (“AGF”) and the December 1, 2016 sale of a confectionery business in Costa Rica. The divestiture of AGF generated a pre-tax gain of $13 million and after-tax loss of $9 million in 2015. The sale of the confectionery business in Costa Rica generated a pre-tax and after-tax gain of $9 million in 2016.

(12) Includes costs incurred and accrued related to the planned sale of a confectionery business in France. Refer to Note 2, Divestitures and Acquisitions, for more information. During 2016, we realized higher net pricing while input costs increased modestly. Higher net pricing, which included the carryover impact of pricing actions taken in 2015, was reflected in Latin America and AMEA, partially offset by lower net pricing in Europe and North America. The increase in input costs was driven by higher raw material costs, in part due to higher currency exchange transaction costs on imported materials, which were partially offset by lower manufacturing costs due to productivity. Unfavorable volume / mix was driven by Latin America and AMEA, which was mostly offset by favorable volume / mix in Europe and North America. Total selling, general and administrative expenses decreased $1,037 million from 2015, due to a number of factors noted in the table above, including in part, the deconsolidation of our historical coffee business, a favorable currency impact, lower costs associated with the JDE coffee business transactions, the deconsolidation of our Venezuelan operations, gains on the sales of property, VAT-related settlements and the absence of devaluation charges related to our net monetary assets in Venezuela in 2016. The decreases were partially offset by increases from divestiture-related costs associated with the planned sale of a confectionery business in France, the reclassification of equity method investment earnings, higher implementation costs incurred for the 2014-2018 Restructuring Program and the impact of acquisitions. Excluding the factors noted above, selling, general and administrative expenses decreased $322 million from 2015. The decrease was driven primarily by lower overhead costs due to continued cost reduction efforts. We recorded a benefit of $54 million in 2016 from VAT-related settlements in Latin America as compared to $30 million in 2015. Unfavorable currency impacts decreased operating income by $176 million due primarily to the strength of the U.S. dollar relative to most currencies, including the British pound sterling, Argentinean peso and Mexican peso. Excluding the portion related to deconsolidating our historical coffee business, the change in mark-to-market gains / (losses) from derivatives decreased operating income by $150 million in 2016. In 2016, the net unrealized losses on commodity and forecasted currency transaction derivatives were $94 million, as compared to net unrealized gains of $56 million ($96 million including coffee related activity) in 2015. Operating income margin decreased from 30.0% in 2015, to 9.9% in 2016. The decrease in operating income margin was driven primarily by last year’s pre-tax gain on the JDE coffee business transactions, the deconsolidation of our historical coffee business, the deconsolidation of our Venezuelan operations, the unfavorable year-over-year change in mark-to-market gains / losses from derivatives, higher costs incurred for the 2014-2018 Restructuring Program, divestiture-related costs associated with the planned sale of a confectionery business in France, higher intangible asset impairment charges and the reclassification of equity method earnings. The items that decreased our operating income margin were partially offset by the prior-year loss on the Venezuela deconsolidation, an increase in our Adjusted Operating Income margin and the absence of costs associated with the JDE coffee business transactions. Adjusted Operating Income margin increased from 13.0% in 2015 to 15.3% in 2016. The increase in Adjusted Operating Income margin was driven primarily by lower overheads from cost reduction programs, improved gross margin reflecting productivity efforts, gains on sales of property and VAT-related settlements. 30 Table of Contents Net Earnings and Earnings per Share Attributable to Mondelēz International – Net earnings attributable to Mondelēz International of $1,659 million decreased by $5,608 million (77.2%) in 2016.

Refer to Note 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies – Currency Translation and Highly Inflationary Accounting: Venezuela, for more information. (3) Please see the Non-GAAP Financial Measures section at the end of this item. Net revenue decline of 13.5% was driven by unfavorable currency and the impact of the deconsolidation of our historical coffee business, partially offset by the historical results of our Venezuelan operations, our underlying Organic Net Revenue growth of 1.4%, the impact of acquisitions and the impact of an accounting calendar change. Unfavorable currency impacts decreased net revenues by $3,565 million, due primarily to the strength of the U.S. dollar relative to several currencies, including the euro, Brazilian real, Russian ruble, Australian dollar and British pound sterling. The adjustment for deconsolidating our historical coffee business resulted in a year-over-year decrease in net revenues of $2,149 million for 2015. The historical results of our Venezuelan subsidiaries prior to the December 31, 2015 deconsolidation contributed a year-over year increase in net revenues of $457 million for 2015. Organic Net Revenue growth was driven by higher net pricing, partially offset by unfavorable volume / mix. Net pricing was up as we realized the effects of input cost-driven pricing actions taken during the year. Higher net pricing was reflected across all segments. Unfavorable volume / mix was largely due to price elasticity as well as strategic decisions to exit certain low-margin product lines. Unfavorable volume / mix was reflected in all segments except North America. The July 2015 acquisition of a biscuit operation in Vietnam added $128 million in incremental net revenues (constant currency basis) for the year. The February 2015 acquisition of the Enjoy Life Foods snack food business in North America added $37 million in incremental net revenues for the year. The North America segment accounting calendar change resulted in a year-over-year increase in net revenues of $78 million for the year. 33 Table of Contents Operating Income – Operating income increased $5,655 million (174.4%) to $8,897 million in 2015, Adjusted Operating Income (1) decreased $65 million (1.8%) to $3,490 million and Adjusted Operating Income on a constant currency basis (1) increased $388 million (10.9%) to $3,943 million due to the following: Operating Income Change (in millions) (percentage point) Operating Income for the Year Ended December 31, 2014 $ 3,242 Spin-Off Costs (2) 35 1.3pp 2012-2014 Restructuring Program costs (3) 459 14.5pp 2014-2018 Restructuring Program costs (3) 381 15.2pp Operating income from Venezuelan subsidiaries (4) (175 ) (5.0)pp Remeasurement of net monetary assets in Venezuela (4) 167 7.1pp Costs associated with the coffee business transactions (5) 77 3.1pp Reclassification of historical coffee business operating income (6) (646 ) (22.3)pp Reclassification of equity method investment earnings (7) (104 ) (4.2)pp Operating income from divestiture (8) (9 ) (0.3)pp Intangible asset impairment charges (9) 57 2.1pp Integration Program and other acquisition integration costs (10) (4 ) (0.1)pp Acquisition-related costs (11) 2 0.1pp Mark-to-market losses on derivatives (12) 73 2.8pp Adjusted Operating Income (1) for the Year Ended December 31, 2014 $ 3,555 Higher net pricing 1,146 32.2pp Higher input costs (186 ) (5.2)pp Unfavorable volume/mix (248 ) (7.0)pp Higher selling, general and administrative expenses (321 ) (9.0)pp Impact of accounting calendar change (4) 37 1.1pp Impact from acquisitions (8) 20 0.5pp Lower VAT-related settlements (54 ) (1.5)pp Gain on sale of property in 2014 (7 ) (0.2)pp Other, net 1 – Total change in Adjusted Operating Income (constant currency) (1) 388 10.9% Unfavorable currency - translation (453 ) (12.7)pp Total change in Adjusted Operating Income (1) (65 ) (1.8)% Adjusted Operating Income (1) for the Year Ended December 31, 2015 $ 3,490 2012-2014 Restructuring Program costs (3) 4 0.1pp 2014-2018 Restructuring Program costs (3) (1,002 ) (37.3)pp Operating income from Venezuelan subsidiaries (4) 281 9.1pp Remeasurement of net monetary assets in Venezuela (4) (11 ) (0.3)pp Loss on deconsolidation of Venezuela (4) (778 ) (24.0)pp Costs associated with the coffee business transactions (5) (278 ) (11.7)pp Gain on the coffee business transactions (5) 6,809 210.0pp Reclassification of historical coffee business operating income (6) 342 14.1pp Reclassification of equity method investment earnings (7) 51 2.2pp Operating income from divestiture (8) 8 0.3pp Gain on divestiture (8) 13 0.4pp Intangible asset impairment charges (9) (71 ) (2.3)pp Acquisition integration costs (10) (9 ) (0.3)pp Acquisition-related costs (11) (8 ) (0.3)pp Mark-to-market gains on derivatives (12) 56 1.9pp Operating Income for the Year Ended December 31, 2015 $ 8,897 174.4% (1) Refer to the Non-GAAP Financial Measures section at the end of this item.

Refer to Note 2, Divestitures and Acquisitions, and Non-GAAP Financial Measures appearing later in this section for more information. (7) Historically, we have recorded income from equity method investments within our operating income as these investments operated as extensions of our base business. Beginning in the third quarter of 2015, to align with the accounting for JDE earnings, we began to record the earnings from our equity method investments in after-tax equity method investment earnings outside of operating income. In periods prior to July 2, 2015, we have reclassified the equity method earnings from Adjusted Operating Income to evaluate our operating results on a consistent basis. (8) Refer to Note 2, Divestitures and Acquisitions, for more information on the April 23, 2015 divestiture of AGF and the December 1, 2016 sale of a confectionery business in Costa Rica. The divestiture of AGF generated a pre-tax gain of $13 million and after-tax loss of $9 million in 2015. The sale of the confectionery business in Costa Rica generated a pre-tax and after-tax gain of $9 million in 2016.

During 2015, higher net pricing outpaced increased input costs. Higher net pricing, due to input-cost driven pricing actions taken during the year, was reflected across all segments. The increase in input costs was driven by higher raw material costs, in part due to higher currency exchange transaction costs on imported materials, partially offset by lower manufacturing costs. Unfavorable volume / mix was reflected across all segments. Total selling, general and administrative expenses decreased $880 million from 2014, due to a number of factors noted in the table above, including in part, a favorable currency impact, the adjustment for deconsolidating our historical coffee business, lower devaluation charges related to our net monetary assets in Venezuela and the absence of 2012-2014 Restructuring Program costs. The decreases were partially offset by increases from higher costs incurred for the 2014-2018 Restructuring Program, costs associated with the coffee business transactions, lower value-added tax (“VAT”)-related settlements, the reclassification of equity method investment earnings, the impact of acquisitions and a gain on a sale of property in 2014. Excluding the factors noted above, selling, general and administrative expenses increased $321 million from 2014. The increase was driven primarily by higher advertising and consumer promotions support, particularly behind our Power Brands. We recorded a benefit of $30 million in 2015 from VAT-related settlements in Latin America as compared to $84 million in 2014. Unfavorable currency impacts decreased operating income by $453 million, due primarily to the strength of the U.S. dollar relative to most currencies, including the euro, Brazilian real, British pound sterling, Australian dollar and Russian ruble. Excluding the portion related to deconsolidating our historical coffee business, the change in unrealized gains / (losses) increased operating income by $129 million in 2015. In 2015, the net unrealized gains on currency and commodity hedging activity were $56 million ($96 million including coffee related activity), as compared to net unrealized losses of $73 million ($112 million including coffee related activity) in 2014 related to currency and commodity hedging activity. Operating income margin increased from 9.5% in 2014 to 30.0% in 2015. The increase in operating income margin was driven primarily by the pre-tax gain on the coffee business transactions, an increase in our Adjusted Operating Income margin, the absence of 2012-2014 Restructuring Program costs, the favorable year-over-year change in mark-to-market gains / losses from derivatives and lower devaluation charges related to our net monetary assets in Venezuela. The items that increased operating income margin were partially offset by the loss on deconsolidation of Venezuela, higher costs incurred for the 2014-2018 Restructuring Program and costs associated with the coffee business transactions. Adjusted Operating Income margin increased from 12.0% in 2014 to 13.0% in 2015. The increase in Adjusted Operating Income margin was driven primarily by improved gross margin, reflecting productivity efforts, and improved overhead leverage from cost reduction programs, partially offset by increased advertising and consumer promotions support. 35 Table of Contents Net Earnings and Earnings per Share Attributable to Mondelēz International – Net earnings attributable to Mondelēz International of $7,267 million increased by $5,083 million (232.7%) in 2015.

Results of Operations by Reportable Segment Our operations and management structure are organized into four reportable operating segments: • Latin America • AMEA • Europe • North America On October 1, 2016, we integrated our EEMEA operating segment into our Europe and Asia Pacific operating segments to further leverage and optimize the operating scale built within the Europe and Asia Pacific regions. Russia, Ukraine, Turkey, Belarus, Georgia and Kazakhstan were combined within our Europe operating segment, while the remaining Middle East and African countries were combined within our Asia Pacific region to form a new AMEA regional operating segment. We have reflected the segment change as if it had occurred in all periods presented. We manage our operations by region to leverage regional operating scale, manage different and changing business environments more effectively and pursue growth opportunities as they arise in our key markets. Our regional management teams have responsibility for the business, product categories and financial results in the regions. Historically, we have recorded income from equity method investments within our operating income as these investments were part of our base business. Beginning in the third quarter of 2015, to align with the accounting for our new coffee equity method investment in JDE, we began to record the earnings from our equity method investments in equity method investment earnings outside of segment operating income. For the six months ended December 31, 2015, after-tax equity method investment net earnings were less than $1 million on a combined basis. Earnings from equity method investments through July 2, 2015 recorded within segment operating income were $52 million in AMEA and $4 million in North America. For the year ended December 31, 2014 these earnings were $104 million in AMEA and $9 million in North America. See Note 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies – Principles of Consolidation, and Note 2, Divestitures and Acquisitions, for additional information. 37 Table of Contents In 2015, we also began to report stock-based compensation for our corporate employees within general corporate expenses that were reported within our North America region. We reclassified $32 million of corporate stock-based compensation expense in 2015 from the North America segment to general corporate expenses. We use segment operating income to evaluate segment performance and allocate resources. We believe it is appropriate to disclose this measure to help investors analyze segment performance and trends. See Note 16, Segment Reporting, for additional information on our segments and Items Affecting Comparability of Financial Results earlier in this section for items affecting our segment operating results. Our segment net revenues and earnings, revised to reflect our new segment structure in all periods, were: For the Years Ended December 31, 2016 2015 2014 (in millions) Net revenues: Latin America (1) $ 3,392 $ 4,988 $ 5,153 AMEA (2) 5,816 6,002 6,367 Europe (2) 9,755 11,672 15,788 North America 6,960 6,974 6,936 Net revenues $ 25,923 $ 29,636 $ 34,244 (1) Net revenues of $1,217 million for 2015 and $760 million for 2014 from our Venezuelan subsidiaries are included in our consolidated financial statements.

Refer to Note 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies – Currency Translation and Highly Inflationary Accounting: Venezuela, for more information. (2) On July 2, 2015, we contributed our global coffee businesses primarily from our Europe and AMEA segments.

The deconsolidation of our Venezuelan operations resulted in a year-over-year decrease in net revenues of $1,217 million. Unfavorable currency impacts were due primarily to the strength of the U.S. dollar relative to most currencies in the region, including the Argentinean peso and Mexican peso. Unfavorable volume / mix, which primarily occurred in Brazil and Argentina, was largely due to the impact of pricing-related elasticity as well as strategic decisions to exit certain low-margin product lines. Unfavorable volume / mix was driven by declines in all categories except for cheese & grocery. Higher net pricing was reflected across all categories driven primarily by Argentina, Brazil and Mexico. Segment operating income decreased $214 million (44.1%), primarily due to higher raw material costs, the deconsolidation of our Venezuelan operations, unfavorable volume / mix and unfavorable currency. These unfavorable items were partially offset by higher net pricing, lower other selling, general and administrative expenses (including higher year-over year VAT-related settlements), lower manufacturing costs, lower advertising and consumer promotion costs, lower costs incurred for the 2014-2018 Restructuring Program and the absence of remeasurement losses in 2016 related to our net monetary assets in Venezuela. 2015 compared with 2014: Net revenues decreased $165 million (3.2%), due to unfavorable currency (21.0 pp), unfavorable volume / mix (5.1 pp) and the adjustment for deconsolidating our historical coffee business (0.1 pp), partially offset by higher net pricing (12.0 pp) and the favorable historical results of our Venezuelan subsidiaries prior to the December 31, 2015 deconsolidation (11.0 pp). Unfavorable currency impacts were due primarily to the strength of the U.S. dollar relative to most currencies in the region, including the Brazilian real, Mexican peso and Argentinean peso. Unfavorable volume / mix was largely due to the impact of pricing-related elasticity as well as strategic decisions to exit certain low-margin product lines. Unfavorable volume / mix was driven by declines in chocolate, refreshment beverages and cheese & grocery, partially offset by gains in biscuits, gum & candy. The adjustment for deconsolidating our historical coffee business resulted in a year-over-year decrease in net revenues of $5 million. Higher net pricing was reflected across all categories. Both the unfavorable volume / mix and higher net pricing were driven primarily by Brazil and Argentina. Segment operating income increased $10 million (2.1%), primarily due to higher net pricing, higher remeasurement losses in 2014 related to our net monetary assets in Venezuela, the favorable historical results of our Venezuelan subsidiaries prior to the December 31, 2015 deconsolidation, lower manufacturing costs and the absence of 2012-2014 Restructuring Program costs. These favorable items were partially offset by higher raw material costs, unfavorable currency, higher advertising and consumer promotion costs, higher other selling, general and administrative expenses (including lower year-over-year VAT-related settlements), unfavorable volume / mix, higher costs incurred for the 2014-2018 Restructuring Program and an intangible asset impairment charge in 2015 related to a biscuit trademark. 39 Table of Contents AMEA For the Years EndedDecember 31, 2016 2015 $ change % change (in millions) Net revenues $ 5,816 $ 6,002 $ (186 ) (3.1)% Segment operating income 506 389 117 30.1% For the Years EndedDecember 31, 2015 2014 $ change % change (in millions) Net revenues $ 6,002 $ 6,367 $ (365 ) (5.7)% Segment operating income 389 530 (141 ) (26.6)% 2016 compared with 2015: Net revenues decreased $186 million (3.1%), due to unfavorable currency (3.7 pp), the adjustment for deconsolidating our historical coffee business (1.1 pp) and unfavorable volume / mix (1.0 pp), partially offset by higher net pricing (1.5 pp) and the impact of an acquisition (1.2 pp). Unfavorable currency impacts were due primarily to the strength of the U.S. dollar relative to most currencies in the region, including the Chinese yuan, Indian rupee, South African rand, Egyptian pound, Nigerian naira, Australian dollar and Philippine peso, partially offset by the strength of the Japanese yen relative to the U.S. dollar. The adjustment for deconsolidating our historical coffee business resulted in a year-over-year decrease in net revenues of $66 million. Unfavorable volume / mix, including the unfavorable impact of strategic decisions to exit certain low-margin product lines, was driven by declines in candy, cheese & grocery, refreshment beverages and chocolate, partially offset by gains in biscuits and gum. Higher net pricing was driven by chocolate, candy, biscuits and refreshment beverages, partially offset by lower net pricing in cheese & grocery and gum. The acquisition of a biscuit operation in Vietnam in July 2015 added net revenues of $71 million (constant currency basis). Segment operating income increased $117 million (30.1%), primarily due to lower manufacturing costs, higher net pricing, lower other selling, general and administrative expenses, lower costs incurred for the 2014-2018 Restructuring Program, the absence of costs associated with the coffee business transactions, the impact of the Vietnam acquisition and lower advertising and consumer promotion costs. These favorable items were partially offset by higher raw material costs, the reclassification of equity method investment earnings, unfavorable volume / mix, unfavorable currency, the deconsolidation of our historical coffee business, and the impact of divestitures. 2015 compared with 2014: Net revenues decreased $365 million (5.7%), due to unfavorable currency (8.8 pp), unfavorable volume / mix (2.5 pp) and the adjustment for deconsolidating our historical coffee business (0.6 pp), partially offset by higher net pricing (4.2 pp) and the impact of an acquisition (2.0 pp). Unfavorable currency impacts were due primarily to the strength of the U.S. dollar relative to most currencies in the region, including the Australian dollar, South African rand, Indian rupee, Japanese yen, Nigerian naira, Chinese yuan and Egyptian pound. Unfavorable volume / mix was due largely to the impact of pricing-related elasticity as well as strategic decisions to exit certain low-margin product lines. Unfavorable volume / mix was driven by declines in all categories except biscuits and gum. The adjustment for deconsolidating our historical coffee business resulted in a year-over-year decrease in net revenues of $49 million. Higher net pricing was reflected across all categories. The acquisition of a biscuit operation in Vietnam in July 2015 added net revenues of $128 million (constant currency basis). Segment operating income decreased $141 million (26.6%), primarily due to higher raw material costs, higher costs incurred for the 2014-2018 Restructuring Program, higher advertising and consumer promotion costs, unfavorable currency, higher other selling, general and administrative expenses (including a phase-out of a local tax incentive program), the reclassification of equity method investment earnings, unfavorable volume / mix, the adjustment for deconsolidating our historical coffee business, costs associated with the coffee business transactions and higher other acquisition-related integration costs. These unfavorable items were partially offset by higher net pricing, lower manufacturing costs, the absence of 2012-2014 Restructuring Program costs, the impact of the Vietnam acquisition and lower intangible asset impairment charges (related to candy and biscuit trademarks in 2015 and a biscuit trademark in 2014). 40 Table of Contents Europe For the Years EndedDecember 31, 2016 2015 $ change % change (in millions) Net revenues $ 9,755 $ 11,672 $ (1,917 ) (16.4)% Segment operating income 1,267 1,350 (83 ) (6.1)% For the Years EndedDecember 31, 2015 2014 $ change % change (in millions) Net revenues $ 11,672 $ 15,788 $ (4,116 ) (26.1)% Segment operating income 1,350 1,952 (602 ) (30.8)% 2016 compared with 2015: Net revenues decreased $1,917 million (16.4%), due to the adjustment for deconsolidating our historical coffee business (12.9 pp), unfavorable currency (4.3 pp) and lower net pricing (0.4 pp), partially offset by favorable volume / mix (1.1 pp) and the impact of an acquisition (0.1 pp).

Favorable volume / mix, including the unfavorable impact of strategic decisions to exit certain low-margin product lines, was driven by biscuits, chocolate and cheese & grocery, partially offset by declines in gum, refreshment beverages and candy. The purchase of the license to manufacture, market and sell Cadbury-branded biscuits in November 2016 added net revenues of $16 million (constant currency basis). Segment operating income decreased $83 million (6.1%), primarily due to the deconsolidation of our historical coffee business, unfavorable currency, higher raw material costs, divestiture-related costs, higher costs incurred for the 2014-2018 Restructuring Program, lower net pricing and higher intangible asset impairment charges. These unfavorable items were partially offset by the absence of costs associated with the JDE coffee business transactions, lower manufacturing costs, lower other selling, general and administrative expenses and favorable volume / mix. 2015 compared with 2014: Net revenues decreased $4,116 million (26.1%), due to unfavorable currency (16.2 pp), the adjustment for deconsolidating our historical coffee business (9.4 pp) and unfavorable volume / mix (3.3 pp), partially offset by higher net pricing (2.8 pp). Unfavorable currency impacts primarily reflected the strength of the U.S. dollar against most currencies in the region, including the euro and British pound sterling. The adjustment for deconsolidating our historical coffee business resulted in a year-over-year decrease in net revenues of $2,095 million. Unfavorable volume / mix was largely due to the impact of pricing-related elasticity as well as strategic decisions to exit certain low-margin product lines. Unfavorable volume / mix was driven by declines in chocolate, gum, refreshment beverages and cheese & grocery, partially offset by gains in biscuits. Higher net pricing was driven by chocolate, gum and candy, partially offset by lower net pricing in cheese & grocery and refreshment beverages. Segment operating income decreased $602 million (30.8%), primarily due to the adjustment for deconsolidating our historical coffee business, unfavorable currency, higher raw material costs, higher costs incurred for the 2014-2018 Restructuring Program, costs associated with the coffee business transactions, unfavorable volume / mix, higher advertising and consumer promotion costs and higher intangible asset impairment charges related to a candy trademark. These unfavorable items were partially offset by higher net pricing, the lower manufacturing costs, absence of 2012-2014 Restructuring Program costs and lower other selling, general and administrative expenses (net of the unfavorable year-over-year impact from the 2014 gain on a sale of property in the United Kingdom). 41 Table of Contents North America For the Years EndedDecember 31, 2016 2015 $ change % change (in millions) Net revenues $ 6,960 $ 6,974 $ (14 ) (0.2)% Segment operating income 1,078 1,105 (27 ) (2.4)% For the Years EndedDecember 31, 2015 2014 $ change % change (in millions) Net revenues $ 6,974 $ 6,936 $ 38 0.5% Segment operating income 1,105 922 183 19.8% 2016 compared with 2015: Net revenues decreased $14 million (0.2%), due to the impact of an accounting calendar change made in the prior year (1.1 pp), unfavorable currency (0.3 pp) and lower net pricing (0.2 pp), partially offset by favorable volume/mix (1.4 pp). The prior-year change in North America’s accounting calendar resulted in a year-over-year decrease in net revenues of $76 million. Unfavorable currency impact was due to the strength of the U.S. dollar relative to the Canadian dollar. Lower net pricing was reflected in biscuits, partially offset by higher net pricing in chocolate, gum and candy. Favorable volume / mix, including the unfavorable impact of strategic decisions to exit certain low-margin product lines, was driven by gains in biscuits and candy, partially offset by declines in gum and chocolate. Segment operating income decreased $27 million (2.4%), primarily due to higher costs incurred for the 2014-2018 Restructuring Program, higher advertising and consumer promotion costs, intangible asset impairment charges, the year-over-year impact of the prior-year accounting calendar change, higher raw material costs and lower net pricing. These unfavorable items were mostly offset by lower other selling, general and administrative expenses (including the gain on sale of property), lower manufacturing costs, favorable volume/mix and the gain on the sale of an intangible asset. 2015 compared with 2014: Net revenues increased $38 million (0.5%), due to an accounting calendar change (1.2 pp), an acquisition (0.5 pp), favorable volume / mix (0.5 pp) and higher net pricing (0.3 pp), partially offset by unfavorable currency (2.0 pp). The change in North America’s accounting calendar added net revenues of $78 million (constant currency basis). The acquisition of the Enjoy Life Foods snack food business in February 2015 added net revenues of $37 million. Favorable volume / mix was driven by gains in biscuits and candy, partially offset by declines in gum and chocolate. Higher net pricing was reflected in gum and chocolate, partially offset by lower net pricing in biscuits and candy. Unfavorable currency impact was due to the strength of the U.S. dollar relative to the Canadian dollar. Segment operating income increased $183 million (19.8%), primarily due to the absence of 2012-2014 Restructuring Program costs, lower manufacturing costs, lower other selling, general and administrative expenses (including the reclassification of corporate stock-based compensation), the impact of an accounting calendar change, higher net pricing and lower raw material costs. These favorable items were partially offset by higher costs incurred for the 2014-2018 Restructuring Program, unfavorable currency, higher advertising and consumer promotion costs, unfavorable volume / mix and the reclassification of equity method investment earnings. 42 Table of Contents Critical Accounting Estimates We prepare our consolidated financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP. The preparation of these financial statements requires the use of estimates, judgments and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the periods presented. Actual results could differ from those estimates and assumptions. Note 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, to the consolidated financial statements includes a summary of the significant accounting policies we used to prepare our consolidated financial statements. We have discussed the selection and disclosure of our critical accounting policies and estimates with our Audit Committee. The following is a review of our most significant assumptions and estimates. Goodwill and Non-Amortizable Intangible Assets: We test goodwill and non-amortizable intangible assets for impairment on an annual basis on October 1. We assess goodwill impairment risk throughout the year by performing a qualitative review of entity-specific, industry, market and general economic factors affecting our goodwill reporting units. We review our operating segment and reporting unit structure for goodwill testing annually or as significant changes in the organization occur. Annually, we may perform qualitative testing, or depending on factors such as prior-year test results, current year developments, current risk evaluations and other practical considerations, we may elect to do quantitative testing instead. Quantitative impairment testing consists of a two-step evaluation. The first step compares a reporting unit’s estimated fair value with its carrying value. We estimate a reporting unit’s fair value using a discounted cash flow method which incorporates planned growth rates, market-based discount rates and estimates of residual value. This year, for our Europe and North America reporting units, we used a market-based, weighted-average cost of capital of 6.7% to discount the projected cash flows of those operations. For our Latin America and AMEA reporting units, we used a risk-rated discount rate of 9.7%. Estimating the fair value of individual reporting units requires us to make assumptions and estimates regarding our future plans and industry and economic conditions, and our actual results and conditions may differ over time. If the carrying value of a reporting unit’s net assets exceeds its fair value, we would apply a second step to measure the difference between the carrying value and implied fair value of goodwill. If the carrying value of goodwill exceeds its implied fair value, the goodwill is impaired and its carrying value is reduced to the implied fair value of the goodwill. On October 1, 2016, we integrated our EEMEA operating segment into our Europe and Asia Pacific operating segments. As a result, EEMEA goodwill of $1.3 billion was reallocated to new reporting units based on the relative fair value of the EEMEA component businesses that moved to the Europe and Asia Pacific segments. Goodwill by segment as of December 31, 2016 reflects the results of the reallocation and the December 31, 2015 goodwill by segment information was recast to reflect the October 1, 2016 reallocation of goodwill. On July 2, 2015, we deconsolidated our global coffee businesses from our Europe and AMEA segments. Goodwill was deconsolidated from the impacted reporting units based on relative fair values of the coffee and remaining businesses. Intangible assets contributed with the coffee business transactions were specifically identified. We deconsolidated total goodwill of $1,664 million and intangible assets of less than $1 million during the third quarter of 2015. Refer to Note 2, Divestitures and Acquisitions – JDE Coffee Business Transactions, for more information. In 2016, 2015 and 2014, there were no impairments of goodwill. In connection with our 2016 annual impairment testing, each of our reporting units had sufficient fair value in excess of carrying value. While all reporting units passed our annual impairment testing, if planned business performance expectations are not met or specific valuation factors outside of our control, such as discount rates, change significantly, then the estimated fair values of a reporting unit or reporting units might decline and lead to a goodwill impairment in the future. Annually, we assess non-amortizable intangible assets for impairment by performing a qualitative review and assessing events and circumstances that could affect the fair value or carrying value of the indefinite-lived intangible assets. If significant potential impairment risk exists for a specific asset, we quantitatively test it for impairment by comparing its estimated fair value with its carrying value. We determine estimated fair value using planned growth rates, market-based discount rates and estimates of royalty rates. If the carrying value of the asset exceeds its estimated fair value, the asset is impaired and its carrying value is reduced to the estimated fair value. 43 Table of Contents During our 2016 annual testing of non-amortizable intangible assets, we recorded $98 million of impairment charges related to five trademarks. The impairments arose due to lower than expected product growth in part driven by decisions to redirect support from these trademarks to other regional and global brands, as well as slowdowns in local economies. We recorded charges related to biscuits, candy and gum trademarks of $41 million in AMEA, $32 million in North America, $22 million in Europe, and $3 million in Latin America. The impairment charges were calculated as the excess of the carrying value over the estimated fair value of the intangible assets on a global basis and were recorded within asset impairment and exit costs. We primarily use a relief of royalty valuation method, which utilizes estimates of future sales, growth rates, royalty rates and discount rates in determining a brand’s global fair value. During our 2016 intangible asset impairment review, we noted nine brands, including the five impaired trademarks, with $630 million of aggregate book value as of December 31, 2016 that each had a fair value in excess of book value of 10% or less. While these other four intangible assets passed our annual impairment testing and we believe our current plans for each of these brands will allow them to continue to not be impaired, if planned business performance expectations are not met or specific valuation factors outside of our control, such as discount rates, change significantly, then a brand or brands could become impaired in the future. In 2015, we recorded a charge related to candy and biscuit trademarks of $44 million in our AMEA segment, $22 million in Europe and $5 million in Latin America. Additionally, in connection with the deconsolidation of our Venezuelan operations on December 31, 2015, we recorded $12 million of impairment charges within the loss on deconsolidation of Venezuela related to a biscuit trademark. In 2014, we recorded a $48 million charge related to a biscuit trademark in our AMEA segment and a $9 million charge related to a candy trademark in our Europe segment. Refer to Note 5, Goodwill and Intangible Assets, for additional information. Trade and marketing programs: We promote our products with advertising, marketing, sales incentives and trade promotions. These programs include, but are not limited to, cooperative advertising, in-store displays, consumer promotions, new product introduction fees, discounts, coupons, rebates and volume-based incentives. We expense advertising costs either in the period the advertising first takes place or as incurred. Sales incentive and trade promotion activities are recorded as a reduction to revenues based on amounts estimated due to customers and consumers at the end of a period. We base these estimates principally on historical utilization and redemption rates. For interim reporting purposes, advertising expenses and sales incentives are charged to operations as a percentage of volume, based on estimated volume and estimated program spending. We do not defer costs on our year-end consolidated balance sheet and all marketing costs are recorded as an expense in the year incurred. Employee Benefit Plans: We sponsor various employee benefit plans throughout the world. These include primarily pension plans and postretirement healthcare benefits. For accounting purposes, we estimate the pension and post-retirement healthcare benefit obligations utilizing assumptions and estimates for discount rates; expected returns on plan assets; expected compensation increases; employee-related factors such as turnover, retirement age and mortality; and health care cost trends. We review our actuarial assumptions on an annual basis and make modifications to the assumptions based on current rates and trends when appropriate. Our assumptions also reflect our historical experiences and management’s best judgment regarding future expectations. These and other assumptions affect the annual expense and obligations recognized for the underlying plans. As permitted by U.S. GAAP, we generally amortize the effect of changes in the assumptions over future periods. The cost or benefit of plan changes, such as increasing or decreasing benefits for prior employee service (prior service cost), is deferred and included in expense on a straight-line basis over the average remaining service period of the employees expected to receive benefits. Since pension and post-retirement liabilities are measured on a discounted basis, the discount rate significantly affects our plan obligations and expenses. The expected return on plan assets assumption affects our pension plan expenses, as many of our pension plans are partially funded. The assumptions for discount rates and expected rates of return and our process for setting these assumptions are described in Note 9, Benefit Plans, to the consolidated financial statements. 44 Table of Contents While we do not anticipate further changes in the 2017 assumptions for our U.S. and non-U.S. pension and postretirement health care plans, as a sensitivity measure, a fifty-basis point change in our discount rates or the expected rate of return on plan assets would have the following effects, increase / (decrease), on our annual benefit plan costs: As of December 31, 2016 U.S. Plans Non-U.S. Plans Fifty-Basis-Point Fifty-Basis-Point Increase Decrease Increase Decrease (in millions) Effect of change in discount rate on pension costs $ (14 ) $ 16 $ (63 ) $ 67 Effect of change in expected rate of return on plan assets on pension costs (7 ) 7 (39 ) 39 Effect of change in discount rate on postretirement health care costs (4 ) 4 (1 ) 1 Income Taxes: As a global company, we calculate and provide for income taxes in each tax jurisdiction in which we operate. The provision for income taxes includes the amounts payable or refundable for the current year, the effect of deferred taxes and impacts from uncertain tax positions. Our provision for income taxes is significantly affected by shifts in the geographic mix of our pre-tax earnings across tax jurisdictions, changes in tax laws and regulations, tax planning opportunities available in each tax jurisdiction and the ultimate outcome of various tax audits. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between the financial statement and tax bases of our assets and liabilities and for operating losses and tax credit carryforwards. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates that will apply to taxable income in the years in which those differences are expected to be recovered or settled. Valuation allowances are established for deferred tax assets when it is more likely than not that a tax benefit will not be realized. We believe our tax positions comply with applicable tax laws and that we have properly accounted for uncertain tax positions. We recognize tax benefits in our financial statements from uncertain tax positions only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by tax authorities based on the technical merits of the position. The amount we recognize is measured as the largest benefit that has a greater than 50 percent likelihood of being realized upon settlement. We evaluate uncertain tax positions on an ongoing basis and adjust the amount recognized in light of changing facts and circumstances, such as the progress of a tax audit or expiration of a statute of limitations. We believe the estimates and assumptions used to support our evaluation of uncertain tax positions are reasonable. However, final determination of historical tax liabilities, either by settlement with tax authorities or due to expiration of statutes of limitations, could be materially different from estimates reflected on our consolidated balance sheet and historical income tax provisions. The outcome of these final determinations could have a material effect on our provision for income taxes, net earnings or cash flows in the period in which the determination is made. No taxes have been provided on undistributed foreign earnings that are planned to be indefinitely reinvested. If future events, such as material changes in long-term investment requirements, necessitate that these earnings be distributed, an additional provision for taxes may apply, which could materially affect our provision for income taxes, net earnings or cash flows. See Note 14, Income Taxes, for additional information on our effective tax rate, current and deferred taxes, valuation allowances and unrecognized tax benefits. Contingencies: See Note 12, Commitments and Contingencies, to the consolidated financial statements. New Accounting Guidance: See Note 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, to the consolidated financial statements for a discussion of new accounting standards. 45 Table of Contents Liquidity and Capital Resources We believe that cash from operations, our $4.5 billion revolving credit facility and our authorized long-term financing will provide sufficient liquidity for our working capital needs, planned capital expenditures, future contractual obligations, share repurchases and payment of our anticipated quarterly dividends. We continue to utilize our commercial paper program, international credit lines and long-term debt issuances for regular funding requirements. We also use intercompany loans with our international subsidiaries to improve financial flexibility. Earnings outside of the United States are considered indefinitely reinvested and no material tax liability has been accrued as of December 31, 2016. Overall, we do not expect any negative effects to our funding sources that would have a material effect on our liquidity, including the indefinite reinvestment of our earnings outside of the United States. Net Cash Provided by Operating Activities: Operating activities provided net cash of $2,838 million in 2016, $3,728 million in 2015 and $3,562 million in 2014. Cash flows from operating activities were lower in 2016 than 2015 due to higher contributions to our pension benefit plans in 2016 and higher working capital cash improvements in 2015 than in 2016. Cash flows from operating activities in all years were favorably impacted by working capital improvements, primarily due to continually decreasing our cash conversion cycle (a metric that measures working capital efficiency and utilizes days sales outstanding, days inventory on hand and days payables outstanding) to negative 28 days in 2016, negative 12 days in 2015 and positive 10 days in 2014. Cash flows from operating activities were favorable in 2015 relative to 2014 primarily due to higher relative working capital cash improvements than in 2014 and significant tax payments in 2014 related to the $2.6 billion Starbucks arbitration award we received in late 2013, partially offset by higher contributions to our pension benefit plans in 2015. Net Cash Provided by / (Used in) Investing Activities: Net cash used in investing activities was $1,029 million in 2016, net cash provided by investing activities was $2,649 million in 2015 and net cash used in investing activities was $1,642 million in 2014. The increase in net cash used in investing activities in 2016 relative to 2015 and the increase in net cash provided by investing activities in 2015 relative to 2014 primarily relate to $4.7 billion of proceeds, net of divested cash and transaction costs, from the contribution of our global coffee businesses, the divestiture of AGF and the cash receipt of $1.0 billion due to the settlement of currency exchange forward contracts related to our coffee business transactions in 2015. The increase in net cash used in investing activities in 2016 relative to 2015 is partially offset by lower capital expenditures in 2016 of $290 million. The increase in net cash provided by investing activities in 2015 relative to 2014 is also driven by lower capital expenditures in 2015 of $128 million, partially offset by the $611 million reduction of cash due to the Venezuela deconsolidation, $501 million of contributed JDE receivables and a $43 million cash payment to fund a capital increase in JDE and $527 million of payments to acquire a biscuit operation in Vietnam and the Enjoy Life Foods snack food business in 2015. Capital expenditures were $1,224 million in 2016, $1,514 million in 2015 and $1,642 million in 2014. We continue to make capital expenditures primarily to modernize manufacturing facilities and support new product and productivity initiatives. We expect 2017 capital expenditures to be up to $1.2 billion, including capital expenditures in connection with our 2014-2018 Restructuring Program. We expect to continue to fund these expenditures from operations. Net Cash Used in Financing Activities: Net cash used in financing activities was $1,862 million in 2016, $5,883 million in 2015 and $2,688 million in 2014. The decrease in net cash used in financing activities in 2016 relative to 2015 was primarily due to higher net short-term debt issuances and $1.0 billion of lower share repurchases following the exceptional year of share repurchases using proceeds from the global coffee business transactions in 2015. The increase in net cash used in financing activities in 2015 relative to 2014 was primarily due to higher repayments of long-term debt in 2015 (including the tender offers and euro notes maturities), $1.9 billion of higher share repurchases and higher net short-term debt repayments, partially offset by higher proceeds received from long-term note issuances. Debt: From time to time we refinance long-term and short-term debt. Refer to Note 7, Debt and Borrowing Arrangements, for details of our tender offers, debt issuances and maturities during 2016, 2015 and 2014. The nature and amount of our long-term and short-term debt and the proportionate amount of each varies as a result of current and expected business requirements, market conditions and other factors. Due to seasonality, in the first and second quarters of the year, our working capital requirements grow, increasing the need for short-term financing. The third and fourth quarters of the year typically generate higher cash flows. As such, we may issue commercial paper or secure other forms of financing throughout the year to meet short-term working capital needs. 46 Table of Contents During 2016, one of our subsidiaries, Mondelez International Holdings Netherlands B.V. (“MIHN”), issued debt totaling $4.5 billion. The operations held by MIHN generated approximately 74.1 percent (or $19.2 billion) of the $25.9 billion of consolidated net revenue during fiscal year 2016 and represented approximately 81.7 percent (or $20.6 billion) of the $25.2 billion of net assets as of December 31, 2016. On February 3, 2017, our Board of Directors approved a new $5 billion long-term financing authority to replace the prior authority. In the next 12 months, we expect $1.4 billion of long-term debt will mature as follows: €750 million ($789 million as of December 31, 2016) in January 2017, fr.175 million Swiss franc notes ($172 million as of December 31, 2016) in March 2017 and $488 million in August 2017. We expect to fund these repayments with a combination of cash from operations and the issuance of commercial paper or long-term debt. Our total debt was $17.2 billion at December 31, 2016 and $15.4 billion at December 31, 2015. Our debt-to-capitalization ratio was 0.41 at December 31, 2016 and 0.35 at December 31, 2015. At December 31, 2016, the weighted-average term of our outstanding long-term debt was 6.6 years. Our average daily commercial borrowings were $2.2 billion in 2016, $2.2 billion in 2015 and $1.9 billion in 2014. We had $2.4 billion of commercial paper borrowings outstanding at December 31, 2016 and none outstanding as of December 31, 2015, as commercial paper interest rates continued to be favorable in late 2016 and we had a bond maturity refinanced with commercial paper in December 2016. We expect to continue to use commercial paper borrowings to finance various short or long-term financing needs. We expect to continue to use commercial paper to finance various short and long-term financing needs and to comply with our long-term debt covenants. Refer to Note 7, Debt and Borrowing Arrangements, for more information on our debt and debt covenants. Commodity Trends We regularly monitor worldwide supply, commodity cost and currency trends so we can cost-effectively secure ingredients, packaging and fuel required for production. During 2016, the primary drivers of the increase in our aggregate commodity costs were higher currency-related costs on our commodity purchases and increased costs for packaging and other raw materials, partially offset by lower costs for nuts, dairy, energy, sugar, grains and oils and cocoa. A number of external factors such as weather conditions, commodity market conditions, currency fluctuations and the effects of governmental agricultural or other programs affect the cost and availability of raw materials and agricultural materials used in our products. We address higher commodity costs and currency impacts primarily through hedging, higher pricing and manufacturing and overhead cost control. We use hedging techniques to limit the impact of fluctuations in the cost of our principal raw materials; however, we may not be able to fully hedge against commodity cost changes, and our hedging strategies may not protect us from increases in specific raw material costs. Due to competitive or market conditions, planned trade or promotional incentives, fluctuations in currency exchange rates or other factors, our pricing actions may also lag commodity cost changes temporarily. We expect price volatility and a slightly higher aggregate cost environment to continue in 2017. While the costs of our principal raw materials fluctuate, we believe there will continue to be an adequate supply of the raw materials we use and that they will generally remain available from numerous sources. 47 Table of Contents Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements and Aggregate Contractual Obligations We have no significant off-balance sheet arrangements other than the contractual obligations discussed below. Guarantees: As discussed in Note 12, Commitments and Contingencies, we enter into third-party guarantees primarily to cover the long-term obligations of our vendors. As part of these transactions, we guarantee that third parties will make contractual payments or achieve performance measures. At December 31, 2016, we had no material third-party guarantees recorded on our consolidated balance sheet. In addition, at December 31, 2016, we were contingently liable for $758 million of guarantees related to our own performance. These include letters of credit, surety bonds and guarantees related to the payment of custom duties and taxes. Guarantees do not have, and we do not expect them to have, a material effect on our liquidity. Aggregate Contractual Obligations: The following table summarizes our contractual obligations at December 31, 2016. Payments Due Total 2017 2018-19 2020-21 2022 andThereafter (in millions) Debt (1) $ 14,732 $ 1,451 $ 3,792 $ 3,916 $ 5,573 Interest expense (2) 3,650 388 656 483 2,123 Capital leases 5 – 2 2 1 Operating leases (3) 921 241 318 205 157 Purchase obligations: (4) Inventory and production costs 5,404 2,123 2,526 336 419 Other 713 628 75 9 1 6,117 2,751 2,601 345 420 Other long-term liabilities (5) 409 21 137 102 149 Total $ 25,834 $ 4,852 $ 7,506 $ 5,053 $ 8,423 (1) Amounts include the expected cash payments of our debt excluding capital leases, which are presented separately in the table above. The amounts also exclude $69 million of net unamortized non-cash bond premiums and discounts and mark-to-market adjustments related to our interest rate swaps recorded in total debt. (2) Amounts represent the expected cash payments of our interest expense on our long-term debt. Interest calculated on our euro, British pound sterling and Swiss franc notes was forecasted using currency exchange rates as of December 31, 2016. An insignificant amount of interest expense was excluded from the table for a portion of our other non-U.S. debt obligations due to the complexities involved in forecasting expected interest payments. (3) Operating lease payments represent the minimum rental commitments under non-cancelable operating leases. (4) Purchase obligations for inventory and production costs (such as raw materials, indirect materials and supplies, packaging, co-manufacturing arrangements, storage and distribution) are commitments for projected needs to be utilized in the normal course of business. Other purchase obligations include commitments for marketing, advertising, capital expenditures, information technology and professional services. Arrangements are considered purchase obligations if a contract specifies all significant terms, including fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased, a pricing structure and approximate timing of the transaction. Most arrangements are cancelable without a significant penalty and with short notice (usually 30 days). Any amounts reflected on the consolidated balance sheet as accounts payable and accrued liabilities are excluded from the table above. (5) Other long-term liabilities include estimated future benefit payments for our postretirement health care plans through December 31, 2026 of $195 million. We are unable to reliably estimate the timing of the payments beyond 2026; as such, they are excluded from the above table. There are also another $179 million of various other long-term liabilities that are expected to be paid over the next 5 years. In addition, the following long-term liabilities included on the consolidated balance sheet are excluded from the table above: accrued pension costs, income taxes, insurance accruals and other accruals. We are unable to reliably estimate the timing of the payments (or contributions beyond 2017, in the case of accrued pension costs) for these items. We currently expect to make approximately $468 million in contributions to our pension plans in 2017. As of December 31, 2016, our total liability for income taxes, including uncertain tax positions and associated accrued interest and penalties, was $899 million. We currently estimate payments of approximately $232 million related to these positions over the next 12 months. 48 Table of Contents Equity and Dividends Stock Plans: See Note 10, Stock Plans, to the consolidated financial statements for more information on our stock plans and grant activity during 2016, 2015 and 2014. Share Repurchases: See Note 11, Capital Stock, to the consolidated financial statements for more information on our share repurchase and accelerated share repurchase programs. We intend to continue to use a portion of our cash for share repurchases. On July 29, 2015, our Finance Committee, with authorization delegated from our Board of Directors, approved an increase of $6.0 billion in the share repurchase program, raising the authorization to $13.7 billion of Common Stock repurchases, and extended the program through December 31, 2018. We repurchased $10.8 billion of shares ($2.6 billion in 2016, $3.6 billion in 2015, $1.9 billion in 2014 and $2.7 billion in 2013) through December 31, 2016. The number of shares that we ultimately repurchase under our share repurchase program may vary depending on numerous factors, including share price and other market conditions, our ongoing capital allocation planning, levels of cash and debt balances, other demands for cash, such as acquisition activity, general economic or business conditions and board and management discretion. Additionally, our share repurchase activity during any particular period may fluctuate. We may accelerate, suspend, delay or discontinue our share repurchase program at any time, without notice. Dividends: We paid dividends of $1,094 million in 2016, $1,008 million in 2015 and $964 million in 2014. On July 19, 2016, our Board of Directors approved a 12% increase in the quarterly dividend to $0.19 per common share or $0.76 per common share on an annual basis. On July 23, 2015, our Board of Directors approved a 13% increase at that time in the quarterly dividend to $0.17 per common share or $0.68 per common share on an annual basis. On August 5, 2014, our Audit Committee, with authorization from our Board of Directors, approved a 7% increase at that time in the quarterly dividend to $0.15 per common share or $0.60 per common share on an annual basis. The declaration of dividends is subject to the discretion of our Board of Directors and depends on various factors, including our net earnings, financial condition, cash requirements, future prospects and other factors that our Board of Directors deems relevant to its analysis and decision making. For U.S. income tax purposes only, the Company has calculated that 100% of the distributions paid to its shareholders in January 2016 are characterized as a qualified dividend paid from U.S. earnings and profits. The distributions the Company paid to its shareholders in April, July and October are characterized as a return of capital to each shareholder, up to the extent of the shareholder’s tax basis. If a shareholder does not have sufficient tax basis, these distributions could result in taxable gains to the shareholder. Shareholders should consult their tax advisors for a full understanding of all of the tax consequences of the receipt of dividends, including distributions in excess of our U.S. earnings and profits. 49 Table of Contents Non-GAAP Financial Measures We use non-GAAP financial information and believe it is useful to investors as it provides additional information to facilitate comparisons of historical operating results, identify trends in our underlying operating results and provide additional insight and transparency on how we evaluate our business. We use non-GAAP financial measures to budget, make operating and strategic decisions and evaluate our performance. We have detailed the non-GAAP adjustments that we make in our non-GAAP definitions below. The adjustments generally fall within the following categories: acquisition & divestiture activities, gains and losses on intangible asset sales and non-cash impairments, major program restructuring activities, constant currency and related adjustments, major program financing and hedging activities and other major items affecting comparability of operating results. We believe the non-GAAP measures should always be considered along with the related U.S. GAAP financial measures. We have provided the reconciliations between the GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures below, and we also discuss our underlying GAAP results throughout our Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations in this Form 10-K. Our primary non-GAAP financial measures are listed below and reflect how we evaluate our current and prior-year operating results. As new events or circumstances arise, these definitions could change. When our definitions change, we provide the updated definitions and present the related non-GAAP historical results on a comparable basis. • “Organic Net Revenue” is defined as net revenues excluding the impacts of acquisitions, divestitures (1), our historical global coffee business (2), our historical Venezuelan operations, accounting calendar changes and currency rate fluctuations (3). We also evaluate Organic Net Revenue growth from emerging markets and our Power Brands. • Our emerging markets include our Latin America region in its entirety; the AMEA region, excluding Australia, New Zealand and Japan; and the following countries from the Europe region: Russia, Ukraine, Turkey, Kazakhstan, Belarus, Georgia, Poland, Czech Republic, Slovak Republic, Hungary, Bulgaria, Romania, the Baltics and the East Adriatic countries. • Our Power Brands include some of our largest global and regional brands such as Oreo, Chips Ahoy!, Ritz, TUC / Club Social and belVita biscuits; Cadbury Dairy Milk, Milka and Lacta chocolate; Trident gum; Hall’s candy; and Tang powdered beverages. • “Adjusted Operating Income” is defined as operating income excluding the impacts of Spin-Off Costs (4); the 2012-2014 Restructuring Program (5); the 2014-2018 Restructuring Program (5); Venezuela remeasurement and deconsolidation losses and historical operating results; gains or losses (including non-cash impairment charges) on goodwill and intangible assets; divestiture (1) or acquisition gains or losses and related integration and acquisition costs; the JDE coffee business transactions (2) gain and net incremental costs; the operating results of divestitures (1); our historical global coffee business operating results (2); mark-to-market impacts from commodity and forecasted currency transaction derivative contracts (6); and equity method investment earnings historically reported within operating income (7). We also present “Adjusted Operating Income margin,” which is subject to the same adjustments as Adjusted Operating Income. We also evaluate growth in our Adjusted Operating Income on a constant currency basis (3). • “Adjusted EPS” is defined as diluted EPS attributable to Mondelēz International from continuing operations excluding the impacts of Spin-Off Costs (4); the 2012-2014 Restructuring Program (5); the 2014-2018 Restructuring Program (5); Venezuela remeasurement and deconsolidation losses and historical operating results; losses on debt extinguishment and related expenses; gains or losses (including non-cash impairment charges) on goodwill and intangible assets; divestiture (1) or acquisition gains or losses and related integration and acquisition costs; the JDE coffee business transactions (2) gain, transaction hedging gains or losses and net incremental costs; gain on the equity method investment exchange; net earnings from divestitures (1); mark-to-market impacts from commodity and forecasted currency transaction derivative contracts (6); and gains or losses on interest rate swaps no longer designated as accounting cash flow hedges due to changed financing and hedging plans. Similarly, within Adjusted EPS, our equity method investment net earnings exclude our proportionate share of our investees’ unusual or infrequent items (8), such as acquisition and divestiture-related costs and restructuring program costs. We also evaluate growth in our Adjusted EPS on a constant currency basis (3). 50 Table of Contents (1) Divestitures include completed sales of businesses and exits of major product lines upon completion of a sale or licensing agreement. (2) In connection with the JDE coffee business transactions that closed on July 2, 2015, because we exchanged our coffee interests for similarly-sized coffee interests in JDE at the time of the transaction, we have deconsolidated and not included our historical global coffee business results within divestitures in our non-GAAP financial measures and in the related Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. We continue to have an ongoing interest in the coffee business and as such, we include the earnings of JDE, Keurig and our historical coffee business within continuing results of operations. Within Adjusted EPS, we included these earnings with equity method investment earnings and deconsolidated our historical coffee business results from Organic Net Revenue and Adjusted Operating Income to facilitate comparisons of past and future coffee operating results. (3) Constant currency operating results are calculated by dividing or multiplying, as appropriate, the current-period local currency operating results by the currency exchange rates used to translate the financial statements in the comparable prior-year period to determine what the current-period U.S. dollar operating results would have been if the currency exchange rate had not changed from the comparable prior-year period. (4) Refer to Note 2, Divestitures and Acquisitions – Spin-Off of Kraft Foods Group, to the consolidated financial statements for more information on Spin-Off Costs incurred in connection with the October 1, 2012 spin-off of the Kraft Foods Group grocery business. (5) Non-GAAP adjustments related to the 2014-2018 Restructuring Program and the 2012-2014 Restructuring Program reflect costs incurred that relate to the objectives of our program to transform our supply chain network and organizational structure. Costs that do not meet the program objectives are not reflected in the non-GAAP adjustments. (6) During the third quarter of 2016, we began to exclude unrealized gains and losses (mark-to-market impacts) from outstanding commodity and forecasted currency transaction derivatives from our non-GAAP earnings measures until such time that the related exposures impact our operating results. Since we purchase commodity and forecasted currency transaction contracts to mitigate price volatility primarily for inventory requirements in future periods, we made this adjustment to remove the volatility of these future inventory purchases on current operating results to facilitate comparisons of our underlying operating performance across periods. We also discontinued designating commodity and forecasted currency transaction derivatives for hedge accounting treatment. To facilitate comparisons of our underlying operating results, we have recast all historical non-GAAP earnings measures to exclude the mark-to-market impacts. (7) Historically, we have recorded income from equity method investments within our operating income as these investments operated as extensions of our base business. Beginning in the third quarter of 2015, we began to record the earnings from our equity method investments in after-tax equity method investment earnings outside of operating income following the deconsolidation of our coffee business. See Note 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies – Principles of Consolidation, for more information. In periods prior to July 2, 2015, we have reclassified the equity method earnings from our Adjusted Operating Income to after-tax equity method investment earnings within Adjusted EPS to be consistent with the deconsolidation of our coffee business results on July 2, 2015 and in order to evaluate our operating results on a consistent basis. (8) We have excluded our proportionate share of our equity method investees’ unusual or infrequent items in order to provide investors with a comparable view of our performance across periods. Although we have shareholder rights and board representation commensurate with our ownership interests in our equity method investees and review the underlying operating results and unusual or infrequent items with them each reporting period, we do not have direct control over their operations or resulting revenue and expenses. Our use of equity method investment net earnings on an adjusted basis is not intended to imply that we have any such control. Our GAAP “diluted EPS attributable to Mondelēz International from continuing operations” includes all of the investees’ unusual and infrequent items. We believe that the presentation of these non-GAAP financial measures, when considered together with our U.S. GAAP financial measures and the reconciliations to the corresponding U.S. GAAP financial measures, provides you with a more complete understanding of the factors and trends affecting our business than could be obtained absent these disclosures. Because non-GAAP financial measures vary among companies, the non-GAAP financial measures presented in this report may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies. Our use of these non-GAAP financial measures is not meant to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for any U.S. GAAP financial measure. A limitation of these non-GAAP financial measures is they exclude items detailed below that have an impact on our U.S. GAAP reported results. The best way this limitation can be addressed is by evaluating our non-GAAP financial measures in combination with our U.S. GAAP reported results and carefully evaluating the following tables that reconcile U.S. GAAP reported figures to the non-GAAP financial measures in this Form 10-K. 51 Table of Contents Organic Net Revenue: Applying the definition of “Organic Net Revenue”, the adjustments made to “net revenues” (the most comparable U.S. GAAP financial measure) were to exclude the impact of currency, our historical Venezuelan operations, the adjustment for deconsolidating our historical coffee business, an accounting calendar change, acquisitions and divestiture. We believe that Organic Net Revenue reflects the underlying growth from the ongoing activities of our business and provides improved comparability of results. We also evaluate our Organic Net Revenue growth from emerging markets and Power Brands, and these underlying measures are also reconciled to U.S. GAAP below.

(3) Each year we reevaluate our Power Brands and confirm the brands in which we will continue to make disproportionate investments. As such, we may make changes in our planned investments in primarily regional Power Brands following our annual review cycles. For 2016, we made limited changes to our list of regional Power Brands and as such, we reclassified 2015 and 2014 Power Brand net revenues on a basis consistent with the current list of Power Brands. 53 Table of Contents Adjusted Operating Income: Applying the definition of “Adjusted Operating Income”, the adjustments made to “operating income” (the most comparable U.S. GAAP financial measure) were to exclude Spin-Off costs, 2012-2014 Restructuring Program costs, 2014-2018 Restructuring Program costs, Venezuela historical operating results and remeasurement and deconsolidation losses, the JDE coffee business transactions gain and net incremental costs, operating income from our historical coffee business, equity method investment earnings reclassified to after-tax earnings in Q3 2015 in connection with the coffee business transactions, operating results of the AGF divestiture, pre-tax gains on the AGF and Costa Rica confectionery business divestitures, divestiture-related costs incurred for the planned sale of a confectionery business in France, gain on sale of an intangible asset, impairment charges related to intangible assets, the Integration Program and other acquisition integration costs, acquisition-related costs and mark-to-market impacts from commodity and forecasted currency transaction derivative contracts.

We monitor and manage these exposures as part of our overall risk management program. Our risk management program focuses on the unpredictability of financial markets and seeks to reduce the potentially adverse effects that the volatility of these markets may have on our operating results. We principally utilize derivative instruments to reduce significant, unanticipated earnings fluctuations that may arise from volatility in currency exchange rates, commodity prices and interest rates. For additional information on our derivative activity and the types of derivative instruments we use to hedge our currency exchange, commodity price and interest rate exposures, see Note 8, Financial Instruments. Many of our non-U.S. subsidiaries operate in functional currencies other than the U.S. dollar. Fluctuations in currency exchange rates create volatility in our reported results as we translate the balance sheets, operating results and cash flows of these subsidiaries into the U.S. dollar for consolidated reporting purposes. The translation of non-U.S. dollar denominated balance sheets and statements of earnings of our subsidiaries into the U.S. dollar for consolidated reporting generally results in a cumulative translation adjustment to other comprehensive income within equity. A stronger U.S. dollar relative to other functional currencies adversely affects our consolidated earnings and net assets while a weaker U.S. dollar benefits our consolidated earnings and net assets. While we hedge significant forecasted currency exchange transactions as well as certain net assets of non-U.S. operations and other currency impacts, we cannot fully predict or eliminate volatility arising from changes in currency exchange rates on our consolidated financial results. See Consolidated Results of Operations and Results of Operations by Reportable Segment under Discussion and Analysis of Historical Results for currency exchange effects on our financial results. For additional information on the impact of currency policies, Brexit, recent currency devaluations, the deconsolidation of our Venezuelan operation and the historical remeasurement of our Venezuelan net monetary assets on our financial condition and results of operations, also see Note 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies—Currency Translation and Highly Inflationary Accounting. We also continually monitor the market for commodities that we use in our products. Input costs may fluctuate widely due to international demand, weather conditions, government policy and regulation and unforeseen conditions. To manage input cost volatility, we enter into forward purchase agreements and other derivative financial instruments. We also pursue productivity and cost saving measures and take pricing actions when necessary to mitigate the impact of higher input costs on earnings. We regularly evaluate our variable and fixed-rate debt as well as current and expected interest rates in the markets in which we raise capital. Our primary exposures include movements in U.S. Treasury rates, corporate credit spreads, London Interbank Offered Rates (“LIBOR”), Euro Interbank Offered Rate (“EURIBOR”) and commercial paper rates. We periodically use interest rate swaps and forward interest rate contracts to achieve a desired proportion of variable versus fixed rate debt based on current and projected market conditions. In addition to using interest rate derivatives to manage future interest payments, during 2016, we retired $6.2 billion of our long-term debt and related costs and issued $6.4 billion of lower borrowing cost debt. Our weighted-average interest rate on our total debt as of December 31, 2016 was 2.2%, down from 3.7% as of December 31, 2015. There were no significant changes in the types of derivative instruments we use to hedge our exposures between December 31, 2015 and December 31, 2016. See Note 8, Financial Instruments, for more information on 2016 derivative activity. Value at Risk: We use a value at risk (“VAR”) computation to estimate: 1) the potential one-day loss in the fair value of our interest rate-sensitive financial instruments; and 2) the potential one-day loss in pre-tax earnings of our currency and commodity price-sensitive derivative financial instruments. The VAR analysis was done separately for our currency exchange, fixed income and commodity risk portfolios as of each quarter end during the periods presented below. The instruments included in the VAR computation were currency exchange forwards and options for currency exchange risk, debt and swaps for interest rate risk, and commodity forwards, futures and options for commodity risk. Excluded from the computation were anticipated transactions, currency trade payables and receivables, and net investments in non-U.S. subsidiaries, which the above-mentioned instruments are intended to hedge. 58 Table of Contents The VAR model assumes normal market conditions, a 95% confidence interval and a one-day holding period. A parametric delta-gamma approximation technique was used to determine the expected return distribution in interest rates, currencies and commodity prices for the purpose of calculating the fixed income, currency exchange and commodity VAR, respectively. The parameters used for estimating the expected return distributions were determined by observing interest rate, currency exchange, and commodity price movements over the prior quarter for the calculation of VAR amounts at December 31, 2016 and 2015, and over each of the four prior quarters for the calculation of average VAR amounts during each year. The values of currency and commodity options do not change on a one-to-one basis with the underlying currency or commodity and were valued accordingly in the VAR computation. As of December 31, 2016 and December 31, 2015, the estimated potential one-day loss in fair value of our interest rate-sensitive instruments, primarily debt, and the estimated potential one-day loss in pre-tax earnings from our currency and commodity instruments, as calculated in the VAR model, were: Pre-Tax Earnings Impact Fair Value Impact At 12/31/16 Average High Low At 12/31/16 Average High Low (in millions) Instruments sensitive to: Interest rates $ 62 $ 62 $ 91 $ 45 Foreign currency rates $ 10 $ 18 $ 26 $ 10 Commodity prices 16 12 16 10 Pre-Tax Earnings Impact Fair Value Impact At 12/31/15 Average High Low At 12/31/15 Average High Low (in millions) Instruments sensitive to: Interest rates $ 56 $ 60 $ 78 $ 50 Foreign currency rates $ 16 $ 55 $ 103 $ 16 Commodity prices 15 23 31 15 The impacts in the 2015 tables above have not been recast to reflect the deconsolidation of our legacy coffee business or Venezuela business and the related derivative activity for those businesses as it is impracticable to do so. This VAR computation is a risk analysis tool designed to statistically estimate the maximum expected daily loss, under the specified confidence interval and assuming normal market conditions, from adverse movements in interest rates, currency exchange rates and commodity prices. The computation does not represent actual losses in fair value or earnings we will incur, nor does it consider the effect of favorable changes in market rates. We cannot predict actual future movements in market rates and do not present these VAR results to be indicative of future movements in market rates or to be representative of any actual impact that future changes in market rates may have on our future financial results. 59 Table of Contents",2023-12-30 19:01:11.874449
1103982,MDLZ,"Mondelez International, Inc.",2018,"Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. The following discussion and analysis contains forward-looking statements. It should be read in conjunction with the other sections of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, including the consolidated financial statements and related notes contained in Item 8, Forward-Looking Statements and Item 1A, Risk Factors. Description of the Company We manufacture and market primarily snack food products, including biscuits (cookies, crackers and salted snacks), chocolate, gum & candy and various cheese & grocery products, as well as powdered beverage products. We have operations in more than 80 countries and sell our products in approximately 160 countries. We aim to deliver strong, profitable long-term growth by accelerating our core snacks business and expanding the reach of our Power Brands globally. To fuel investments in our Power Brands and global and digital reach, we have been working to optimize our cost structure. These efforts include reinventing our supply chain operations and aggressively managing overhead costs. Through these actions, we’re leveraging our brands, platforms and capabilities to drive long-term value and return on investment for our shareholders. U.S. Tax Reform On December 22, 2017, the United States enacted tax reform legislation that included a broad range of business tax provisions, including but not limited to a reduction in the U.S. federal tax rate from 35% to 21% as well as provisions that limit or eliminate various deductions or credits. The legislation also causes U.S. allocated expenses (e.g. interest and general administrative expenses) to be taxed and imposes a new tax on U.S. cross-border payments. Furthermore, the legislation includes a one-time transition tax on accumulated foreign earnings and profits. In response to the enactment of U.S. tax reform, the SEC issued guidance to address the complexity in accounting for this new legislation. When the initial accounting for items under the new legislation is incomplete, the guidance allows us to recognize provisional amounts when reasonable estimates can be made or to continue to apply the prior tax law if a reasonable estimate of the impact cannot be made. The SEC has provided up to a one-year window for companies to finalize the accounting for the impacts of this new legislation and we anticipate finalizing our accounting during 2018. While our accounting for the new U.S. tax legislation is not complete, we have made reasonable estimates for some provisions and recognized a $59 million discrete net tax benefit in our 2017 financial statements. This net benefit is primarily comprised of a $1,311 million provisional deferred tax benefit from revaluing our net U.S. deferred tax liabilities to reflect the new U.S. corporate tax rate as well as an additional $61 million provisional deferred tax benefit related to changes in our indefinite reinvestment assertion, partially offset by a $1,317 million provisional charge for the estimated transition tax. However, as of the date of this Form 10-K, we are continuing to evaluate the accounting impacts of the legislation, as we continue to assemble and analyze all the information required to prepare and analyze these effects and await additional guidance from the U.S. Treasury Department, the IRS or other standard-setting bodies. Additionally, we continue to analyze other information and regulatory guidance, and accordingly we may record additional provisional amounts or adjustments to provisional amounts in future periods. See Note 14, Income Taxes, for further details on the impacts of U.S. tax reform. Malware Incident On June 27, 2017, a global malware incident impacted our business. The malware affected a significant portion of our global sales, distribution and financial networks. In the last four days of the second quarter and during the third quarter, we executed business continuity and contingency plans to contain the impact, minimize damages and restore our systems environment. To date, we have not found, nor do we expect to find, any instances of Company or personal data released externally. We have now restored our main operating systems and processes as well as enhanced our system security. 24 Table of Contents During 2017, we estimate that the loss of revenue as a result of the malware incident had a negative impact of 0.4% on our net revenue and Organic Net Revenue growth. We also incurred incremental expenses of $84 million predominantly during the second half of 2017 as part of the recovery effort. We believe the recovery from this incident is largely resolved, and we do not expect significant ongoing impacts or incremental expenses from this incident in future periods. We also continue to make progress on our efforts to strengthen our security measures and mitigate cybersecurity risk. Refer to our Risk Factors section for a discussion of potential risks to our operations from cybersecurity threats. Coffee Business Transactions JDE Coffee Business Transactions: On July 2, 2015, we completed transactions to combine our wholly owned coffee businesses with those of D.E Master Blenders 1753 B.V. to create a new company, Jacob Douwe Egberts (“JDE”). In connection with these transactions, in 2015, we recorded a final pre-tax gain of $6.8 billion ($6.6 billion after-tax) from the deconsolidation of our legacy coffee businesses. We also recorded approximately $1.0 billion of cumulative pre-tax net gains ($436 million in 2015 and $628 million in 2014) and cash related to currency hedging. See Note 2, Divestitures and Acquisitions—JDE Coffee Business Transactions, for additional details. As further described below, in March 2016, we exchanged a portion of our investment in JDE for an investment in Keurig Green Mountain Inc. (“Keurig”). As of December 31, 2017, we hold a 26.5% voting interest, a 26.4% ownership interest and a 26.2% profit and dividend sharing interest in JDE. We recorded JDE equity earnings of $129 million in 2017 and $100 million in 2016 and equity losses of $58 million in 2015. We also recorded $49 million of cash dividends received during the first quarter of 2017. Keurig Transaction: Following the March 3, 2016 Acorn Holdings B.V. acquisition of Keurig, on March 7, 2016, we exchanged a portion of our equity interest in JDE for an interest in Keurig valued at $2.0 billion. We recorded the difference between the fair value of the Keurig interest and our basis in JDE shares as a $43 million gain. Following the exchange, our ownership interest in JDE became 26.5% and we owned a 24.2% interest in Keurig. Our initial $2.0 billion investment in Keurig includes a $1.6 billion Keurig equity interest and a $0.4 billion shareholder loan receivable, which are reported on a combined basis within equity method investments on our consolidated balance sheet. The shareholder loan has a 5.5% interest rate and is payable at the end of a seven-year term on February 27, 2023. We recorded Keurig equity earnings of $208 million in 2017 (of which, approximately $119 million relates to the provisional tax benefit Keurig recorded as a result of U.S. tax reform), and $77 million in 2016. We recorded shareholder loan interest of $24 million in 2017 and $20 million in 2016. Additionally, we received shareholder loan interest payments of $30 million in 2017 and $14 million in 2016 and dividends of $14 million in 2017 and $4 million in 2016. See Note 2, Divestitures and Acquisitions, for additional details on the Keurig transaction. Planned Keurig Dr Pepper Transaction: On January 29, 2018, we announced that we would exchange our ownership interest in Keurig for equity in Keurig Dr Pepper, which is contingent upon the successful completion of a planned merger of Keurig with Dr Pepper Snapple Group, Inc. Following the close of the merger in mid-2018, we expect our ownership in Keurig Dr Pepper to be 13-14%. We expect to account for this new investment under the equity method as we have for Keurig, resulting in our recognizing our share of their earnings within our earnings and our share of their dividends within our cash flows. We will have the right to nominate two directors to the board of Keurig Dr Pepper and will have certain governance rights over Keurig Dr Pepper following the transaction. Venezuela Deconsolidation Effective as of the close of the 2015 fiscal year, we deconsolidated our Venezuelan subsidiaries due to a loss of control over our Venezuelan operations and an other-than-temporary lack of currency exchangeability. We recorded a $778 million pretax loss on December 31, 2015 as we reduced the value of our investment in Venezuela and all Venezuelan receivables held by our other subsidiaries to realizable fair value, resulting in full impairment. As of the start of 2016, we no longer included net revenues, earnings or net assets of our Venezuelan subsidiaries within our GAAP consolidated financial statements and we excluded Venezuela from our non-GAAP results for all historical periods presented to facilitate comparisons of operating results. See Note 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies – Currency Translation and Highly Inflationary Accounting: Venezuela, for more information on our Venezuela operations, including currency remeasurement losses and the loss on deconsolidation. 25 Table of Contents Summary of Results • Net revenues were approximately $25.9 billion in both 2017 and 2016, a decrease of 0.1% in 2017 and a decrease of 12.5% in 2016. Business deconsolidations and divestitures reduced net revenues during 2015-2017, with net revenues in 2016 most significantly affected by the deconsolidations of our historical coffee business and Venezuelan operations in 2015 as well as significant unfavorable currency translation impacts in 2016 and 2015. • Organic Net Revenue increased 0.9% to $25.5 billion in 2017 and increased 1.5% to $26.4 billion in 2016. Organic Net Revenue is on a constant currency basis and excludes revenue from deconsolidated coffee and Venezuelan operations, divestitures and an acquisition. We use Organic Net Revenue as it provides improved year-over-year comparability of our underlying operating results (see the definition of Organic Net Revenue and our reconciliation with net revenues within Non-GAAP Financial Measures appearing later in this section). • Diluted EPS attributable to Mondelēz International increased 81.9% to $1.91 in 2017 and decreased 76.4% to $1.05 in 2016. Diluted EPS increased in 2017 as prior-year refinancing and higher restructuring activities drove lower interest and overhead costs in 2017. We also recorded benefits from resolving two local indirect tax matters and gains from divesting non-core businesses during 2017. Diluted EPS was significantly lower in 2016 primarily as a result of the $6.8 billion gain recorded in 2015 in connection with the JDE coffee business transactions as well as a number of other significant items that affected the comparability of our reported results. See our Discussion and Analysis of Historical Results appearing later in this section for further details. • Adjusted EPS increased 15.1% to $2.14 in 2017 and increased 21.6% to $1.86 in 2016. On a constant currency basis, Adjusted EPS increased 14.5% to $2.13 in 2017 and increased 25.5% to $1.92 in 2016. Lower manufacturing costs and overhead costs, driven by strong productivity efforts, were significant drivers of Adjusted EPS growth in both years. Adjusted EPS and Adjusted EPS on a constant currency basis are non-GAAP financial measures. We use these measures as they provide improved year-over-year comparability of our underlying results (see the definition of Adjusted EPS and our reconciliation with diluted EPS within Non-GAAP Financial Measures appearing later in this section). Financial Outlook We seek to achieve profitable, long-term growth and manage our business to attain this goal using our key operating metrics: Organic Net Revenue, Adjusted Operating Income and Adjusted EPS. We use these non-GAAP financial metrics and related computations such as margins internally to evaluate and manage our business and to plan and make near-and long-term operating and strategic decisions. As such, we believe these metrics are useful to investors as they provide supplemental information in addition to our U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (“U.S. GAAP”) financial results. We believe providing investors with the same financial information that we use internally ensures that investors have the same data to make comparisons of our historical operating results, identify trends in our underlying operating results and gain additional insight and transparency on how we evaluate our business. We believe our non-GAAP financial measures should always be considered in relation to our GAAP results and we have provided reconciliations between our GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures within Non-GAAP Financial Measures appearing later in this section. In addition to monitoring our key operating metrics, we monitor a number of developments and trends that could impact our revenue and profitability objectives. Long-Term Demographics and Consumer Trends – Snack food consumption is highly correlated to GDP growth, urbanization of populations and rising discretionary income levels associated with a growing middle class, particularly in emerging markets. Over the long term, we expect these trends to continue leading to growth in consumer behaviors such as more frequent, smaller meals, snacking and greater use of convenience foods. We also recognize changing consumer trends such as the increased emphasis on well-being, time compression and wide participation across an evolving retail and digital landscape. To position ourselves for long-term growth, we are investing in our well-being and other snack offerings, product and marketing innovation and new routes to market including e-commerce. 26 Table of Contents Demand – We monitor consumer spending and our market share within the food and beverage categories in which we sell our products. In recent years, low GDP growth, economic recessionary pressures, weak consumer confidence, a historically strong U.S. dollar and changing consumer trends have slowed category and our net revenue growth. While we have begun to see some improvements in global economic growth and a weaker U.S. dollar in 2017, there are still geopolitical and economic uncertainties, and category growth continues to be soft. Growth in our global snacking categories (excluding Venezuela) decreased from approximately 3.4% in 2015 and 2.4% in 2016 to 2.1% in 2017. We continue to make investments in our brand and snacks portfolio, while building strong routes to market to address the needs of consumers in emerging and developed markets. In doing so, we anticipate driving demand in our categories and growing our position in these markets. Volatility of Global Markets – Our growth strategy depends in part on our ability to expand our operations, particularly in emerging markets. Some emerging markets have greater political, economic and currency volatility and greater vulnerability to infrastructure and labor disruptions than more established markets. Volatility in these markets affects demand for and the costs of our products and requires frequent changes in how we operate our business. Refer to Note 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies—Venezuela, for further discussion of these issues and their impacts on our Venezuela operations. We expect continued volatility across our markets, particularly emerging markets. As such, we are focused on investing in our global Power Brands and routes to market while we protect our margins through the management of costs and pricing. Competition – We operate in highly competitive markets that include global, regional and local competitors. Our advantaged geographic footprint, operating scale and portfolio of brands have all significantly contributed to building our market-leading positions across most of the product categories in which we sell. To grow and maintain our market positions, we focus on meeting consumer needs and preferences through new product innovations and product quality. We also continue to optimize our manufacturing and other operations and invest in our brands through ongoing research and development, advertising, marketing and consumer promotions. Pricing – We adjust our product prices based on a number of variables including demand, the competitive environment and changes in our product input costs. Our net revenue growth and profitability may be affected as we adjust prices to address new conditions. Over 2015-2017, we generally increased prices in response to higher commodity costs, currency and other market factors. In 2018, we anticipate changing market conditions to continue to impact pricing. Price competition may continue to affect net revenues or market share in the near term as the market adjusts to changes in input costs and other market conditions. Operating Costs – Our operating costs include raw materials, labor, selling, general and administrative expenses, taxes, currency impacts and financing costs. We manage these costs through cost saving and productivity initiatives, sourcing and hedging programs, pricing actions, refinancing and tax planning. We continue to renegotiate collective bargaining agreements covering eight U.S. facilities that expired beginning in February 2016. We have plans to ensure business continuity during the renegotiations. To remain competitive on our operating structure, we continue to work on programs to expand our profitability and margins, such as our 2014-2018 Restructuring Program, which is designed to bring about significant reductions in our operating cost structure in both our supply chain and overhead costs. Effective on October 1, 2016, we also integrated our EEMEA region operations into our Europe and Asia Pacific operating segments. This change had a favorable impact on our operating performance due to greater leverage of our European and AMEA regional businesses and resulting cost structure. Taxes – While the 2017 U.S. tax reform reduced the U.S. corporate tax rate and included beneficial depreciation provisions, other provisions could have an adverse effect on our results. Specifically, new provisions that cause U.S. allocated expenses (e.g. interest and general administrative expenses) to be taxed and impose a tax on U.S. cross-border payments could adversely impact our effective tax rate. We will continue to evaluate the impacts as additional guidance on implementing the legislation becomes available. 27 Table of Contents Currency – As a global company with 75.8% of our net revenues generated outside the United States, we are continually exposed to changes in global economic conditions and currency movements. In 2017, the U.S. dollar began to weaken relative to other currencies in which we operate, while in 2015 and 2016, the U.S. dollar generally was stronger as a number of countries experienced significant declines in or devaluations of their currency. The currency movements created volatility in our reported results of operations. Unfavorable currency translation impacts were 12.6 percentage points (or 12.0 percentage points excluding currency impacts related to Venezuela) of the 13.5% net revenue decrease in 2015 and 4.6 percentage points of the 12.5% net revenue decrease in 2016. In 2017, the 0.1% net revenue decrease reflected 0.3 percentage points of favorable currency translation impacts as the U.S. dollar generally weakened against a number of currencies this past year. As currency movements can make comparisons of year-over-year operating performance challenging, we isolate the impact of currency and also report growth on a constant currency basis, holding prior-year currency exchange rates constant, so that prior-year and current-year results can be compared on a consistent basis. Historically, we have also been exposed to currency devaluation risks impacting earnings particularly, but not only, in connection with our Venezuela operations that were deconsolidated at the close of the 2015 fiscal year. In the months following the Brexit vote in June 2016, there was significant volatility in the global stock markets and currency exchange rates. The value of the British pound sterling relative to the U.S. dollar declined significantly and negatively affected our translated results reported in U.S. dollars. In December 2017, the European Union and United Kingdom agreed to begin trade negotiations, and we could experience additional volatility in the British pound sterling as the Brexit negotiations move forward. To partially offset the translation of certain of our overseas operations, including the United Kingdom, we enter into net investment hedges primarily in the form of local currency denominated debt and cross-currency swaps and other financial instruments. We generally do not hedge against currency translation and primarily seek to hedge against economic losses on cross-currency transactions. Due to limited markets for hedging currency transactions and other factors, we may not be able to effectively hedge all of our cross-currency transaction risks. Local economies, monetary policies and currency hedging availability can affect our ability to hedge against currency-related economic losses. While we work to mitigate our exposure to currency risks, factors such as continued global and local market volatility, actions by foreign governments, political uncertainty, limited hedging opportunities and other factors could lead to unfavorable currency impacts in the future. We monitor currency-related risks and economies at risk of qualifying for highly inflationary accounting under U.S. GAAP, such as Argentina and Ukraine. While we work to safeguard our business, currency devaluations could adversely affect future demand for our products, our financial results and operations, and our relationships with customers, suppliers and employees in the short or long-term. We may not be able to fully offset the increased risks related to currency devaluations and Brexit, which could impact profitability should the currency-related conditions continue. See Note 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies – Currency Translation and Highly Inflationary Accounting, and Note 8, Financial Instruments, for additional information. Financing Costs – We regularly evaluate our variable and fixed-rate debt. We continue to use low-cost, short- and long-term debt to finance our ongoing working capital, capital expenditures and other investments, dividends and share repurchases. We also expect to use existing cash or short-term borrowings to finance the estimated $1.3 billion U.S. tax reform transition tax liability payable through 2026. During 2017, we retired $1.5 billion of long-term debt and issued lower-cost, short-term commercial paper and long-term Swiss franc debt. During 2016, we retired $6.2 billion of our long-term debt and issued lower-cost, long-term euro, Swiss franc and U.S. dollar-denominated debt. Our weighted-average interest rate on our total debt as of December 31, 2017 was 2.1%, down from 2.2% as of December 31, 2016 and down from 3.7% as of December 31, 2015. We also continue to use interest rate swaps and other financial instruments to manage our exposure to interest rate and cash flow variability, protect the value of our existing currency assets and liabilities and protect the value of our debt. For example, through February 8, 2018, we entered into cross-currency interest rate swaps and forwards with an aggregate notional value of $3.2 billion to hedge our non-U.S. net investments against adverse movements in exchange rates. We designated these swaps and forwards as net investment hedges related to our operations in our Europe and AMEA regions. We expect a favorable impact on our prospective financing costs as we reduce some of the financing costs and related currency impacts within our interest costs. Refer to Note 7, Debt and Borrowing Arrangements, and Note 8, Financial Instruments, for additional information on our debt and derivative activity. 28 Table of Contents Discussion and Analysis of Historical Results Items Affecting Comparability of Financial Results The following table includes significant income or (expense) items that affected the comparability of our results of operations and our effective tax rates.

Power Brands net revenues increased 2.9%, including a favorable currency impact, and Power Brands Organic Net Revenue increased 2.1%. Emerging markets net revenues increased 3.7%, including a favorable currency impact, and emerging markets Organic Net Revenue increased 3.6%. The underlying changes in net revenues and Organic Net Revenue are detailed below: 2017 Change in net revenues (by percentage point) Total change in net revenues (0.1)% Add back the following items affecting comparability: Favorable currency (0.3)pp Impact of acquisition (0.2)pp Impact of divestitures 1.5pp Total change in Organic Net Revenue (1) 0.9% Higher net pricing 1.5pp Unfavorable volume/mix (0.6)pp (1) Please see the Non-GAAP Financial Measures section at the end of this item. Net revenue decline of 0.1% was driven by the impact of divestitures, partially offset by our underlying Organic Net Revenue growth of 0.9%, favorable currency and the impact of an acquisition. The impact of divestitures resulted in a year-over-year decline in net revenues of $383 million for 2017. Our underlying Organic Net Revenue increase was driven by higher net pricing, partially offset by unfavorable volume/mix. Net pricing was up, which includes the benefit of carryover pricing from 2016 as well as the effects of input cost-driven pricing actions taken during 2017. Higher net pricing was reflected in Latin America and AMEA, partially offset by lower net pricing in North America and Europe. Unfavorable volume/mix was reflected in all segments except Europe, in part due to expected shipments that we did not realize following the second quarter malware incident. Favorable year-over-year currency impacts increased net revenues by $77 million, due primarily to the strength of several currencies relative to the U.S. dollar, including the Brazilian real, euro, Russian ruble, Australian dollar, Indian rupee and South African rand, partially offset by the strength of the U.S. dollar relative to several currencies, including the Egyptian pound, British pound sterling, Argentinean peso, Nigerian naira, Turkish lira, Philippine peso and Chinese yuan. The November 2, 2016 acquisition of a business and license to manufacture, market and sell Cadbury-branded biscuits in additional key markets added $59 million (constant currency basis) of incremental net revenues for 2017. 30 Table of Contents Operating Income – Operating income increased $937 million (36.5%) to $3,506 million in 2017, Adjusted Operating Income (1) increased $376 million (9.9%) to $4,178 million and Adjusted Operating Income on a constant currency basis (1) increased $376 million (9.9%) to $4,178 million due to the following: Operating Income Change (in millions) Operating Income for the Year Ended December 31, 2016 $ 2,569 2014-2018 Restructuring Program costs (2) 1,086 Intangible asset impairment charges (3) 137 Mark-to-market losses from derivatives (4) 94 Acquisition integration costs (5) 7 Acquisition-related costs (5) 1 Divestiture-related costs (6) 86 Operating income from divestitures (6) (153 ) Gain on divestiture (6) (9 ) Gain on sale of intangible assets (7) (15 ) Other/rounding (1 ) Adjusted Operating Income (1) for the Year Ended December 31, 2016 $ 3,802 Higher net pricing 370 Higher input costs (173 ) Unfavorable volume/mix (160 ) Lower selling, general and administrative expenses 405 Gains on sales of property in 2016 (8) (46 ) VAT-related settlement in 2016 (54 ) Property insurance recovery 27 Impact from acquisition (8) 8 Other (1 ) Total change in Adjusted Operating Income (constant currency) (1) 376 9.9% Currency translation – Total change in Adjusted Operating Income (1) 376 9.9% Adjusted Operating Income (1) for the Year Ended December 31, 2017 $ 4,178 2014-2018 Restructuring Program costs (2) (792 ) Intangible asset impairment charges (3) (109 ) Mark-to-market losses from derivatives (4) (96 ) Malware incident incremental expenses (84 ) Acquisition integration costs (5) (3 ) Divestiture-related costs (6) (31 ) Operating income from divestitures (6) 61 Net gain on divestitures (6) 186 Benefits from resolution of tax matters (9) 209 CEO transition remuneration (14 ) Other/rounding 1 Operating Income for the Year Ended December 31, 2017 $ 3,506 36.5% (1) Refer to the Non-GAAP Financial Measures section at the end of this item.

(9) Refer to Note 12, Commitments and Contingencies – Tax Matters, for more information. Primarily includes the reversal of tax liabilities in connection with the resolution of a Brazilian indirect tax matter and settlement of pre-acquisition Cadbury tax matters. During 2017, we realized higher net pricing while input costs increased modestly. Higher net pricing, which included the carryover impact of pricing actions taken in 2016 as well as the effects of input cost-driven pricing actions taken during 2017, was driven by Latin America and AMEA, partially offset by lower net pricing in North America and Europe. The increase in input costs was driven by higher raw material costs which were partially offset by lower manufacturing costs due to productivity. Unfavorable volume/mix was driven by North America, Latin America and AMEA, which was partially offset by favorable volume/mix in Europe. Total selling, general and administrative expenses decreased $629 million from 2016, due to a number of factors noted in the table above, including in part, the benefits from the resolution of tax matters, lower implementation costs incurred for the 2014-2018 Restructuring Program, lower divestiture-related costs, a property insurance recovery in AMEA and lower intangible asset impairment charges. The decreases were partially offset by gains on sales of property in 2016, unfavorable currency impact, Value-added tax (“VAT”) related settlements in 2016 and incremental expenses incurred due to the malware incident. Excluding the factors noted above, selling, general and administrative expenses decreased $405 million from 2016. The decrease was driven primarily by lower overhead costs and lower advertising and consumer promotion costs due to continued cost reduction efforts in both areas. Currency changes during the year did not impact operating income as the strength of the U.S. dollar relative to several currencies, including the Egyptian pound, British pound sterling and Argentinean peso, was offset by the strength of several currencies relative to the U.S. dollar, including the euro, Brazilian real, Russian ruble, Australian dollar, Indian rupee and South African rand. Operating income margin increased from 9.9% in 2016 to 13.5% in 2017. The increase in operating income margin was driven primarily by an increase in our Adjusted Operating Income margin, lower 2014-2018 Restructuring Program costs, the benefits from the resolution of tax matters, the net gain on divestitures and lower divestiture-related costs, partially offset by incremental costs related to the malware incident and CEO transition remuneration costs. Adjusted Operating Income margin increased from 15.0% in 2016 to 16.3% in 2017. The increase in Adjusted Operating Income margin was driven primarily by lower overheads and lower advertising and consumer promotion costs due to continued cost reduction efforts in both areas. 32 Table of Contents Net Earnings and Earnings per Share Attributable to Mondelēz International – Net earnings attributable to Mondelēz International of $2,922 million increased by $1,263 million (76.1%) in 2017.

(3) Please see the Non-GAAP Financial Measures section at the end of this item. 34 Table of Contents Net revenue decline of 12.5% was driven by the impact of the deconsolidation of our historical coffee business, unfavorable currency, the deconsolidation of our historical Venezuelan operations and the year-over-year impact of the 2015 accounting calendar change, partially offset by our underlying Organic Net Revenue growth of 1.5%, and the impact of acquisitions. The adjustment for deconsolidating our historical coffee business resulted in a year-over-year decrease in net revenues of $1,627 million for 2016. Unfavorable currency impacts decreased net revenues by $1,233 million, due primarily to the strength of the U.S. dollar relative to several currencies, including the Argentinean peso, British pound sterling, Mexican peso, Brazilian real, Chinese yuan and Russian ruble. The deconsolidation of our historical Venezuelan operations resulted in a year-over-year decrease in net revenues of $1,217 million for 2016. The North America segment accounting calendar change in 2015 resulted in a year-over-year decrease in net revenues of $76 million for 2016. Our underlying Organic Net Revenue growth was driven by higher net pricing, partially offset by unfavorable volume/mix. Net pricing was up, which includes the benefit of carryover pricing from 2015 as well as the effects of input cost-driven pricing actions taken during 2016. Higher net pricing was reflected in Latin America and AMEA, partially offset by lower net pricing in Europe and North America. Unfavorable volume/mix was reflected in Latin America and AMEA, mostly offset by favorable volume/mix in Europe and North America. Unfavorable volume/mix in Latin America and AMEA was largely due to price elasticity as well as strategic decisions to exit certain low-margin product lines. The impact of acquisitions primarily includes the July 15, 2015 acquisition of a biscuit operation in Vietnam, which added $71 million of incremental net revenues for 2016, and the November 2, 2016 acquisition of a business and a license to manufacture, market and sell Cadbury-branded biscuits in additional key markets, which added $16 million of incremental net revenues for 2016. 35 Table of Contents Operating Income – Operating income decreased $6,328 million (71.1%) to $2,569 million in 2016, Adjusted Operating Income (1) increased $486 million (14.7%) to $3,802 million and Adjusted Operating Income on a constant currency basis (1) increased $657 million (19.8%) to $3,973 million due to the following: OperatingIncome Change (in millions) Operating Income for the Year Ended December 31, 2015 $ 8,897 2012-2014 Restructuring Program costs (2) (4 ) 2014-2018 Restructuring Program costs (2) 1,002 Intangible asset impairment charges (3) 71 Mark-to-market gains from derivatives (4) (56 ) Acquisition integration costs (5) 9 Acquisition-related costs (5) 8 Operating income from divestiture (6) (182 ) Gain on divestiture (6) (13 ) Operating income from Venezuelan subsidiaries (7) (281 ) Remeasurement of net monetary assets in Venezuela (7) 11 Loss on deconsolidation of Venezuela (7) 778 Costs associated with the coffee business transactions (8) 278 Gain on the JDE coffee business transactions (8) (6,809 ) Reclassification of historical coffee business operating income (9) (342 ) Reclassification of equity method investment earnings (10) (51 ) Adjusted Operating Income (1) for the Year Ended December 31, 2015 $ 3,316 Higher net pricing 422 Higher input costs (131 ) Favorable volume/mix 11 Lower selling, general and administrative expenses 318 Gains on sales of property (11) 46 Higher VAT-related settlements 24 Impact from acquisitions (11) 4 Impact of accounting calendar change (12) (36 ) Other (1 ) Total change in Adjusted Operating Income (constant currency) (1) 657 19.8 % Unfavorable currency translation (171 ) Total change in Adjusted Operating Income (1) 486 14.7 % Adjusted Operating Income (1) for the Year Ended December 31, 2016 $ 3,802 2014-2018 Restructuring Program costs (2) (1,086 ) Intangible asset impairment charges (3) (137 ) Mark-to-market losses from derivatives (4) (94 ) Acquisition integration costs (5) (7 ) Acquisition-related costs (5) (1 ) Divestiture-related costs (13) (86 ) Operating income from divestiture (6) 153 Gain on divestiture (6) 9 Gain on sale of intangible assets (14) 15 Other/rounding 1 Operating Income for the Year Ended December 31, 2016 $ 2,569 (71.1 )% (1) Refer to the Non-GAAP Financial Measures section at the end of this item.

Refer to Note 2, Divestitures and Acquisitions, and Non-GAAP Financial Measures appearing later in this section for more information. (10) Historically, we have recorded income from equity method investments within our operating income as these investments operated as extensions of our base business. Beginning in the third quarter of 2015, to align with the accounting for JDE earnings, we began to record the earnings from our equity method investments in after-tax equity method investment earnings outside of operating income. In periods prior to July 2, 2015, we have reclassified the equity method earnings from Adjusted Operating Income to evaluate our operating results on a consistent basis.

During 2016, we realized higher net pricing while input costs increased modestly. Higher net pricing, which included the carryover impact of pricing actions taken in 2015, was reflected in Latin America and AMEA, partially offset by lower net pricing in Europe and North America. The increase in input costs was driven by higher raw material costs, in part due to higher currency exchange transaction costs on imported materials, which were partially offset by lower manufacturing costs due to productivity. Favorable volume/mix was driven by Europe and North America, which was mostly offset by unfavorable volume/mix in Latin America and AMEA. Total selling, general and administrative expenses decreased $1,037 million from 2015, due to a number of factors noted in the table above, including in part, the deconsolidation of our historical coffee business, a favorable currency impact, lower costs associated with the JDE coffee business transactions, the deconsolidation of our Venezuelan operations, gains on the sales of property, VAT-related settlements and the absence of devaluation charges related to our net monetary assets in Venezuela in 2016. The decreases were partially offset by increases from divestiture-related costs associated with the planned sale of a confectionery business in France, the reclassification of equity method investment earnings, higher implementation costs incurred for the 2014-2018 Restructuring Program and the impact of acquisitions. Excluding the factors noted above, selling, general and administrative expenses decreased $318 million from 2015. The decrease was driven primarily by lower overhead costs due to continued cost reduction efforts. We recorded a benefit of $54 million in 2016 from VAT-related settlements in Latin America as compared to $30 million in 2015. Unfavorable currency impacts decreased operating income by $171 million due primarily to the strength of the U.S. dollar relative to most currencies, including the British pound sterling, Argentinean peso and Mexican peso. Operating income margin decreased from 30.0% in 2015 to 9.9% in 2016. The decrease in operating income margin was driven primarily by last year’s pre-tax gain on the JDE coffee business transactions, the deconsolidation of our historical coffee business, the deconsolidation of our Venezuelan operations, the unfavorable year-over-year change in mark-to-market gains/losses from derivatives, higher costs incurred for the 2014-2018 Restructuring Program, divestiture-related costs associated with the planned sale of a confectionery business in France, higher intangible asset impairment charges and the reclassification of equity method earnings. The items that decreased our operating income margin were partially offset by the prior-year loss on the Venezuela deconsolidation, an increase in our Adjusted Operating Income margin and the absence of costs associated with the JDE coffee business transactions. Adjusted Operating Income margin increased from 12.7% in 2015 to 15.0% in 2016. The increase in Adjusted Operating Income margin was driven primarily by lower overheads from cost reduction programs, improved gross margin reflecting productivity efforts, gains on sales of property and VAT-related settlements. 37 Table of Contents Net Earnings and Earnings per Share Attributable to Mondelēz International – Net earnings attributable to Mondelēz International of $1,659 million decreased by $5,608 million (77.2%) in 2016.

Results of Operations by Reportable Segment Our operations and management structure are organized into four reportable operating segments: • Latin America • AMEA • Europe • North America On October 1, 2016, we integrated our EEMEA operating segment into our Europe and Asia Pacific operating segments to further leverage and optimize the operating scale built within the Europe and Asia Pacific regions. Russia, Ukraine, Turkey, Belarus, Georgia and Kazakhstan were combined within our Europe operating segment, while the remaining Middle East and African countries were combined within our Asia Pacific region to form a new AMEA regional operating segment. We have reflected the segment change as if it had occurred in all periods presented. We manage our operations by region to leverage regional operating scale, manage different and changing business environments more effectively and pursue growth opportunities as they arise in our key markets. Our regional management teams have responsibility for the business, product categories and financial results in the regions. Historically, we have recorded income from equity method investments within our operating income as these investments were part of our base business. Beginning in the third quarter of 2015, to align with the accounting for our new coffee equity method investment in JDE, we began to record the earnings from our equity method investments in equity method investment earnings outside of segment operating income. For the six months ended December 31, 2015, after-tax equity method investment net earnings were less than $1 million on a combined basis. Earnings from equity method investments through July 2, 2015 recorded within segment operating income were $52 million in AMEA and $4 million in North America. See Note 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies – Principles of Consolidation, and Note 2, Divestitures and Acquisitions, for additional information. 39 Table of Contents In 2015, we also began to report stock-based compensation for our corporate employees within general corporate expenses that were reported within our North America region. We reclassified $32 million of corporate stock-based compensation expense in 2015 from the North America segment to general corporate expenses. We use segment operating income to evaluate segment performance and allocate resources. We believe it is appropriate to disclose this measure to help investors analyze segment performance and trends. See Note 16, Segment Reporting, for additional information on our segments and Items Affecting Comparability of Financial Results earlier in this section for items affecting our segment operating results. Our segment net revenues and earnings, reflecting our current segment structure for all periods presented, were: For the Years Ended December 31, 2017 2016 2015 (in millions) Net revenues: Latin America (1) $ 3,566 $ 3,392 $ 4,988 AMEA (2) 5,739 5,816 6,002 Europe (2) 9,794 9,755 11,672 North America 6,797 6,960 6,974 Net revenues $ 25,896 $ 25,923 $ 29,636 (1) Net revenues of $1,217 million for 2015 from our Venezuelan subsidiaries are included in our consolidated financial statements.

Refer to Note 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies – Currency Translation and Highly Inflationary Accounting: Venezuela, for more information. (2) On July 2, 2015, we contributed our global coffee businesses primarily from our Europe and AMEA segments. Net revenues of our global coffee business were $1,561 million in Europe and $66 million in AMEA for the year ended December 31, 2015.

Higher net pricing was reflected across all categories driven primarily by Argentina, Brazil and Mexico. Favorable currency impacts were due primarily to the strength of several currencies in the region relative to the U.S. dollar, primarily the Brazilian real, partially offset by the strength of the U.S. dollar relative to the Argentinean peso and Mexican peso. Unfavorable volume/mix, which occurred across most of the region, was largely due to the impact of pricing-related elasticity. In addition, only a portion of the shipments delayed at the end of the second quarter due to the malware incident was recovered. Unfavorable volume/mix was driven by declines in all categories except chocolate and candy. On December 1, 2016, we sold a small confectionery business in Costa Rica. Segment operating income increased $294 million (108.5%), primarily due to higher net pricing, the benefit from the resolution of a Brazilian indirect tax matter of $153 million, lower manufacturing costs, lower costs incurred for the 2014-2018 Restructuring Program, favorable currency and lower advertising and consumer promotion costs. These favorable items were partially offset by higher raw material costs, unfavorable volume/mix and higher other selling, general and administrative expenses (net of prior-year VAT-related settlements). 2016 compared with 2015: Net revenues decreased $1,596 million (32.0%), due to the deconsolidation of our Venezuelan operations (21.9 pp), unfavorable currency (14.8 pp), unfavorable volume/mix (5.3 pp) and the impact of a divestiture (0.1 pp), partially offset by higher net pricing (10.1 pp). The deconsolidation of our Venezuelan operations resulted in a year-over-year decrease in net revenues of $1,217 million. Unfavorable currency impacts were due primarily to the strength of the U.S. dollar relative to most currencies in the region, including the Argentinean peso and Mexican peso. Unfavorable volume/mix, which primarily occurred in Brazil and Argentina, was largely due to the impact of pricing-related elasticity as well as strategic decisions to exit certain low-margin product lines. Unfavorable volume/mix was driven by declines in all categories except for cheese & grocery. Higher net pricing was reflected across all categories driven primarily by Argentina, Brazil and Mexico. Segment operating income decreased $214 million (44.1%), primarily due to higher raw material costs, the deconsolidation of our Venezuelan operations, unfavorable volume/mix and unfavorable currency. These unfavorable items were partially offset by higher net pricing, lower other selling, general and administrative expenses (including higher year-over year VAT-related settlements), lower manufacturing costs, lower advertising and consumer promotion costs, lower costs incurred for the 2014-2018 Restructuring Program and the absence of remeasurement losses in 2016 related to our net monetary assets in Venezuela. 41 Table of Contents AMEA For the Years EndedDecember 31, 2017 2016 $ change % change (in millions) Net revenues $ 5,739 $ 5,816 $ (77) (1.3)% Segment operating income 516 506 10 2.0% For the Years EndedDecember 31, 2016 2015 $ change % change (in millions) Net revenues $ 5,816 $ 6,002 $ (186) (3.1)% Segment operating income 506 389 117 30.1% 2017 compared with 2016: Net revenues decreased $77 million (1.3%), due to the impact of divestitures (2.2 pp), unfavorable currency (1.8 pp) and unfavorable volume/mix (0.2 pp), partially offset by higher net pricing (2.9 pp). The impact of divestitures, primarily related to the grocery & cheese business in Australia and New Zealand that was divested on July 4, 2017, resulted in a year-over-year decline in net revenues of $128 million for 2017. Unfavorable currency impacts were due primarily to the strength of the U.S. dollar relative to several currencies in the region, including the Egyptian pound, Nigerian naira, Philippine peso, Chinese yuan and Japanese yen, partially offset by the strength of several other currencies in the region relative to the U.S. dollar, including the Australian dollar, Indian rupee and South African rand. Unfavorable volume/mix was driven by declines in refreshment beverages, cheese & grocery, gum and candy, partially offset by gains in chocolate and biscuits. In addition, only a portion of the shipments delayed at the end of the second quarter due to the malware incident was recovered. Higher net pricing was reflected across all categories except cheese & grocery. Segment operating income increased $10 million (2.0%), primarily due to higher net pricing, lower other selling, general and administrative expenses (including a property insurance recovery), lower manufacturing costs and lower advertising and consumer promotion costs. These favorable items were mostly offset by higher raw material costs, unfavorable currency, unfavorable volume/mix, higher costs incurred for the 2014-2018 Restructuring Program, the impact of divestitures and higher intangible asset impairment charges. 2016 compared with 2015: Net revenues decreased $186 million (3.1%), due to unfavorable currency (3.9 pp), the adjustment for deconsolidating our historical coffee business (1.1 pp) and unfavorable volume/mix (1.0 pp), partially offset by higher net pricing (1.7 pp) and the impact of an acquisition (1.2 pp). Unfavorable currency impacts were due primarily to the strength of the U.S. dollar relative to most currencies in the region, including the Chinese yuan, Indian rupee, South African rand, Egyptian pound, Nigerian naira, Philippine peso and Australian dollar, partially offset by the strength of the Japanese yen relative to the U.S. dollar. The adjustment for deconsolidating our historical coffee business resulted in a year-over-year decrease in net revenues of $66 million. Unfavorable volume/mix, including the unfavorable impact of strategic decisions to exit certain low-margin product lines, was driven by declines in candy, refreshment beverages, cheese & grocery and chocolate, partially offset by gains in biscuits and gum. Higher net pricing was driven by chocolate, candy, biscuits and refreshment beverages, partially offset by lower net pricing in gum and cheese & grocery. The acquisition of a biscuit operation in Vietnam in July 2015 added net revenues of $71 million (constant currency basis). Segment operating income increased $117 million (30.1%), primarily due to lower manufacturing costs, higher net pricing, lower other selling, general and administrative expenses, lower costs incurred for the 2014-2018 Restructuring Program, the absence of costs associated with the coffee business transactions and the impact of the Vietnam acquisition. These favorable items were partially offset by higher raw material costs, the reclassification of equity method investment earnings, unfavorable volume/mix, unfavorable currency, the deconsolidation of our historical coffee business and the impact of divestitures. 42 Table of Contents Europe For the Years EndedDecember 31, 2017 2016 $ change % change (in millions) Net revenues $ 9,794 $ 9,755 $ 39 0.4% Segment operating income 1,680 1,267 413 32.6% For the Years EndedDecember 31, 2016 2015 $ change % change (in millions) Net revenues $ 9,755 $ 11,672 $ (1,917) (16.4)% Segment operating income 1,267 1,350 (83) (6.1)% 2017 compared with 2016: Net revenues increased $39 million (0.4%), due to favorable volume/mix (1.4 pp), favorable currency (1.0 pp), and the impact of an acquisition (0.6 pp), partially offset by the impact of divestitures (2.5 pp) and lower net pricing (0.1 pp). Favorable volume/mix was driven by chocolate and biscuits, partially offset by declines in gum, cheese & grocery, candy and refreshment beverages. In addition, a portion of the shipments delayed at the end of the second quarter due to the malware incident was not recovered. Favorable currency impacts reflected the strength of several other currencies relative to the U.S. dollar, primarily the euro and Russian ruble, partially offset by the strength of the U.S. dollar against several currencies in the region, including the British pound sterling and Turkish lira. The November 2016 acquisition of a business and license to manufacture, market and sell Cadbury-branded biscuits added net revenues of $59 million (constant currency basis). The impact of divestitures, primarily due to the sale of a confectionery business in France, resulted in a year-over-year decline in net revenues of $234 million for 2017. Lower net pricing was driven by biscuits, mostly offset by higher net pricing in all other categories. Segment operating income increased $413 million (32.6%), primarily due to lower manufacturing costs, lower costs incurred for the 2014-2018 Restructuring Program, lower other selling, general and administrative expenses, lower divestiture-related costs, lower advertising and consumer promotion costs, the benefit from the settlement of a Cadbury tax matter, favorable volume/mix, lower intangible asset impairment charges, favorable currency and the impact of an acquisition. These favorable items were partially offset by higher raw material costs, the impact of divestitures, incremental costs incurred due to the malware incident, lower net pricing and a prior-year gain on the sale of an intangible asset. 2016 compared with 2015: Net revenues decreased $1,917 million (16.4%), due to the adjustment for deconsolidating our historical coffee business (12.9 pp), unfavorable currency (4.4 pp), lower net pricing (0.4 pp) and the impact of divestitures (0.2 pp), partially offset by favorable volume/mix (1.3 pp) and the impact of an acquisition (0.2 pp).

Favorable volume/mix, including the unfavorable impact of strategic decisions to exit certain low-margin product lines, was driven by biscuits, chocolate and cheese & grocery, partially offset by declines in gum, candy and refreshment beverages. The purchase of the license to manufacture, market and sell Cadbury-branded biscuits in November 2016 added net revenues of $16 million (constant currency basis). Segment operating income decreased $83 million (6.1%), primarily due to the deconsolidation of our historical coffee business, unfavorable currency, higher raw material costs, divestiture-related costs, higher costs incurred for the 2014-2018 Restructuring Program, lower net pricing, higher intangible asset impairment charges and the impact of divestitures. These unfavorable items were partially offset by the absence of costs associated with the JDE coffee business transactions, lower manufacturing costs, lower other selling, general and administrative expenses, favorable volume/mix and a gain on the sale of an intangible asset. 43 Table of Contents North America For the Years Ended December 31, 2017 2016 $ change % change (in millions) Net revenues $ 6,797 $ 6,960 $ (163 ) (2.3)% Segment operating income 1,120 1,078 42 3.9 % For the Years Ended December 31, 2016 2015 $ change % change (in millions) Net revenues $ 6,960 $ 6,974 $ (14 ) (0.2)% Segment operating income 1,078 1,105 (27 ) (2.4)% 2017 compared with 2016: Net revenues decreased $163 million (2.3%), due to unfavorable volume/mix (1.8 pp), lower net pricing (0.6 pp) and the impact of divestitures (0.1 pp), partially offset by favorable currency (0.2 pp).

Lower net pricing was reflected in biscuits and chocolate, partially offset by higher net pricing in candy and gum. Favorable currency impact was due to the strength of the Canadian dollar relative to the U.S. dollar. Segment operating income increased $42 million (3.9%), primarily due to lower costs incurred for the 2014-2018 Restructuring Program, lower other selling, general and administrative expenses (net of the prior-year’s gain on sale of property), lower manufacturing costs, lower advertising and consumer promotion costs and lower raw material costs.

The prior-year change in North America’s accounting calendar resulted in a year-over-year decrease in net revenues of $76 million. Unfavorable currency impact was due to the strength of the U.S. dollar relative to the Canadian dollar. Lower net pricing was reflected in biscuits and candy, partially offset by higher net pricing in chocolate and gum. Favorable volume/ mix, including the unfavorable impact of strategic decisions to exit certain low-margin product lines, was driven by gains in biscuits and candy, partially offset by declines in gum and chocolate.

These unfavorable items were mostly offset by lower other selling, general and administrative expenses (including the gain on sale of property), lower manufacturing costs, favorable volume/mix and the gain on the sale of an intangible asset. 44 Table of Contents Critical Accounting Estimates We prepare our consolidated financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP. The preparation of these financial statements requires the use of estimates, judgments and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the periods presented. Actual results could differ from those estimates and assumptions. Note 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, to the consolidated financial statements includes a summary of the significant accounting policies we used to prepare our consolidated financial statements. We have discussed the selection and disclosure of our critical accounting policies and estimates with our Audit Committee. The following is a review of our most significant assumptions and estimates. Goodwill and Non-Amortizable Intangible Assets: We have historically annually tested goodwill and non-amortizable intangible assets for impairment as of October 1. This year, we voluntarily changed the annual impairment assessment date from October 1 to July 1. We believe this measurement date, which represents a change in the method of applying an accounting principle, is preferable because it better aligns with our strategic business planning process and financial forecasts which are key components of the annual impairment tests. The change in the measurement date did not delay, accelerate or prevent an impairment charge. Each quarter, we have evaluated goodwill and intangible asset impairment risks and recognized any related impairments to date. As such, the change in the annual test date was applied on July 1, 2017. We assess goodwill impairment risk throughout the year by performing a qualitative review of entity-specific, industry, market and general economic factors affecting our goodwill reporting units. We review our operating segment and reporting unit structure for goodwill testing annually or as significant changes in the organization occur. Annually, we may perform qualitative testing, or depending on factors such as prior-year test results, current year developments, current risk evaluations and other practical considerations, we may elect to do quantitative testing instead. In our quantitative testing, we compare a reporting unit’s estimated fair value with its carrying value. We estimate a reporting unit’s fair value using a discounted cash flow method which incorporates planned growth rates, market-based discount rates and estimates of residual value. This year, for our Europe and North America reporting units, we used a market-based, weighted-average cost of capital of 7.2% to discount the projected cash flows of those operations. For our Latin America and AMEA reporting units, we used a risk-rated discount rate of 10.2%. Estimating the fair value of individual reporting units requires us to make assumptions and estimates regarding our future plans and industry and economic conditions, and our actual results and conditions may differ over time. If the carrying value of a reporting unit’s net assets exceeds its fair value, we would recognize an impairment charge for the amount by which the carrying value exceeds the reporting unit fair value. In 2017, 2016 and 2015, there were no impairments of goodwill. In connection with our 2017 annual impairment testing, each of our reporting units had sufficient fair value in excess of carrying value. While all reporting units passed our annual impairment testing, if we do not meet business performance expectations or specific valuation factors outside of our control, such as discount rates, change significantly, then the estimated fair values of a reporting unit or reporting units might decline and lead to a goodwill impairment in the future. Annually, we assess non-amortizable intangible assets for impairment by performing a qualitative review and assessing events and circumstances that could affect the fair value or carrying value of the indefinite-lived intangible assets. If significant potential impairment risk exists for a specific asset, we quantitatively test it for impairment by comparing its estimated fair value with its carrying value. We determine estimated fair value using planned growth rates, market-based discount rates and estimates of royalty rates. If the carrying value of the asset exceeds its estimated fair value, the asset is impaired and its carrying value is reduced to the estimated fair value. 45 Table of Contents During our 2017 annual testing of non-amortizable intangible assets, we recorded $70 million of impairment charges in the third quarter of 2017 related to five trademarks. The impairments arose due to lower than expected product growth in part driven by decisions to redirect support from these trademarks to other regional and global brands. We recorded charges related to candy and gum trademarks of $52 million in AMEA, $11 million in Europe, $5 million in Latin America and $2 million in North America. The impairment charges were calculated as the excess of the carrying value over the estimated fair value of the intangible assets on a global basis and were recorded within asset impairment and exit costs. We primarily use a relief of royalty valuation method, which utilizes estimates of future sales, growth rates, royalty rates and discount rates in determining a brand’s global fair value. We also noted thirteen brands, including the five impaired trademarks, with $963 million of aggregate book value as of December 31, 2017 that each had a fair value in excess of book value of 10% or less. We believe our current plans for each of these brands will allow them to continue to not be impaired, but if we do not meet the product line expectations or specific valuation factors outside of our control, such as discount rates, change significantly, then a brand or brands could become impaired in the future. In 2016, we recorded charges related to biscuits, candy and gum trademarks of $41 million in AMEA, $32 million in North America, $22 million in Europe, and $3 million in Latin America. In 2015, we recorded a $44 million charge related to candy and biscuit trademarks in AMEA, $22 million in Europe and $5 million in Latin America. Refer to Note 5, Goodwill and Intangible Assets, for additional information. Trade and marketing programs: We promote our products with trade and sales incentives as well as marketing and advertising programs. These programs include, but are not limited to, new product introduction fees, discounts, coupons, rebates and volume-based incentives as well as cooperative advertising, in-store displays and consumer marketing promotions. Trade and sales incentives are recorded as a reduction to revenues based on amounts estimated due to customers and consumers at the end of a period. We base these estimates principally on historical utilization and redemption rates. For interim reporting purposes, advertising and consumer promotion expenses are charged to operations as a percentage of volume, based on estimated sales volume and estimated program spending. We do not defer costs on our year-end consolidated balance sheet and all marketing and advertising costs are recorded as an expense in the year incurred. Employee Benefit Plans: We sponsor various employee benefit plans throughout the world. These include primarily pension plans and postretirement healthcare benefits. For accounting purposes, we estimate the pension and postretirement healthcare benefit obligations utilizing assumptions and estimates for discount rates; expected returns on plan assets; expected compensation increases; employee-related factors such as turnover, retirement age and mortality; and health care cost trends. We review our actuarial assumptions on an annual basis and make modifications to the assumptions based on current rates and trends when appropriate. Our assumptions also reflect our historical experiences and management’s best judgment regarding future expectations. These and other assumptions affect the annual expense and obligations recognized for the underlying plans. As permitted by U.S. GAAP, we generally amortize the effect of changes in the assumptions over future periods. The cost or benefit of plan changes, such as increasing or decreasing benefits for prior employee service (prior service cost), is deferred and included in expense on a straight-line basis over the average remaining service period of the employees expected to receive benefits. Since pension and postretirement liabilities are measured on a discounted basis, the discount rate significantly affects our plan obligations and expenses. The expected return on plan assets assumption affects our pension plan expenses, as many of our pension plans are partially funded. The assumptions for discount rates and expected rates of return and our process for setting these assumptions are described in Note 9, Benefit Plans, to the consolidated financial statements. 46 Table of Contents While we do not anticipate further changes in the 2018 assumptions for our U.S. and non-U.S. pension and postretirement health care plans, as a sensitivity measure, a fifty-basis point change in our discount rates or the expected rate of return on plan assets would have the following effects, increase/(decrease), on our annual benefit plan costs: As of December 31, 2017 U.S. Plans Non-U.S. Plans Fifty-Basis-Point Fifty-Basis-Point Increase Decrease Increase Decrease (in millions) Effect of change in discount rate on pension costs $ (16 ) $ 17 $ (67 ) $ 76 Effect of change in expected rate of return onplan assets on pension costs (8 ) 8 (43 ) 43 Effect of change in discount rate onpostretirement health care costs (3 ) 4 (1 ) 1 Income Taxes: As a global company, we calculate and provide for income taxes in each tax jurisdiction in which we operate. The provision for income taxes includes the amounts payable or refundable for the current year, the effect of deferred taxes and impacts from uncertain tax positions. Our provision for income taxes is significantly affected by shifts in the geographic mix of our pre-tax earnings across tax jurisdictions, changes in tax laws and regulations, tax planning opportunities available in each tax jurisdiction and the ultimate outcome of various tax audits. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between the financial statement and tax bases of our assets and liabilities and for operating losses and tax credit carryforwards. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates that will apply to taxable income in the years in which those differences are expected to be recovered or settled. Valuation allowances are established for deferred tax assets when it is more likely than not that a tax benefit will not be realized. We believe our tax positions comply with applicable tax laws and that we have properly accounted for uncertain tax positions. We recognize tax benefits in our financial statements from uncertain tax positions only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained by the taxing authorities based on the technical merits of the position. The amount we recognize is measured as the largest amount of benefit that is greater than 50 percent likely of being realized upon resolution. We evaluate uncertain tax positions on an ongoing basis and adjust the amount recognized in light of changing facts and circumstances, such as the progress of a tax audit or expiration of a statute of limitations. We believe the estimates and assumptions used to support our evaluation of uncertain tax positions are reasonable. However, final determination of historical tax liabilities, whether by settlement with tax authorities, judicial or administrative ruling or due to expiration of statutes of limitations, could be materially different from estimates reflected on our consolidated balance sheet and historical income tax provisions. The outcome of these final determinations could have a material effect on our provision for income taxes, net earnings or cash flows in the period in which the determination is made. As a result of the U.S. tax reform and the related SEC guidance, we included provisional estimates in our consolidated financial statements for some impacts of the new tax legislation. We were unable to make a reasonable estimate for other provisions of the legislation and did not include an estimate in our consolidated financial statements. See Note 14, Income Taxes, for further discussion of the provisional amounts related to U.S. tax reform included in our financial statements and a discussion of the items for which no estimate could be made, as well as additional information on our effective tax rate, current and deferred taxes, valuation allowances and unrecognized tax benefits. Contingencies: See Note 12, Commitments and Contingencies, to the consolidated financial statements. New Accounting Guidance: See Note 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, to the consolidated financial statements for a discussion of new accounting standards. 47 Table of Contents Liquidity and Capital Resources We believe that cash from operations, our revolving credit facilities and our authorized long-term financing will provide sufficient liquidity for our working capital needs, planned capital expenditures, future contractual obligations, share repurchases, transition tax liability on our historical accumulated foreign earnings due to the U.S. tax reform and payment of our anticipated quarterly dividends. We continue to utilize our commercial paper program, international credit lines and long-term debt issuances for regular funding requirements. We also use intercompany loans with our international subsidiaries to improve financial flexibility. Overall, we do not expect any negative effects to our funding sources that would have a material effect on our liquidity. Net Cash Provided by Operating Activities: Operating activities provided net cash of $2,593 million in 2017, $2,838 million in 2016 and $3,728 million in 2015. Cash flows from operating activities were lower in 2017 than 2016 primarily due to increases in working capital including higher tax and VAT-related payments in 2017 and lower operating cash flows from divested businesses, partially offset by higher net earnings and lower pension contributions in 2017. Cash flows from operating activities were lower in 2016 than 2015 due to higher contributions to our pension benefit plans in 2016 and higher working capital cash improvements in 2015 than in 2016. Net Cash Provided by/(Used in) Investing Activities: Net cash used in investing activities was $301 million in 2017 and $1,029 million in 2016 and net cash provided by investing activities was $2,649 million in 2015. The decrease in net cash used in investing activities in 2017 relative to 2016 was due to higher net proceeds received from divestitures in 2017, no acquisition-related payments in 2017 as in 2016, and lower capital expenditures in 2017. The increase in net cash used in investing activities in 2016 relative to 2015 primarily relates to $4.7 billion of proceeds, net of divested cash and transaction costs, from the contribution of our global coffee businesses to JDE, the divestiture of AGF and the cash receipt of $1.0 billion due to the settlement of currency exchange forward contracts related to our coffee business transactions in 2015. Capital expenditures were $1,014 million in 2017, $1,224 million in 2016 and $1,514 million in 2015. We continue to make capital expenditures primarily to modernize manufacturing facilities and support new product and productivity initiatives. We expect 2018 capital expenditures to be up to $1.0 billion, including capital expenditures in connection with our 2014-2018 Restructuring Program. We expect to continue to fund these expenditures from operations. Net Cash Used in Financing Activities: Net cash used in financing activities was $3,361 million in 2017, $1,862 million in 2016 and $5,883 million in 2015. The increase in net cash used in financing activities in 2017 relative to 2016 was primarily due to lower net issuances of short-term and long-term debt as well as an increase in dividends paid, partly offset by lower Common Stock repurchases compared to the prior year. The decrease in net cash used in financing activities in 2016 relative to 2015 was primarily due to higher short-term debt issuances and $1.0 billion of lower share repurchases following the exceptional year of share repurchases using proceeds from the global coffee business transactions in 2015. Debt: From time to time we refinance long-term and short-term debt. Refer to Note 7, Debt and Borrowing Arrangements, for details of our tender offers, debt issuances and maturities during 2016-2017. The nature and amount of our long-term and short-term debt and the proportionate amount of each varies as a result of current and expected business requirements, market conditions and other factors. Due to seasonality, in the first and second quarters of the year, our working capital requirements grow, increasing the need for short-term financing. The second half of the year typically generates higher cash flows. As such, we may issue commercial paper or secure other forms of financing throughout the year to meet short-term working capital needs. During 2016, one of our subsidiaries, Mondelez International Holdings Netherlands B.V. (“MIHN”), issued debt totaling $4.5 billion. The operations held by MIHN generated approximately 74.5% (or $19.3 billion) of the $25.9 billion of consolidated net revenue during fiscal year 2017 and represented approximately 75.5% (or $19.8 billion) of the $26.2 billion of net assets as of December 31, 2017. On February 3, 2017, our Board of Directors approved a new $5 billion long-term financing authority to replace the prior authority. As of December 31, 2017, we had $4.7 billion of long-term financing authority remaining. 48 Table of Contents In the next 12 months, we expect $1.2 billion of long-term debt will mature as follows: fr.250 million Swiss franc notes ($257 million as of December 31, 2017) in January 2018, $478 million in February 2018, £76 million sterling notes ($103 million as of December 31, 2017) in July 2018, and $322 million in August 2018. We expect to fund these repayments with a combination of cash from operations and the issuance of commercial paper or long-term debt. Our total debt was $17.7 billion at December 31, 2017 and $17.2 billion at December 31, 2016. Our debt-to-capitalization ratio was 0.40 at December 31, 2017 and 0.41 at December 31, 2016. At December 31, 2017, the weighted-average term of our outstanding long-term debt was 6.2 years. Our average daily commercial borrowings were $4.4 billion in 2017, $2.2 billion in 2016 and $2.2 billion in 2015. We had $3.4 billion of commercial paper borrowings outstanding at December 31, 2017 and $2.4 billion outstanding as of December 31, 2016. We expect to continue to use commercial paper to finance various short and long-term financing needs and to continue to comply with our long-term debt covenants. Refer to Note 7, Debt and Borrowing Arrangements, for more information on our debt and debt covenants. Commodity Trends We regularly monitor worldwide supply, commodity cost and currency trends so we can cost-effectively secure ingredients, packaging and fuel required for production. During 2017, the primary drivers of the increase in our aggregate commodity costs were higher currency-related costs on our commodity purchases and increased costs for dairy, cocoa, sugar, packaging and other raw materials. A number of external factors such as weather conditions, commodity market conditions, currency fluctuations and the effects of governmental agricultural or other programs affect the cost and availability of raw materials and agricultural materials used in our products. We address higher commodity costs and currency impacts primarily through hedging, higher pricing and manufacturing and overhead cost control. We use hedging techniques to limit the impact of fluctuations in the cost of our principal raw materials; however, we may not be able to fully hedge against commodity cost changes, such as dairy, where there is a limited ability to hedge, and our hedging strategies may not protect us from increases in specific raw material costs. Due to competitive or market conditions, planned trade or promotional incentives, fluctuations in currency exchange rates or other factors, our pricing actions may also lag commodity cost changes temporarily. We expect price volatility and a slightly higher aggregate cost environment to continue in 2018. While the costs of our principal raw materials fluctuate, we believe there will continue to be an adequate supply of the raw materials we use and that they will generally remain available from numerous sources. 49 Table of Contents Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements and Aggregate Contractual Obligations We have no significant off-balance sheet arrangements other than the contractual obligations discussed below. Guarantees: As discussed in Note 12, Commitments and Contingencies, we enter into third-party guarantees primarily to cover the long-term obligations of our vendors. As part of these transactions, we guarantee that third parties will make contractual payments or achieve performance measures. At December 31, 2017, we had no material third-party guarantees recorded on our consolidated balance sheet. Guarantees do not have, and we do not expect them to have, a material effect on our liquidity. Aggregate Contractual Obligations: The following table summarizes our contractual obligations at December 31, 2017. Payments Due Total 2018 2019-20 2021-22 2023 andThereafter (in millions) Debt (1) $ 14,196 $ 1,162 $ 3,545 $ 4,127 $ 5,362 Interest expense (2) 3,330 348 556 431 1,995 Capital leases 3 1 2 – – Operating leases (3) 920 245 352 169 154 Purchase obligations: (4) Inventory and production costs 5,328 3,083 1,645 256 344 Other 831 694 130 6 1 6,159 3,777 1,775 262 345 U.S. tax reform transition liability (5) 1,317 128 200 200 789 Other long-term liabilities (6) 423 21 135 65 202 Total $ 26,348 $ 5,682 $ 6,565 $ 5,254 $ 8,847 (1) Amounts include the expected cash payments of our debt excluding capital leases, which are presented separately in the table above. The amounts also exclude $64 million of net unamortized non-cash bond premiums, discounts, bank fees and mark-to-market adjustments related to our interest rate swaps recorded in total debt. (2) Amounts represent the expected cash payments of our interest expense on our long-term debt. Interest calculated on our euro, British pound sterling and Swiss franc notes was forecasted using currency exchange rates as of December 31, 2017. An insignificant amount of interest expense was excluded from the table for a portion of our other non-U.S. debt obligations due to the complexities involved in forecasting expected interest payments. (3) Operating lease payments represent the minimum rental commitments under non-cancelable operating leases. (4) Purchase obligations for inventory and production costs (such as raw materials, indirect materials and supplies, packaging, co-manufacturing arrangements, storage and distribution) are commitments for projected needs to be utilized in the normal course of business. Other purchase obligations include commitments for marketing, advertising, capital expenditures, information technology and professional services. Arrangements are considered purchase obligations if a contract specifies all significant terms, including fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased, a pricing structure and approximate timing of the transaction. Most arrangements are cancelable without a significant penalty and with short notice (usually 30 days). Any amounts reflected on the consolidated balance sheet as accounts payable and accrued liabilities are excluded from the table above. (5) In connection with the U.S. tax reform, we currently estimate paying a $1.3 billion transition tax liability through 2026. The amounts and timing of our tax payments are likely to change as a result of additional guidance expected to be issued in 2018. See Note 14, Income Taxes, for additional information on the U.S. tax reform and its impact on our financial statements. (6) Other long-term liabilities include estimated future benefit payments for our postretirement health care plans through December 31, 2027 of $235 million. We are unable to reliably estimate the timing of the payments beyond 2027; as such, they are excluded from the above table. There are also another $126 million of various other long-term liabilities that are expected to be paid over the next 5 years. In addition, the following long-term liabilities included on the consolidated balance sheet are excluded from the table above: accrued pension costs, unrecognized tax benefits, insurance accruals and other accruals. As of December 31, 2017, our unrecognized tax benefit, including associated interest and penalties, classified as a long-term payable is $649 million. We currently expect to make approximately $289 million in contributions to our pension plans in 2018. 50 Table of Contents Equity and Dividends Stock Plans: See Note 10, Stock Plans, to the consolidated financial statements for more information on our stock plans and grant activity during 2015-2017. Share Repurchases: See Note 11, Capital Stock, to the consolidated financial statements for more information on our share repurchase program. Between 2013 and 2017, our Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of a total of $13.7 billion of our Common Stock through December 31, 2018. On January 31, 2018, our Finance Committee, with authorization delegated from our Board of Directors, approved an increase of $6.0 billion in the share repurchase program, raising the authorization to $19.7 billion of Common Stock repurchases, and extended the program through December 31, 2020. We repurchased approximately $13 billion of shares ($2.2 billion in 2017, $2.6 billion in 2016, $3.6 billion in 2015, $1.9 billion in 2014 and $2.7 billion in 2013), at a weighted-average cost of $38.86 per share, through December 31, 2017. The number of shares that we ultimately repurchase under our share repurchase program may vary depending on numerous factors, including share price and other market conditions, our ongoing capital allocation planning, levels of cash and debt balances, other demands for cash, such as acquisition activity, general economic or business conditions and board and management discretion. Additionally, our share repurchase activity during any particular period may fluctuate. We may accelerate, suspend, delay or discontinue our share repurchase program at any time, without notice. Dividends: We paid dividends of $1,198 million in 2017, $1,094 million in 2016 and $1,008 million in 2015. On August 2, 2017, the Finance Committee, with authorization delegated from our Board of Directors, approved a 16% increase in the quarterly dividend to $0.22 per common share or $0.88 per common share on an annualized basis. On July 19, 2016, our Board of Directors approved a 12% increase in the quarterly dividend to $0.19 per common share or $0.76 per common share on an annual basis. On July 23, 2015, our Board of Directors approved a 13% increase in the quarterly dividend to $0.17 per common share or $0.68 per common share on an annual basis. The declaration of dividends is subject to the discretion of our Board of Directors and depends on various factors, including our net earnings, financial condition, cash requirements, future prospects and other factors that our Board of Directors deems relevant to its analysis and decision making. For U.S. income tax purposes only, the Company has determined that 100% of the distributions paid to its shareholders in 2017 are characterized as a qualified dividend paid from U.S. earnings and profits. Shareholders should consult their tax advisors for a full understanding of the tax consequences of the receipt of dividends. 51 Table of Contents Non-GAAP Financial Measures We use non-GAAP financial information and believe it is useful to investors as it provides additional information to facilitate comparisons of historical operating results, identify trends in our underlying operating results and provide additional insight and transparency on how we evaluate our business. We use non-GAAP financial measures to budget, make operating and strategic decisions and evaluate our performance. We have detailed the non-GAAP adjustments that we make in our non-GAAP definitions below. The adjustments generally fall within the following categories: acquisition & divestiture activities, gains and losses on intangible asset sales and non-cash impairments, major program restructuring activities, constant currency and related adjustments, major program financing and hedging activities and other major items affecting comparability of operating results. We believe the non-GAAP measures should always be considered along with the related U.S. GAAP financial measures. We have provided the reconciliations between the GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures below, and we also discuss our underlying GAAP results throughout our Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations in this Form 10-K. Our primary non-GAAP financial measures are listed below and reflect how we evaluate our current and prior-year operating results. As new events or circumstances arise, these definitions could change. When our definitions change, we provide the updated definitions and present the related non-GAAP historical results on a comparable basis (1). • “Organic Net Revenue” is defined as net revenues excluding the impacts of acquisitions, divestitures (2), our historical global coffee business (3), our historical Venezuelan operations, accounting calendar changes and currency rate fluctuations (4). We also evaluate Organic Net Revenue growth from emerging markets and our Power Brands. • Our emerging markets include our Latin America region in its entirety; the AMEA region, excluding Australia, New Zealand and Japan; and the following countries from the Europe region: Russia, Ukraine, Turkey, Kazakhstan, Belarus, Georgia, Poland, Czech Republic, Slovak Republic, Hungary, Bulgaria, Romania, the Baltics and the East Adriatic countries. (Our developed markets include the entire North America region, the Europe region excluding the countries included in the emerging markets definition, and Australia, New Zealand and Japan from the AMEA region.) • Our Power Brands include some of our largest global and regional brands such as Oreo, Chips Ahoy!, Ritz, TUC/Club Social and belVita biscuits; Cadbury Dairy Milk, Milka and Lacta chocolate; Trident gum; Halls candy and Tang powdered beverages. • “Adjusted Operating Income” is defined as operating income excluding the impacts of the 2012-2014 Restructuring Program (5); the 2014-2018 Restructuring Program (5); Venezuela remeasurement and deconsolidation losses and historical operating results; gains or losses (including non-cash impairment charges) on goodwill and intangible assets; divestiture (2) or acquisition gains or losses and related integration and acquisition costs; the JDE coffee business transactions (3) gain and net incremental costs; the operating results of divestitures (2); our historical global coffee business operating results (3); mark-to-market impacts from commodity and forecasted currency transaction derivative contracts (6); equity method investment earnings historically reported within operating income (7); benefits from resolution of tax matters (8) ; CEO transition remuneration (9) and incremental expenses related to the malware incident. We also present “Adjusted Operating Income margin,” which is subject to the same adjustments as Adjusted Operating Income. We also evaluate growth in our Adjusted Operating Income on a constant currency basis (4). • “Adjusted EPS” is defined as diluted EPS attributable to Mondelēz International from continuing operations excluding the impacts of the 2012-2014 Restructuring Program (5); the 2014-2018 Restructuring Program (5); Venezuela remeasurement and deconsolidation losses and historical operating results; losses on debt extinguishment and related expenses; gains or losses (including non-cash impairment charges) on goodwill and intangible assets; divestiture (2) or acquisition gains or losses and related integration and acquisition costs; the JDE coffee business transactions (3) gain, transaction hedging gains or losses and net incremental costs; gain on equity method investment transactions; net earnings from divestitures (2); mark-to-market impacts from commodity and forecasted currency transaction derivative contracts (6); gains or losses on interest rate swaps no longer designated as accounting cash flow hedges due to changed financing and hedging plans; benefits from resolution of tax matters (8); CEO transition remuneration (9); incremental expenses related to the malware incident and the U.S. tax reform discrete impacts (10). Similarly, within Adjusted EPS, our equity method investment net earnings exclude our proportionate share of our investees’ unusual or infrequent items (11). We also evaluate growth in our Adjusted EPS on a constant currency basis (4). 52 Table of Contents (1) When items no longer impact our current or future presentation of non-GAAP operating results, we remove these items from our non-GAAP definitions. During 2017, we added to the non-GAAP definitions the exclusion of: benefits from the resolution of tax matters (see footnote (8) below), CEO transition remuneration (see footnote (9) below), incremental expenses related to the malware incident (discussed under Malware Incident) and the U.S. tax reform discrete impacts (see footnote (10) below). (2) Divestitures include completed sales of businesses and exits of major product lines upon completion of a sale or licensing agreement. (3) We continue to have an ongoing interest in the legacy coffee business we deconsolidated in 2015 as part of the JDE coffee business transactions. For historical periods prior to the July 15, 2015 coffee business deconsolidation, we have reclassified any net revenue or operating income from the historical coffee business and included them where the coffee equity method investment earnings are presented within Adjusted EPS. As such, Organic Net Revenue and Adjusted Operating Income in all periods do not include the results of our legacy coffee businesses, which are shown within Adjusted EPS. (4) Constant currency operating results are calculated by dividing or multiplying, as appropriate, the current-period local currency operating results by the currency exchange rates used to translate the financial statements in the comparable prior-year period to determine what the current-period U.S. dollar operating results would have been if the currency exchange rate had not changed from the comparable prior-year period. (5) Non-GAAP adjustments related to the 2014-2018 Restructuring Program reflect costs incurred that relate to the objectives of our program to transform our supply chain network and organizational structure. Costs that do not meet the program objectives are not reflected in the non-GAAP adjustments. Refer to our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2016 for more information on the 2012-2014 Restructuring Program. (6) During the third quarter of 2016, we began to exclude unrealized gains and losses (mark-to-market impacts) from outstanding commodity and forecasted currency transaction derivatives from our non-GAAP earnings measures until such time that the related exposures impact our operating results. Since we purchase commodity and forecasted currency transaction contracts to mitigate price volatility primarily for inventory requirements in future periods, we made this adjustment to remove the volatility of these future inventory purchases on current operating results to facilitate comparisons of our underlying operating performance across periods. We also discontinued designating commodity and forecasted currency transaction derivatives for hedge accounting treatment. To facilitate comparisons of our underlying operating results, we have recast all historical non-GAAP earnings measures to exclude the mark-to-market impacts. (7) Historically, we have recorded income from equity method investments within our operating income as these investments operated as extensions of our base business. Beginning in the third quarter of 2015, we began to record the earnings from our equity method investments in after-tax equity method investment earnings outside of operating income following the deconsolidation of our coffee business. Refer to Note 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2016 for more information. (8) During 2017, we recorded benefits from the reversal of tax liabilities in connection with the resolution of a Brazilian indirect tax matter and settlement of pre-acquisition Cadbury tax matters. See Note 12, Commitments and Contingencies—Tax Matters, for additional information. (9) On November 20, 2017, Dirk Van de Put succeeded Irene Rosenfeld as CEO of Mondelēz International in advance of her retirement at the end of March 2018. In order to incent Mr. Van de Put to join us, we provided him compensation with a total combined target value of $42.5 million to make him whole for incentive awards he forfeited or grants that were not made to him when he left his former employer. The compensation we granted took the form of cash, deferred stock units, performance share units and stock options. In connection with Irene Rosenfeld’s retirement, we made her outstanding grants of performance share units for the 2016-2018 and 2017-2019 performance cycles eligible for continued vesting and approved a $0.5 million salary for her service as Chairman from January through March 2018. We refer to these elements of Mr. Van de Put’s and Ms. Rosenfeld’s compensation arrangements together as “CEO transition remuneration.” We are excluding amounts we expense as CEO transition remuneration from our 2017 and future non-GAAP results because those amounts are not part of our regular compensation program and are incremental to amounts we would have incurred as ongoing CEO compensation. As a result, in 2017, we excluded amounts expensed for the cash payment to Mr. Van de Put and partial vesting of his equity grants. In 2018, we expect to exclude amounts paid for Ms. Rosenfeld’s service as Chairman and partial vesting of Mr. Van de Put’s and Ms. Rosenfeld’s equity grants. (10) On December 22, 2017, the United States enacted tax reform legislation that included a broad range of business tax provisions. As further detailed in Note 14, Income Taxes, our accounting for the new legislation is not complete and we have made reasonable estimates for some tax provisions. We exclude the discrete U.S. tax reform impacts from our Adjusted EPS as they do not reflect our ongoing tax obligations under U.S. tax reform. (11) We have excluded our proportionate share of our equity method investees’ unusual or infrequent items such as acquisition and divestiture related costs, restructuring program costs and discrete U.S. tax reform impacts, in order to provide investors with a comparable view of our performance across periods. Although we have shareholder rights and board representation commensurate with our ownership interests in our equity method investees and review the underlying operating results and unusual or infrequent items with them each reporting period, we do not have direct control over their operations or resulting revenue and expenses. Our use of equity method investment net earnings on an adjusted basis is not intended to imply that we have any such control. Our GAAP “diluted EPS attributable to Mondelēz International from continuing operations” includes all of the investees’ unusual and infrequent items. We believe that the presentation of these non-GAAP financial measures, when considered together with our U.S. GAAP financial measures and the reconciliations to the corresponding U.S. GAAP financial measures, provides you with a more complete understanding of the factors and trends affecting our business than could be obtained absent these disclosures. Because non-GAAP financial measures vary among companies, the non-GAAP financial measures presented in this report may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies. Our use of these non-GAAP financial measures is not meant to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for any U.S. GAAP financial measure. A limitation of these non-GAAP financial measures is they exclude items detailed below that have an impact on our U.S. GAAP reported results. The best way this limitation can be addressed is by evaluating our non-GAAP financial measures in combination with our U.S. GAAP reported results and carefully evaluating the following tables that reconcile U.S. GAAP reported figures to the non-GAAP financial measures in this Form 10-K. 53 Table of Contents Organic Net Revenue: Applying the definition of “Organic Net Revenue”, the adjustments made to “net revenues” (the most comparable U.S. GAAP financial measure) were to exclude the impact of currency, our historical Venezuelan operations, the adjustment for deconsolidating our historical coffee business, an accounting calendar change, acquisitions and divestitures. We believe that Organic Net Revenue reflects the underlying growth from the ongoing activities of our business and provides improved comparability of results.

As such, we may make changes in our planned investments in primarily regional Power Brands following our annual review cycles. For 2017, we made limited changes to our list of regional Power Brands and as such, we reclassified 2016 and 2015 Power Brand net revenues on a basis consistent with the current list of Power Brands. 54 Table of Contents Adjusted Operating Income: Applying the definition of “Adjusted Operating Income”, the adjustments made to “operating income” (the most comparable U.S. GAAP financial measure) were to exclude 2012-2014 Restructuring Program costs; 2014-2018 Restructuring Program costs; impairment charges related to intangible assets; mark-to-market impacts from commodity and forecasted currency transaction derivative contracts; incremental expenses related to the malware incident; acquisition integration costs; acquisition-related costs; divestiture-related costs; the operating results of divestitures; net gain on divestitures; gain on sale of intangible assets; benefits from the resolution of tax matters; CEO transition remuneration; Venezuela historical operating results and remeasurement and deconsolidation losses; the JDE coffee business transactions gain and net incremental costs; operating income from our historical coffee business and equity method investment earnings reclassified to after-tax earnings in Q3 2015 in connection with the coffee business transactions. We also present “Adjusted Operating Income margin,” which is subject to the same adjustments as Adjusted Operating Income, and evaluate Adjusted Operating Income on a constant currency basis.

Refer to Note 2, Divestitures and Acquisitions, and Non-GAAP Financial Measures appearing later in this section for more information. (11) Historically, we have recorded income from equity method investments within our operating income as these investments operated as extensions of our base business. Beginning in the third quarter of 2015, to align with the accounting for JDE earnings, we began to record the earnings from our equity method investments in equity method investment earnings outside of operating income. In periods prior to July 2, 2015, we have reclassified the equity method earnings from Adjusted Operating Income to evaluate our operating results on a consistent basis. 56 Table of Contents Adjusted EPS: Applying the definition of “Adjusted EPS” (1), the adjustments made to “diluted EPS attributable to Mondelēz International” (the most comparable U.S. GAAP financial measure) were to exclude 2014-2018 Restructuring Program costs; impairment charges related to intangible assets; mark-to-market impacts from commodity and forecasted currency transaction derivative contracts; incremental expenses related to the malware incident; acquisition integration costs; divestiture-related costs; net earnings from divestitures; after-tax gains/losses on divestitures; gain on sale of intangible assets; benefits from the resolution of tax matters; CEO transition remuneration; losses on interest rate swaps no longer designated as accounting cash flow hedges due to changed financing and hedging plans; losses on debt extinguishment and related expenses; U.S. tax reform discrete net tax benefit; Venezuela historical operating results and remeasurement and deconsolidation losses; the JDE coffee business transactions gain, hedging gains and net incremental costs; operating income from our historical coffee business; equity method investment earnings reclassified to after-tax earnings in Q3 2015 in connection with the coffee business transactions; gain on equity method investment transactions; and our proportionate share of unusual or infrequent items recorded by our JDE and Keurig equity method investees.

Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk. As we operate globally, we are primarily exposed to currency exchange rate, commodity price and interest rate market risks. We monitor and manage these exposures as part of our overall risk management program. Our risk management program focuses on the unpredictability of financial markets and seeks to reduce the potentially adverse effects that the volatility of these markets may have on our operating results. We principally utilize derivative instruments to reduce significant, unanticipated earnings fluctuations that may arise from volatility in currency exchange rates, commodity prices and interest rates. For additional information on our derivative activity and the types of derivative instruments we use to hedge our currency exchange, commodity price and interest rate exposures, see Note 8, Financial Instruments. Many of our non-U.S. subsidiaries operate in functional currencies other than the U.S. dollar. Fluctuations in currency exchange rates create volatility in our reported results as we translate the balance sheets, operating results and cash flows of these subsidiaries into the U.S. dollar for consolidated reporting purposes. The translation of non-U.S. dollar denominated balance sheets and statements of earnings of our subsidiaries into the U.S. dollar for consolidated reporting generally results in a cumulative translation adjustment to other comprehensive income within equity. A stronger U.S. dollar relative to other functional currencies adversely affects our consolidated earnings and net assets while a weaker U.S. dollar benefits our consolidated earnings and net assets. While we hedge significant forecasted currency exchange transactions as well as certain net assets of non-U.S. operations and other currency impacts, we cannot fully predict or eliminate volatility arising from changes in currency exchange rates on our consolidated financial results. See Consolidated Results of Operations and Results of Operations by Reportable Segment under Discussion and Analysis of Historical Results for currency exchange effects on our financial results. For additional information on the impact of currency policies, recent currency devaluations, the deconsolidation of our Venezuelan operation and the historical remeasurement of our Venezuelan net monetary assets on our financial condition and results of operations, also see Note 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies—Currency Translation and Highly Inflationary Accounting. We also continually monitor the market for commodities that we use in our products. Input costs may fluctuate widely due to international demand, weather conditions, government policy and regulation and unforeseen conditions. To manage input cost volatility, we enter into forward purchase agreements and other derivative financial instruments. We also pursue productivity and cost saving measures and take pricing actions when necessary to mitigate the impact of higher input costs on earnings. We regularly evaluate our variable and fixed-rate debt as well as current and expected interest rates in the markets in which we raise capital. Our primary exposures include movements in U.S. Treasury rates, corporate credit spreads, London Interbank Offered Rates (“LIBOR”), Euro Interbank Offered Rate (“EURIBOR”) and commercial paper rates. We periodically use interest rate swaps and forward interest rate contracts to achieve a desired proportion of variable versus fixed rate debt based on current and projected market conditions. Our weighted-average interest rate on our total debt was 2.1% as of December 31, 2017, down from 2.2% as of December 31, 2016. There were no significant changes in the types of derivative instruments we use to hedge our exposures between December 31, 2016 and December 31, 2017. See Note 8, Financial Instruments, for more information on 2017 and 2018 derivative activity. Value at Risk: We use a value at risk (“VAR”) computation to estimate: 1) the potential one-day loss in the fair value of our interest rate-sensitive financial instruments; and 2) the potential one-day loss in pre-tax earnings of our currency and commodity price-sensitive derivative financial instruments. The VAR analysis was done separately for our currency exchange, fixed income and commodity risk portfolios as of each quarter end during the periods presented below. The instruments included in the VAR computation were currency exchange forwards and options for currency exchange risk, debt and swaps for interest rate risk, and commodity forwards, futures and options for commodity risk. Excluded from the computation were anticipated transactions, currency trade payables and receivables, and net investments in non-U.S. subsidiaries, which the above-mentioned instruments are intended to hedge. 59 Table of Contents The VAR model assumes normal market conditions, a 95% confidence interval and a one-day holding period. A parametric delta-gamma approximation technique was used to determine the expected return distribution in interest rates, currencies and commodity prices for the purpose of calculating the fixed income, currency exchange and commodity VAR, respectively. The parameters used for estimating the expected return distributions were determined by observing interest rate, currency exchange, and commodity price movements over the prior quarter for the calculation of VAR amounts at December 31, 2017 and 2016, and over each of the four prior quarters for the calculation of average VAR amounts during each year. The values of currency and commodity options do not change on a one-to-one basis with the underlying currency or commodity and were valued accordingly in the VAR computation. As of December 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016, the estimated potential one-day loss in fair value of our interest rate-sensitive instruments, primarily debt, and the estimated potential one-day loss in pre-tax earnings from our currency and commodity instruments, as calculated in the VAR model, were: Pre-Tax Earnings Impact Fair Value Impact At 12/31/17 Average High Low At 12/31/17 Average High Low (in millions) Instruments sensitive to: Interest rates $ 31 $ 45 $ 55 $ 31 Foreign currency rates $ 15 $ 16 $ 22 $ 11 Commodity prices 14 17 24 14 Pre-Tax Earnings Impact Fair Value Impact At 12/31/16 Average High Low At 12/31/16 Average High Low (in millions) Instruments sensitive to: Interest rates $ 62 $ 62 $ 91 $ 45 Foreign currency rates $ 10 $ 18 $ 26 $ 10 Commodity prices 16 12 16 10 This VAR computation is a risk analysis tool designed to statistically estimate the maximum expected daily loss, under the specified confidence interval and assuming normal market conditions, from adverse movements in interest rates, currency exchange rates and commodity prices. The computation does not represent actual losses in fair value or earnings we will incur, nor does it consider the effect of favorable changes in market rates. We cannot predict actual future movements in market rates and do not present these VAR results to be indicative of future movements in market rates or to be representative of any actual impact that future changes in market rates may have on our future financial results. 60 Table of Contents",2023-12-30 19:01:15.399780
