87347,SLB,SCHLUMBERGER LIMITED/NV,2011,"Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, and the consolidated financial statements and related notes included in this Form 10-K. We urge you to consider carefully the risks described below, as well as in other reports and materials that we file with the SEC and the other information included or incorporated by reference in Form 10-K. If any of the risks described below or elsewhere in this Form 10-K were to materialize, our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows or prospects could be materially adversely affected. In such case, the trading price of our common stock could decline and you could lose part or all of your investment. Additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial may also materially adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. Demand for the majority of our services is substantially dependent on the levels of expenditures by the oil and gas industry. A substantial or an extended decline in oil and gas prices could result in lower expenditures by the oil and gas industry, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. Demand for the majority of our services depends substantially on the level of expenditures by the oil and gas industry for the exploration, development and production of oil and natural gas reserves. These expenditures are generally dependent on the industry’s view of future oil and natural gas prices and are sensitive to the industry’s view of future economic growth and the resulting impact on demand for oil and natural gas. Declines, as well as anticipated declines, in oil and gas prices could also result in project modifications, delays or cancellations, general business disruptions, and delays in, or nonpayment of, amounts that are owed to us. These effects could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and cash flows. The prices for oil and natural gas have historically been volatile and may be affected by a variety of factors, including: • demand for hydrocarbons, which is affected by worldwide population growth, economic growth rates and general economic and business conditions; • the ability of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (“OPEC”) to set and maintain production levels for oil; • oil and gas production by non-OPEC countries; • the level of excess production capacity; • political and economic uncertainty and sociopolitical unrest; • the level of worldwide oil and gas exploration and production activity; • the cost of exploring for, producing and delivering oil and gas; • technological advances affecting energy consumption; and • weather conditions. The oil and gas industry has historically experienced periodic downturns, which have been characterized by diminished demand for oilfield services and downward pressure on the prices we charge. A significant downturn in the oil and gas industry could result in a reduction in demand for oilfield services and could adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. 7 Table of Contents Part I, Item 1A A significant portion of our revenue is derived from our non-United States operations, which exposes us to risks inherent in doing business in each of the approximately 80 countries in which we operate. Our non-United States operations accounted for approximately 76% of our consolidated revenue in 2010, 84% in 2009 and 78% in 2008. Operations in countries other than the United States are subject to various risks, including: • unsettled political and economic conditions in certain areas; • exposure to possible expropriation of our assets or other governmental actions; • social unrest, acts of terrorism, war or other armed conflict; • confiscatory taxation or other adverse tax policies; • deprivation of contract rights; • trade restrictions or embargoes imposed by the United States or other countries; • restrictions under the United States Foreign Corrupt Practices Act or similar legislation in other countries; • restrictions on the repatriation of income or capital; • currency exchange controls; • inflation; and • currency exchange rate fluctuations and devaluations. In addition, we are subject to risks associated with our operations in countries, including Iran, Syria, Sudan and Cuba, that are subject to trade and economic sanctions or other restrictions imposed by the United States or other governments or organizations. United States law enforcement authorities are currently conducting a grand jury investigation and an associated regulatory inquiry related to our operations in certain of these countries. Additionally, in 2009 prior to its merger with Schlumberger, Smith received an administrative subpoena with respect to its historical business practices in certain countries that are subject to United States trade and economic sanctions. If any of the risks described above materialize, or if any governmental investigation results in criminal or civil penalties or other remedial measures, it could reduce our earnings and our cash available for operations. We are also subject to risks related to investment in our common stock in connection with certain US state divestment or investment limitation legislation applicable to companies with operations in these countries, and similar actions by some private investors, which could adversely affect the market price of our common stock. Our merger with Smith will continue to be dilutive to our earnings per share in the near term, which may negatively affect the market price of our common stock. Our merger with Smith will continue to be dilutive to earnings per share in the near term. Future events and conditions could decrease or delay any accretion, result in dilution or cause greater dilution than is currently expected, including adverse changes in: • energy market conditions; • commodity prices for oil, natural gas and natural gas liquids; • production levels; • reserve levels; • operating results; • competitive conditions; • laws and regulations affecting the energy business; • capital expenditure obligations; and • general economic conditions. 8 Table of Contents Part I, Item 1A Any dilution of, or decrease or delay of any accretion to, our earnings per share could cause the price of our common stock to decline. Our offshore oil and gas operations could be adversely impacted by the Deepwater Horizon drilling rig accident and resulting oil spill; changes in and compliance with restrictions or regulations on offshore drilling in the US Gulf of Mexico and in other areas around the world may adversely affect our business and operating results. On April 20, 2010, a fire and explosion occurred onboard the semisubmersible drilling rig Deepwater Horizon, owned by Transocean Ltd. and under contract to a subsidiary of BP plc. As a result of the incident and related oil spill, the Secretary of the US Department of the Interior directed the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management, Regulation and Enforcement (“BOEMRE”) to issue a suspension, until November 30, 2010, of drilling activities for specified drilling configurations and technologies. Although this moratorium was lifted on October 12, 2010, effective immediately, we cannot predict with certainty when drilling operations will fully resume in the US Gulf of Mexico. The BOEMRE has also issued new guidelines and regulations regarding safety, environmental matters, drilling equipment and decommissioning applicable to drilling in the US Gulf of Mexico, and may take other additional steps that could increase the costs of exploration and production, reduce the area of operations and result in permitting delays. At this time, we cannot predict with any certainty what further impact, if any, the Deepwater Horizon incident may have on the regulation of offshore oil and gas exploration and development activity, or on the cost or availability of insurance coverage to cover the risks of such operations. Ongoing effects of and delays from the lifted suspension of drilling activity in the US Gulf of Mexico, or the enactment of new or stricter regulations in the United States and other countries where we operate, could materially adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. Environmental compliance costs and liabilities could reduce our earnings and cash available for operations. We are subject to increasingly stringent laws and regulations relating to importation and use of hazardous materials, radioactive materials and explosives, environmental protection, including laws and regulations governing air emissions, water discharges and waste management. We incur, and expect to continue to incur, capital and operating costs to comply with environmental laws and regulations. The technical requirements of these laws and regulations are becoming increasingly complex, stringent and expensive to implement. These laws may provide for “strict liability” for damages to natural resources or threats to public health and safety. Strict liability can render a party liable for damages without regard to negligence or fault on the part of the party. Some environmental laws provide for joint and several strict liability for remediation of spills and releases of hazardous substances. We use and generate hazardous substances and wastes in our operations. In addition, many of our current and former properties are, or have been, used for industrial purposes. Accordingly, we could become subject to potentially material liabilities relating to the investigation and cleanup of contaminated properties, and to claims alleging personal injury or property damage as the result of exposures to, or releases of, hazardous substances. In addition, stricter enforcement of existing laws and regulations, new laws and regulations, the discovery of previously unknown contamination or the imposition of new or increased requirements could require us to incur costs or become the basis of new or increased liabilities that could reduce our earnings and our cash available for operations. We believe we are currently in substantial compliance with environmental laws and regulations. We could be subject to substantial liability claims, which would adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. Certain equipment used in the delivery of oilfield services, such as directional drilling equipment, perforating systems, subsea completion equipment, radioactive materials and explosives and well completion systems, are used in hostile environments, such as exploration, development and production applications. An accident or a failure of a product could cause personal injury, loss of life, damage to property, equipment or the environment, and suspension of operations. Our insurance may not protect us against liability for some kinds of events, including events involving pollution, or against losses resulting from business interruption. Moreover, in the future we may not be able to maintain insurance at levels of risk coverage or policy limits that we deem adequate. Substantial claims made under our policies could cause our premiums to increase. Any future damages caused by our products that are not covered by insurance, or 9 Table of Contents Part I, Item 1A are in excess of policy limits or are subject to substantial deductibles, could adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. If we are unable to maintain technology leadership, this could adversely affect any competitive advantage we hold. If we are unable to develop and produce competitive technology or deliver it to our clients in the form of service offerings in a timely and cost-competitive manner in the various markets we serve, it could adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. Limitations on our ability to protect our intellectual property rights, including our trade secrets, could cause a loss in revenue and any competitive advantage we hold. Some of our products or services, and the processes we use to produce or provide them, have been granted patent protection, have patent applications pending or are trade secrets. Our business may be adversely affected if our patents are unenforceable, the claims allowed under our patents are not sufficient to protect our technology, our patent applications are denied, or our trade secrets are not adequately protected. Our competitors may be able to develop technology independently that is similar to ours without infringing on our patents or gaining access to our trade secrets. We may be subject to litigation if another party claims that we have infringed upon its intellectual property rights. The tools, techniques, methodologies, programs and components we use to provide our services may infringe upon the intellectual property rights of others. Infringement claims generally result in significant legal and other costs and may distract management from running our core business. Royalty payments under licenses from third parties, if available, would increase our costs. If a license were not available we might not be able to continue providing a particular service or product, which could adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. Additionally, developing non-infringing technologies would increase our costs. Failure to obtain and retain skilled technical personnel could impede our operations. We require highly skilled personnel to operate and provide technical services and support for our business. Competition for the personnel required for our businesses intensifies as activity increases. In periods of high utilization it may become more difficult to find and retain qualified individuals. This could increase our costs or have other adverse effects on our operations. Severe weather conditions may affect our operations. Our business may be materially affected by severe weather conditions in areas where we operate. This may entail the evacuation of personnel and stoppage of services. In addition, if particularly severe weather affects platforms or structures, this may result in a suspension of activities until the platforms or structures have been repaired. Any of these events could adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. Demand for our products and services could be reduced or eliminated by governmental regulation or a change in the law. International, national, and state governments and agencies are currently evaluating and promulgating climate-related legislation and regulations that are focused on restricting greenhouse gas (“GHG”) emissions. In the United States, the Environmental Protection Agency (“EPA”) is taking steps to require monitoring and reporting of GHG emissions and to regulate GHGs as pollutants under the Clean Air Act (“CAA”). The EPA’s “Mandatory Reporting of Greenhouse Gases” rule established a comprehensive scheme of regulations that require monitoring and reporting of GHG emissions that began in 2010. Furthermore, the EPA recently proposed additional GHG reporting rules specifically for the oil and gas industry. The EPA has also published a final rule, the “Endangerment Finding,” finding that GHGs in the atmosphere endanger public health and welfare, and that emissions of GHGs from mobile sources cause or 10 Table of Contents Part I, Item 1A contribute to the GHG pollution. Following issuance of the Endangerment Finding, the EPA promulgated final motor vehicle GHG emission standards on April 1, 2010. The EPA has asserted that the final motor vehicle GHG emission standards will trigger construction and operating permit requirements for stationary sources. In addition, climate change legislation is pending in the United States Congress. These developments may curtail production and demand for fossil fuels such as oil and gas in areas of the world where our customers operate and thus adversely affect future demand for our services, which may in turn adversely affect future results of operations. Additionally, legislation to reduce greenhouse gases may have an adverse effect on our operations, including payment of additional costs due to carbon emissions. Higher carbon emission activities include transportation, including marine vessels, cement production (by third party suppliers), and electricity generation (by third party suppliers) as well as other activities. Finally, our business could be negatively affected by climate change related physical changes or changes in weather patterns, which could result in damages to or loss of our physical assets, impacts to our ability to conduct operations and/or disruption of our customers’ operations. Legislation may be introduced in the United States Congress that would authorize the EPA to regulate hydraulic fracturing. In addition, a number of states are evaluating the adoption of legislation or regulations governing hydraulic fracturing. Such legislation or regulations could reduce demand for pressure pumping services. If federal and/or state legislation or regulations were enacted, it could adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. We are unable to predict whether the proposed legislation, regulations, or any other proposals will ultimately be enacted. 11 Table of Contents Part I, Item 1B, 2, 3, 4 Item 1B.

87347,SLB,SCHLUMBERGER LIMITED/NV,2010,"Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, and the consolidated financial statements and related notes included in this Form 10-K. We urge you to carefully consider the risks described below, as well as in other reports and materials that we file with the SEC and the other information included or incorporated by reference in Form 10-K. If any of the risks described below or elsewhere in this Form 10-K were to materialize, our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows or prospects could be materially adversely affected. In such case, the trading price of our common stock could decline and you could lose part or all of your investment. Additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial may also materially adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. Demand for the majority of our services is substantially dependent on the levels of expenditures by the oil and gas industry. Our customers’ capital expenditures may decline in 2010 and beyond if current global economic conditions continue or worsen. This could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. The current global economic downturn has reduced worldwide demand for oil and natural gas and resulted in significantly lower crude oil and natural gas prices compared to their record highs in July 2008. It is difficult to predict how long the global economic downturn will continue, or to what extent this will continue to affect us. The significant decline in oil and natural gas prices reduced many of our customers’ activities and spending on our services and products in 2009; this reduction in our customers’ activities and spending could continue through 2010 and beyond. Demand for the majority of our services depends substantially on the level of expenditures by the oil and gas industry for the exploration, development and production of oil and natural gas reserves. These expenditures are sensitive to the industry’s view of future economic growth and the resulting impact on demand for oil and natural gas. The worldwide deterioration in the financial and credit markets, which began in the second half of 2008, resulted in diminished demand for oil and gas and significantly lower oil and natural gas prices. This caused many of our customers to reduce or delay their oil and gas exploration and production spending in 2009, which consequently reduced the demand for our services, and exerted downward pressure on the prices of our services and products. If the economic downturn 6 Table of Contents Part 1, Item 1A continues for a prolonged period or if there is little or no economic growth, it will likely result in further reductions of exploration and production expenditures by our customers, causing further declines in the demand for, and prices of, our services and products. This could result in a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. The reduction in cash flows being experienced by our customers resulting from declines in commodity prices, together with the reduced availability of credit and increased costs of borrowing, could have significant adverse effects on the financial condition of some of our customers. This could result in project modifications, delays or cancellations, general business disruptions, and delay in, or nonpayment of, amounts that are owed to us, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and cash flows. The prices for oil and natural gas are subject to a variety of factors, including: · demand for hydrocarbons, which is affected by worldwide population growth, economic growth rates and general economic and business conditions; · the ability of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (“OPEC”) to set and maintain production levels for oil; · oil and gas production by non-OPEC countries; · the level of excess production capacity; · political and economic uncertainty and sociopolitical unrest; · the level of worldwide oil and gas exploration and production activity; · the cost of exploring for, producing and delivering oil and gas; · technological advances affecting energy consumption; and · weather conditions. A significant portion of our revenue is derived from our non-United States operations, which exposes us to risks inherent in doing business in each of the approximately 80 countries in which we operate. Our non-United States operations accounted for approximately 84% of our consolidated revenue in 2009, 78% in 2008 and 76% in 2007. Operations in countries other than the United States are subject to various risks, including: · unsettled political and economic conditions in certain areas; · exposure to possible expropriation of our assets or other governmental actions; · social unrest, acts of terrorism, war or other armed conflict; · confiscatory taxation or other adverse tax policies; · deprivation of contract rights; · trade restrictions or embargoes imposed by the United States or other countries; · restrictions under the United States Foreign Corrupt Practices Act or similar legislation in other countries; · restrictions on the repatriation of income or capital; · currency exchange controls; · inflation; and · currency exchange rate fluctuations and devaluations. 7 Table of Contents Part 1, Item 1A In addition, we are subject to risks associated with our operations in countries, including Iran, Syria, Sudan and Cuba, which are subject to trade and economic sanctions or other restrictions imposed by the United States or other governments or organizations. United States law enforcement authorities are currently conducting a grand jury investigation and an associated regulatory inquiry related to our operations in certain of these countries. If any of the risks described above materialize, or if any governmental investigation results in criminal or civil penalties or other remedial measures, it could reduce our earnings and our cash available for operations. We are also subject to risks related to investment in our common stock in connection with certain US state divestment or investment limitation legislation applicable to companies with operations in these countries, and similar actions by some private investors, which could adversely affect the market price of our common stock. Environmental compliance costs and liabilities could reduce our earnings and cash available for operations. We are subject to increasingly stringent laws and regulations relating to importation and use of hazardous materials, radioactive materials and explosives, environmental protection, including laws and regulations governing air emissions, water discharges and waste management. We incur, and expect to continue to incur, capital and operating costs to comply with environmental laws and regulations. The technical requirements of these laws and regulations are becoming increasingly complex, stringent and expensive to implement. These laws may provide for “strict liability” for damages to natural resources or threats to public health and safety. Strict liability can render a party liable for damages without regard to negligence or fault on the part of the party. Some environmental laws provide for joint and several strict liability for remediation of spills and releases of hazardous substances. We use and generate hazardous substances and wastes in our operations. In addition, many of our current and former properties are, or have been, used for industrial purposes. Accordingly, we could become subject to potentially material liabilities relating to the investigation and cleanup of contaminated properties, and to claims alleging personal injury or property damage as the result of exposures to, or releases of, hazardous substances. In addition, stricter enforcement of existing laws and regulations, new laws and regulations, the discovery of previously unknown contamination or the imposition of new or increased requirements could require us to incur costs or become the basis of new or increased liabilities that could reduce our earnings and our cash available for operations. We believe we are currently in substantial compliance with environmental laws and regulations. We could be subject to substantial liability claims, which would adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. Certain equipment used in the delivery of oilfield services, such as directional drilling equipment, perforating systems, subsea completion equipment, radioactive materials and explosives and well completion systems, are used in hostile environments, such as exploration, development and production applications. An accident or a failure of a product could cause personal injury, loss of life, damage to property, equipment or the environment, and suspension of operations. Our insurance may not adequately protect us against liability for some kinds of events, including events involving pollution, or against losses resulting from business interruption. Moreover, in the future we may not be able to maintain insurance at levels of risk coverage or policy limits that we deem adequate. Substantial claims made under our policies could cause our premiums to increase. Any future damages caused by our products that are not covered by insurance, or are in excess of policy limits or are subject to substantial deductibles, could adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. 8 Table of Contents Part 1, Item 1A If we are unable to maintain technology leadership in the form of services and products, this could adversely affect any competitive advantage we hold. If we are unable to develop and produce competitive technology or deliver it to our clients in the form of services and products in a timely and cost-competitive manner in the various markets we serve, it could adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. Limitations on our ability to protect our intellectual property rights, including our trade secrets, could cause a loss in revenue and any competitive advantage we hold. Some of our products or services, and the processes we use to produce or provide them, have been granted patent protection, have patent applications pending or are trade secrets. Our business may be adversely affected if our patents are unenforceable, the claims allowed under our patents are not sufficient to protect our technology, our patent applications are denied, or our trade secrets are not adequately protected. Our competitors may be able to develop technology independently that is similar to ours without infringing on our patents or gaining access to our trade secrets. We may be subject to litigation if another party claims that we have infringed upon its intellectual property rights. The tools, techniques, methodologies, programs and components we use to provide our services may infringe upon the intellectual property rights of others. Infringement claims generally result in significant legal and other costs and may distract management from running our core business. Royalty payments under licenses from third parties, if available, would increase our costs. If a license were not available we might not be able to continue providing a particular service or product, which could adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. Additionally, developing non-infringing technologies would increase our costs. Failure to obtain and retain skilled technical personnel could impede our operations. We require highly skilled personnel to operate and provide technical services and support for our business. Competition for the personnel required for our businesses intensifies as activity increases. In periods of high utilization it may become more difficult to find and retain qualified individuals. This could increase our costs or have other adverse effects on our operations. Severe weather conditions may affect our operations. Our business may be materially affected by severe weather conditions in areas where we operate. This may entail the evacuation of personnel and stoppage of services. In addition, if particularly severe weather affects platforms or structures, this may result in a suspension of activities until the platforms or structures have been repaired. Any of these events could adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. 9 Table of Contents Part 1, Item 1B, 2, 3, 4 Item 1B. Unresolved Staff Comments. None. Item 2. Properties. Schlumberger owns or leases manufacturing facilities, administrative offices, service centers, research centers, data processing centers, sales offices and warehouses throughout the world. No significant lease is scheduled to terminate in the near future, and we believe comparable space is readily obtainable should any lease expire without renewal. We believe our properties are generally well maintained and adequate for their intended use. Outside the United States the principal owned or leased facilities of Oilfield Services are located in Beijing, China; Clamart and Abbeville, France; Fuchinobe, Japan; Oslo, Norway; Singapore; Abingdon, Cambridge and Stonehouse, United Kingdom; and Novosibirsk, Russia.

Market for Schlumberger’s Common Stock, Related Stockholder Matters and Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities. As of January 31, 2010, there were 1,196,589,089 shares of common stock of Schlumberger outstanding, exclusive of 137,623,075 shares held in treasury, and approximately 21,151 stockholders of record. The principal United States market for Schlumberger’s common stock is the NYSE, where it is traded under the symbol “SLB”. Schlumberger’s common stock is also traded on the Euronext Paris, Euronext Amsterdam, London and SIX Swiss stock exchanges. Common Stock, Market Prices and Dividends Declared per Share Quarterly high and low prices for Schlumberger’s common stock as reported by the NYSE (composite transactions), together with dividends declared per share in each quarter of 2009 and 2008, were: Price Range Dividends Declared High Low 2009 QUARTERS First $ 49.25 $ 35.05 $ 0.210 Second 63.78 39.11 0.210 Third 63.00 48.13 0.210 Fourth 71.10 56.00 0.210 2008 QUARTERS First $ 102.71 $ 72.30 $ 0.210 Second 110.11 88.02 0.210 Third 111.95 73.53 0.210 Fourth 78.00 37.07 0.210 There are no legal restrictions on the payment of dividends or ownership or voting of such shares, except as to shares held as treasury stock. Under current legislation, stockholders are not subject to any Netherlands Antilles withholding or other Netherlands Antilles taxes attributable to the ownership of such shares. The following graph compares the yearly percentage change in the cumulative total stockholder return on Schlumberger common stock, assuming reinvestment of dividends on the last day of the month of payment into common stock of Schlumberger, with the cumulative total return on the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index (S&P 500 Index) and the cumulative total return on both the Philadelphia Oil Service Index (OSX) and the Value Line Oilfield Services Industry Index over the five-year period ending on December 31, 2009. Schlumberger is using the Philadelphia Oil Service Index (OSX) to replace the Value Line Oilfield Services Industry Index used in prior years. Schlumberger determined that the new index includes a greater concentration of our most direct competitors. The stockholder return set forth below is not necessarily indicative of future performance. The following graph and related information shall not be deemed “soliciting material” or to be “filed” with the SEC, nor shall such information be incorporated by reference into any future filing under the Securities Act of 1933 or the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, except to the extent that Schlumberger specifically incorporates it by reference into such filing. 12 Table of Contents Part II, Item 5 COMPARISON OF FIVE-YEAR CUMULATIVE TOTAL RETURN AMONG SCHLUMBERGER COMMON STOCK, THE S&P 500 INDEX, THE PHILADELPHIA OIL SERVICE INDEX (OSX) AND THE VALUE LINE OILFIELD SERVICES INDUSTRY INDEX Assumes $100 invested on December 31, 2004 in Schlumberger common stock, in the S&P 500 Index, in the Philadelphia Oil Service Index (OSX), and in the Value Line Oilfield Services Industry Index.

The following selected consolidated financial data should be read in conjunction with both “Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” and “",2023-12-30 19:18:48.656894
87347,SLB,SCHLUMBERGER LIMITED/NV,2012,"Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, and the consolidated financial statements and related notes included in this Form 10-K. We urge you to consider carefully the risks described below, as well as in other reports and materials that we file with the SEC and the other information included or incorporated by reference in this Form 10-K. If any of the risks described below or elsewhere in this Form 10-K were to materialize, our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows or prospects could be materially adversely affected. In such case, the trading price of our common stock could decline and you could lose part or all of your investment. Additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial may also materially adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. Demand for the majority of our services is substantially dependent on the levels of expenditures by the oil and gas industry. A substantial or an extended decline in oil and gas prices could result in lower expenditures by the oil and gas industry, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. Demand for the majority of our services depends substantially on the level of expenditures by the oil and gas industry for the exploration, development and production of oil and natural gas reserves. These expenditures are generally dependent on the industry’s view of future oil and natural gas prices and are sensitive to the industry’s view of future economic growth and the resulting impact on demand for oil and natural gas. Declines, as well as anticipated declines, in oil and gas prices could also result in project modifications, delays or cancellations, general business disruptions, and delays in, or nonpayment of, amounts that are owed to us. These effects could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. The prices for oil and natural gas have historically been volatile and can be affected by a variety of factors, including: 7 Table of Contents — demand for hydrocarbons, which is affected by general economic and business conditions; — the ability of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (“OPEC”) to set and maintain production levels for oil; — oil and gas production levels by non-OPEC countries; — the level of excess production capacity; — political and economic uncertainty and sociopolitical unrest; — the level of worldwide oil and gas exploration and production activity; — access to potential resources; — governmental policies and subsidies; — the costs of exploring for, producing and delivering oil and gas; — technological advances affecting energy consumption; and — weather conditions. The oil and gas industry has historically experienced periodic downturns, which have been characterized by diminished demand for oilfield services and downward pressure on the prices we charge. A significant downturn in the oil and gas industry could result in a reduction in demand for oilfield services and could adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. A significant portion of our revenue is derived from our non-United States operations, which exposes us to risks inherent in doing business in each of the approximately 85 countries in which we operate. Our non-United States operations accounted for approximately 68% of our consolidated revenue in 2011, 76% in 2010 and 84% in 2009. Operations in countries other than the United States are subject to various risks, including: — political and economic conditions in certain areas; — exposure to possible expropriation of our assets or other governmental actions; — social unrest, acts of terrorism, war or other armed conflict; — confiscatory taxation or other adverse tax policies; — deprivation of contract rights; — trade restrictions or embargoes imposed by the United States or other countries; — restrictions under the United States Foreign Corrupt Practices Act or similar legislation in other countries; — restrictions on the repatriation of income or capital; — currency exchange controls; — inflation; and — currency exchange rate fluctuations and devaluations. In addition, we are subject to risks associated with our operations in countries, including Iran, Syria, Sudan and Cuba, that are subject to trade and economic sanctions or other restrictions imposed by the United States or other governments or organizations. United States law enforcement authorities are currently conducting a grand jury investigation and an associated regulatory inquiry related to our operations in certain of these countries. Additionally, in 2009 prior to being acquired by Schlumberger, Smith received an administrative subpoena with respect to its historical business practices in certain countries that are subject to United States trade and economic sanctions. If any of the risks described above materialize, or if any governmental investigation results in criminal or civil penalties or other remedial measures, it could reduce our earnings and our cash available for operations. We are also subject to risks related to investment in our common stock in connection with certain US state divestment or investment limitation legislation applicable to companies with operations in these countries, and similar actions by some private investors, which could adversely affect the market price of our common stock. 8 Table of Contents Our offshore oil and gas operations could be adversely impacted by the Deepwater Horizon drilling rig accident as resulting changes in and compliance with restrictions or regulations on offshore drilling in the US Gulf of Mexico and in other areas around the world may adversely affect our business and operating results. On April 20, 2010, a fire and explosion occurred onboard the semisubmersible drilling rig Deepwater Horizon, owned by Transocean Ltd. and under contract to a subsidiary of BP plc. As a result of the incident and related oil spill, the Secretary of the US Department of the Interior directed the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management, Regulation and Enforcement (“BOEMRE”) to issue a suspension, of deepwater drilling activities, which was lifted on October 12, 2010. In October 2010, BOEMRE, now split into the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management and the Bureau of Safety and Environmental Enforcement, issued new guidelines and regulations regarding safety, environmental matters, drilling equipment and decommissioning applicable to drilling in the US Gulf of Mexico, and may take other additional steps that could result in permitting delays, increased costs of exploration and production and reduced areas of operations which could reduce the demand for our services. At this time, we cannot predict with any certainty what further impact, if any, the Deepwater Horizon incident may have on the regulation of offshore oil and gas exploration and development activity, or on the cost or availability of insurance coverage to cover the risks of such operations. The enactment of new or stricter regulations in the United States and other countries where we operate could adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. Environmental compliance costs and liabilities could reduce our earnings and cash available for operations. We are subject to increasingly stringent laws and regulations relating to importation and use of hazardous materials, radioactive materials and explosives and to environmental protection, including laws and regulations governing air emissions, water discharges and waste management. We incur, and expect to continue to incur, capital and operating costs to comply with environmental laws and regulations. The technical requirements of these laws and regulations are becoming increasingly complex, stringent and expensive to implement. These laws may provide for “strict liability” for remediation costs, damages to natural resources or threats to public health and safety. Strict liability can render a party liable for damages without regard to negligence or fault on the part of the party. Some environmental laws provide for joint and several strict liability for remediation of spills and releases of hazardous substances. We use and generate hazardous substances and wastes in our operations. In addition, many of our current and former properties are, or have been, used for industrial purposes. Accordingly, we could become subject to material liabilities relating to the investigation and cleanup of potentially contaminated properties, and to claims alleging personal injury or property damage as the result of exposures to, or releases of, hazardous substances. In addition, stricter enforcement of existing laws and regulations, new laws and regulations, the discovery of previously unknown contamination or the imposition of new or increased requirements could require us to incur costs or become the basis of new or increased liabilities that could reduce our earnings and our cash available for operations. We believe we are currently in substantial compliance with environmental laws and regulations. We could be subject to substantial liability claims, which could adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. The technical complexities of our operations are such that we are exposed to a wide range of significant health, safety and environmental risks. Our offerings involve production-related activities, radioactive materials, explosives and other equipment and services that are deployed in challenging exploration, development and production environments. An accident involving these services or equipment, or a failure of a product, could cause personal injury, loss of life, damage to property, equipment or the environment, or suspension of operations. Our insurance may not protect us against liability for some kinds of events, including events involving pollution, or against losses resulting from business interruption. Moreover, we may not be able to maintain insurance at levels of risk coverage or policy limits that we deem adequate. Any damages caused by our services or products that are not covered by insurance, or are in excess of policy limits or are subject to substantial deductibles, could adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. 9 Table of Contents Demand for our products and services could be reduced by changes in governmental regulations or in the law. International, national and state governments and agencies are currently evaluating and promulgating climate-related legislation and regulations that are focused on restricting greenhouse gas emissions. Such legislation, as well as government initiatives to conserve energy or to promote the use of alternative energy sources, may significantly curtail production and demand for fossil fuels such as oil and gas in areas of the world where our customers operate and thus adversely affect future demand for our services, which may in turn adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. International, national and state governments and agencies are also currently evaluating and promulgating legislation and regulations that are focused on the extraction of shale gas using hydraulic fracturing. Such legislation or regulations could lead to operational delays and increased costs and, therefore, reduce demand for our pressure pumping services. If additional international, national or state legislation or regulations are enacted, it could adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. If we are unable to maintain technology leadership, this could adversely affect any competitive advantage we hold. If we are unable to develop and produce competitive technology or deliver it to our clients—in a timely and cost-competitive manner in the various markets we serve, it could adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. Limitations on our ability to protect our intellectual property rights, including our trade secrets, could cause a loss in revenue and any competitive advantage we hold. Some of our products or services, and the processes we use to produce or provide them, have been granted patent protection, have patent applications pending or are trade secrets. Our business may be adversely affected if our patents are unenforceable, the claims allowed under our patents are not sufficient to protect our technology, our patent applications are denied, or our trade secrets are not adequately protected. Our competitors may be able to develop technology independently that is similar to ours without infringing on our patents or gaining access to our trade secrets, which could adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. We may be subject to litigation if another party claims that we have infringed upon its intellectual property rights. The tools, techniques, methodologies, programs and components we use to provide our services may infringe upon the intellectual property rights of others. Infringement claims generally result in significant legal and other costs and may distract management from running our core business. Royalty payments under licenses from third parties, if available, would increase our costs. If a license were not available, we might not be able to continue providing a particular service or product, which could adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. Additionally, developing non-infringing technologies would increase our costs. Failure to obtain and retain skilled technical personnel could impede our operations. We require highly skilled personnel to operate and provide technical services and support for our business. Competition for the personnel required for our businesses intensifies as activity increases. In periods of high utilization it may become more difficult to find and retain qualified individuals. This could increase our costs or have other adverse effects on our operations. Severe weather conditions may affect our operations. Our business may be materially affected by severe weather conditions in areas where we operate. This may entail the evacuation of personnel and stoppage of services. In addition, if particularly severe weather affects platforms or structures, this may result in a suspension of activities. Any of these events could adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. 10 Table of Contents Item 1B. Unresolved Staff Comments. None. Item 2. Properties. Schlumberger owns or leases numerous manufacturing facilities, administrative offices, service centers, research centers, data processing centers, mines, ore, drilling fluid and production chemical processing centers, sales offices and warehouses throughout the world.

The information with respect to Item 3. Legal Proceedings is set forth in Note 16 of the Consolidated Financial Statements. Item 4. Mine Safety Disclosures. The barite and bentonite mining operations of M-I LLC, which, following our acquisition of Smith, became an indirect wholly-owned subsidiary, are subject to regulation by the federal Mine Safety and Health Administration under the Federal Mine Safety and Health Act of 1977. Information concerning mine safety violations or other regulatory matters required by section 1503(a) of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act and Item 104 of Regulation S-K is included in Exhibit 95 to this Report. 11 Table of Contents PART II Item 5. Market for Schlumberger’s Common Stock, Related Stockholder Matters and Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities. As of December 31, 2011, there were approximately 23,719 stockholders of record. The principal United States market for Schlumberger’s common stock is the NYSE, where it is traded under the symbol “SLB,” although it is traded on other exchanges in and outside the United States, including the Euronext Paris, the London Stock Exchange and the SIX Swiss Exchange. Common Stock, Market Prices and Dividends Declared per Share Quarterly high and low prices for Schlumberger’s common stock as reported by the NYSE (composite transactions), together with dividends declared per share in each quarter of 2011 and 2010, were: Price Range DividendsDeclared High Low 2011 QUARTERS First $ 95.64 $ 79.74 $ 0.25 Second 95.00 79.55 0.25 Third 95.53 58.77 0.25 Fourth 77.65 54.79 0.25 2010 QUARTERS First $ 72.00 $ 59.42 $ 0.21 Second 73.99 51.67 0.21 Third 63.72 52.91 0.21 Fourth 84.11 60.57 0.21 On January 19, 2012, Schlumberger announced that its Board of Directors had approved an increase in the quarterly dividend of 10%, to $0.275.

Demand for the majority of our services depends substantially on the level of expenditures by the oil and gas industry for the exploration, development and production of oil and natural gas reserves. These expenditures are generally dependent on the industry’s view of future oil and natural gas prices and are sensitive to the industry’s view of future economic growth and the resulting impact on demand for oil and natural gas. Declines, as well as anticipated declines, in oil and gas prices could also result in project modifications, delays or cancellations, general business disruptions, and delays in payment of, or nonpayment of, amounts that are owed to us. These effects could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. The prices for oil and natural gas have historically been volatile and can be affected by a variety of factors, including: — demand for hydrocarbons, which is affected by general economic and business conditions; — the ability of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (“OPEC”) to set and maintain production levels for oil; — oil and gas production levels by non-OPEC countries; — the level of excess production capacity; — political and economic uncertainty and geopolitical unrest; — the level of worldwide oil and gas exploration and production activity; — access to potential resources; 7 — governmental policies and subsidies; — the costs of exploring for, producing and delivering oil and gas; — technological advances affecting energy consumption; and — weather conditions. The oil and gas industry has historically experienced periodic downturns, which have been characterized by diminished demand for oilfield services and downward pressure on the prices we charge. A significant downturn in the oil and gas industry could result in a reduction in demand for oilfield services and could adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. A significant portion of our revenue is derived from our non-United States operations, which exposes us to risks inherent in doing business in each of the approximately 85 countries in which we operate. Our non-United States operations accounted for approximately 72% of our consolidated revenue in 2012, 71% in 2011 and 78% in 2010. Operations in countries other than the United States are subject to various risks, including: — political and economic conditions in certain areas; — exposure to possible expropriation of our assets or other governmental actions; — social unrest, acts of terrorism, war or other armed conflict; — confiscatory taxation or other adverse tax policies; — deprivation of contract rights; — trade restrictions or embargoes imposed by the United States or other countries; — restrictions under the United States Foreign Corrupt Practices Act or similar legislation in other countries; — restrictions on the repatriation of income or capital; — currency exchange controls; — inflation; and — currency exchange rate fluctuations and devaluations. In addition, we are subject to risks associated with our operations in countries, including Iran, Syria, North Sudan and Cuba, that are subject to trade and economic sanctions or other restrictions imposed by the United States or other governments or organizations. United States law enforcement authorities are currently conducting a grand jury investigation and an associated regulatory inquiry related to our operations in certain of these countries. Additionally, in 2009 prior to being acquired by Schlumberger, Smith International, Inc. received an administrative subpoena with respect to its historical business practices in certain countries that are subject to United States trade and economic sanctions. If any of the risks described above materialize, or if any governmental investigation results in criminal or civil penalties or other remedial measures, it could reduce our earnings and our cash available for operations. We are also subject to risks related to investment in our common stock in connection with certain US state divestment or investment limitation legislation applicable to companies with operations in these countries, and similar actions by some private investors, which could adversely affect the market price of our common stock. During 2012, certain non-U.S. subsidiaries of Schlumberger provided oilfield services to the National Iranian Oil Company and certain of its affiliates (“NIOC”). Schlumberger has not bid on any new contracts relating to Iran’s petroleum production since March 2009. Schlumberger’s full-year 2012 revenue attributable to this activity was $418 million, which resulted in net income of $208 million in its consolidated financial statements. Schlumberger intends to discontinue such activity in Iran in 2013 and is currently winding down its operations there. In this regard, during the fourth quarter of 2012, Schlumberger recorded revenue relating to this activity in Iran of $92 million and net income of $48 million in its consolidated financial statements. This activity included obtaining services from and engaging in other dealings with the government of Iran that are incidental to operating in Iran, and the expenses of which are reflected in the net income disclosed above. These services and other dealings consisted of paying taxes, duties, license fees and other typical governmental charges, along with payments for utilities, transportation, hotel accommodations, facility rentals, 8 telecommunications services, newspaper advertisements, recreational and fitness memberships, and the purchase of routine office and similar supplies from entities associated with the government of Iran. Collections of amounts owed to Schlumberger were received in part by depository accounts held by two non-U.S. subsidiaries of Schlumberger at a branch of Bank Saderat Iran (“Saderat”), and in part by a depositary account held by one of such non-U.S. subsidiaries at Bank Tejarat (“Tejarat”) in Tehran. The accounts at Saderat are maintained solely for the deposit by NIOC of amounts owed to non-U.S. subsidiaries of Schlumberger. The account at Tejarat is maintained also for payment of expenses in connection with operating in Iran, such as payroll expenses, rental payments and taxes. In addition, NIOC maintains bank accounts at Bank Melli Iran (“Melli”) through which it made payments to a non-U.S. subsidiary of Schlumberger for services provided in Iran under letters of credit issued by Melli. Schlumberger maintains no bank accounts at Melli. Schlumberger will discontinue its dealings with Melli, Saderat and Tejarat following the receipt of all amounts owed to Schlumberger for services in Iran. Environmental compliance costs and liabilities could reduce our earnings and cash available for operations. We are subject to increasingly stringent laws and regulations relating to importation and use of hazardous materials, radioactive materials and explosives and to environmental protection, including laws and regulations governing air emissions, water discharges and waste management. We incur, and expect to continue to incur, capital and operating costs to comply with environmental laws and regulations. The technical requirements of these laws and regulations are becoming increasingly complex, stringent and expensive to implement. These laws may provide for “strict liability” for remediation costs, damages to natural resources or threats to public health and safety. Strict liability can render a party liable for damages without regard to negligence or fault on the part of the party. Some environmental laws provide for joint and several strict liability for remediation of spills and releases of hazardous substances. We use and generate hazardous substances and wastes in our operations. In addition, many of our current and former properties are, or have been, used for industrial purposes. Accordingly, we could become subject to material liabilities relating to the investigation and cleanup of potentially contaminated properties, and to claims alleging personal injury or property damage as the result of exposures to, or releases of, hazardous substances. In addition, stricter enforcement of existing laws and regulations, new laws and regulations, the discovery of previously unknown contamination or the imposition of new or increased requirements could require us to incur costs or become the basis of new or increased liabilities that could reduce our earnings and our cash available for operations. We believe we are currently in substantial compliance with environmental laws and regulations. We could be subject to substantial liability claims, which could adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. The technical complexities of our operations are such that we are exposed to a wide range of significant health, safety and environmental risks. Our offerings involve production-related activities, radioactive materials, explosives and other equipment and services that are deployed in challenging exploration, development and production environments. An accident involving these services or equipment, or a failure of a product, could cause personal injury, loss of life, damage to or destruction of property, equipment or the environment, or suspension of operations. Our insurance may not protect us against liability for some kinds of events, including events involving pollution, or against losses resulting from business interruption. Moreover, we may not be able to maintain insurance at levels of risk coverage or policy limits that we deem adequate. Any damages caused by our services or products that are not covered by insurance, or are in excess of policy limits or are subject to substantial deductibles, could adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. Demand for our products and services could be reduced by changes in governmental regulations or in the law. Some international, national and state governments and agencies are currently evaluating and promulgating climate-related legislation and regulations that are focused on restricting greenhouse gas emissions. Such legislation, as well as government initiatives to conserve energy or to promote the use of alternative energy sources, may significantly curtail demand for and production of fossil fuels such as oil and gas in areas of the world where our customers operate and thus adversely affect future demand for our services, which may in turn adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. Some international, national and state governments and agencies have also adopted laws and regulations or are evaluating proposed legislation and regulations that are focused on the extraction of shale gas or oil using hydraulic fracturing. Hydraulic fracturing is a stimulation treatment routinely performed on oil and gas wells in low-permeability reservoirs. Specially engineered fluids are pumped at high pressure and rate into the reservoir interval to be treated, 9 causing cracks in the target formation. Proppant, such as sand of a particular size, is mixed with the treatment fluid to keep the cracks open when the treatment is complete. Future hydraulic fracturing-related legislation or regulations could lead to operational delays and increased costs and, therefore, reduce demand for our pressure pumping services. If such additional international, national or state legislation or regulations are enacted, it could adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. If we are unable to maintain technology leadership, this could adversely affect any competitive advantage we hold. If we are unable to continue to develop and produce competitive technology or deliver it to our clients in a timely and cost-competitive manner in the various markets we serve, it could adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. Limitations on our ability to protect our intellectual property rights, including our trade secrets, could cause a loss in revenue and any competitive advantage we hold. Some of our products or services, and the processes we use to produce or provide them, have been granted patent protection, have patent applications pending or are trade secrets. Our business may be adversely affected if our patents are unenforceable, the claims allowed under our patents are not sufficient to protect our technology, our patent applications are denied, or our trade secrets are not adequately protected. Our competitors may be able to develop technology independently that is similar to ours without infringing on our patents or gaining access to our trade secrets, which could adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. We may be subject to litigation if another party claims that we have infringed upon its intellectual property rights. The tools, techniques, methodologies, programs and components we use to provide our services may infringe upon the intellectual property rights of others. Infringement claims generally result in significant legal and other costs and may distract management from running our core business. Royalty payments under licenses from third parties, if available, would increase our costs. If a license were not available, we might not be able to continue providing a particular service or product, which could adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. Additionally, developing non-infringing technologies would increase our costs. Failure to obtain and retain skilled technical personnel could impede our operations. We require highly skilled personnel to operate and provide technical services and support for our business. Competition for the personnel required for our businesses intensifies as activity increases. In periods of high utilization it may become more difficult to find and retain qualified individuals. This could increase our costs or have other adverse effects on our operations. Severe weather conditions may affect our operations. Our business may be materially affected by severe weather conditions in areas where we operate. This may entail the evacuation of personnel and stoppage of services. In addition, if particularly severe weather affects platforms or structures, this may result in a suspension of activities. Any of these events could adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. Item 1B. Unresolved Staff Comments. None. Item 2. Properties. Schlumberger owns or leases numerous manufacturing facilities, administrative offices, service centers, research centers, data processing centers, mines, ore, drilling fluid and production chemical processing centers, sales offices and warehouses throughout the world. Schlumberger views its principal manufacturing, mining and processing facilities, research centers and data processing centers as its “principal owned or leased facilities.” 10 The following sets forth Schlumberger’s principal owned or leased facilities: Beijing, China; Clamart, France; Mumbai, India; Fuchinobe, Japan; Oslo, Norway; Singapore; Abingdon, Cambridge and Stonehouse, United Kingdom; Moscow, Russia; and within the United States: Boston, Massachusetts; Houston, Rosharon and Sugar Land, Texas; Battle Mountain, Nevada; Greybull, Wyoming and Florence, Kentucky. Item 3. Legal Proceedings. The information with respect to Item 3. Legal Proceedings is set forth in Note 16 of the Consolidated Financial Statements. Item 4. Mine Safety Disclosures. The barite and bentonite mining operations of M-I LLC, an indirect wholly-owned subsidiary, are subject to regulation by the federal Mine Safety and Health Administration under the Federal Mine Safety and Health Act of 1977. Information concerning mine safety violations or other regulatory matters required by section 1503(a) of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act and Item 104 of Regulation S-K is included in Exhibit 95 to this Form 10-K. 11 PART II Item 5. Market for Schlumberger’s Common Stock, Related Stockholder Matters and Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities. As of December 31, 2012, there were approximately 22,455 stockholders of record. The principal United States market for Schlumberger’s common stock is the NYSE, where it is traded under the symbol “SLB,” although it is traded on other exchanges in and outside the United States, including the Euronext Paris, the London Stock Exchange and the SIX Swiss Exchange. Common Stock, Market Prices and Dividends Declared per Share Quarterly high and low prices for Schlumberger’s common stock as reported by the NYSE (composite transactions), together with dividends declared per share in each quarter of 2012 and 2011, were: Price Range Dividends Declared High Low 2012 QUARTERS First $ 80.78 $ 67.12 $ 0.275 Second 76.19 59.12 0.275 Third 78.47 64.19 0.275 Fourth 75.70 66.85 0.275 2011 QUARTERS First $ 95.64 $ 79.74 $ 0.25 Second 95.00 79.55 0.25 Third 95.53 58.77 0.25 Fourth 77.65 54.79 0.25 On January 17, 2013, Schlumberger announced that its Board of Directors had approved an increase in the quarterly dividend of 13.6%, to $0.3125. There are no legal restrictions on the payment of dividends or ownership or voting of such shares, except as to shares held as treasury stock. Under current legislation, stockholders are not subject to any Curaçao withholding or other Curaçao taxes attributable to the ownership of such shares. The following graph compares the cumulative total stockholder return on Schlumberger common stock, assuming reinvestment of dividends on the last day of the month of payment into common stock of Schlumberger, with the cumulative total return on the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index (S&P 500 Index) and the cumulative total return on the Philadelphia Oil Service Index (OSX) over the five-year period ended December 31, 2012. The stockholder return set forth below is not necessarily indicative of future performance. The following graph and related information shall not be deemed “soliciting material” or to be “filed” with the SEC, nor shall such information be incorporated by reference into any future filing under the Securities Act of 1933 or the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, except to the extent that Schlumberger specifically incorporates it by reference into such filing. 12 Comparison of five-year cumulative total return among Schlumberger common stock, the S&P 500 Index and the Philadelphia Oil Service Index (OSX) Assumes $100 invested on December 31, 2007 in Schlumberger common stock, in the S&P 500 Index and in the Philadelphia Oil Service Index (OSX) and reinvestment of dividends on the last day of the month of payment. Share Repurchases On April 17, 2008, the Schlumberger Board of Directors approved an $8 billion share repurchase program for Schlumberger common stock, to be acquired in the open market before December 31, 2011. On July 21, 2011, the Board of Directors approved an extension of this repurchase program to December 31, 2013. Schlumberger did not repurchase any common stock during the three months ended December 31, 2012. The maximum value of shares that may be purchased under this program as of December 31, 2012 was $879 million. In connection with the exercise of stock options under Schlumberger’s incentive compensation plans, Schlumberger routinely receives shares of its common stock from optionholders in consideration of the exercise price of the stock options. Schlumberger does not view these transactions as requiring disclosure under this Item 5 as the number of shares of Schlumberger common stock received from optionholders is not material. Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities As discussed in Note 13 of the Consolidated Financial Statements, Schlumberger maintains a Discounted Stock Purchase Plan (the “DSPP”), which was established in 1988. The DSPP provides for two purchase periods each calendar year: January 1 to June 30 and July 1 to December 31. Schlumberger filed registration statements with the SEC to register the shares initially available for purchase under the DSPP as well as to register additional shares that were approved by Schlumberger stockholders in 2005. In 2010, Schlumberger stockholders approved an amendment to the DSPP that, among other things, increased the number of shares available for purchase under the DSPP by 10,000,000 shares. In December 2012, Schlumberger discovered that it had inadvertently failed to file a registration statement with the SEC to register the additional DSPP shares approved in 2010. In December 2012, Schlumberger registered the sale of the shares that remain available for purchase under the DSPP. Prior to such registration, however, some of the shares Schlumberger sold under the DSPP were unregistered. With respect to the six-month 13 purchase period ending June 30, 2012, 2,197,151 unregistered shares were sold at a discounted purchase price of $59.89 per share, resulting in cash proceeds of approximately $132 million. The Company believes that it has historically provided participants in the DSPP with the same information they would have received had the registration statement been filed. Nonetheless, original purchasers of the unregistered shares may have rescission rights with respect to the shares purchased by them with respect to the six-month purchase period ended June 30, 2012. Schlumberger believes that any liability resulting from a potential rescission would be immaterial, particularly in light of the fact that the market price of Schlumberger’s common stock has exceeded the participants’ discounted purchase price since the date of purchase. Item 6. Selected Financial Data. The following selected consolidated financial data should be read in conjunction with both “Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” and “",2023-12-30 19:18:35.065452
87347,SLB,SCHLUMBERGER LIMITED/NV,2014,"Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, and the Consolidated Financial Statements and related notes included in this Form 10-K. We urge you to consider carefully the risks described below, as well as in other reports and materials that we file with the SEC and the other information included or incorporated by reference in this Form 10-K. If any of the risks described below or elsewhere in this Form 10-K were to materialize, our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows or prospects could be materially adversely affected. In such case, the trading price of our common stock could decline and you could lose part or all of your investment. Additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial may also materially adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. Demand for the majority of our services is substantially dependent on the levels of expenditures by the oil and gas industry. A substantial or an extended decline in oil and gas prices could result in lower expenditures by the oil and gas industry, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. Demand for the majority of our services depends substantially on the level of expenditures by the oil and gas industry for the exploration, development and production of oil and natural gas reserves. These expenditures are generally dependent on the industry’s view of future oil and natural gas prices and are sensitive to the industry’s view of future economic growth and the resulting impact on demand for oil and natural gas. Declines, as well as anticipated declines, in oil and gas prices could also result in project modifications, delays or cancellations, general business disruptions, and delays in payment of, or nonpayment of, amounts that are owed to us. These effects could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. The prices for oil and natural gas have historically been volatile and can be affected by a variety of factors, including: —demand for hydrocarbons, which is affected by general economic and business conditions; —the ability of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (“OPEC”) to set and maintain production levels for oil; —oil and gas production levels by non-OPEC countries; —the level of excess production capacity; —political and economic uncertainty and geopolitical unrest; —the level of worldwide oil and gas exploration and production activity; —access to potential resources; —governmental policies and subsidies; —the costs of exploring for, producing and delivering oil and gas; —technological advances affecting energy consumption; and —weather conditions. The oil and gas industry has historically experienced periodic downturns, which have been characterized by diminished demand for oilfield services and downward pressure on the prices we charge. A significant downturn in the oil and gas industry could result in a reduction in demand for oilfield services and could adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. A significant portion of our revenue is derived from our non-United States operations, which exposes us to risks inherent in doing business in each of the approximately 85 countries in which we operate. Our non-United States operations accounted for approximately 73% of our consolidated revenue in 2013, 72% in 2012 and 71% in 2011. Operations in countries other than the United States are subject to various risks, including: —political and economic conditions in certain areas; —exposure to possible expropriation of our assets or other governmental actions; —social unrest, acts of terrorism, war or other armed conflict; —confiscatory taxation or other adverse tax policies; —deprivation of contract rights; —trade restrictions or embargoes imposed by the United States or other countries; —restrictions under the United States Foreign Corrupt Practices Act or similar legislation in other countries; —restrictions on the repatriation of income or capital; 7 —currency exchange controls; —inflation; and —currency exchange rate fluctuations and devaluations. In addition, we are subject to risks associated with our operations in countries, including Sudan and Cuba, that are subject to trade and economic sanctions or other restrictions imposed by the United States or other governments or organizations. United States law enforcement authorities are currently conducting a grand jury investigation and an associated regulatory inquiry related to our historical operations in countries that are subject to United States trade and economic sanctions. If any of the risks described above materialize, or if any governmental investigation results in criminal or civil penalties or other remedial measures, it could reduce our earnings and our cash available for operations. We are also subject to risks related to investment in our common stock in connection with certain US state divestment or investment limitation legislation applicable to companies with operations in these countries, and similar actions by some private investors, which could adversely affect the market price of our common stock. During 2013, certain non-US subsidiaries of Schlumberger provided oilfield services to the National Iranian Oil Company and certain of its affiliates (“NIOC”). Schlumberger’s 2013 revenue attributable to this activity was $102 million, which resulted in a net loss of $69 million. During the second quarter of 2013, Schlumberger completed the wind down of its service operations in Iran. As a result, Schlumberger has reclassified the results of this business as a discontinued operation. All prior periods have been restated accordingly. Schlumberger’s activity in Iran during 2013 included obtaining services from and engaging in other dealings with the government of Iran that were incidental to operating in Iran, and the expenses of which are reflected in the results disclosed above. These services and other dealings consisted of paying taxes, duties, license fees and other typical governmental charges, along with payments for utilities, transportation, hotel accommodations, facility rentals, telecommunications services, newspaper advertisements, recreational and fitness memberships, and the purchase of routine office and similar supplies from entities associated with the government of Iran. Collections of amounts owed to Schlumberger for services rendered in Iran were received in part by depository accounts held by two non-US subsidiaries of Schlumberger at a branch of Bank Saderat Iran (“Saderat”), and in part by a depositary account held by one of such non-US subsidiaries at Bank Tejarat (“Tejarat”) in Tehran. The accounts at Tejarat are also used in connection with payment of expenses incidental to collection of amounts owed to Schlumberger for prior services. The accounts at Saderat are maintained solely for the deposit by NIOC of amounts owed to non-US subsidiaries of Schlumberger for prior services. One of the non-US subsidiaries also maintained a depository account at Bank Sarmayeh (“Sarmayeh”) which, together with the account at Tejarat, was maintained for the payment of expenses such as payroll expenses, rental payments and taxes. In addition, NIOC maintained bank accounts at Bank Melli Iran (“Melli”) through which it made payments to a non-US subsidiary of Schlumberger for services provided in Iran under letters of credit issued by Melli. Schlumberger maintains no bank accounts at Melli. Schlumberger has discontinued dealings with Melli and Sarmayeh, and anticipates that it will discontinue its dealings with Saderat and Tejarat following the receipt of all amounts owed to Schlumberger for prior services rendered in Iran. Environmental compliance costs and liabilities could reduce our earnings and cash available for operations. We are subject to increasingly stringent laws and regulations relating to importation and use of hazardous materials, radioactive materials and explosives and to environmental protection, including laws and regulations governing air emissions, hydraulic fracturing, water discharges and waste management. We incur, and expect to continue to incur, capital and operating costs to comply with environmental laws and regulations.

In addition, stricter enforcement of existing laws and regulations, new laws and regulations, the discovery of previously unknown contamination or the imposition of new or increased requirements could require us to incur costs or become the basis of new or increased liabilities that could reduce our earnings and our cash available for operations. 8 We could be subject to substantial liability claims, which could adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. The technical complexities of our operations are such that we are exposed to a wide range of significant health, safety and environmental risks. Our offerings involve production-related activities, radioactive materials, explosives and other equipment and services that are deployed in challenging exploration, development and production environments. An accident involving these services or equipment, or a failure of a product, could cause personal injury, loss of life, damage to or destruction of property, equipment or the environment, or suspension of operations. Our insurance may not protect us against liability for some kinds of events, including events involving pollution, or against losses resulting from business interruption. Moreover, we may not be able to maintain insurance at levels of risk coverage or policy limits that we deem adequate.

87347,SLB,SCHLUMBERGER LIMITED/NV,2015,"Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, and the Consolidated Financial Statements and related notes included in this Form 10-K. We urge you to consider carefully the risks described below, as well as in other reports and materials that we file with the SEC and the other information included or incorporated by reference in this Form 10-K. If any of the risks described below or elsewhere in this Form 10-K were to materialize, our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows or prospects could be materially adversely affected. In such case, the trading price of our common stock could decline and you could lose part or all of your investment. Additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial may also materially adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. Demand for the majority of our services is substantially dependent on the levels of expenditures by the oil and gas industry. A substantial or an extended decline in oil and gas prices could result in lower expenditures by the oil and gas industry, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. Demand for the majority of our services depends substantially on the level of expenditures by the oil and gas industry for the exploration, development and production of oil and natural gas reserves. These expenditures are generally dependent on the industry’s view of future oil and natural gas prices and are sensitive to the industry’s view of future economic growth and the resulting impact on demand for oil and natural gas. Declines, as well as anticipated declines, in oil and gas prices could also result in project modifications, delays or cancellations, general business disruptions, and delays in payment of, or nonpayment of, amounts that are owed to us. These effects could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. The prices for oil and natural gas have historically been volatile and can be affected by a variety of factors, including: ● demand for hydrocarbons, which is affected by general economic and business conditions; ● the ability or willingness of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (“OPEC”) to set and maintain production levels for oil; ● oil and gas production levels by non-OPEC countries; ● the level of excess production capacity; ● political and economic uncertainty and geopolitical unrest; ● the level of worldwide oil and gas exploration and production activity; ● access to potential resources; ● governmental policies and subsidies; ● the costs of exploring for, producing and delivering oil and gas; ● technological advances affecting energy consumption; and ● weather conditions. The oil and gas industry has historically experienced periodic downturns, which have been characterized by diminished demand for oilfield services and downward pressure on the prices we charge. A significant downturn in the oil and gas industry could result in a reduction in demand for oilfield services and could adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. A significant portion of our revenue is derived from our non-United States operations, which exposes us to risks inherent in doing business in each of the approximately 85 countries in which we operate. Our non-United States operations accounted for approximately 71% of our consolidated revenue in 2014, 73% in 2013 and 72% in 2012. Operations in countries other than the United States are subject to various risks, including: ● political and economic conditions in certain areas; ● exposure to possible expropriation of our assets or other governmental actions; ● social unrest, acts of terrorism, war or other armed conflict; ● confiscatory taxation or other adverse tax policies; ● deprivation of contract rights; ● trade and economic sanctions or other restrictions imposed by the European Union, the United States or other countries; 7 ● restrictions under the United States Foreign Corrupt Practices Act or similar legislation in other countries; ● restrictions on the repatriation of income or capital; ● currency exchange controls; ● inflation; and ● currency exchange rate fluctuations and devaluations. During the fourth quarter of 2014, Schlumberger completed the wind down of its operations in the Republic of Sudan. As previously disclosed, during the second quarter of 2013, Schlumberger completed the wind down of its service operations in Iran. Prior to this, certain non-US subsidiaries of Schlumberger provided oilfield services to the National Iranian Oil Company and certain of its affiliates (“NIOC”). Schlumberger has reclassified the results of this business as a discontinued operation. All prior periods have been restated accordingly. Schlumberger’s residual transactions or dealings with the government of Iran during 2014 consisted of payments of taxes and other typical governmental charges. Two non-US subsidiaries of Schlumberger maintained depository accounts at the Dubai branch of Bank Saderat Iran (“Saderat”), and at Bank Tejarat (“Tejarat”) in Tehran for the deposit by NIOC of amounts owed to non-US subsidiaries of Schlumberger for prior services rendered in Iran. One non-US subsidiary also maintains an account at Tejarat for payment of local expenses such as taxes and utilities. Schlumberger anticipates that it will discontinue its dealings with Saderat and Tejarat following the receipt of all amounts owed to Schlumberger for prior services rendered in Iran. Environmental compliance costs and liabilities could reduce our earnings and cash available for operations. We are subject to increasingly stringent laws and regulations relating to importation and use of hazardous materials, radioactive materials, chemicals and explosives and to environmental protection, including laws and regulations governing air emissions, hydraulic fracturing, water discharges and waste management. We incur, and expect to continue to incur, capital and operating costs to comply with environmental laws and regulations. The technical requirements of these laws and regulations are becoming increasingly complex, stringent and expensive to implement. These laws may provide for “strict liability” for remediation costs, damages to natural resources or threats to public health and safety. Strict liability can render a party liable for damages without regard to negligence or fault on the part of the party. Some environmental laws provide for joint and several strict liability for remediation of spills and releases of hazardous substances. We use and generate hazardous substances and wastes in our operations. In addition, many of our current and former properties are, or have been, used for industrial purposes. Accordingly, we could become subject to material liabilities relating to the investigation and cleanup of potentially contaminated properties, and to claims alleging personal injury or property damage as the result of exposures to, or releases of, hazardous substances. In addition, stricter enforcement of existing laws and regulations, new laws and regulations, the discovery of previously unknown contamination or the imposition of new or increased requirements could require us to incur costs or become the basis of new or increased liabilities that could reduce our earnings and our cash available for operations. We could be subject to substantial liability claims, which could adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. The technical complexities of our operations expose us to a wide range of significant health, safety and environmental risks. Our offerings involve production-related activities, radioactive materials, chemicals, explosives and other equipment and services that are deployed in challenging exploration, development and production environments. An accident involving these services or equipment, or a failure of a product, could cause personal injury, loss of life, damage to or destruction of property, equipment or the environment, or suspension of operations. Our insurance may not protect us against liability for some kinds of events, including events involving pollution, or against losses resulting from business interruption. Moreover, we may not be able to maintain insurance at levels of risk coverage or policy limits that we deem adequate. Any damages caused by our services or products that are not covered by insurance, or are in excess of policy limits or are subject to substantial deductibles, could adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. Demand for our products and services could be reduced by changes in governmental regulations or in the law. 8 Existing or future legislation and regulations related to greenhouse gas emissions and climate change, as well as government initiatives to conserve energy or promote the use of alternative energy sources, may significantly curtail demand for and production of fossil fuels such as oil and gas in areas of the world where our customers operate and thus adversely affect future demand for our services. This may, in turn, adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. Some international, national, state and local governments and agencies have also adopted laws and regulations or are evaluating proposed legislation and regulations that are focused on the extraction of shale gas or oil using hydraulic fracturing. Hydraulic fracturing is a stimulation treatment routinely performed on oil and gas wells in low-permeability reservoirs. Specially engineered fluids are pumped at high pressure and rate into the reservoir interval to be treated, causing cracks in the target formation. Proppant, such as sand of a particular size, is mixed with the treatment fluid to keep the cracks open when the treatment is complete. Future hydraulic fracturing-related legislation or regulations could limit or ban hydraulic fracturing, or lead to operational delays and increased costs, and therefore reduce demand for our pressure pumping services. If such additional international, national, state or local legislation or regulations are enacted, it could adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. If we are unable to maintain technology leadership, this could adversely affect any competitive advantage we hold. If we are unable to continue to develop and produce competitive technology or deliver it to our clients in a timely and cost-competitive manner in the various markets we serve, it could adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. Limitations on our ability to protect our intellectual property rights, including our trade secrets, could cause a loss in revenue and any competitive advantage we hold. Some of our products or services, and the processes we use to produce or provide them, have been granted patent protection, have patent applications pending or are trade secrets. Our business may be adversely affected if our patents are unenforceable, the claims allowed under our patents are not sufficient to protect our technology, our patent applications are denied, or our trade secrets are not adequately protected. Our competitors may be able to develop technology independently that is similar to ours without infringing on our patents or gaining access to our trade secrets, which could adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. We may be subject to litigation if another party claims that we have infringed upon its intellectual property rights. The tools, techniques, methodologies, programs and components we use to provide our services may infringe upon the intellectual property rights of others. Infringement claims generally result in significant legal and other costs and may distract management from running our core business. Royalty payments under licenses from third parties, if available, would increase our costs. Additionally, developing non-infringing technologies would increase our costs. If a license were not available, we might not be able to continue providing a particular service or product, which could adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. Failure to obtain and retain skilled technical personnel could impede our operations. We require highly skilled personnel to operate and provide technical services and support for our business. Competition for the personnel required for our businesses intensifies as activity increases. In periods of high utilization it may become more difficult to find and retain qualified individuals. This could increase our costs or have other adverse effects on our operations. Severe weather conditions may affect our operations. Our business may be materially affected by severe weather conditions in areas where we operate. This may entail the evacuation of personnel and stoppage of services. In addition, if particularly severe weather affects platforms or structures, this may result in a suspension of activities. Any of these events could adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. Cyber attacks could affect our business. If our systems for protecting against cybersecurity risks are circumvented or breached, this could result in the loss of our intellectual property or other proprietary information, including customer data, and disruption of our business operations.

Share Repurchases On July 18, 2013, the Schlumberger Board of Directors approved a $10 billion share repurchase program for Schlumberger common stock, to be completed at the latest by June 30, 2018. Schlumberger is accelerating this share repurchase program with the aim of completing it in 2.5 years as compared to the original target of 5 years.

87347,SLB,SCHLUMBERGER LIMITED/NV,2016,"Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, and the Consolidated Financial Statements and related notes included in this Form 10-K. We urge you to consider carefully the risks described below, as well as in other reports and materials that we file with the SEC and the other information included or incorporated by reference in this Form 10-K. If any of the risks described below or elsewhere in this Form 10-K were to materialize, our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows or prospects could be materially adversely affected. In such case, the trading price of our common stock could decline and you could lose part or all of your investment. Additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial may also materially adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. Demand for the majority of our services is substantially dependent on the levels of expenditures by the oil and gas industry. The current significant oil and gas industry downturn has resulted in reduced demand for oilfield services, which has had, and may continue to have, a significant adverse impact on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. If these conditions worsen or oil and gas prices do not improve, further reductions in spending by the oil and gas industry could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. Demand for the majority of our services depends substantially on the level of expenditures by the oil and gas industry for the exploration, development and production of oil and natural gas reserves. These expenditures are generally dependent on the industry’s view of future oil and natural gas prices and are sensitive to the industry’s view of future economic growth and the resulting impact on demand for oil and natural gas. Since 2014, oil and gas prices have declined significantly, resulting in lower expenditures by the oil and gas industry. As a result, many of our customers have reduced or delayed their oil and gas exploration and production spending, reducing the demand for our services and exerting downward pressure on the prices that we charge. These conditions have had, and may continue to have, an adverse impact on our financial condition. Continued low oil and gas prices or a further decline in oil and gas prices could cause a reduction in cash flows for our customers, which could have significant adverse effects on the financial condition of some of our customers. This could result in project modifications, delays or cancellations, general business disruptions, and delays in payment of, or nonpayment of, amounts that are owed to us. These effects could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. The prices for oil and natural gas have historically been volatile and can be affected by a variety of factors, including: ● demand for hydrocarbons, which is affected by general economic and business conditions; ● the ability or willingness of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (“OPEC”) to set and maintain production levels for oil; ● oil and gas production levels by non-OPEC countries; ● the level of excess production capacity; ● political and economic uncertainty and geopolitical unrest; ● the level of worldwide oil and gas exploration and production activity; ● access to potential resources; ● governmental policies and subsidies; ● the costs of exploring for, producing and delivering oil and gas; ● technological advances affecting energy consumption; and ● weather conditions. There can be no assurance that the demand or pricing for oil and natural gas will follow historic patterns or recover in the near term. Continued or worsening conditions in the oil and gas industry could further adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. 7 A significant portion of our revenue is derived from our non-United States operations, which exposes us to risks inherent in doing business in each of the approximately 85 countries in which we operate. Our non-United States operations accounted for approximately 76% of our consolidated revenue in 2015, 71% in 2014 and 73% in 2013. Operations in countries other than the United States are subject to various risks, including: ● volatility in political, social and economic conditions in certain areas; ● exposure to possible expropriation of our assets or other governmental actions; ● social unrest, acts of terrorism, war or other armed conflict; ● confiscatory taxation or other adverse tax policies; ● deprivation of contract rights; ● trade and economic sanctions or other restrictions imposed by the European Union, the United States or other countries; ● restrictions under the United States Foreign Corrupt Practices Act or similar legislation in other countries; ● restrictions on the repatriation of income or capital; ● currency exchange controls; ● inflation; and ● currency exchange rate fluctuations and devaluations. We completed the wind down of our service operations in Iran during the second quarter of 2013. Prior to this, certain of our non-US subsidiaries provided oilfield services to the National Iranian Oil Company and certain of its affiliates (“NIOC”). We have reclassified the results of this business as a discontinued operation. All prior periods have been restated accordingly. Our residual transactions or dealings with the government of Iran during 2015 consisted of payments of taxes and other typical governmental charges. Certain of our non-US subsidiaries maintained depository accounts at the Dubai branch of Bank Saderat Iran (“Saderat”), and at Bank Tejarat (“Tejarat”) in Tehran and in Kish for the deposit by NIOC of amounts owed to non-US subsidiaries of Schlumberger for prior services rendered in Iran and for the maintenance of such amounts previously received. One non-US subsidiary also maintains an account at Tejarat for payment of local expenses such as taxes and utilities. We anticipate that we will discontinue our dealings with Saderat and Tejarat following the receipt of all amounts owed to us for prior services rendered in Iran. Our failure to comply with Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (“FCPA”) and other laws could have a negative impact on our ongoing operations. We are subject to complex US and foreign laws and regulations, such as the FCPA, the U.K. Bribery Act and various other anti-bribery and anti-corruption laws. We are also subject to trade sanction laws that restrict certain operations in various countries or with certain persons. The internal controls, policies and procedures, and employee training and compliance programs we have implemented to deter prohibited practices may not be effective in preventing employees, contractors or agents from violating or circumventing such internal policies and violating applicable laws and regulations. Any determination that we have violated or are responsible for violations of anti-bribery or anti-corruption laws could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition. Violations of international and US laws and regulations may result in fines and penalties, criminal sanctions, administrative remedies, restrictions on business conduct and could have a material adverse effect on our reputation and our business, operating results and financial condition. Environmental compliance costs and liabilities could reduce our earnings and cash available for operations. We are subject to increasingly stringent laws and regulations relating to importation and use of hazardous materials, radioactive materials, chemicals and explosives and to environmental protection, including laws and regulations governing air emissions, hydraulic fracturing, water discharges and waste management. We incur, and expect to continue to incur, capital and operating costs to comply with environmental laws and regulations.

Strict liability can render a party liable for damages without regard to negligence or fault on the part of the party. Some environmental laws provide for joint and several strict liability for remediation of spills and releases of hazardous substances. We use and generate hazardous substances and wastes in our operations. In addition, many of our current and former properties are, or have been, used for industrial purposes. Accordingly, we could become subject to material liabilities relating to the investigation and cleanup of potentially contaminated properties, and to claims alleging personal injury or property damage as the result of exposures to, or releases of, hazardous substances. In addition, stricter enforcement of existing laws and regulations, new laws and regulations, the 8 discovery of previously unknown contamination or the imposition of new or increased requirements could require us to incur costs or become the basis of new or increased liabilities that could reduce our earnings and our cash available for operations. We could be subject to substantial liability claims, which could adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. The technical complexities of our operations expose us to a wide range of significant health, safety and environmental risks. Our offerings involve production-related activities, radioactive materials, chemicals, explosives and other equipment and services that are deployed in challenging exploration, development and production environments. An accident involving these services or equipment, or a failure of a product, could cause personal injury, loss of life, damage to or destruction of property, equipment or the environment, or suspension of operations. Our insurance may not protect us against liability for some kinds of events, including events involving pollution, or against losses resulting from business interruption. Moreover, we may not be able to maintain insurance at levels of risk coverage or policy limits that we deem adequate. Any damages caused by our services or products that are not covered by insurance, or are in excess of policy limits or are subject to substantial deductibles, could adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. Demand for our products and services could be reduced by existing and future legislation or regulations. Environmental advocacy groups and regulatory agencies in the United States and other countries have been focusing considerable attention on the emissions of carbon dioxide, methane and other greenhouse gasses and their potential role in climate change. Existing or future legislation and regulations related to greenhouse gas emissions and climate change, as well as government initiatives to conserve energy or promote the use of alternative energy sources, may significantly curtail demand for and production of fossil fuels such as oil and gas in areas of the world where our customers operate and thus adversely affect future demand for our services. This may, in turn, adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. Some international, national, state and local governments and agencies have also adopted laws and regulations or are evaluating proposed legislation and regulations that are focused on the extraction of shale gas or oil using hydraulic fracturing. Hydraulic fracturing is a stimulation treatment routinely performed on oil and gas wells in low-permeability reservoirs.

If such additional international, national, state or local legislation or regulations are enacted, it could adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. If we are unable to maintain technology leadership, this could adversely affect any competitive advantage we hold. The oilfield service industry is highly competitive. Our ability to continually provide competitive technology and services can impact our ability to defend, maintain or increase prices for our services, maintain market share, and negotiate acceptable contract terms with our customers. If we are unable to continue to develop and produce competitive technology or deliver it to our clients in a timely and cost-competitive manner in the various markets we serve, it could adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. Limitations on our ability to protect our intellectual property rights, including our trade secrets, could cause a loss in revenue and any competitive advantage we hold. Some of our products or services, and the processes we use to produce or provide them, have been granted patent protection, have patent applications pending or are trade secrets.

The tools, techniques, methodologies, programs and components we use to provide our services may infringe upon the intellectual property rights of others. Infringement claims generally result in significant legal and other costs and may distract management from running our core business. Royalty payments under licenses from third parties, if available, would increase our costs. Additionally, developing non-infringing technologies would increase our costs. If a license were not available, we might not be able to continue providing a particular service or product, which could adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. 9 Failure to obtain and retain skilled technical personnel could impede our operations. We require highly skilled personnel to operate and provide technical services and support for our business. Competition for the personnel required for our businesses intensifies as activity increases. In periods of high utilization it may become more difficult to find and retain qualified individuals. This could increase our costs or have other adverse effects on our operations. Severe weather conditions may affect our operations. Our business may be materially affected by severe weather conditions in areas where we operate. This may entail the evacuation of personnel and stoppage of services. In addition, if particularly severe weather affects platforms or structures, this may result in a suspension of activities. Any of these events could adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. Cybersecurity risks and threats could affect our business. We rely heavily on information systems to conduct our business. There can be no assurance that the systems we have designed to prevent or limit the effects of cyber incidents or attacks will be sufficient to prevent or detect such incidents or attacks, or to avoid a material impact on our systems when such incidents or attacks do occur. If our systems for protecting against cybersecurity risks are circumvented or breached, this could result in the loss of our intellectual property or other proprietary information, including customer data, and disruption of our business operations. Our ability to complete the proposed merger with Cameron is subject to various closing conditions and the receipt of consents and approvals from government entities which may impose conditions that could materially adversely affect Cameron or Schlumberger or cause the merger to be abandoned. The merger agreement contains certain closing conditions, including approval of the proposed merger by Cameron stockholders, the absence of injunctions or other legal restrictions and that no material adverse effect shall have occurred with respect to either company. On December 17, 2015, Cameron stockholders voted to adopt our proposed merger. Also, in November 2015 the U.S. Department of Justice cleared our proposed merger without any conditions. However, we will be unable to complete the merger until consents and approvals are received from the European Commission and various other governmental entities. Regulatory entities have broad discretion in administering the governing regulations and may impose certain requirements or obligations as conditions for their approval. The merger agreement may require us to accept conditions from these regulators that could adversely affect the combined company. If the regulatory clearances are not received, or they are not received on terms that satisfy the conditions set forth in the merger agreement, then we will not be obligated to complete the merger. We can provide no assurance that the various closing conditions will be satisfied and that the necessary approvals will be obtained, or that any required conditions will not materially adversely affect the combined company following the merger. In addition, we can provide no assurance that these conditions will not result in the abandonment or delay of the merger. Failure to complete the proposed merger with Cameron could negatively impact our stock price and our future business and financial results. If the proposed merger is not completed, our ongoing business may be adversely affected and we would be subject to several risks, including a decline in the market price of our common stock, negative customer perception and diversion of management’s focus on pursuing other opportunities that could be beneficial to us, in each case, without realizing any of the benefits that might have resulted had the merger been completed. Multiple lawsuits have been filed against us and Cameron challenging the proposed merger, and an adverse ruling in any such lawsuit may prevent the merger from being completed. After the announcement of the proposed merger, four putative class action lawsuits were commenced on behalf of stockholders of Cameron against Cameron and its directors, as well as against us and Schlumberger Holding Corporation and Rain Merger Sub (both of which are indirect wholly-owned subsidiaries). These lawsuits were consolidated for all purposes and a consolidated amended class action complaint (the “Consolidated Complaint”) was filed. The Consolidated Complaint seeks various remedies, including enjoining the merger from being consummated, rescission of the merger to the extent already implemented and the plaintiffs’ costs and fees. Additional lawsuits with similar allegations may be filed. While we believe these lawsuits are without merit and we intend to vigorously defend against such claims, the outcome of any such litigation is inherently uncertain. One of the conditions to the closing of the merger is that no law, order, injunction, judgment, decree, ruling or other similar requirement shall be in effect that prohibits the completion of the merger. Accordingly, if any of the plaintiffs are successful in obtaining an injunction prohibiting the completion of the merger, then that injunction may prevent the merger from becoming effective, or delay its becoming effective. We may fail to realize the anticipated benefits of the proposed merger. The success of the proposed merger will depend on, among other things, our ability to combine our business with that of Cameron in a manner that facilitates growth opportunities and realizes anticipated synergies. However, we must successfully combine both businesses in a manner that permits these benefits to be realized. In addition, we must achieve the anticipated synergies without 10 adversely affecting current revenues and investments in future growth. If we are not able to successfully achieve these objectives, the anticipated benefits of the merger may not be realized fully, may take longer to realize than expected, or may never be realized. Potential issues and difficulties we may encounter in the integration process include the following: · difficulties in managing the expanded operations of a significantly larger and more complex combined company; · lost sales and customers as a result of certain customers of either or both of the two companies deciding not to do business with the combined company, or deciding to decrease their level of business in order to reduce their reliance on a single company; · integrating personnel from the two companies while maintaining focus on providing consistent, high quality products and customer service; · potential unknown liabilities and unforeseen increased expenses, delays or regulatory conditions associated with the merger; and · performance shortfalls at one or both of the two companies as a result of the diversion of management’s attention caused by completing the merger and integrating the companies’ operations. Business issues currently faced by Cameron may impact our operations. To the extent that Cameron currently has or is perceived by customers to have operational challenges, such as on-time performance, safety issues or workforce issues, those challenges may raise concerns by our existing customers following the merger, which may limit or impede our future ability to obtain additional work from those customers.

Market for Schlumberger’s Common Stock, Related Stockholder Matters and Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities. As of December 31, 2015, there were 23,831 stockholders of record. The principal United States market for Schlumberger’s common stock is the New York Stock Exchange (“NYSE”), where it is traded under the symbol “SLB,” although it is traded on other exchanges in and outside the United States, including the Euronext Paris, the London Stock Exchange and the SIX Swiss Exchange. Common Stock, Market Prices and Dividends Declared per Share Quarterly high and low prices for Schlumberger’s common stock as reported by the NYSE (composite transactions), together with dividends declared per share in each quarter of 2015 and 2014, were as follows: Price Range Dividends High Low Declared 2015 QUARTERS First $ 89.00 $ 75.60 $ 0.50 Second 95.13 83.60 0.50 Third 86.69 67.75 0.50 Fourth 82.43 66.57 0.50 2014 QUARTERS First $ 98.45 $ 85.77 $ 0.40 Second 118.13 96.66 0.40 Third 118.76 100.30 0.40 Fourth 102.40 78.47 0.40 There are no legal restrictions on the payment of dividends or ownership or voting of such shares, except as to shares held as treasury stock. Under current legislation, stockholders are not subject to any Curaçao withholding or other Curaçao taxes attributable to the ownership of such shares. The following graph compares the cumulative total stockholder return on Schlumberger common stock, assuming reinvestment of dividends on the last day of the month of payment into common stock of Schlumberger, with the cumulative total return on the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index (S&P 500 Index) and the cumulative total return on the Philadelphia Oil Service Index (OSX) over the five-year period ended December 31, 2015. The stockholder return set forth below is not necessarily indicative of future performance. The following graph and related information shall not be deemed “soliciting material” or to be “filed” with the SEC, nor shall such information be incorporated by reference into any future filing under the Securities Act of 1933 or the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, except to the extent that Schlumberger specifically incorporates it by reference into such filing. 12 Comparison of five-year cumulative total return among Schlumberger common stock, the S&P 500 Index and the Philadelphia Oil Service Index (OSX) Assumes $100 invested on December 31, 2010 in Schlumberger common stock, in the S&P 500 Index and in the Philadelphia Oil Service Index (OSX) and reinvestment of dividends on the last day of the month of payment. Share Repurchases On July 18, 2013, the Schlumberger Board of Directors (the “Board”) approved a $10 billion share repurchase program for Schlumberger common stock, to be completed at the latest by June 30, 2018. Schlumberger’s common stock repurchase program activity for the three months ended December 31, 2015 was as follows: (Stated in thousands, except per share amounts) Total number of shares purchased Average price paid per share Total number of shares purchased as part of publicly announced program Maximum value of shares that may yet be purchased under the program October 1 through October 31, 2015 2,398.0 $ 74.00 2,398.0 $ 1,644,290 November 1 through November 30, 2015 1,525.7 $ 78.44 1,525.7 $ 1,524,623 December 1 through December 31, 2015 1,473.7 $ 68.92 1,473.7 $ 1,423,058 5,397.4 $ 73.86 5,397.4 In connection with the exercise of stock options under Schlumberger’s stock incentive plans, Schlumberger routinely receives shares of its common stock from optionholders in consideration of the exercise price of the stock options. Schlumberger does not view these transactions as requiring disclosure under this Item 5 as the number of shares of Schlumberger common stock received from optionholders is not material. On January 21, 2016, the Board approved a new $10 billion share repurchase program for Schlumberger common stock. This new program will take effect once the remaining $1.4 billion authorized to be repurchased under the July 18, 2013 program is exhausted. 13 Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities None. Item 6. Selected Financial Data. The following selected consolidated financial data should be read in conjunction with both “Item 7.

87347,SLB,SCHLUMBERGER LIMITED/NV,2017,"Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, and the Consolidated Financial Statements and related notes included in this Form 10-K. We urge you to consider carefully the risks described below, as well as in other reports and materials that we file with the SEC and the other information included or incorporated by reference in this Form 10-K. If any of the risks described below or elsewhere in this Form 10-K were to materialize, our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows or prospects could be materially adversely affected. In such case, the trading price of our common stock could decline and you could lose part or all of your investment. Additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial may also materially adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. Demand for the majority of our services is substantially dependent on the levels of expenditures by our customers. The current significant oil and gas industry downturn has resulted in reduced demand for oilfield services, which has had, and may continue to have, a material adverse impact on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. If these conditions worsen or oil and gas prices do not improve, it could have a further material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. Demand for the majority of our services depends substantially on the level of expenditures by our customers for the exploration, development and production of oil and natural gas reserves. These expenditures are generally dependent on our customers’ views of future oil and natural gas prices and are sensitive to our customers’ views of future economic growth and the resulting impact on demand for oil and natural gas. Since 2014, oil and gas prices have declined significantly, resulting in lower expenditures by our customers. As a result, many of our customers have reduced or delayed their oil and gas exploration and production spending, reducing the demand for our products and services and exerting downward pressure on the prices that we charge. These conditions have had, and may continue to have, an adverse impact on our financial condition. 7 The continued low oil and gas prices have caused a reduction in cash flows for our customers, which has had a significant adverse effect on the financial condition of some of our customers. This has resulted, in and may continue to result in, project modifications, delays and cancellations, general business disruptions, and delays in payment of, or nonpayment of, amounts that are owed to us. These effects could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. The prices for oil and natural gas have historically been volatile and can be affected by a variety of factors, including: ● demand for hydrocarbons, which is affected by general economic and business conditions; ● the ability or willingness of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (“OPEC”) to set and maintain production levels for oil; ● oil and gas production levels by non-OPEC countries; ● the level of excess production capacity; ● political and economic uncertainty and geopolitical unrest; ● the level of worldwide oil and gas exploration and production activity; ● access to potential resources; ● governmental policies and subsidies; ● the costs of exploring for, producing and delivering oil and gas; ● technological advances affecting energy consumption; and ● weather conditions. There can be no assurance that the demand or pricing for oil and natural gas will follow historic patterns or recover meaningfully in the near term. Continued or worsening conditions in the oil and gas industry could have a further material adverse affect our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. A significant portion of our revenue is derived from our non-United States operations, which exposes us to risks inherent in doing business in each of the over 85 countries in which we operate. Our non-United States operations accounted for approximately 80% of our consolidated revenue in 2016, 76% in 2015 and 71% in 2014. Operations in countries other than the United States are subject to various risks, including: ● volatility in political, social and economic conditions; ● exposure to expropriation of our assets or other governmental actions; ● social unrest, acts of terrorism, war or other armed conflict; ● confiscatory taxation or other adverse tax policies; ● deprivation of contract rights; ● trade and economic sanctions or other restrictions imposed by the United States, the European Union or other countries; ● restrictions under the United States Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA) or similar legislation; ● restrictions on the repatriation of income or capital; ● currency exchange controls; ● inflation; and ● currency exchange rate fluctuations and devaluations. Our failure to comply with complex US and foreign laws and regulations could have a material adverse effect on our operations. We are subject to complex US and foreign laws and regulations, such as the FCPA, the U.K. Bribery Act and various other anti-bribery and anti-corruption laws. We are also subject to trade control regulations and trade sanctions laws that restrict the movement of certain goods to, and certain operations in, various countries or with certain persons. Our ability to transfer people and products among certain countries is subject to maintaining required licenses and complying with these laws and regulations. The internal controls, policies and procedures, and employee training and compliance programs we have implemented to deter prohibited practices may not be effective in preventing employees, contractors or agents from violating or circumventing such internal policies or violating applicable laws and regulations. Any determination that we have violated or are responsible for violations of anti-bribery, trade 8 control, trade sanctions or anti-corruption laws could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition. Violations of international and US laws and regulations or the loss of any required licenses may result in fines and penalties, criminal sanctions, administrative remedies or restrictions on business conduct, and could have a material adverse effect on our reputation and our business, operating results and financial condition. Environmental compliance costs and liabilities could reduce our earnings and cash available for operations. We are subject to increasingly stringent laws and regulations relating to importation and use of hazardous materials, radioactive materials, chemicals and explosives and to environmental protection, including laws and regulations governing air emissions, hydraulic fracturing, water discharges and waste management. We incur, and expect to continue to incur, capital and operating costs to comply with environmental laws and regulations. The technical requirements of these laws and regulations are becoming increasingly complex, stringent and expensive to implement. These laws may provide for “strict liability” for remediation costs, damages to natural resources or threats to public health and safety. Strict liability can render a party liable for damages without regard to negligence or fault on the part of the party. Some environmental laws provide for joint and several strict liability for remediation of spills and releases of hazardous substances. We use and generate hazardous substances and wastes in our operations. In addition, many of our current and former properties are, or have been, used for industrial purposes. Accordingly, we could become subject to material liabilities relating to the investigation and cleanup of potentially contaminated properties, and to claims alleging personal injury or property damage as the result of exposures to, or releases of, hazardous substances. In addition, stricter enforcement of existing laws and regulations, new laws and regulations, the discovery of previously unknown contamination or the imposition of new or increased requirements could require us to incur costs or become the basis for new or increased liabilities that could reduce our earnings and our cash available for operations. We could be subject to substantial liability claims, which could adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. The technical complexities of our operations expose us to a wide range of significant health, safety and environmental risks. Our offerings involve production-related activities, radioactive materials, chemicals, explosives and other equipment and services that are deployed in challenging exploration, development and production environments. An accident involving these services or equipment, or a failure of a product, could cause personal injury, loss of life, damage to or destruction of property, equipment or the environment, or suspension of operations. Our insurance may not protect us against liability for certain kinds of events, including events involving pollution, or against losses resulting from business interruption. Moreover, we may not be able to maintain insurance at levels of risk coverage or policy limits that we deem adequate. Any damages caused by our services or products that are not covered by insurance, or are in excess of policy limits or subject to substantial deductibles, could adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. Demand for our products and services could be reduced by existing and future legislation or regulations. Environmental advocacy groups and regulatory agencies in the United States and other countries have been focusing considerable attention on the emissions of carbon dioxide, methane and other greenhouse gasses and their potential role in climate change. Existing or future legislation and regulations related to greenhouse gas emissions and climate change, as well as government initiatives to conserve energy or promote the use of alternative energy sources, may significantly curtail demand for and production of fossil fuels such as oil and gas in areas of the world where our customers operate and thus adversely affect future demand for our services. This may, in turn, adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. Some international, national, state and local governments and agencies have also adopted laws and regulations or are evaluating proposed legislation and regulations that are focused on the extraction of shale gas or oil using hydraulic fracturing. Hydraulic fracturing is a stimulation treatment routinely performed on oil and gas wells in low-permeability reservoirs. Specially engineered fluids are pumped at high pressure and rate into the reservoir interval to be treated, causing cracks in the target formation. Proppant, such as sand of a particular size, is mixed with the treatment fluid to keep the cracks open when the treatment is complete. Future hydraulic fracturing-related legislation or regulations could limit or ban hydraulic fracturing, or lead to operational delays and increased costs, and therefore reduce demand for our pressure pumping services. If such additional international, national, state or local legislation or regulations are enacted, it could adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. If we are unable to maintain technology leadership, this could adversely affect any competitive advantage we hold. The oilfield service industry is highly competitive. Our ability to continually provide competitive technology and services can impact our ability to defend, maintain or increase prices for our services, maintain market share, and negotiate acceptable contract terms with our customers. If we are unable to continue to develop and produce competitive technology or deliver it to our clients in a timely and cost-competitive manner in the various markets we serve, it could adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. 9 Limitations on our ability to protect our intellectual property rights, including our trade secrets, could cause a loss in revenue and any competitive advantage we hold. Some of our products or services, and the processes we use to produce or provide them, have been granted patent protection, have patent applications pending or are trade secrets. Our business may be adversely affected if our patents are unenforceable, the claims allowed under our patents are not sufficient to protect our technology, our patent applications are denied or our trade secrets are not adequately protected. Our competitors may be able to develop technology independently that is similar to ours without infringing on our patents or gaining access to our trade secrets, which could adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. We may be subject to litigation if another party claims that we have infringed upon its intellectual property rights. The tools, techniques, methodologies, programs and components we use to provide our services may infringe upon the intellectual property rights of others. Infringement claims generally result in significant legal and other costs and may distract management from running our core business. Royalty payments under licenses from third parties, if available, would increase our costs. Additionally, developing non-infringing technologies would increase our costs. If a license were not available, we might not be able to continue providing a particular service or product, which could adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. Failure to obtain and retain skilled technical personnel could impede our operations. We require highly skilled personnel to operate and provide technical services and support for our business. Competition for the personnel required for our businesses intensifies as activity increases. In periods of high utilization it may become more difficult to find and retain qualified individuals. This could increase our costs or have other adverse effects on our operations. Severe weather conditions may adversely affect our operations. Our business may be materially affected by severe weather conditions in areas where we operate. This may entail the evacuation of personnel and stoppage of services. In addition, if particularly severe weather affects platforms or structures, this may result in a suspension of activities. Any of these events could adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. Cybersecurity risks and threats could adversely affect our business. We rely heavily on information systems to conduct our business. There can be no assurance that the systems we have designed to prevent or limit the effects of cyber incidents or attacks will be sufficient to prevent or detect such incidents or attacks, or to avoid a material impact on our systems when such incidents or attacks do occur. If our systems for protecting against cybersecurity risks are circumvented or breached, this could result in the loss of our intellectual property or other proprietary information, including customer data, and disruption of our business operations.

A significant portion of our revenue is derived from our non-United States operations, which exposes us to risks inherent in doing business in each of the over 85 countries in which we operate. Our non-United States operations accounted for approximately 74% of our consolidated revenue in 2017, 80% in 2016 and 76% in 2015. Operations in countries other than the United States are subject to various risks, including: ● volatility in political, social and economic conditions; ● exposure to expropriation of our assets or other governmental actions; ● social unrest, acts of terrorism, war or other armed conflict; ● confiscatory taxation or other adverse tax policies; ● deprivation of contract rights; ● trade and economic sanctions or other restrictions imposed by the United States, the European Union or other countries; ● restrictions under the United States Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (“FCPA”) or similar legislation; ● restrictions on the repatriation of income or capital; ● currency exchange controls; ● inflation; and ● currency exchange rate fluctuations and devaluations. Our failure to comply with complex US and foreign laws and regulations could have a material adverse effect on our operations. We are subject to complex US and foreign laws and regulations, such as the FCPA, the U.K. Bribery Act and various other anti-bribery and anti-corruption laws. We are also subject to trade control regulations and trade sanctions laws that restrict the movement of certain goods to, and certain operations in, various countries or with certain persons. Our ability to transfer people and products among certain countries is subject to maintaining required licenses and complying with these laws and regulations. The internal controls, policies and procedures, and employee training and compliance programs we have implemented to deter prohibited practices may not be effective in preventing employees, contractors or agents from violating or circumventing such internal policies or violating applicable laws and regulations. Any determination that we have violated or are responsible for violations of anti-bribery, trade control, trade sanctions or anti-corruption laws could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition. Violations of international and US laws and regulations or the loss of any required licenses may result in fines and penalties, criminal sanctions, administrative remedies or restrictions on business conduct, and could have a material adverse effect on our reputation and our business, operating results and financial condition. 9 Demand for our products and services could be reduced by existing and future legislation or regulations. Environmental advocacy groups and regulatory agencies in the United States and other countries have been focusing considerable attention on the emissions of carbon dioxide, methane and other greenhouse gasses and their potential role in climate change. Existing or future legislation and regulations related to greenhouse gas emissions and climate change, as well as government initiatives to conserve energy or promote the use of alternative energy sources, may significantly curtail demand for and production of fossil fuels such as oil and gas in areas of the world where our customers operate, and thus adversely affect future demand for our products and services. This may, in turn, adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. Some international, national, state and local governments and agencies have also adopted laws and regulations or are evaluating proposed legislation and regulations that are focused on the extraction of shale gas or oil using hydraulic fracturing. Hydraulic fracturing is a stimulation treatment routinely performed on oil and gas wells in low-permeability reservoirs. Specially engineered fluids are pumped at high pressure and rate into the reservoir interval to be treated, causing cracks in the target formation. Proppant, such as sand of a particular size, is mixed with the treatment fluid to keep the cracks open when the treatment is complete. Future hydraulic fracturing-related legislation or regulations could limit or ban hydraulic fracturing, or lead to operational delays and increased costs, and therefore reduce demand for our pressure pumping services. If such additional international, national, state or local legislation or regulations are enacted, it could adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. Environmental compliance costs and liabilities could reduce our earnings and cash available for operations. We are subject to increasingly stringent laws and regulations relating to importation and use of hazardous materials, radioactive materials, chemicals and explosives and to environmental protection, including laws and regulations governing air emissions, hydraulic fracturing, water discharges and waste management. We incur, and expect to continue to incur, capital and operating costs to comply with environmental laws and regulations. The technical requirements of these laws and regulations are becoming increasingly complex, stringent and expensive to implement. These laws may provide for “strict liability” for remediation costs, damages to natural resources or threats to public health and safety. Strict liability can render a party liable for damages without regard to negligence or fault on the part of the party. Some environmental laws provide for joint and several strict liability for remediation of spills and releases of hazardous substances. We use and generate hazardous substances and wastes in our operations. In addition, many of our current and former properties are, or have been, used for industrial purposes. Accordingly, we could become subject to material liabilities relating to the investigation and cleanup of potentially contaminated properties, and to claims alleging personal injury or property damage as the result of exposures to, or releases of, hazardous substances. In addition, stricter enforcement of existing laws and regulations, new laws and regulations, the discovery of previously unknown contamination or the imposition of new or increased requirements could require us to incur costs or become the basis for new or increased liabilities that could reduce our earnings and our cash available for operations. We could be subject to substantial liability claims, which could adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. The technical complexities of our operations expose us to a wide range of significant health, safety and environmental risks. Our offerings involve production-related activities, radioactive materials, chemicals, explosives and other equipment and services that are deployed in challenging exploration, development and production environments. An accident involving these services or equipment, or a failure of a product, could cause personal injury, loss of life, damage to or destruction of property, equipment or the environment, or suspension of operations. Our insurance may not protect us against liability for certain kinds of events, including events involving pollution, or against losses resulting from business interruption. Moreover, we may not be able to maintain insurance at levels of risk coverage or policy limits that we deem adequate. Any damages caused by our services or products that are not covered by insurance, or are in excess of policy limits or subject to substantial deductibles, could adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. If we are unable to maintain technology leadership, this could adversely affect any competitive advantage we hold. The oilfield service industry is highly competitive. Our ability to continually provide competitive technology and services can impact our ability to defend, maintain or increase prices for our products and services, maintain market share, and negotiate acceptable contract terms with our customers. If we are unable to continue to develop and produce competitive technology or deliver it to our clients in a timely and cost-competitive manner in the various markets we serve, it could adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. Limitations on our ability to protect our intellectual property rights, including our trade secrets, could cause a loss in revenue and any competitive advantage we hold. Some of our products or services, and the processes we use to produce or provide them, have been granted patent protection, have patent applications pending, or are trade secrets. Our business may be adversely affected if our patents are unenforceable, the claims allowed under our patents are not sufficient to protect our technology, our patent applications are denied or our trade secrets are not 10 adequately protected. Our competitors may be able to develop technology independently that is similar to ours without infringing on our patents or gaining access to our trade secrets, which could adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. We may be subject to litigation if another party claims that we have infringed upon its intellectual property rights. The tools, techniques, methodologies, programs and components we use to provide our services may infringe upon the intellectual property rights of others. Infringement claims generally result in significant legal and other costs, and may distract management from running our business. Royalty payments under licenses from third parties, if available, would increase our costs. Additionally, developing non-infringing technologies would increase our costs. If a license were not available, we might not be able to continue providing a particular service or product, which could adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. Failure to obtain and retain skilled technical personnel could impede our operations. We require highly skilled personnel to operate and provide technical services and support for our business. Competition for the personnel required for our businesses intensifies as activity increases. In periods of high utilization it may become more difficult to find and retain qualified individuals. This could increase our costs or have other adverse effects on our operations. Severe weather conditions may adversely affect our operations. Our business may be materially affected by severe weather conditions in areas where we operate. This may entail the evacuation of personnel and stoppage of services. In addition, if particularly severe weather affects platforms or structures, this may result in a suspension of activities. Any of these events could adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. Cyberattacks could have a material adverse impact on our business and results of operation. We rely heavily on information systems to conduct our business. Although we devote significant resources to protect our systems and data, we have experienced and will continue to experience varying degrees of cyber incidents in the normal conduct of our business. There can be no assurance that the systems we have designed to prevent or limit the effects of cyber incidents or attacks will be sufficient to prevent or detect such incidents or attacks, or to avoid a material adverse impact on our systems when such incidents or attacks do occur. If our systems for protecting against cybersecurity risks are circumvented or breached, this could result in disruptions to our business operations, access to our financial reporting systems, the loss of access to critical data or systems through ransomware or other attacks, or other loss, misuse or corruption of critical data and proprietary information, including our intellectual property and customer data.

87347,SLB,SCHLUMBERGER LIMITED/NV,2019,"Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, and the Consolidated Financial Statements and related notes included in this Form 10-K. We urge you to consider carefully the risks described below, as well as in other reports and materials that we file with the SEC and the other information included or incorporated by reference in this Form 10-K. If any of the risks described below or elsewhere in this Form 10-K were to materialize, our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows or prospects could be materially adversely affected. In such case, the trading price of our common stock could decline and you could lose part or all of your investment. Additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial may also materially adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. Demand for our products and services is substantially dependent on the levels of expenditures by our customers. A substantial or an extended decline in oil and gas prices could result in lower expenditures by our customers, which could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. Demand for our products and services depends substantially on expenditures by our customers for the exploration, development and production of oil and natural gas reserves. These expenditures are generally dependent on our customers’ views of future oil and natural gas prices and are sensitive to our customers’ views of future economic growth and the resulting impact on demand for oil and natural gas. Declines, as well as anticipated declines, in oil and gas prices could result in project modifications, delays or cancellations, general business disruptions, and delays in payment of, or nonpayment of, amounts that are owed to us. These effects could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. Historically, oil and natural gas prices have experienced significant volatility and can be affected by a variety of factors, including: ● demand for hydrocarbons, which is affected by general economic and business conditions; ● the ability or willingness of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (“OPEC”) to set and maintain production levels for oil; ● oil and gas production levels by non-OPEC countries; ● the level of excess production capacity; ● political and economic uncertainty and geopolitical unrest; ● the level of worldwide oil and gas exploration and production activity; 7 ● access to potential resources; ● governmental policies and subsidies; ● the costs of exploring for, producing and delivering oil and gas; ● technological advances affecting energy consumption; and ● weather conditions. The oil and gas industry has historically experienced periodic downturns, which have been characterized by diminished demand for our products and services as well as and downward pressure on the prices we charge. Sustained market uncertainty can also result in lower demand and pricing for our products and services. A significant downturn or sustained market uncertainty could result in a reduction in demand for oilfield services and could adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. A significant portion of our revenue is derived from our non-United States operations, which exposes us to risks inherent in doing business in each of the over 85 countries in which we operate. Our non-United States operations accounted for approximately 69% of our consolidated revenue in 2018, 74% in 2017 and 80% in 2016.

Our failure to comply with complex US and foreign laws and regulations could have a material adverse effect on our operations. We are subject to complex US and foreign laws and regulations, such as the FCPA, the U.K. Bribery Act and various other anti-bribery and anti-corruption laws. We are also subject to trade control regulations and trade sanctions laws that restrict the movement of certain goods to, and certain operations in, various countries or with certain persons.

Sustained market uncertainty can also result in lower demand and pricing for our products and services. A future downturn or sustained market uncertainty could again result in a reduction in demand for oilfield services and could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows and prospects. A significant portion of our revenue is derived from our non-United States operations, which exposes us to risks inherent in doing business in each of the over 120 countries in which we operate. Our non-United States operations accounted for approximately 72% of our consolidated revenue in 2019, 68% in 2018 and 74% in 2017. In addition to the risks addressed elsewhere in this section, our operations in countries other than the United States are subject to various risks, including: • volatility in political, social and economic conditions; • exposure to expropriation of our assets or other governmental actions; • social unrest, acts of terrorism, war or other armed conflict; • confiscatory taxation or other adverse tax policies; • deprivation of contract rights; • trade and economic sanctions or other restrictions imposed by the European Union, the United States or other countries; • exposure under the United States Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (“FCPA”), the U.K. Bribery Act or similar anti-bribery and anti-corruption legislation; • theft of proprietary technology and other intellectual property; • restrictions on the repatriation of income or capital; • currency exchange controls; • inflation; and • currency exchange rate fluctuations and devaluations. Our failure to comply with complex US and foreign laws and regulations could have a material adverse effect on our operations or financial condition. We are subject to complex US and foreign laws and regulations, such as the FCPA, the U.K. Bribery Act and various other anti-bribery and anti-corruption laws. We are also subject to trade control regulations and trade sanctions laws that restrict the movement of certain goods to, and certain operations in, various countries or with certain persons. Our ability to transfer people, products and data among certain countries is subject to maintaining required licenses and complying with these laws and regulations. The internal controls, policies and procedures, and employee training and compliance programs we have implemented to deter prohibited practices may not be effective in preventing employees, contractors or agents from violating or circumventing such internal policies or from material violations of applicable laws and regulations. Any determination that we have violated or are responsible for violations of anti-bribery, trade control, trade sanctions or anti-corruption laws could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition. Violations of international and US laws and regulations or the loss of any required licenses may result in fines and penalties, criminal sanctions, administrative remedies or restrictions on business conduct, and could have a material adverse effect on our reputation and our business, operating results and financial condition. 8 Demand for our products and services could be reduced by existing and future legislation, regulations and public sentiment. Environmental advocacy groups and regulatory agencies in the European Union, the United States and other regions or countries have been focusing considerable attention on the emissions of carbon dioxide, methane and other greenhouse gases and their potential role in climate change. Existing or future legislation and regulations related to greenhouse gas emissions and climate change, as well as government initiatives to conserve energy or promote the use of alternative energy sources, may significantly curtail demand for and production of fossil fuels such as oil and gas in areas of the world where our customers operate, and thus reduce future demand for our products and services. This may, in turn, adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. New or additional legal or regulatory requirements regarding climate change could adversely affect our business, reputation or demand for our stock. There is also increased focus, including by governmental and non-governmental organizations, investors and other stakeholders, on these and other sustainability matters. Additionally, some international, national, state and local governments and agencies have adopted laws and regulations or are evaluating proposed legislation and regulations that are focused on the extraction of shale gas or oil using hydraulic fracturing. Future hydraulic fracturing-related legislation or regulations could limit or ban hydraulic fracturing, or lead to operational delays and increased costs, and therefore reduce demand for our pressure pumping services. Enactment of additional international, national, state or local legislation or regulations can adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows and could be material. Environmental compliance costs and liabilities could reduce our earnings and cash available for operations. We are subject to increasingly stringent laws and regulations relating to importation and use of hazardous materials, radioactive materials, chemicals and explosives and to environmental protection, including laws and regulations governing air emissions, hydraulic fracturing, water discharges and waste management. We incur, and expect to continue to incur, significant capital and operating costs to comply with environmental laws and regulations. The technical requirements of these laws and regulations are becoming increasingly complex, stringent and expensive to implement. These laws may provide for “strict liability” for remediation costs, damages to natural resources or threats to public health and safety. Strict liability can render us liable for damages without regard to our degree of care or fault. Some environmental laws provide for joint and several strict liability for remediation of spills and releases of hazardous substances, and, as a result, we could be liable for the actions of others. We use and generate hazardous substances and wastes in our operations. In addition, many of our current and former properties are, or have been, used for industrial purposes. Accordingly, we could become subject to material liabilities relating to the investigation and cleanup of potentially contaminated properties, and to claims alleging personal injury or property damage as the result of exposures to, or releases of, hazardous substances. In addition, stricter enforcement of existing laws and regulations, new laws and regulations, the discovery of previously unknown contamination or the imposition of new or increased requirements could require us to incur costs or become the basis for new or increased liabilities that could reduce our earnings and our cash available for operations. We could be subject to substantial liability claims, including catastrophic well incidents, which could adversely affect our reputation, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. The technical complexities of our operations expose us to a wide range of significant health, safety and environmental risks. Our operations involve production-related activities, radioactive materials, chemicals, explosives and other equipment and services that are deployed in challenging exploration, development and production environments. Accidents involving these services or equipment, or a failure of a product, could cause personal injury, loss of life, damage to or destruction of property, equipment or the environment, or suspension of operations, which could materially adversely affect us. Any catastrophic well incidents, including blowouts at a well site, may expose us to additional liabilities, which could be material. Generally, we rely on contractual indemnities, releases, and limitations on liability with our customers and insurance to protect us from potential liability related to such events. However, our insurance may not protect us against liability for certain kinds of events, including events involving pollution, or against losses resulting from business interruption. Moreover, we may not be able to maintain insurance at levels of risk coverage or policy limits that we deem adequate. Any damages caused by our services or products that are not covered by insurance, or are in excess of policy limits or subject to substantial deductibles, could adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. If we are unable to maintain technology leadership, this could adversely affect any competitive advantage we hold. The oilfield service industry is highly competitive. Our ability to continually provide competitive technology and services can impact our ability to defend, maintain or increase prices for our products and services, maintain market share, and negotiate acceptable contract terms with our customers. Failure to continue to develop and produce competitive technology or deliver it to our clients in a timely and cost-competitive manner in the various markets we serve, could adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. Limitations on our ability to protect our intellectual property rights, including our trade secrets, could cause a loss in revenue and any competitive advantage we hold. 9 Some of our products or services, and the processes we use to produce or provide them, have been granted patent protection, have patent applications pending, or are trade secrets. Our business may be adversely affected when our patents are unenforceable, the claims allowed under our patents are not sufficient to protect our technology, our patent applications are denied or our trade secrets are not adequately protected. Our competitors may be able to develop technology independently that is similar to ours without infringing on our patents or gaining access to our trade secrets, which could adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. Third parties may claim that we have infringed upon their intellectual property rights. The tools, techniques, methodologies, programs and components we use to provide our services and products may infringe upon the intellectual property rights of others. Infringement claims generally result in significant legal and other costs, and may distract management from running our business. Royalty payments under licenses from third parties, if available, would increase our costs. If a license were not available, we might not be able to continue providing a particular service or product, which could adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. Additionally, developing non-infringing technologies would increase our costs. Failure to obtain and retain skilled technical personnel could impede our operations. We require highly skilled personnel to operate and provide technical services and support for our business. Competition for the personnel required for our businesses intensifies as activity increases and technology evolves. In periods of high utilization, it is often more difficult to find and retain qualified individuals. This could increase our costs or have other adverse effects on our operations. Severe weather may adversely affect our operations. Our business has been, and in the future will be affected by severe weather in areas where we operate, which could materially impact our operations and financial results This may entail the evacuation of personnel and stoppage of services. In addition, particularly severe weather affects platforms or structures, which may result in a suspension of activities. Any of these events could adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. Cyberattacks could have a material adverse impact on our business and results of operation. We rely heavily on information systems to conduct our business, including systems operated by or under the control of third parties. Although we devote significant resources to protect our systems and proprietary data, we have experienced and will continue to experience varying degrees of cyber incidents in the normal conduct of our business. There can be no assurance that the systems we have designed to prevent or limit the effects of cyber incidents or attacks will be sufficient to prevent or detect such incidents or attacks, or to avoid a material adverse impact on our systems after such incidents or attacks do occur. Breaches or circumvention of our systems, or the systems of third parties, including by ransomware or other attacks, result in disruptions to our business operations; unauthorized access to (or the loss of Company access to) competitively sensitive, confidential or other critical data or systems; loss of customers; financial losses; regulatory fines; and misuse or corruption of critical data and proprietary information, any of which could be material.

87347,SLB,SCHLUMBERGER LIMITED/NV,2021,"Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, and the Consolidated Financial Statements and related notes included in this Form 10-K. We urge you to consider carefully the risks described below, which discuss the material factors that make an investment in our securities speculative or risky, as well as in other reports and materials that we file with the SEC and the other information included or incorporated by reference in this Form 10-K. Additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial may also materially adversely affect our business, reputation, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows and prospects. Business and Operational Risks Demand for our products and services is substantially dependent on the levels of expenditures by our customers. The current significant oil and gas industry downturn has resulted in reduced demand for oilfield services and lower expenditures by our customers, which has had, and may continue to have, a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. Demand for our products and services depends substantially on expenditures by our customers for the exploration, development and production of oil and natural gas reserves. These expenditures are generally dependent on our customers’ views of future oil and natural gas prices, as well as their ability to access capital. These expenditures are also sensitive to our customers’ views of future economic growth and the resulting impact on demand for oil and natural gas. The continued low oil and gas prices have also caused a reduction in cash flows for our customers, which has had a significant adverse effect on the financial condition of some of our customers. This has resulted in, and may continue to result in, lower capital expenditures, project modifications, delays or cancellations, general business disruptions, and delays in payment of, or nonpayment of, amounts that are owed to us. These effects have had, and may continue to have, a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. Historically, oil and natural gas prices have experienced significant volatility and can be affected by a variety of factors, including: • changes in the supply of and demand for hydrocarbons, which are affected by general economic and business conditions, as well as increased demand for (and availability of) alternative energy sources and electric vehicles; • the ability or willingness of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries and 10 other oil producing countries, including Russia, Mexico and Kazakhstan (“OPEC+”), to set and maintain production levels for oil; • oil and gas production levels in the United States and by other non-OPEC+ countries; • changes in the level of demand resulting from actual or threatened public health emergencies, such as the COVID-19 pandemic, or from other events affecting the level of economic activity; • political and economic uncertainty and geopolitical unrest; • the level of excess production capacity; • the level of global oil and gas exploration and production activity; • the level of global oil and natural gas inventories; • access to potential resources; • governmental policies and subsidies; • the costs of exploring for, producing and delivering oil and gas; • speculation as to the future price of oil and the speculative trading of oil and natural gas futures contracts; • government initiatives to promote the use of renewable energy sources and public sentiment regarding alternatives to oil and gas; • technological advances affecting energy consumption; and • weather conditions. 10 The oil and gas industry has historically been extremely cyclical. However, there can be no assurance that the demand or pricing for oil and natural gas or for our products and services will follow historic patterns or recover meaningfully in the near or medium term. Continued or worsening conditions in the oil and gas industry generally may have a further material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows and prospects. The COVID-19 pandemic has significantly reduced demand for our services, and has had, and is likely to continue to have, a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. The effects of the COVID-19 pandemic, including actions taken by businesses and governments to contain the spread of the virus, have resulted in a significant and swift reduction in international and US economic activity. In our industry, geopolitical events that increased the supply of low-priced oil to the global market occurred at the same time that demand weakened due to the worldwide effects of the pandemic, leading to a collapse in oil prices in March 2020. These events together adversely affected the demand for oil and natural gas, as well as for our services and products, and caused significant volatility and disruption of the global financial markets. Other effects of the pandemic have included, and may continue to include, adverse revenue and net income effects; disruptions to our operations, including suspension or deferral of drilling activities; customer shutdowns of oil and gas exploration and production; downward revisions to customer budgets; limitations on access to sources of liquidity; employee impacts from illness, school closures and other community response measures; workforce reductions in response to activity declines; and temporary closures of our facilities or the facilities of our customers and suppliers. This period of extreme economic disruption, low oil prices and reduced demand for our products and services has had, and is likely to continue to have, a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. The extent to which our operating and financial results will continue to be affected by the COVID-19 pandemic will depend on various factors and consequences beyond our control, such as the duration and scope of the pandemic; additional actions by businesses and governments in response to the pandemic; and the speed and effectiveness of responses to combat the virus, including vaccine development and distribution. COVID-19, and the volatile regional and global economic conditions stemming from the pandemic, could also aggravate our other risk factors described in this Form 10-K. A significant portion of our revenue is derived from our non-US operations, which exposes us to risks inherent in doing business in the more than 120 countries in which we generate revenue. Our non-US operations accounted for approximately 81% of our consolidated revenue in 2020, 72% in 2019 and 68% in 2018. In addition to the risks addressed elsewhere in this section, our operations in countries other than the United States are subject to various risks, including: • uncertain or volatile political, social and economic conditions; • exposure to expropriation, nationalization, deprivation or confiscation of our assets or the assets of our customers, or other governmental actions; • social unrest, acts of terrorism, war or other armed conflict; • public health crises and other catastrophic events, such as the COVID-19 pandemic; • confiscatory taxation or other adverse tax policies; • theft of, or lack of sufficient legal protection for, proprietary technology and other intellectual property; • deprivation of contract rights; • trade and economic sanctions or other restrictions imposed by the European Union, the United States or other regions or countries; • exposure under the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (“FCPA”), the U.K. Bribery Act or similar anti-bribery and anti-corruption legislation; • unexpected changes in legal and regulatory requirements, including changes in interpretation or enforcement of existing laws; • restrictions on the repatriation of income or capital; • currency exchange controls; • inflation; and • currency exchange rate fluctuations and devaluations. 11 Severe weather, including extreme weather conditions associated with climate change, has in the past and may in the future adversely affect our operations and financial results. Our business has been, and in the future will be, affected by severe weather in areas where we operate, which could materially affect our operations and financial results. Extreme weather conditions such as hurricanes, flooding and landslides have in the past resulted in, and may in the future result in, the evacuation of personnel, stoppage of services and activity disruptions at our facilities, in our supply chain, or at well-sites. Particularly severe weather events affecting platforms or structures may result in a suspension of activities. In addition, impacts of climate change, such as sea level rise, coastal storm surge, inland flooding from intense rainfall and hurricane-strength winds may damage our facilities. Any such extreme weather-related events may result in increased operating costs or decreases in revenue which could adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. Legal and Regulatory Risks Our operations require us to comply with numerous laws and regulations, violations of which could have a material adverse effect on our operations, financial condition or cash flows. Our operations are subject to international, regional, national, and local laws and regulations in every place where we operate, relating to matters such as environmental protection, health and safety, labor and employment, import/export controls, currency exchange, bribery and corruption, data privacy and cybersecurity, intellectual property, immigration, and taxation. These laws and regulations are complex, frequently change, and have tended to become more stringent over time. In the event the scope of these laws and regulations expands in the future, the incremental cost of compliance could adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows. Our international operations are subject to anti-corruption and anti-bribery laws and regulations, such as the FCPA, the U.K. Bribery Act and other similar laws. We are also subject to trade control regulations and trade sanctions laws that restrict the movement of certain goods to, and certain operations in, various countries or with certain persons. Our ability to transfer people, products and data among certain countries is subject to maintaining required licenses and complying with these laws and regulations. The internal controls, policies and procedures, and employee training and compliance programs we have implemented to deter prohibited practices may not be effective in preventing employees, contractors or agents from violating or circumventing such internal policies or from material violations of applicable laws and regulations. Any determination that we have violated or are responsible for violations of anti-bribery, trade control, trade sanctions or anti-corruption laws could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition. Violations of international and US laws and regulations or the loss of any required licenses may result in fines and penalties, criminal sanctions, administrative remedies or restrictions on business conduct, and could have a material adverse effect on our business, operations and financial condition. In addition, any major violations could have a significant effect on our reputation and consequently on our ability to win future business and maintain existing customer and supplier relationships. Demand for our products and services could be reduced by existing and future legislation, regulations and public sentiment. Regulatory agencies and environmental advocacy groups in the European Union, the United States and other regions or countries have been focusing considerable attention on the emissions of carbon dioxide, methane and other greenhouse gases and their role in climate change. There is also increased focus, including by governments and our customers, investors and other stakeholders, on these and other sustainability and energy transition matters. Existing or future legislation and regulations related to greenhouse gas emissions and climate change, as well as initiatives by governments, non-governmental organizations, and companies to conserve energy or promote the use of alternative energy sources, and negative attitudes toward or perceptions of fossil fuel products and their relationship to the environment, may significantly curtail demand for and production of oil and gas in areas of the world where our customers operate, and thus reduce future demand for our products and services. This may, in turn, adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. Our business, reputation and demand for our stock could be negatively affected if we do not (or are perceived to not) act responsibly with respect to sustainability matters. Environmental compliance costs and liabilities arising as a result of environmental laws and regulations could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. We are subject to numerous laws and regulations relating to environmental protection, including those governing air emissions, water discharges and waste management, as well as the importation and use of hazardous materials, radioactive materials, chemicals and explosives. We incur, and expect to continue to incur, significant capital and operating costs to comply with environmental laws and regulations. The technical requirements of these laws and regulations are becoming increasingly complex, stringent and expensive to implement. These laws sometimes provide for “strict liability” for remediation costs, damages to natural resources or threats to public health and safety. Strict liability can render us liable for damages without regard to our degree of care or fault. Some environmental laws provide for joint and several strict liability for remediation of spills and releases of hazardous substances, and, as a result, we could be liable for the actions of others. We use and generate hazardous substances and wastes in our operations. In addition, many of our current and former properties are, or have been, used for industrial purposes. Accordingly, we could become subject to material liabilities relating to the investigation 12 and cleanup of potentially contaminated properties, and to claims alleging personal injury or property damage as the result of exposures to, or releases of, hazardous substances. In addition, stricter enforcement or changing interpretations of existing laws and regulations, the enactment of new laws and regulations, the discovery of previously unknown contamination or the imposition of new or increased requirements could require us to incur costs or become the basis for new or increased liabilities that could have a material adverse effect on our business, operations and financial condition. We could be subject to substantial liability claims, including well incidents, which could adversely affect our reputation, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. The technical complexities of our operations expose us to a wide range of significant health, safety and environmental risks. Our operations involve production-related activities, radioactive materials, chemicals, explosives and other equipment and services that are deployed in challenging exploration, development and production environments. Accidents or acts of malfeasance involving these services or equipment, or a failure of a product (including as a result of a cyberattack), could cause personal injury, loss of life, damage to or destruction of property, equipment or the environment, or suspension of operations, which could materially adversely affect us. Any well incidents, including blowouts at a well site, may expose us to additional liabilities, which could be material. Generally, we rely on contractual indemnities, releases, and limitations on liability with our customers and insurance to protect us from potential liability related to such events. However, our insurance may not protect us against liability for certain kinds of events, including events involving pollution, or against losses resulting from business interruption. Moreover, we may not be able to maintain insurance at levels of risk coverage or policy limits that we deem adequate. Any damages caused by our services or products that are not covered by insurance or are in excess of policy limits or subject to substantial deductibles, could adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. Intellectual Property and Technology Risks If we are unable to maintain technology leadership, this could adversely affect any competitive advantage we hold. The oilfield services industry is highly competitive. Our business may be adversely affected if we fail to continue to develop and produce competitive technologies in response to changes in the market, customer requirements and technology trends (including trends in favor of emissions-reducing technologies), or if we fail to deliver such technologies to our customers in a timely and cost-competitive manner in the various markets we serve. If we are unable to maintain technology leadership in our industry, our ability to maintain market share, defend, maintain or increase prices for our products and services, and negotiate acceptable contract terms with our customers could be adversely affected. Furthermore, if our equipment or proprietary technologies become obsolete, the value of our intellectual property may be reduced, which could adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. Limitations on our ability to obtain, maintain, protect or enforce our intellectual property rights, including our trade secrets, could cause a loss in revenue and any competitive advantage we hold. There can be no assurance that the steps we take to obtain, maintain, protect and enforce our intellectual property rights will be adequate. Some of our products or services, and the processes we use to produce or provide them, have been granted patent protection, have patent applications pending, or are trade secrets. Our business may be adversely affected when our patents are unenforceable, the claims allowed under our patents are not sufficient to protect our technology, our patent applications are denied, or our trade secrets are not adequately protected. Patent protection on some types of technology, such as software or machine learning processes, may not be available in certain countries in which we operate. Our competitors may also be able to develop technology independently that is similar to ours without infringing on our patents or gaining access to our trade secrets, which could adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. Third parties may claim that we have infringed upon, misappropriated or otherwise violated their intellectual property rights. The tools, techniques, methodologies, programs and components we use to provide our services and products may infringe upon, misappropriate or otherwise violate the intellectual property rights of others or be challenged on that basis. Regardless of the merits, any such claims generally result in significant legal and other costs, including reputational harm, and may distract management from running our business. Resolving such claims could increase our costs, including through royalty payments to acquire licenses, if available, from third parties and through the development of replacement technologies. If a license to resolve a claim were not available, we might not be able to continue providing a particular service or product, which could adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. Failure to obtain and retain skilled technical personnel could impede our operations. We require highly skilled personnel to operate and provide technical services and support for our business. Competition for the personnel required for our businesses intensifies as activity increases and technology evolves. In periods of high utilization, it is often more difficult to find and retain qualified individuals. This could increase our costs or have other material adverse effects on our operations. 13 Our operations are subject to cyber incidents that could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. We are increasingly dependent on digital technologies and services to conduct our business. We use these technologies for internal purposes, including data storage, processing and transmissions, as well as in our interactions with our business associates, such as customers and suppliers. In addition, we develop software and other digital products and services that store, retrieve, manipulate and manage our customers’ information and data, external data, and our own data. Our digital technologies and services, and those of our business associates, are subject to the risk of cyberattacks and, given the nature of such attacks, some incidents can remain undetected for a period of time despite efforts to detect and respond to them in a timely manner. There can be no assurance that the systems we have designed to prevent or limit the effects of cyber incidents or attacks will be sufficient to prevent or detect material consequences arising from such incidents or attacks, or to avoid a material adverse impact on our systems after such incidents or attacks do occur. We have experienced and will continue to experience varying degrees of cyber incidents in the normal conduct of our business, including attacks resulting from phishing emails and ransomware infections. Even if we successfully defend our own digital technologies and services, we also rely on third-party business associates, with whom we may share data and services, to defend their digital technologies and services against attack. We could suffer significant damage to our reputation if a cyber incident or attack were to allow unauthorized access to or modification of our customers’ data, other external data, or our own data, or if the services we provide to our customers were disrupted, or if our digital products or services were reported to have or were perceived as having security vulnerabilities. This could lead to fewer customers using our digital products and services, which could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations. In addition, if our systems, or our third-party business associates’ systems, for protecting against cybersecurity risks prove to be insufficient, we could be adversely affected by, among other things, loss of or damage to intellectual property, proprietary or confidential information, or customer, supplier, or employee data; interruption of our business operations; increased legal and regulatory exposure and costs; and increased costs required to prevent, respond to, or mitigate cybersecurity attacks. These risks could harm our reputation and our relationships with our employees, business associates and other third parties, and may result in claims against us. The occurrence of any of these risks could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Item 1B. Unresolved Staff Comments. None. Item 2. Properties. Schlumberger owns or leases numerous manufacturing facilities, administrative offices, service centers, research centers, data processing centers, mines, and other facilities throughout the world, none of which are individually material. Item 3. Legal Proceedings. The information with respect to this Item 3. Legal Proceedings is set forth in Note 15—Contingencies, in the accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements. Item 4.

Market for Schlumberger’s Common Stock, Related Stockholder Matters and Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities. As of December 31, 2020, there were 24,592 stockholders of record. The principal US market for Schlumberger’s common stock is the New York Stock Exchange (“NYSE”), where it is traded under the symbol “SLB.” The following graph compares the cumulative total stockholder return on Schlumberger common stock with the cumulative total return on the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index (“S&P 500 Index”) and the cumulative total return on the Philadelphia Oil Service Index. It assumes $100 was invested on December 31, 2015 in Schlumberger common stock, in the S&P 500 Index and in the Philadelphia Oil Service Index, as well as the reinvestment of dividends on the last day of the month of payment. The stockholder return set forth below is not necessarily indicative of future performance. The following graph and related information shall not be deemed “soliciting material” or to be “filed” with the SEC, nor shall such information be incorporated by reference into any future filing under the Securities Act of 1933 or the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, except to the extent that Schlumberger specifically incorporates it by reference into such filing.

87347,SLB,SCHLUMBERGER LIMITED/NV,2022,"Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, and the Consolidated Financial Statements and related notes included in this Form 10-K. We urge you to consider carefully the risks described below, which discuss the material factors that make an investment in our securities speculative or risky, as well as in other reports and materials that we file with the SEC and the other information included or incorporated by reference in this Form 10-K. Additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial may also materially adversely affect our business, reputation, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows and prospects. Business and Operational Risks Demand for our products and services is substantially dependent on the levels of expenditures by our customers. Recent oil and gas industry downturns have resulted in reduced demand for oilfield products and services and lower expenditures by our customers, which has in the past had, and may in the future have, a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. Demand for our products and services depends substantially on expenditures by our customers for the exploration, development and production of oil and gas reserves. These expenditures are generally dependent on our customers’ views of future demand for oil and gas and future oil and gas prices, as well as our customers’ ability to access capital. In addition, the transition of the global energy sector from primarily a fossil fuel-based system to renewable energy sources could affect our customers’ levels of expenditures. Actual and anticipated declines in oil and gas prices have in the past resulted in, and may in the future result in, lower capital expenditures, project modifications, delays or cancellations, general business disruptions, and delays in payment of, or nonpayment of, amounts that are owed to us. These effects have had, and may in the future have, a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. Historically, oil and gas prices have experienced significant volatility and can be affected by a variety of factors, including: • changes in the supply of and demand for hydrocarbons, which are affected by general economic and business conditions; • the costs of exploring for, producing and delivering oil and gas; • the ability or willingness of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries and the expanded alliance known as OPEC+ to set and maintain production levels for oil; • the level of oil and gas exploration and production activity; • the level of excess production capacity; • the level of oil and gas inventories; • access to potential resources; • political and economic uncertainty and geopolitical unrest; • governmental laws, policies, regulations and subsidies, including initiatives to promote the use of renewable energy sources; • speculation as to the future price of oil and the speculative trading of oil and gas futures contracts; • technological advances affecting energy consumption; and • extreme weather conditions, natural disasters, and public health or similar issues, such as pandemics and epidemics. The oil and gas industry has historically experienced periodic downturns, which have been characterized by diminished demand for our products and services and downward pressure on the prices that we are able to charge. Sustained market uncertainty can also result in lower demand and pricing for our products and services. A significant industry downturn, sustained market uncertainty, or increased availability of economical alternative energy sources could result in a reduction in demand for our products and services, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows and prospects. Disruptions in the political, regulatory, economic, and social environments of the countries in which we operate could adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. We generate revenue in more than 120 countries across the world. Our non-US operations accounted for approximately 85% of our consolidated revenue in 2021, 81% in 2020 and 72% in 2019. Instability and unforeseen changes in any of the markets in which we operate could result in business disruptions that may have an adverse effect on the demand for our products and services or our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. These factors include, but are not limited to, the following: • uncertain or volatile political, social and economic conditions; 11 • exposure to expropriation, nationalization, deprivation or confiscation of our assets or the assets of our customers, or other governmental actions; • social unrest, acts of terrorism, war or other armed conflict; • public health crises and other catastrophic events, such as the COVID-19 pandemic; • confiscatory taxation or other adverse tax policies; • theft of, or lack of sufficient legal protection for, proprietary technology and other intellectual property; • deprivation of contract rights; • trade and economic sanctions or other restrictions imposed by the European Union, the United States or other regions or countries that could restrict or curtail our ability to operate in certain markets; • unexpected changes in legal and regulatory requirements, including changes in interpretation or enforcement of existing laws; • restrictions on the repatriation of income or capital; • currency exchange controls; • inflation; and • currency exchange, rate fluctuations and devaluations. Failure to effectively and timely address the energy transition could adversely affect our business, results of operations and cash flows. Our long-term success depends on our ability to effectively address the energy transition, which will require adapting our technology portfolio to potentially changing government requirements and customer preferences, as well as engaging with our customers to develop solutions to decarbonize oil and gas operations. If the energy transition landscape changes faster than anticipated or in a manner that we do not anticipate, demand for our products and services could be adversely affected. Furthermore, if we fail or are perceived to not effectively implement an energy transition strategy, or if investors or financial institutions shift funding away from companies in fossil fuel-related industries, our access to capital or the market for our securities could be negatively impacted. We operate in a highly competitive environment. If we are unable to maintain technology leadership, this could adversely affect any competitive advantage we hold. The energy industry is highly competitive. Our business may be adversely affected if we fail to continue developing and producing innovative technologies in response to changes in the market, including customer and government requirements, or if we fail to deliver such technologies to our customers in a timely and cost-competitive manner. If we are unable to maintain technology leadership in our industry, our ability to maintain market share, defend, maintain or increase prices for our products and services, and negotiate acceptable contract terms with our customers could be adversely affected. Furthermore, if competing technology accelerates the obsolescence of any of our products or services, the value of our intellectual property may be reduced, which could adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. Limitations on our ability to obtain, maintain, protect or enforce our intellectual property rights, including our trade secrets, could cause a loss in revenue and any competitive advantage we hold. There can be no assurance that the steps we take to obtain, maintain, protect and enforce our intellectual property rights will be adequate. Some of our products or services, and the processes we use to produce or provide them, have been granted patent protection, have patent applications pending, or are trade secrets. Our business may be adversely affected when our patents are unenforceable, the claims allowed under our patents are not sufficient to protect our technology, our patent applications are denied, or our trade secrets are not adequately protected. Patent protection on some types of technology, such as software or machine learning processes, may not be available in certain countries in which we operate. Our competitors may also be able to develop technology independently that is similar to ours without infringing on our patents or gaining access to our trade secrets, which could adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. Third parties may claim that we have infringed upon or otherwise violated their intellectual property rights. The tools, techniques, methodologies, programs and components we use to provide our services and products may infringe upon or otherwise violate the intellectual property rights of others or be challenged on that basis. Regardless of the merits, any such claims generally result in significant legal and other costs, including reputational harm, and may distract management from running our business. Resolving such claims could increase our costs, including through royalty payments to acquire licenses, if available, from third parties and through the development of replacement technologies. If a license to resolve a claim were not available, we might not be able to continue providing a particular service or product, which could adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. 12 Legal and Regulatory Risks Our operations require us to comply with numerous laws and regulations, violations of which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. Our operations are subject to international, regional, national, and local laws and regulations in every place where we operate, relating to matters such as environmental protection, health and safety, labor and employment, import/export controls, currency exchange, bribery and corruption, data privacy and cybersecurity, intellectual property, immigration, and taxation. These laws and regulations are complex, frequently change, and have tended to become more stringent over time. In the event the scope of these laws and regulations expands in the future, the incremental cost of compliance could adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows. Our operations are subject to anti-corruption and anti-bribery laws and regulations, such as the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, the U.K. Bribery Act and other similar laws. We are also subject to trade control regulations and trade sanctions laws that restrict the movement of certain goods to, and certain operations in, various countries or with certain persons. Our ability to transfer people, products and data among certain countries is subject to maintaining required licenses and complying with these laws and regulations. The internal controls, policies and procedures, and employee training and compliance programs we have implemented to deter prohibited practices may not be effective in preventing employees, contractors or agents from violating or circumventing such internal policies or from material violations of applicable laws and regulations. Any determination that we have violated or are responsible for violations of anti-bribery, trade control, trade sanctions or anti-corruption laws could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition. Violations of international and US laws and regulations or the loss of any required licenses may result in fines and penalties, criminal sanctions, administrative remedies or restrictions on business conduct, and could have a material adverse effect on our business, operations and financial condition. In addition, any major violations could have a significant effect on our reputation and consequently on our ability to win future business and maintain existing customer and supplier relationships. Existing or future laws, regulations, court orders or other initiatives to limit greenhouse gas emissions or relating to climate change may reduce demand for our products and services. Continuing political and social attention to the issue of climate change has resulted in both existing and proposed international agreements and national, regional and local legislation and regulatory measures to limit GHG emissions. The implementation of these agreements, including the Paris Agreement, the Europe Climate Law, and other existing or future regulatory mandates, may adversely affect the demand for our products and services, impose taxes on us or our customers, require us or our customers to reduce GHG emissions from our technologies or operations, or accelerate the obsolescence of our products or services. In addition, increasing attention to the risks of climate change has resulted in an increased possibility of litigation or investigations brought by public and private entities against oil and gas companies in connection with their GHG emissions. As a result, we or our customers may become subject to court orders compelling a reduction of GHG emissions or requiring mitigation of the effects of climate change. There is also increased focus by governments and our customers, investors and other stakeholders on climate change, sustainability and energy transition matters. Negative attitudes toward or perceptions of our industry or fossil fuel products and their relationship to the environment have led governments, non-governmental organizations, and companies to implement initiatives to conserve energy and promote the use of alternative energy sources, which may reduce the demand for and production of oil and gas in areas of the world where our customers operate, and thus reduce future demand for our products and services. In addition, initiatives by investors and financial institutions to limit funding to companies in fossil fuel-related industries may adversely affect our liquidity or access to capital. Any of these initiatives may, in turn, adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. Environmental compliance costs and liabilities arising as a result of environmental laws and regulations could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. We are subject to numerous laws and regulations relating to environmental protection, including those governing air and GHG emissions, water discharges and waste management, as well as the importation and use of hazardous materials, radioactive materials, chemicals and explosives. The technical requirements of these laws and regulations are becoming increasingly complex, stringent and expensive to implement. These laws sometimes provide for “strict liability” for remediation costs, damages to natural resources or threats to public health and safety. Strict liability can render us liable for damages without regard to our degree of care or fault. Some environmental laws provide for joint and several strict liability for remediation of spills and releases of hazardous substances, and, as a result, we could be liable for the actions of others. We use and generate hazardous substances and wastes in our operations. In addition, many of our current and former properties are, or have been, used for industrial purposes. Accordingly, we could become subject to material liabilities relating to the investigation 13 and cleanup of potentially contaminated properties, and to claims alleging personal injury or property damage as a result of exposures to, or releases of, hazardous substances. In addition, stricter enforcement or changing interpretations of existing laws and regulations, the enactment of new laws and regulations, the discovery of previously unknown contamination or the imposition of new or increased requirements could require us to incur costs or become the basis for new or increased liabilities that could have a material adverse effect on our business, operations and financial condition. We could be subject to substantial liability claims, including as a result of well incidents, which could adversely affect our reputation, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. The technical complexities of our operations expose us to a wide range of significant health, safety and environmental risks. Our operations involve production-related activities, radioactive materials, chemicals, explosives and other equipment and services that are deployed in challenging exploration, development and production environments. Accidents or acts of malfeasance involving these services or equipment, or a failure of a product (including as a result of a cyberattack), could cause personal injury, loss of life, damage to or destruction of property, equipment or the environment, or suspension of operations, which could materially adversely affect us. Any well incidents, including blowouts at a well site or any loss of containment or well control, may expose us to additional liabilities, which could be material. Generally, we rely on contractual indemnities, releases, and limitations on liability with our customers and insurance to protect us from potential liability related to such events. However, our insurance may not protect us against liability for certain kinds of events, including events involving pollution, or against losses resulting from business interruption. Moreover, we may not be able to maintain insurance at levels of risk coverage or policy limits that we deem adequate. Any damages caused by our services or products that are not covered by insurance or are in excess of policy limits or subject to substantial deductibles, could adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. General Risk Factors The COVID-19 pandemic and resulting adverse economic conditions have had, and may to continue to have, a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. The COVID-19 pandemic caused a significant and swift reduction in global economic activity during 2020, which significantly weakened demand for oil and gas, and in turn, for our products and services. Other effects of the pandemic included, and may continue to include, significant volatility and disruption of the global financial markets; adverse revenue and net income effects; disruptions to our operations, including suspension or deferral of drilling activities; customer shutdowns of oil and gas exploration and production; downward revisions to customer budgets; limitations on access to sources of liquidity; supply chain disruptions; limitations on access to raw materials; employee impacts from illness, school closures and other community response measures; and temporary closures of our facilities or the facilities of our customers and suppliers. The pandemic is continuously evolving, and the extent to which our operating and financial results will continue to be affected will depend on various factors beyond our control, such as the ultimate duration, severity and sustained geographic resurgence of the virus; the emergence of new variants and strains of the virus; and the success of actions to contain the virus and its variants, or treat its impact, such as the availability and acceptance of vaccines. COVID-19, and the volatile regional and global economic conditions stemming from the pandemic, could also aggravate our other risk factors described in this Form 10-K. Our operations are subject to cyber incidents that could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. We are highly dependent on digital technologies and services to conduct our business. We use these technologies for internal purposes, including data storage, processing and transmission, as well as in our interactions with our business associates, such as customers and suppliers. In addition, we develop software and other digital products and services that store, retrieve, manipulate and manage our customers’ information and data, external data, personal data, and our own data. Our digital technologies and services, and those of our business associates, are subject to the risk of cyberattacks and, given the nature of such attacks, some incidents can remain undetected for a period of time despite efforts to detect and respond to them in a timely manner. There can be no assurance that the systems we have designed to prevent or limit the effects of cyber incidents or attacks will be sufficient to prevent or detect material consequences arising from such incidents or attacks, or to avoid a material adverse impact on our systems after such incidents or attacks do occur. We have experienced and will continue to experience varying degrees of cyber incidents in the normal conduct of our business, including attacks resulting from phishing emails and ransomware infections. Even if we successfully defend our own digital technologies and services, we also rely on third-party business associates, with whom we may share data and services, to defend their digital technologies and services against attack. We could suffer significant damage to our reputation if a cyber incident or attack were to allow unauthorized access to or modification of our customers’ data, other external data, personal data, or our own data, or if the services we provide to our customers were disrupted, or if our digital products or services were reported to have or were perceived as having security vulnerabilities. This could lead to fewer customers using our digital products and services, which could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations. In addition, if our systems, or our third-party business associates’ systems, for protecting against cybersecurity risks prove to be insufficient, we could be adversely affected by, among other things, loss of or damage to intellectual property, proprietary or confidential information, or customer, supplier, or employee data; breach of personal data; interruption of our business operations; increased legal and regulatory exposure, including fines and remediation costs; and increased costs required to 14 prevent, respond to, or mitigate cybersecurity attacks. These risks could harm our reputation and our relationships with our employees, business associates and other third parties, and may result in claims against us. The occurrence of any of these risks could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Our aspirations, goals, and initiatives related to sustainability and emissions reduction, and our public statements and disclosures regarding them, expose us to numerous risks. We have developed, and will continue to develop and set, goals, targets, and other objectives related to sustainability matters, including our net-zero target and our energy transition strategy. Statements related to these goals, targets and objectives reflect our current plans and do not constitute a guarantee that they will be achieved. Our efforts to research, establish, accomplish, and accurately report on these goals, targets, and objectives expose us to numerous operational, reputational, financial, legal, and other risks. Our ability to achieve any stated goal, target, or objective, including with respect to emissions reduction, is subject to numerous factors and conditions, some of which are outside of our control. Our business may face increased scrutiny from investors and other stakeholders related to our sustainability activities, including the goals, targets, and objectives that we announce, and our methodologies and timelines for pursuing them. If our sustainability practices do not meet investor or other stakeholder expectations and standards, which continue to evolve, our reputation, our ability to attract or retain employees, and our attractiveness as an investment or business partner could be negatively affected. Similarly, our failure or perceived failure to pursue or fulfill our sustainability-focused goals, targets, and objectives, to comply with ethical, environmental, or other standards, regulations, or expectations, or to satisfy various reporting standards with respect to these matters, within the timelines we announce, or at all, could adversely affect our business or reputation, as well as expose us to government enforcement actions and private litigation. Failure to attract and retain qualified personnel could impede our operations. Our future success depends on our ability to recruit, train, and retain qualified personnel. We require highly skilled personnel to operate and provide technical services and support for our business. Competition for the personnel necessary for our businesses intensifies as activity increases and technology evolves. In periods of high utilization, it is often more difficult to find and retain qualified individuals. This could increase our costs or have other material adverse effects on our operations. Severe weather, including extreme weather conditions associated with climate change, has in the past and may in the future adversely affect our operations and financial results. Our business has been, and in the future will be, affected by severe weather in areas where we operate, which could materially affect our operations and financial results. Extreme weather conditions such as hurricanes, flooding and landslides have in the past resulted in, and may in the future result in, the evacuation of personnel, stoppage of services and activity disruptions at our facilities, in our supply chain, or at well-sites, or result in disruptions of our customers’ operations. Particularly severe weather events affecting platforms or structures may result in a suspension of activities. In addition, acute or chronic physical impacts of climate change, such as sea level rise, coastal storm surge, inland flooding from intense rainfall and hurricane-strength winds may damage our facilities. Any such extreme weather events may result in increased operating costs or decreases in revenue, which could adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. Item 1B.

The following discussion and analysis contains forward-looking statements, including, without limitation, statements relating to our plans, strategies, objectives, expectations, intentions and resources. Such forward-looking statements should be read in conjunction with our disclosures under “Item 1A. Risk Factors” of this Form 10-K. This section of the Form 10-K generally discusses 2021 and 2020 items and year-to-year comparisons between 2021 and 2020. Discussions of 2019 items and year-to-year comparison between 2020 and 2019 that are not included in this Form 10-K can be found in “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” in Part II, Item 7 of Schlumberger’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2020. 2021 Executive Overview Continuing a broad recovery that began in 2020, oil markets were generally positive throughout the year, with Brent oil price starting 2021 at the year’s low of $51 per barrel, reaching a high of $85 in November. Sentiment in oil markets was largely positive as global demand recovered and supply was managed by a combination of the reassurance of continued intervention from OPEC+, and ongoing capital discipline by publicly traded operators in North America. Within the context of strengthening fundamentals across the year, there were several instances where the potential impact of COVID-19 variants raised concerns regarding demand growth. However, these periods were shorter lived than the prolonged decline in 2020, which was characterized by economic lockdowns, and oil prices soon rebounded. Pricing was initially supported by OPEC+ production agreements that had come into effect in 2020 and remained resilient as those production targets were gradually increased in the second half of 2021, as crude and product stocks continued a multiyear downward trend. International activity grew broadly across geographies in the second half of the year, including offshore and deepwater, with operators investing in projects to meet long-term objectives and regional demand growth. Activity in North America land also rebounded, albeit from a very low base in 2020, but did not return to prepandemic levels, as investment and production were subdued as a result of continued capital discipline on the part of larger producers. International natural gas pricing, while following the traditional seasonal pattern, was volatile, swinging from pandemic-driven lows in 2020 to record highs around the world. Domestically, US Henry Hub natural gas prices rose dramatically, averaging $3.91 per million British thermal units on a monthly basis—as compared to $2.04 in 2020—and reaching a peak of $5.87 in October before ending the year at $3.73. Against this backdrop, Schlumberger’s full-year 2021 revenue of $22.9 billion decreased 3% year-on-year as a result of the divestitures of the OneStim pressure pumping business and the North America low-flow artificial lift business during the fourth quarter of 2020. These divestitures were consistent with Schlumberger’s strategy to focus on expanding margins, minimizing earnings volatility and focusing on less capital-intensive businesses by high-grading and rationalizing its business portfolio. The divested businesses accounted for approximately 25% of Schlumberger’s North America revenue in 2020. Excluding the impact of these divestitures, which generated $1.3 billion of revenue during 2020 (all of which was in North America), full-year 2021 global revenue grew 3% year-on-year, driven by an 8% increase in North America and a 2% increase in international revenue. Financial performance in 2021 was driven by global oil and gas activity growth in the second half of the year as investment spending experienced double-digit growth year-on-year. Consequently, Schlumberger’s revenue in the second half of 2021 grew 12% compared to the same period of 2020, and increased 18% when adjusted for the effects of the divestitures. International revenue increased 12% year-on-year during the second half of 2021, and North America revenue increased 10%, or 44% when adjusted for the effects of the divestitures (which generated $0.5 billion of revenue during the second half of 2020). Looking ahead into 2022, we believe the industry macro fundamentals are very favorable, due to the combination of projected steady demand recovery, an increasingly tight supply market, and supportive oil prices. Schlumberger expects this to result in a material step up in industry capital spending with double-digit growth in both the international and North American markets. Absent any further significant COVID-related disruption, oil demand is expected to exceed prepandemic levels before the end of the year and further strengthen in 2023. We believe these favorable market conditions are similar to those experienced during the last industry supercycle, suggesting that resurgent global demand-led capital spending will result in an exceptional multiyear growth cycle. Throughout 2021, Schlumberger continued to strengthen its core portfolio, enhanced its sustainability leadership, successfully advanced its digital journey, and expanded its new energy portfolio. Schlumberger is well prepared to fully seize this growth ahead. Schlumberger is entering this cycle in a position of strength, having reset its operating leverage, expanded peer-leading margins across multiple quarters, and aligned its technology and business portfolio with the new industry imperatives. 17 Fourth Quarter 2021 Results (Stated in millions) Fourth Quarter 2021 Third Quarter 2021 Income Income Before Before Revenue Taxes Revenue Taxes Digital & Integration $ 889 $ 335 $ 812 $ 284 Reservoir Performance 1,287 200 1,192 190 Well Construction 2,388 368 2,273 345 Production Systems 1,765 159 1,674 166 Eliminations & other (104 ) (76 ) (104 ) (77 ) 986 908 Corporate & other (1) (140 ) (145 ) Interest income (2) 14 8 Interest expense (3) (123 ) (127 ) Charges & credits (4) 18 47 $ 6,225 $ 755 $ 5,847 $ 691 (1) Comprised principally of certain corporate expenses not allocated to the segments, stock-based compensation costs, amortization expense associated with certain intangible assets, certain centrally managed initiatives and other nonoperating items. (2) Excludes interest income included in the segments’ income (fourth quarter 2021: $1 million; third quarter 2021: $- million). (3) Excludes interest expense included in the segments’ income (fourth quarter 2021: $4 million; third quarter 2021: $3 million). (4) Charges and credits are described in detail in Note 3 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Fourth-quarter revenue of $6.22 billion increased 6% sequentially as a result of broad-based growth across all geographies and Divisions. International revenue of $4.90 billion grew 5% sequentially, driven primarily by strengthening activity, increased digital sales, and early benefits of pricing improvements. The sequential revenue increase was led by growth in Europe/CIS/Africa largely due to strong offshore activity in Africa. This growth was complemented by project startups and activity gains in the Middle East & Asia and sustained activity growth in Latin America. In North America, revenue of $1.28 billion grew 13% sequentially, outperforming the rig count growth. The sequential growth was driven by strong offshore and land drilling activity and increased exploration data licensing. Fourth-quarter pretax segment operating margin of 16% increased 31 basis points (bps) sequentially, reaching its highest quarterly level since 2015, largely as a result of the accretive effect of accelerating digital sales. Digital & Integration Fourth-quarter revenue of $889 million increased 10% sequentially, propelled by accelerated digital sales internationally, particularly in Europe/CIS/Africa and Middle East & Asia, and increased exploration data licensing sales in North America offshore and the Permian. These increases, however, were partially offset by the effects of a temporary production interruption in the APS projects in Ecuador due to pipeline disruption. Digital & Integration pretax operating margin of 38% expanded 268 bps sequentially, primarily due to higher digital and exploration data licensing sales. Reservoir Performance Fourth-quarter revenue of $1.3 billion increased 8% sequentially, primarily due to higher intervention activity across the international offshore markets and activity gains in the Middle East & Asia. Reservoir Performance pretax operating margin of 16% was essentially flat sequentially. 18 Well Construction Fourth-quarter revenue of $2.4 billion increased 5% sequentially, driven by higher measurements and drilling fluids activity and increased drilling equipment sales. North America revenue increased 15% due to higher rig count on land and increased well construction activity in the US Gulf of Mexico. International revenue growth of 3% was driven by growth in Latin America. Well Construction pretax operating margin of 15% was essentially flat sequentially. Production Systems Fourth-quarter revenue of $1.8 billion increased 5% sequentially driven by a 6% increase in international revenue. This growth was mainly in Europe/CIS/Africa as a result of strong project progress. Production Systems pretax operating margin of 9% declined 85 bps sequentially due to an unfavorable mix and the impact of delayed deliveries due to global supply and logistics constraints.

(2) Excludes interest income included in the segments’ income (2021: $2 million; 2020: $2 million). (3) Excludes interest expense included in the segments’ income (2021: $15 million; 2020: $28 million). (4) Charges and credits are described in detail in Note 3 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Full-year 2021 revenue of $22.9 billion decreased 3% year-on-year primarily as a result of the divestitures of the OneStim pressure pumping business and the low-flow artificial lift business during the fourth quarter of 2020. Excluding the impact of these divestitures, which generated $1.3 billion of revenue (all of which was in North America) during 2020, global revenue increased 3% year-on-year. In North America revenue declined 18% year-on-year; however, excluding the impact of the previously described divestitures, full-year revenue increased 8%. International revenue also increased 2%. The growth in 2021 was driven by strong global oil and gas activity in the second half of the year. Schlumberger’s revenue in the second half of 2021 grew 12% compared to the same period of 2020 and increased 18% when adjusted for the effects of the divestitures. This growth was pervasive across all geographies and Divisions. Full-year 2021 pretax operating margin of 15% was 450 bps higher compared to 2020, primarily due to the divestiture of certain businesses in North America, which were previously dilutive to margins, combined with reduced depreciation and amortization expense following the asset impairment charges recorded during 2020 and the effects of cost reduction measures. 19 Digital & Integration Full-year 2021 revenue of $3.3 billion increased 7% year-on-year, primarily driven by robust APS project revenue from higher production and improved oil prices. Year-on-year, pretax operating margin increased 11 percentage points to 35%. Operating margin increased due to improved profitability from APS projects as a result of higher oil prices and reduced amortization expense following the asset impairment charges that were recorded during 2020 relating to certain APS investments. Reservoir Performance Full-year 2021 revenue of $4.6 billion decreased 18% year-on-year, largely reflecting the effects of the OneStim divestiture, which generated $1.2 billion of revenue during 2020. Excluding the impact of the OneStim divestiture, revenue increased 5% year-on-year primarily driven by strong activity in Latin America. Year-on-year, pretax operating margin increased by 779 bps to 14% despite the significant drop in revenue, primarily due to the divestiture of the OneStim business, which was previously dilutive to margins. Well Construction Full-year 2021 revenue of $8.7 billion increased 1% year-on-year. Year-on-year, pretax operating margin increased 363 bps to 14% despite the relatively flat revenue, largely as a result of the implementation of cost control measures. Production Systems Full-year 2021 revenue of $6.7 billion increased 1% year-on-year, primarily driven by improved international activity that was largely offset by a decline in completions activity in North America as a result of the pandemic. Year-on-year, pretax operating margin was essentially flat at 9%. Interest and Other Income Interest & other income consisted of the following: (Stated in millions) 2021 2020 Earnings of equity method investments $ 40 $ 91 Interest income 33 33 Unrealized gain on marketable securities 47 39 Gain on sale of Liberty shares 28 - $ 148 $ 163 The decrease in earnings of equity method investments in 2021 as compared to 2020 is primarily attributable to Schlumberger’s share of net losses associated with Schlumberger’s investment in Liberty. Schlumberger records its share of Liberty’s net income or loss on a one-quarter lag. During the fourth quarter of 2021 Schlumberger sold 9.5 million of its shares of Liberty and recognized a gain of $28 million. See Note 3 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. During the third quarter of 2021, a start-up company that Schlumberger previously invested in was acquired. As a result of this transaction, Schlumberger’s ownership interest was converted into shares of a publicly traded company. Schlumberger recognized an unrealized pretax gain of $47 million to increase the carrying value of this investment to its estimated fair value of approximately $55 million. See Note 3 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. During the fourth quarter of 2020, a start-up company that Schlumberger previously invested in completed an initial public offering. As a result, Schlumberger recognized an unrealized gain of $39 million to increase the carrying value of this investment to its fair 20 value of $43 million as of December 31, 2020. See Note 3 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Schlumberger sold this investment during 2021, which did not result in a material gain or loss. Interest Expense Interest expense of $539 million in 2021 decreased $24 million compared to 2020 primarily as a result of the $2.7 billion year-on-year reduction in total debt outstanding. Other Research & engineering and General & administrative expenses, as a percentage of Revenue, were as follows: 2021 2020 Research & engineering 2.4 % 2.5 % General & administrative 1.5 % 1.5 % Income Taxes The Schlumberger effective tax rate is sensitive to the geographic mix of earnings. When the percentage of pretax earnings generated outside of North America increases, the Schlumberger effective tax rate generally decreases. Conversely, when the percentage of pretax earnings generated outside of North America decreases, the Schlumberger effective tax rate generally increases. The Schlumberger effective tax rate was 19% in 2021 as compared to 7% in 2020. The increase in the effective tax rate was primarily due to the charges and credits described in Note 3 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. These charges and credits reduced the effective tax rate in 2020 by 12 percentage points as a significant portion of these charges were not tax-effective. Charges and Credits Schlumberger recorded charges and credits during 2021 and 2020. These charges and credits, which are summarized below, are more fully described in Note 3 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. The following is a summary of the 2021 charges and credits. (Stated in millions) Pretax Tax Net Third quarter: Unrealized gain on marketable securities $ (47 ) $ (11 ) $ (36 ) Fourth quarter: Gain on sale of Liberty shares (28 ) (4 ) (24 ) Early repayment of bonds 10 - 10 $ (65 ) $ (15 ) $ (50 ) 21 The following is a summary of the 2020 charges and credits.

Approximately $33 million of this quarterly reduction is reflected in the Digital & Integration Division and $12 million is reflected in the Reservoir Performance Division. The remaining $50 million is reflected in the “Corporate & other” line item. As a result of the second quarter 2020 restructuring and impairment charges, commencing with the third quarter of 2020, depreciation and amortization expense was reduced by approximately $80 million and lease expense was reduced by $25 million on a quarterly basis. Approximately $51 million of this quarterly reduction is reflected in the Digital & Integration Division and $31 million is reflected in the Reservoir Performance Division, with the remaining $23 million reflected among the Well Construction Division and Production Systems Division. As a result of the third quarter 2020 restructuring charges, commencing with the fourth quarter of 2020, depreciation and lease expense was reduced by $15 million on a quarterly basis. This quarterly reduction is reflected among all of the Divisions. 22 Liquidity and Capital Resources Details of the components of liquidity as well as changes in liquidity follow: (Stated in millions) Dec. 31, Dec. 31, Components of Liquidity: 2021 2020 Cash $ 1,757 $ 844 Short-term investments 1,382 2,162 Short-term borrowings and current portion of long-term debt (909 ) (850 ) Long-term debt (13,286 ) (16,036 ) Net debt (1) $ (11,056 ) $ (13,880 ) Changes in Liquidity: 2021 2020 Net income (loss) $ 1,928 $ (10,486 ) Impairments and other charges and credits (65 ) 12,515 Depreciation and amortization (2) 2,120 2,566 Deferred taxes (31 ) (1,248 ) Earnings of equity method investments, less dividends received 10 (28 ) Stock-based compensation expense 324 397 Increase in working capital (3) (45 ) (833 ) US Federal tax refund 477 - Other (67 ) 61 Cash flow from operations 4,651 2,944 Capital expenditures (1,141 ) (1,116 ) APS investments (474 ) (303 ) Multiclient seismic data capitalized (39 ) (101 ) Free cash flow (4) 2,997 1,424 Dividends paid (699 ) (1,734 ) Stock repurchase program - (26 ) Proceeds from employee stock plans 137 146 Proceeds from sale of Liberty shares 109 - Net proceeds from divestitures - 434 Business acquisitions and investments, net of cash acquired plus debt assumed (103 ) (33 ) Repayment of finance lease obligations - (188 ) Other (105 ) (181 ) Change in net debt before impact of changes in foreign exchange rates on net debt 2,336 (158 ) Impact of changes in foreign exchange rates on net debt 488 (595 ) (Increase) decrease in Net Debt 2,824 (753 ) Net Debt, Beginning of period (13,880 ) (13,127 ) Net Debt, End of period $ (11,056 ) $ (13,880 ) (1) “Net debt” represents gross debt less cash and short-term investments. Management believes that Net debt provides useful information regarding the level of Schlumberger’s indebtedness by reflecting cash and investments that could be used to repay debt. Net debt is a non-GAAP financial measure that should be considered in addition to, not as a substitute for or superior to, total debt. (2) Includes depreciation of property, plant and equipment and amortization of intangible assets, multiclient seismic data costs and APS investments. (3) Includes severance payments of $248 million and $843 million during 2021 and 2020, respectively. (4) “Free cash flow” represents cash flow from operations less capital expenditures, APS investments and multiclient seismic data costs capitalized. Management believes that free cash flow is an important liquidity measure for the company and that it is useful to investors and management as a measure of our ability to generate cash. Once business needs and obligations are met, this cash can be used to reinvest in the company for future growth or to return to shareholders through dividend payments or share repurchases. Free cash flow does not represent the residual cash flow available for discretionary expenditures. Free cash flow is a non-GAAP financial measure that should be considered in addition to, not as a substitute for or superior to, cash flow from operations. 23 Key liquidity events during 2021 and 2020 included: • In April 2020, in light of the uncertainty of the depth and extent of the contraction in oil demand due to the COVID-19 pandemic combined with the weaker commodity price environment at the time, Schlumberger announced a 75% reduction to its quarterly cash dividend. The revised dividend supports Schlumberger’s value proposition through a balanced approach of shareholder distributions and organic investment, and provided flexibility to address the uncertain environment. This decision reflected the Company’s focus on its capital stewardship program as well as its commitment to maintain both a strong liquidity position and a strong investment grade credit rating that provides privileged access to the financial markets. Dividends paid during 2021 and 2020 were $0.7 billion and $1.7 billion, respectively. • Cash flow from operations was $4.7 billion in 2021 and $2.9 billion in 2020. The increase in cash flow from operations in 2021 as compared to 2020 was driven by the sharp increase in earnings excluding non-cash charges and credits and depreciation and amortization expense as a result of the improved business conditions in 2021, as well as the receipt of the $0.5 billion US federal tax refund described below and a $0.6 billion year-on-year reduction in severance payments. • On January 21, 2016, the Schlumberger Board of Directors approved a $10 billion share repurchase program for Schlumberger common stock. Schlumberger had repurchased $1.0 billion of Schlumberger common stock under this program as of December 31, 2021. Schlumberger did not repurchase any of its common stock during 2021, and repurchased $26 million of its common stock during 2020. • Capital investments (consisting of capital expenditures, APS investments and multiclient seismic data capitalized) were $1.7 billion in 2021 and $1.5 billion in 2020. Capital investments during 2022 are expected to be between $1.9 billion and $2.0 billion. • During the fourth quarter of 2021, Schlumberger deposited sufficient funds with the trustee for its $1.0 billion of 2.40% Senior Notes due 2022 (including payment of the February 1, 2022 interest payment) to satisfy and discharge all of its obligations relating to such notes. As a result of this transaction, Schlumberger recorded a charge of $10 million. This charge is reflected in Interest in the Consolidated Statement of Income (Loss). See Note 3 – Charges and Credits. • During the fourth quarter of 2021 Schlumberger sold 9.5 million of its shares of Liberty and received proceeds of $109 million. • During the second quarter of 2021, Schlumberger repurchased all $665 million of its 3.30% Senior Notes due 2021. • During the second quarter of 2021, Schlumberger received a federal tax refund of $477 million relating to the carryback of US net operating losses pursuant to the Coronavirus Aid, Relief and Economic Security Act. • During the fourth quarter of 2020, Schlumberger repaid certain finance lease obligations totaling $188 million as a result of the OneStim transaction. • During the third quarter of 2020, Schlumberger issued $500 million of 1.40% Senior Notes due 2025 and $350 million of 2.65% Senior Notes due 2030. • During the second quarter of 2020, Schlumberger issued €1.0 billion of 1.375% Guaranteed Notes due 2026, $900 million of 2.650% Senior Notes due 2030 and €1.0 billion of 2.00% Guaranteed Notes due 2032. • During the second quarter of 2020, Schlumberger repurchased all $600 million of its 4.20% Senior Notes due 2021 and $935 million of its 3.30% Senior Notes due 2021. Schlumberger paid a premium of approximately $40 million in connection with these repurchases. This premium was classified in Impairments & other in the Consolidated Statement of Income (Loss). See Note 3 – Charges and Credits. • During the first quarter of 2020, Schlumberger issued €400 million of 0.25% Notes due 2027 and €400 million of 0.50% Notes due 2031. • During the first quarter of 2020, Schlumberger completed the sale of its 49% interest in the Bandurria Sur Block in Argentina. The net cash proceeds from this transaction, combined with the proceeds received from the divestiture of a smaller APS project, amounted to $298 million. As of December 31, 2021, Schlumberger had $3.14 billion of cash and short-term investments and committed credit facility agreements with commercial banks aggregating $6.60 billion, all of which was available and unused. Schlumberger believes these amounts, along with cash generated by ongoing operations, will be sufficient to meet future business requirements for the next 12 months and beyond. 24 The following table reflects the carrying amounts of Schlumberger’s debt at December 31, 2021 by year of maturity: (Stated in millions) 2022 2023 2024 2025 2026 2027 2028 2029 Thereafter Total Fixed rate debt 2.65% Senior Notes $ 600 600 3.63% Senior Notes 295 295 3.65% Senior Notes $ 1,497 1,497 4.00% Notes 80 80 3.70% Notes $ 55 55 3.75% Senior Notes 748 748 0.00% Notes 563 563 1.40% Senior Notes $ 498 498 4.00% Senior Notes 930 930 1.375% Guaranteed Notes $ 1,125 1,125 1.00% Guaranteed Notes 679 679 0.25% Notes $ 1,013 1,013 3.90% Senior Notes $ 1,457 1,457 4.30% Senior Notes $ 846 846 2.65% Senior Notes $ 1,250 1,250 0.50% Notes 1,012 1,012 2.00% Guaranteed Notes 1,118 1,118 7.00% Notes 204 204 5.95% Notes 113 113 5.13% Notes 98 98 Total fixed rate debt $ 895 $ 1,577 $ 1,366 $ 1,428 $ 1,804 $ 1,013 $ 1,457 $ 846 $ 3,795 $ 14,181 Variable rate debt 14 - - - - - - - - 14 Total $ 909 $ 1,577 $ 1,366 $ 1,428 $ 1,804 $ 1,013 $ 1,457 $ 846 $ 3,795 $ 14,195 Interest payments on fixed rate debt obligations by year are as follows: (Stated in millions) 2022 $ 446 2023 418 2024 343 2025 317 2026 265 Thereafter 941 $ 2,730 See Note 13, Leases of the Consolidated Financial Statements for details regarding Schlumberger’s lease obligations. Schlumberger has outstanding letters of credit/guarantees that relate to business performance bonds, custom/excise tax commitments, facility lease/rental obligations, etc. These were entered into in the ordinary course of business and are customary practices in the various countries where Schlumberger operates. 25 Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates The preparation of financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States requires Schlumberger to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, the disclosure of contingent liabilities and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses. The following accounting policies involve “critical accounting estimates” because they are particularly dependent on estimates and assumptions made by Schlumberger about matters that are inherently uncertain. Schlumberger bases its estimates on historical experience and on various assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. Allowance for Doubtful Accounts Schlumberger maintains an allowance for doubtful accounts in order to record accounts receivable at their net realizable value. Judgment is involved in recording and making adjustments to this reserve. Allowances have been recorded for receivables believed to be uncollectible, including amounts for the resolution of potential credit and other collection issues such as disputed invoices. Adjustments to the allowance may be required in future periods depending on how such potential issues are resolved, or if the financial condition of Schlumberger’s customers were to deteriorate resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments. As a large multinational company with a long history of operating in a cyclical industry, Schlumberger has extensive experience in working with its customers during difficult times to manage its accounts receivable. During weak economic environments or when there is an extended period of weakness in oil and gas prices, Schlumberger typically experiences delays in the payment of its receivables. However, except for a $469 million accounts receivable write-off during 2017 as a result of the political and economic condition in Venezuela, Schlumberger has not historically had material write-offs due to uncollectible accounts receivable. Schlumberger generates revenue in more than 120 countries. As of December 31, 2021, five of those countries individually accounted for greater than 5% of Schlumberger’s net accounts receivable balance, of which only one (the United States) accounted for greater than 10% of such receivables. At times in recent periods, Schlumberger has experienced delays in payments from its primary customer in Mexico. Included in Receivables, less allowance for doubtful accounts in the Consolidated Balance Sheet as of December 30, 2021 is approximately $0.5 billion of receivables relating to Mexico at December 31, 2021 ($0.7 billion at December 31, 2020). Schlumberger’s receivables from its primary customer in Mexico are not in dispute and Schlumberger has not historically had any material write-offs due to uncollectible accounts receivable relating to this customer. Goodwill, Intangible Assets and Long-Lived Assets Schlumberger records the excess of purchase price over the fair value of the tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed as goodwill. The goodwill relating to each of Schlumberger’s reporting units is tested for impairment annually as well as when an event, or change in circumstances, indicates an impairment may have occurred. Under generally accepted accounting principles, Schlumberger has the option to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether the existence of events or circumstances leads to a determination that it is more likely than not that the fair value of one or more of its reporting units is greater than its carrying amount. If, after assessing the totality of events or circumstances, Schlumberger determines it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is greater than its carrying amount, there is no need to perform any further testing. However, if Schlumberger concludes otherwise, then it is required to perform a quantitative impairment test by calculating the fair value of the reporting unit and comparing the fair value with the carrying amount of the reporting unit. If the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying value, an impairment loss is recorded based on that difference. Schlumberger has the option to bypass the qualitative assessment for any reporting unit in any period and proceed directly to performing the quantitative goodwill impairment test. Schlumberger elected to perform the qualitative assessment described above for purposes of its annual goodwill impairment test in 2021. Based on this assessment, Schlumberger concluded it was more likely than not that the fair value of each of its reporting units was significantly greater than its carrying amount. Accordingly, no further testing was required. During 2020 and 2019, Schlumberger recorded goodwill impairment charges of $3.1 billion and $8.8 billion and intangible asset impairment charges of $3.3 billion and $1.1 billion, respectively. Refer to Note 3 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for details regarding the facts and circumstances that led to this impairment and how the fair value of each reporting unit was estimated, including the significant assumptions used and other details. Long-lived assets, including fixed assets, intangible assets and investments in APS projects, are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable. In reviewing for impairment, the carrying value of such assets is compared to the estimated undiscounted future cash flows expected from the use of the assets and their eventual 26 disposition. If such cash flows are not sufficient to support the asset’s recorded value, an impairment charge is recognized to reduce the carrying value of the long-lived asset to its estimated fair value. The determination of future cash flows as well as the estimated fair value of long-lived assets involves significant estimates on the part of management. If there is a material change in economic conditions or other circumstances influencing the estimate of future cash flows or fair value, Schlumberger could be required to recognize impairment charges in the future. Income Taxes Schlumberger conducts business in more than 100 tax jurisdictions, a number of which have tax laws that are not fully defined and are evolving. Schlumberger’s tax filings are subject to regular audits by the tax authorities. These audits may result in assessments for additional taxes that are resolved with the authorities or, potentially, through the courts. Schlumberger recognizes the impact of a tax position in its financial statements if that position is more likely than not of being sustained on audit, based on the technical merits of the position. Tax liabilities are recorded based on estimates of additional taxes that will be due upon the conclusion of these audits. Estimates of these tax liabilities are judgmental and are made based upon prior experience, and are updated in light of changes in facts and circumstances. However, due to the uncertain and complex application of tax regulations, the ultimate resolution of audits may result in liabilities that could be materially different from these estimates. In such an event, Schlumberger will record additional tax expense or tax benefit in the period in which such resolution occurs. Revenue Recognition for Certain Long-term Construction-type Contracts Schlumberger recognizes revenue for certain long-term construction-type contracts over time. These contracts involve significant design and engineering efforts in order to satisfy custom designs for customer-specific applications. Under this method, revenue is recognized as work progresses on each contract. Progress is measured by the ratio of actual costs incurred to date on the project in relation to total estimated project costs. Approximately 6% of Schlumberger’s revenue in 2021, and 5% in each of 2020 and 2019, respectively, was recognized under this method. The estimate of total project costs has a significant impact on both the amount of revenue recognized as well as the related profit on a project. Revenue and profits on contracts can also be significantly affected by change orders and claims. Profits are recognized based on the estimated project profit multiplied by the percentage complete. Due to the nature of these projects, adjustments to estimates of contract revenue and total contract costs are often required as work progresses. Any expected losses on a project are recorded in full in the period in which they become probable. Pension and Postretirement Benefits Schlumberger’s pension and postretirement benefit obligations are described in detail in Note 16 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. The obligations and related costs are calculated using actuarial concepts, which include critical assumptions related to the discount rate, expected rate of return on plan assets and medical cost trend rates. These assumptions are important elements of expense and/or liability measurement and are updated on an annual basis, or upon the occurrence of significant events. The discount rate that Schlumberger uses reflects the prevailing market rate of a portfolio of high-quality debt instruments with maturities matching the expected timing of payment of the related benefit obligations. The following summarizes the discount rates utilized by Schlumberger for its various pension and postretirement benefit plans: • The discount rate utilized to determine the liability for Schlumberger’s United States pension plans and postretirement medical plan was 3.00% at December 31, 2021 and 2.60% at December 31, 2020. • The weighted-average discount rate utilized to determine the liability for Schlumberger’s international pension plans was 2.83% at December 31, 2021 and 2.38% at December 31, 2020. • The discount rate utilized to determine expense for Schlumberger’s United States pension plans and postretirement medical plan was 2.60% in 2021 and 3.30% in 2020. • The weighted-average discount rate utilized to determine expense for Schlumberger’s international pension plans was 2.38% in 2021 and 3.27% in 2020. The expected rate of return for Schlumberger’s retirement benefit plans represents the average rate of return expected to be earned on plan assets over the period that benefits included in the benefit obligation are expected to be paid, with consideration given to the distribution of investments by asset class and historical rates of return for each individual asset class. The average expected rate of return on plan assets for the United States pension plans was 6.60% in both 2021 and 2020. The weighted average expected rate of return on plan assets for the international pension plans was 6.73% in 2021 and 6.71% in 2020. A lower expected rate of return would increase pension expense. 27 The following illustrates the sensitivity to changes in certain assumptions, holding all other assumptions constant, for Schlumberger’s United States and international pension plans: (Stated in millions) Effect on Effect on 2021 Dec. 31, 2021 Change in Assumption Pretax Expense Obligation 25 basis point decrease in discount rate +$41 +$604 25 basis point increase in discount rate -$38 -$568 25 basis point decrease in expected return on plan assets +$34 - 25 basis point increase in expected return on plan assets -$34 - The following illustrates the sensitivity to changes in certain assumptions, holding all other assumptions constant, for Schlumberger’s United States postretirement medical plans: (Stated in millions) Effect on Effect on 2021 Dec. 31, 2021 Change in Assumption Pretax Expense Obligation 25 basis point decrease in discount rate - +$42 25 basis point increase in discount rate - -$39 28 Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk. Schlumberger is subject to market risks primarily associated with changes in foreign currency exchange rates. As a multinational company, Schlumberger generates revenue in more than 120 countries. Schlumberger’s functional currency is primarily the US dollar. Approximately 70% of Schlumberger’s revenue in 2021 was denominated in US dollars. However, outside the United States, a significant portion of Schlumberger’s expenses is incurred in foreign currencies. Therefore, when the US dollar weakens in relation to the foreign currencies of the countries in which Schlumberger conducts business, the US dollar-reported expenses will increase. Schlumberger maintains a foreign-currency risk management strategy that uses derivative instruments to manage the impact of changes in foreign exchange rates on its earnings. Schlumberger enters into foreign currency forward contracts to provide a hedge against currency fluctuations on certain monetary assets and liabilities, and certain expenses denominated in currencies other than the functional currency. A 10% appreciation in the US dollar from the December 31, 2021 market rates would increase the unrealized value of Schlumberger’s forward contracts by $5 million. Conversely, a 10% depreciation in the US dollar from the December 31, 2021 market rates would decrease the unrealized value of Schlumberger’s forward contracts by $8 million. In either scenario, the gain or loss on the forward contract would be offset by the gain or loss on the underlying transaction, and therefore, would have no impact on future earnings. At December 31, 2021, contracts were outstanding for the US dollar equivalent of $7.7 billion in various foreign currencies, of which $6.0 billion related to hedges of debt balances denominated in currencies other than the functional currency. Forward-Looking Statements This Form 10-K, as well as other statements we make, contains “forward-looking statements” within the meaning of the federal securities laws, which include any statements that are not historical facts.

87347,SLB,SCHLUMBERGER LIMITED/NV,2023,"Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, and the Consolidated Financial Statements and related notes included in this Form 10-K. We urge you to consider carefully the risks described below, which discuss the material factors that make an investment in our securities speculative or risky, as well as in other reports and materials that we file with the SEC and the other information included or incorporated by reference in this Form 10-K, any of which could materially adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. Additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial may also materially adversely affect our business, reputation, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows and prospects. Business and Operational Risks Demand for our products and services is substantially dependent on the levels of expenditures by our customers. Recent oil and gas industry downturns have resulted in reduced demand for oilfield products and services and lower expenditures by our customers, which has in the past had, and may in the future have, a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. Demand for our products and services depends substantially on expenditures by our customers for the exploration, development and production of oil and gas reserves. These expenditures are generally dependent on our customers’ views of future demand for oil and gas and future oil and gas prices, as well as our customers’ ability to access capital. In addition, the transition of the global energy sector from primarily a fossil fuel-based system to renewable energy sources could affect our customers’ levels of expenditures. Actual and anticipated declines in oil and gas prices have in the past resulted in, and may in the future result in, lower capital expenditures, project modifications, delays or cancellations, general business disruptions, and delays in payment of, or nonpayment of, amounts that are owed to us. These effects have had, and may in the future have, a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. Historically, oil and gas prices have experienced significant volatility and can be affected by a variety of factors, including: • changes in the supply of and demand for hydrocarbons, which are affected by general economic and business conditions; • the costs of exploring for, producing, and delivering oil and gas; • the ability or willingness of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries and the expanded alliance known as OPEC+ to set and maintain production levels for oil; • the level of oil and gas exploration and production activity; • the level of excess production capacity; • the level of refining capacity; • the level of oil and gas inventories; • access to potential resources; • political and economic uncertainty and geopolitical unrest; • governmental laws, policies, regulations, subsidies, and other actions, including initiatives to promote the use of renewable energy sources; • speculation as to the future price of oil and the speculative trading of oil and gas futures contracts; • technological advances affecting energy consumption; and • extreme weather conditions, natural disasters, and public health or similar issues, such as pandemics and epidemics. 10 The oil and gas industry has historically experienced periodic downturns, which have been characterized by diminished demand for our products and services and downward pressure on the prices that we are able to charge. Sustained market uncertainty can also result in lower demand and pricing for our products and services. A significant industry downturn, sustained market uncertainty, or increased availability of economical alternative energy sources could result in a reduction in demand for our products and services, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows and prospects. Disruptions in the political, regulatory, economic, and social environments of the countries in which we operate could adversely affect our reputation, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. We are a global technology company, and our non-US operations accounted for approximately 84% of our consolidated revenue in 2022, 85% in 2021 and 81% in 2020. Instability and unforeseen changes in any of the markets in which we operate could result in business disruptions or operational challenges that may adversely affect the demand for our products and services, or our reputation, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. These factors include, but are not limited to, the following: • uncertain or volatile political, social, and economic conditions; • exposure to expropriation, nationalization, deprivation or confiscation of our assets or the assets of our customers, or other governmental actions; • social unrest, acts of terrorism, war, or other armed conflict; • public health crises and other catastrophic events, such as the COVID-19 pandemic; • confiscatory taxation or other adverse tax policies; • theft of, or lack of sufficient legal protection for, proprietary technology and other intellectual property; • deprivation of contract rights; • trade and economic sanctions or other restrictions imposed by the European Union, the United States, the United Kingdom, China, or other regions or countries that could restrict or curtail our ability to operate in certain markets; • unexpected changes in legal and regulatory requirements, including changes in interpretation or enforcement of existing laws; • restrictions on the repatriation of income or capital; • currency exchange controls; • inflation; and • currency exchange, rate fluctuations and devaluations. As an example of a risk resulting from our global operations, in March 2022 we decided to immediately suspend new investment and technology deployment to our Russia operations. Russia represented approximately 6% of our worldwide revenue during 2022. The carrying value of our net assets in Russia was approximately $0.7 billion as of December 31, 2022. This consisted of $0.3 billion of receivables, $0.3 billion of fixed assets, $0.5 billion of current assets, and $0.4 billion of current liabilities. We continue to actively monitor the dynamic situation in Ukraine and applicable laws, sanctions and trade control restrictions resulting from the conflict. The extent to which our operations and financial results may be affected by the ongoing conflict in Ukraine will depend on various factors, including the extent and duration of the conflict; the effects of the conflict on regional and global economic and geopolitical conditions; the effect of further laws, sanctions and trade control restrictions on our business, the global economy and global supply chains; and the impact of fluctuations in the exchange rate of the ruble. Continuation or escalation of the conflict may also aggravate this and other risk factors identified in this Form 10-K, including cybersecurity, regulatory, and reputational risks. Failure to effectively and timely address the energy transition could adversely affect our business, results of operations and cash flows. Our long-term success depends on our ability to effectively address the energy transition, which will require adapting our technology portfolio to changing customer preferences and government requirements, developing solutions to decarbonize oil and gas operations, and scaling innovative low-carbon and carbon-neutral technologies. If the energy transition landscape changes faster than anticipated or in a manner that we do not anticipate, demand for our products and services could be adversely affected. Furthermore, if we fail or are perceived to not effectively implement an energy transition strategy, or if investors or financial institutions shift funding away from companies in fossil fuel-related industries, our access to capital or the market for our securities could be negatively impacted. Our operations are subject to cyber incidents that could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations. Our success depends in part on our ability to provide effective data security protection in connection with our digital technologies and services. We rely on information technology networks and systems for internal purposes, including secure data storage, processing, and transmission, as well as in our interactions with our business associates, such as customers and suppliers. We also develop software and other digital products and services that store, retrieve, manipulate, and manage our customers’ information and data, external data, personal data, and our own data. Our digital technologies and services, and those of our business associates, are subject to the risk of cyberattacks and, given the nature of such attacks, some incidents can remain undetected for a period of time despite efforts to detect and respond to them in a timely manner. There can be no assurance that the systems we have designed to prevent or limit the effects of cyber incidents or attacks will be sufficient to prevent or detect material consequences arising from such incidents or attacks, or to avoid a material adverse impact on our systems after such incidents or attacks do occur. We have experienced and will continue to experience varying degrees of cyber incidents in the normal conduct of our business, including attacks resulting from phishing emails and ransomware infections. Even if we successfully defend our own digital technologies and services, we 11 also rely on third-party business associates, with whom we may share data and services, to defend their digital technologies and services against attack. Unauthorized access to or modification of, or actions disabling our ability to obtain authorized access to, our customers’ data, other external data, personal data, or our own data, as a result of a cyber incident, attack or exploitation of a security vulnerability, could result in significant damage to our reputation or disruption of the services we provide to our customers. In addition, allegations, reports, or concerns regarding vulnerabilities affecting our digital products or services could damage our reputation. This could lead to fewer customers using our digital products and services, which could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition, results of operations or prospects. In addition, if our systems, or our third-party business associates’ systems, for protecting against cybersecurity risks prove to be insufficient, we could be adversely affected by, among other things, loss of or damage to intellectual property, proprietary or confidential information, or customer, supplier, or employee data; breach of personal data; interruption of our business operations; increased legal and regulatory exposure, including fines and remediation costs; and increased costs required to prevent, respond to, or mitigate cybersecurity attacks. These risks could harm our reputation and our relationships with our employees, business associates and other third parties, and may result in claims against us. We operate in a highly competitive environment. If we are unable to maintain technology leadership, this could adversely affect any competitive advantage we hold. The energy industry is highly competitive and rapidly evolving. Our business may be adversely affected if we fail to continue developing and producing innovative technologies in response to changes in the market, including customer and government requirements, or if we fail to deliver such technologies to our customers in a timely and cost-competitive manner. If we are unable to maintain technology leadership in our industry, our ability to maintain market share, defend, maintain, or increase prices for our products and services, and negotiate acceptable contract terms with our customers could be adversely affected. Furthermore, competing or new technologies may accelerate the obsolescence of our products or services and reduce the value of our intellectual property. Limitations on our ability to obtain, maintain, protect, or enforce our intellectual property rights, including our trade secrets, could cause a loss in revenue and any competitive advantage we hold. There can be no assurance that the steps we take to obtain, maintain, protect, and enforce our intellectual property rights will be adequate. Some of our products or services, and the processes we use to produce or provide them, have been granted patent protection, have patent applications pending, or are trade secrets. Our business may be adversely affected when our patents are unenforceable, the claims allowed under our patents are not sufficient to protect our technology, our patent applications are denied, or our trade secrets are not adequately protected. Patent protection on some types of technology, such as software or machine learning processes, may not be available in certain countries in which we operate. Our competitors may also be able to develop technology independently that is similar to ours without infringing on our patents or gaining access to our trade secrets. Third parties may claim that we have infringed upon or otherwise violated their intellectual property rights. The tools, techniques, methodologies, programs, and components we use to provide our services and products may infringe upon or otherwise violate the intellectual property rights of others or be challenged on that basis. Regardless of the merits, any such claims generally result in significant legal and other costs, including reputational harm, and may distract management from running our business. Resolving such claims could increase our costs, including through royalty payments to acquire licenses, if available, from third parties and through the development of replacement technologies. If a license to resolve a claim were not available, we might not be able to continue providing a particular service or product. Legal and Regulatory Risks Our operations require us to comply with numerous laws and regulations, violations of which could have a material adverse effect on our reputation, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. Our operations are subject to international, regional, national, and local laws and regulations in every place where we operate, relating to matters such as environmental protection, health and safety, labor and employment, human rights, import/export controls, currency exchange, bribery and corruption, data privacy and cybersecurity, intellectual property, immigration, and taxation. These laws and regulations are complex, frequently change, and have tended to become more stringent over time. In the event the scope of these laws and regulations expands in the future, the incremental cost of compliance could adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows. Our operations are subject to anti-corruption and anti-bribery laws and regulations, such as the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, the UK Bribery Act, and other similar laws. We are also subject to trade control regulations and trade sanctions laws that restrict the movement of certain goods and services to, and certain operations in, various countries or with certain persons. Our ability to transfer people, products and data among certain countries is subject to maintaining required licenses and complying with these laws and regulations. The internal controls, policies and procedures, and employee training and compliance programs we have implemented to deter prohibited practices may not be effective in preventing employees, contractors, or agents from violating or circumventing such internal policies or from material violations of applicable laws and regulations. Any determination that we have violated or are responsible for violations of applicable laws, including anti-bribery, trade control, trade sanctions or anti-corruption laws, could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition. Violations of international and US laws and regulations or the loss of any required licenses may result in fines and penalties, criminal sanctions, administrative remedies, or restrictions on business conduct, and could have a material 12 adverse effect on our business, operations, and financial condition. In addition, any major violations could have a significant effect on our reputation and consequently on our ability to win future business and maintain existing customer and supplier relationships. Existing or future laws, regulations, court orders or other public- or private-sector initiatives to limit greenhouse gas emissions or relating to climate change may reduce demand for our products and services. Continuing political and social attention to the issue of climate change has resulted in both existing and proposed international agreements and national, regional, and local legislation and regulatory measures to limit GHG emissions. The implementation of these agreements, including the Paris Agreement, the Europe Climate Law, and other existing or future regulatory mandates, may adversely affect the demand for our products and services, impose taxes on us or our customers, require us or our customers to reduce GHG emissions from our technologies or operations, or accelerate the obsolescence of our products or services. In addition, increasing attention to the risks of climate change has resulted in an increased possibility of litigation or investigations brought by public and private entities against oil and gas companies in connection with their GHG emissions. As a result, we or our customers may become subject to court orders compelling a reduction of GHG emissions or requiring mitigation of the effects of climate change. There is also increased focus by our customers, investors and other stakeholders on climate change, sustainability, and energy transition matters. Actions to address these concerns or negative perceptions of our industry or fossil fuel products and their relationship to the environment have led to initiatives to conserve energy and promote the use of alternative energy sources, which may reduce the demand for and production of oil and gas in areas of the world where our customers operate, and thus reduce future demand for our products and services. In addition, initiatives by investors and financial institutions to limit funding to companies in fossil fuel-related industries may adversely affect our liquidity or access to capital. Any of these initiatives may, in turn, adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. Environmental compliance costs and liabilities arising as a result of environmental laws and regulations could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. We are subject to numerous laws and regulations relating to environmental protection, including those governing air and GHG emissions, water discharges and waste management, as well as the importation and use of hazardous materials, radioactive materials, chemicals, and explosives. The technical requirements of these laws and regulations are becoming increasingly complex, stringent, and expensive to implement. These laws sometimes provide for “strict liability” for remediation costs, damages to natural resources or threats to public health and safety. Strict liability can render us liable for damages without regard to our degree of care or fault. Some environmental laws provide for joint and several strict liability for remediation of spills and releases of hazardous substances, and, as a result, we could be liable for the actions of others. We use and generate hazardous substances and wastes in our operations. In addition, many of our current and former properties are, or have been, used for industrial purposes. Accordingly, we could become subject to material liabilities relating to the investigation and cleanup of potentially contaminated properties, and to claims alleging personal injury or property damage as a result of exposures to, or releases of, hazardous substances. In addition, stricter enforcement or changing interpretations of existing laws and regulations, the enactment of new laws and regulations, the discovery of previously unknown contamination or the imposition of new or increased requirements could require us to incur costs or become the basis for new or increased liabilities that could have a material adverse effect on our business, operations, and financial condition. We could be subject to substantial liability claims, including as a result of well incidents, which could adversely affect our reputation, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. The technical complexities of our operations expose us to a wide range of significant health, safety, and environmental risks. Our operations involve production-related activities, radioactive materials, chemicals, explosives and other equipment and services that are deployed in challenging exploration, development, and production environments. Accidents or acts of malfeasance involving these services or equipment, or a failure of a product (including as a result of a cyberattack), could cause personal injury, loss of life, damage to or destruction of property, equipment or the environment, or suspension of operations, which could materially adversely affect us. Any well incidents, including blowouts at a well site or any loss of containment or well control, may expose us to additional liabilities, which could be material. Generally, we rely on contractual indemnities, releases, and limitations on liability with our customers and insurance to protect us from potential liability related to such events. However, our insurance may not protect us against liability for certain kinds of events, including events involving pollution, or against losses resulting from business interruption. Moreover, we may not be able to maintain insurance at levels of risk coverage or policy limits that we deem adequate. Any damages caused by our services or products that are not covered by insurance or are in excess of policy limits or subject to substantial deductibles, could adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. General Risk Factors The COVID-19 pandemic and resulting adverse economic conditions have had, and may continue to have, a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. The COVID-19 pandemic caused, and any resurgence of the pandemic could again cause, a significant reduction in global economic activity, significantly weakening demand for oil and gas, and in turn, for our products and services. Other effects of the pandemic included, and may continue to include, significant volatility and disruption of the global financial markets; adverse revenue and net 13 income effects; disruptions to our operations, including suspension or deferral of drilling activities; customer shutdowns of oil and gas exploration and production; downward revisions to customer budgets; limitations on access to sources of liquidity; supply chain disruptions; limitations on access to raw materials; employee impacts from illness; and local and regional closures or lockdowns, including temporary closures of our facilities and the facilities of our customers and suppliers. The extent to which our operating and financial results will continue to be affected by the pandemic will depend on various factors beyond our control, such as the continued severity of the pandemic, including any sustained geographic resurgence; the emergence of new variants and strains of the COVID-19 virus; and the success of actions to contain or treat the virus. COVID-19, and volatile regional and global economic conditions stemming from the pandemic, could also aggravate our other risk factors described in this Form 10-K. Our aspirations, goals, and initiatives related to sustainability and emissions reduction, and our public statements and disclosures regarding them, expose us to numerous risks. We have developed, and will continue to develop and set, goals, targets, and other objectives related to sustainability matters, including our net-zero target and our energy transition strategy. Statements related to these goals, targets and objectives reflect our current plans and aspirations and do not constitute a guarantee that they will be achieved. Our efforts to research, establish, accomplish, and accurately report on these goals, targets, and objectives expose us to numerous operational, reputational, financial, legal, and other risks. Our ability to achieve any stated goal, target, or objective, including with respect to emissions reduction, is subject to numerous factors and conditions, some of which are outside of our control. Our targets are based on empirical data and estimates that reflect the current best practices for measuring or estimating emissions, but we anticipate that future innovations in both measurement technologies and estimation methodologies could cause us to revise our baseline as well as re-calculate progress toward our targets. Our business faces increased scrutiny from certain investors and other stakeholders related to our sustainability activities, including the goals, targets, and objectives that we announce, and our methodologies and timelines for pursuing them. If our sustainability practices do not meet investor or other stakeholder expectations and standards, which continue to evolve, our reputation, our ability to attract or retain employees, and our attractiveness as an investment or business partner could be negatively affected. Similarly, our failure or perceived failure to pursue or fulfill our sustainability-focused goals, targets, and objectives, to comply with ethical, environmental, or other standards, regulations, or expectations, or to satisfy various reporting standards with respect to these matters, within the timelines we announce, or at all, could adversely affect our business or reputation, as well as expose us to government enforcement actions and private litigation. Failure to attract and retain qualified personnel could impede our operations. Our future success depends on our ability to recruit, train, and retain qualified personnel. We require highly skilled personnel to operate and provide technical services and support for our business. Competition for the personnel necessary for our businesses intensifies as activity increases, technology evolves and customer demands change. In periods of high utilization, it is often more difficult to find and retain qualified individuals. This could increase our costs or have other material adverse effects on our operations. Severe weather events, including extreme weather conditions associated with climate change, have in the past and may in the future adversely affect our operations and financial results. Our business has been, and in the future will be, affected by severe weather events in areas where we operate, which could materially affect our operations and financial results. Extreme weather conditions such as hurricanes, flooding, landslides, and heat waves have in the past resulted in, and may in the future result in, the evacuation of personnel, stoppage of services and activity disruptions at our facilities, in our supply chain, or at well-sites, or result in disruptions of our customers’ operations. Particularly severe weather events affecting platforms or structures may result in a suspension of activities. In addition, acute or chronic physical impacts of climate change, such as sea level rise, coastal storm surge, inland flooding from intense rainfall, and hurricane-strength winds may damage our facilities. Any such extreme weather events may result in increased operating costs or decreases in revenue. 14 Item 1B. Unresolved Staff Comments. None. Item 2. Properties.

The following discussion and analysis contains forward-looking statements, including, without limitation, statements relating to our plans, strategies, objectives, expectations, intentions and resources. Such forward-looking statements should be read in conjunction with our disclosures under “Item 1A. Risk Factors” of this Form 10-K. This section of the Form 10-K generally discusses 2022 and 2021 items and year-to-year comparisons between 2022 and 2021. Discussions of 2020 items and year-to-year comparison between 2021 and 2020 that are not included in this Form 10-K can be found in “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” in Part II, Item 7 of SLB’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2021. 2022 Executive Overview We delivered strong fourth quarter results and concluded a remarkable year for SLB with great success. Full-year 2022 revenue of $28.1 billion increased 23% year on year. All Divisions and geographical areas experienced double digit revenue growth. 2022 was transformative for SLB as we set new safety, operational, and performance benchmarks for our customers and strengthened our market position both internationally and in North America. We launched our bold new brand identity, reinforcing our leadership position in energy technology, digital, and sustainability, and demonstrated our ability to deliver superior earnings in this early phase of a structural upcycle in energy. In North America, we seized the growth cycle throughout the year, increased our pretax operating margins close to 600 basis points (“bps”), and almost doubled our pretax operating income. We effectively harnessed our refocused portfolio, fit-for-basin technology, and performance differentiation to gain greater market access and improved pricing, particularly in the drilling markets where we significantly outperformed rig count growth. Today, we have built one of the highest-quality oilfield services and equipment businesses in North America through the implementation of our returns-focused strategy. In the international markets, after a first half of the year that was impacted by geopolitical conflict and supply chain bottlenecks, activity began to visibly expand in the second half of the year, resulting in full year revenue growth of 20% and margin expansion of more than 150 bps. We laid the foundation for further growth and margin expansion through pricing improvements and a solid pipeline of incremental contract awards. In the Middle East, SLB is well positioned to be a key beneficiary of this visible market expansion, and we expect record levels of upstream investment by national oil companies to continue in the next few years. During the year, we secured a sizeable share of tender awards in the region, driven by our differentiated performance, fit-for-purpose technology, and best-in-class local content. Similarly, across offshore basins, we continue to consolidate our advantaged position with new contract awards, particularly in Latin America and Africa. Beyond our financial results, we made significant progress in our sustainability initiatives during the year, including launching several new Transition Technologies to support the decarbonization of oil and gas. Our Transition Technologies portfolio revenue grew more than 30% year-on-year, and we project it will cross the $1 billion revenue mark in 2023. Finally, we initiated increased returns to shareholders, demonstrating confidence in our strategy, our financial outperformance, and our commitment to superior returns. We increased our dividend by 40% in April 2022, followed by a further 43% increase in January 2023, and we resumed our share buyback program in the first quarter of 2023. The fourth quarter affirmed a distinctive new phase in the upcycle with the much-anticipated acceleration of activity in the Middle East, as revenue in the region increased by double digits. Offshore activity continued to strengthen, partially offset by seasonality in the Northern Hemisphere. In North America, the US land rig count remains at robust levels, although the pace of growth is moderating. Additionally, pricing continues to trend favorably, extending beyond North America and into the international regions, supported by new technology and very tight equipment and service capacity in certain markets. These activity dynamics, improved pricing, and our commercial success—particularly in the Middle East, offshore, and North American markets—combine to set a very strong foundation for outperformance in 2023. We strengthened our balance by reducing our net debt by $1.7 billion to $9.3 billion, its lowest level since the second quarter of 2016, and repaid approximately $1.7 billion of gross debt during the year. Looking ahead, we believe the macro backdrop and market fundamentals that underpin a strong multi-year upcycle for energy remain very compelling in both oil and gas and in low-carbon energy resources. First, oil and gas demand is forecasted by the International Energy Agency (“IEA”) to grow by 1.7 million barrels per day in 2023 despite concerns for a potential economic slowdown in certain regions. In parallel, markets remain very tightly supplied. Second, energy security is prompting a sense of urgency to make further investments to ensure capacity expansion and diversity of supply. And third, the secular trends of digital and decarbonization are set to accelerate with significant digital technology advancements, favorable government policy support, and increased spending on low-carbon initiatives and resources. Based on these factors, global upstream spending projections continue to trend positively. Activity growth is expected to be broad-based, marked by an acceleration in international basins. These positive activity dynamics will be amplified by higher service pricing 17 and tighter service sector capacity. The impact of loosening COVID-19 restrictions and an earlier than expected reopening of China could support further upside potential over 2023. Overall, the combination of these effects will result in a very favorable mix for SLB with significant growth opportunities in our Core, Digital, and New Energy and we expect another year of very strong growth and margin expansion.

(4) Charges & credits are described in detail in Note 3 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Fourth-quarter revenue of $7.9 billion increased 5% sequentially. Revenue grew across all Divisions and geographical areas, with robust year-end sales in digital and particularly strong service activity offshore and in the Middle East where a significant inflection was witnessed as capacity expansion projects mobilized. International revenue of $6.2 billion grew 5% sequentially, driven by continued strengthening activity. This revenue increase was led by the Middle East & Asia and Latin America, both of which grew 7%. In North America, revenue of $1.6 billion increased 6% sequentially driven by strong year-end exploration data licensing sales in the US Gulf of Mexico boosting North America offshore revenue. US land revenue increased 4% sequentially due to drilling revenue growth, which outperformed the rig count growth. Fourth-quarter pretax segment operating margin of 19.8% was the highest since 2015. Digital & Integration Digital & Integration fourth-quarter revenue of $1.0 billion increased 12% sequentially, propelled by the year-end exploration data licensing sales in the US Gulf of Mexico and Africa; increased Asset Performance Solutions (“APS”) project activity in Ecuador and higher digital sales internationally. Digital & Integration pretax operating margin of 38% expanded 386 bps sequentially, due to improved profitability in exploration data licensing and digital solutions. Reservoir Performance Reservoir Performance revenue of $1.6 billion increased 7% sequentially from new projects and activity gains internationally, particularly in the Middle East and Africa. Reservoir Performance pretax operating margin of 18% expanded 146 bps sequentially. Profitability was boosted by higher offshore and exploration activity, mainly in Africa, and strong development activity, particularly in US land and Middle East & Asia. Well Construction Well Construction revenue of $3.2 billion increased 5% sequentially, outperforming global rig count growth due to strong activity from new projects and solid pricing improvements internationally, particularly in the Middle East & Asia and Latin America. 18 Well Construction pretax operating margin of 21% contracted 50 bps sequentially, as improved profitability from increasing activity in the Middle East & Asia, North America, and Latin America was more than offset by the onset of seasonal effects in the Northern Hemisphere. Production Systems Production Systems revenue of $2.2 billion increased 3% sequentially primarily due to higher international sales of artificial lift, completions, and midstream productions systems. Production Systems pretax operating margin of 11% expanded 32 bps sequentially primarily due to an improved revenue mix.

Full-year 2022 revenue of $28.1 billion increased 23% year-on-year driven by activity increases internationally, in North America and across all Divisions. International revenue increased 20% to $21.9 billion led by Latin America and Europe/CIS/Africa with revenue growth of 27% and 25%, respectively, while revenue in the Middle East & Asia increased 12%. In North America, revenue increased 34% to $6.0 billion primarily driven by robust onshore drilling activity; higher sales of production systems; a strong contribution from the APS project in Canada; and increased exploration data licensing in the US Gulf of Mexico. Full-year pretax operating margin of 18% increased 316 bps due to improved operating leverage from higher activity, a favorable activity mix, and an improving pricing environment. Digital & Integration Digital & Integration full-year revenue of $3.7 billion increased 13% year on year, primarily driven by increased APS project activity in Ecuador and Canada and higher exploration data licensing sales in the US Gulf of Mexico. Digital & Integration pretax operating margin of 36% expanded 177 bps year on year largely due to improved profitability in exploration data licensing. Reservoir Performance Reservoir Performance full-year revenue of $5.6 billion increased 21% year on year as a result of strong international activity led by the Middle East & Asia and Latin America on higher activity and improved pricing. 19 Reservoir Performance pretax operating margin of 16% increased 177 bps year on year primarily due to improved profitability in intervention activity. Well Construction Well Construction full-year revenue of $11.4 billion grew 31% year on year with strong growth across all geographical areas led by North America and Latin America, which grew 56% and 53%, respectively. This growth was driven by higher land and offshore activity along with improved pricing. Well Construction pretax operating margin of 19% expanded 560 bps year on year driven by the higher activity and improved pricing. Production Systems Production Systems full-year revenue of $7.9 billion increased 17% year on year driven by new projects and increased sales activity primarily in Europe, Africa, and North America. Double digit growth was posted in midstream, artificial lift, surface production systems and subsea production systems. Production Systems pretax operating margin of 10% was essentially flat primarily as a result of higher logistics costs and a less favorable revenue mix. Interest & Other Income, Net Interest & other income, net consisted of the following: (Stated in millions) 2022 2021 Gain on sale of Liberty shares $ 325 $ 28 Loss on Blue Chip Swap transactions (139 ) - Gain on ADC equity investment 107 - Earnings of equity method investments 164 40 Interest income 99 33 Gain on sale of real estate 43 - Gain on repurchase of bonds 11 - Unrealized gain on marketable securities - 47 $ 610 $ 148 During 2022, SLB sold 47.8 million of its shares of Liberty and recognized a gain of $325 million. During 2021, SLB sold 9.5 million of its shares of Liberty and recognized a gain of $28 million. SLB’s functional currency in Argentina is the US dollar and it uses Argentina’s official exchange rate to remeasure its Argentine peso-denominated net assets into US dollars. The Central Bank of Argentina maintains certain currency controls that limit SLB’s ability to access US dollars in Argentina and remit cash from its Argentine operations. A legal indirect foreign exchange mechanism exists-in the form of capital market transactions known as Blue Chip Swaps, which effectively results in a parallel US dollar exchange rate. This parallel rate, which cannot be used as the basis to remeasure SLB’s net monetary assets in US dollars under US GAAP, was approximately 93% higher than Argentina’s official exchange rate at December 31, 2022. During the fourth quarter of 2022, SLB entered into Blue Chip Swap transactions that resulted in a loss of $139 million. SLB’s peso-denominated net assets in Argentina were approximately $40 million at December 31, 2022 (as compared to approximately $270 million at September 30, 2022), primarily consisting of cash. If Argentina’s official exchange rate converges with the parallel rate, SLB would incur a loss on its peso-denominated net assets in Argentina. Additionally, SLB may enter into further Blue Chip Swap transactions in the future. Argentina represented less than 5% of SLB’s consolidated revenue in 2022. SLB has an investment in the Arabian Drilling Company (“ADC”), an onshore and offshore gas and oil rig drilling company in Saudi Arabia, that it accounts for under the equity method. During the fourth quarter of 2022, ADC completed an initial public offering (“IPO”). In connection with the IPO, SLB sold a portion of its interest in a secondary offering that resulted in SLB receiving net proceeds of $223 million. As a result of these transactions, SLB’s ownership interest in ADC decreased from 49% to approximately 34%. SLB recognized a gain of $107 million, representing the gain on the sale of a portion of its interest as well as the effect of the ownership dilution of its equity investment due to the IPO. The increase in earnings of equity method investments in 2022 as compared to 2021 is primarily due to SLB’s investment in Liberty, as Liberty experienced net losses in 2021 as compared to net income in 2022, as well as higher earnings from SLB’s investment in ADC. The increase in interest income was primarily driven by the effect of higher cash and short-term investment balances and interest rates in Argentina. This increase was more than offset by approximately $100 million of foreign exchange losses recorded during 2022 ($13 20 million during 2021) relating to the remeasurement of Argentine peso-denominated net monetary assets as the official Argentine peso exchange rate devalued compared to the US dollar throughout 2022. During 2022, SLB sold certain real estate and recognized a gain of $43 million. During the fourth quarter of 2022, SLB repurchased $395 million of its 3.75% Senior Notes due 2024 and $409 million of its 4.00% Senior Notes due 2025 for $790 million, resulting in a gain of $11 million after considering the write-off of the related deferred financing fees and other costs. During 2021, a start-up company that SLB previously invested in was acquired. As a result of this transaction, SLB’s ownership interest was converted into shares of a publicly traded company. SLB recognized an unrealized pretax gain of $47 million to increase the carrying value of this investment to its estimated fair value of approximately $55 million. Interest Expense Interest expense of $490 million in 2022 decreased $49 million compared to 2021 primarily as a result of the repayment of $1.7 billion and $2.1 billion of debt during 2022 and 2021, respectively. Other Research & engineering and General & administrative expenses, as a percentage of Revenue, were as follows: 2022 2021 Research & engineering 2.3 % 2.4 % General & administrative 1.3 % 1.5 % Income Taxes The SLB effective tax rate is sensitive to the geographic mix of earnings. When the percentage of pretax earnings generated outside of North America increases, the SLB effective tax rate generally decreases. Conversely, when the percentage of pretax earnings generated outside of North America decreases, the SLB effective tax rate generally increases. The effective tax rate was 18% in 2022 as compared to 19% in 2021. The decrease in the effective tax rate was primarily due to the charges and credits described in Note 3 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. These charges and credits reduced the effective tax rate in 2022 by approximately one percentage point. Charges and Credits SLB recorded charges and credits during 2022 and 2021. These charges and credits, which are summarized below, are more fully described in Note 3 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. The following is a summary of the 2022 charges and credits: (Stated in millions) Pretax Tax Benefit Charge (Credit) (Expense) Net First quarter: Gain on sale of Liberty shares $ (26 ) $ (4 ) $ (22 ) Second quarter: Gain on sale of Liberty shares (215 ) (14 ) (201 ) Gain on sale of real estate (43 ) (2 ) (41 ) Fourth quarter: Gain on sale of Liberty shares (84 ) (19 ) (65 ) Loss on Blue Chip Swap transactions 139 - 139 Gain on ADC equity investment (107 ) (3 ) (104 ) Gain on repurchase of bonds (11 ) (2 ) (9 ) $ (347 ) $ (44 ) $ (303 ) 21 The following is a summary of the 2021 charges and credits: (Stated in millions) Pretax Tax Benefit Charge (Credit) (Expense) Net Third quarter: Unrealized gain on marketable securities $ (47 ) $ (11 ) $ (36 ) Fourth quarter: Gain on sale of Liberty shares (28 ) (4 ) (24 ) Early repayment of bonds 10 - 10 $ (65 ) $ (15 ) $ (50 ) Liquidity and Capital Resources Details of the components of liquidity as well as changes in liquidity follow: (Stated in millions) Dec. 31, Dec. 31, Components of Liquidity: 2022 2021 Cash $ 1,655 $ 1,757 Short-term investments 1,239 1,382 Short-term borrowings and current portion of long-term debt (1,632 ) (909 ) Long-term debt (10,594 ) (13,286 ) Net debt (1) $ (9,332 ) $ (11,056 ) Changes in Liquidity: 2022 2021 Net income $ 3,492 $ 1,928 Charges and credits (347 ) (65 ) Depreciation and amortization (2) 2,147 2,120 Stock-based compensation expense 313 324 Deferred taxes (39 ) (31 ) Earnings of equity method investments, less dividends received (96 ) 10 Increase in working capital (1,709 ) (45 ) US Federal tax refund - 477 Other (41 ) (67 ) Cash flow from operations 3,720 4,651 Capital expenditures (1,618 ) (1,141 ) APS investments (587 ) (474 ) Exploration data capitalized (97 ) (39 ) Free cash flow (3) 1,418 2,997 Dividends paid (848 ) (699 ) Proceeds from employee stock purchase plan 141 137 Proceeds from exercise of stock options 81 - Taxes paid on net-settled stock-based compensation awards (93 ) (24 ) Business acquisitions and investments, net of cash acquired plus debt assumed (58 ) (103 ) Proceeds from sale of Liberty shares 732 109 Proceeds from sale of ADC shares 223 - Proceeds from sale of real estate 120 - Purchases of Blue Chip Swap securities (259 ) - Proceeds from sales of Blue Chip Swap securities 111 - Other (105 ) (81 ) Change in net debt before impact of changes in foreign exchange rates on net debt 1,463 2,336 Impact of changes in foreign exchange rates on net debt 261 488 Decrease in Net Debt 1,724 2,824 Net Debt, Beginning of period (11,056 ) (13,880 ) Net Debt, End of period $ (9,332 ) $ (11,056 ) 22 (1) “Net debt” represents gross debt less cash and short-term investments. Management believes that Net debt provides useful information regarding the level of SLB’s indebtedness by reflecting cash and investments that could be used to repay debt. Net debt is a non-GAAP financial measure that should be considered in addition to, not as a substitute for or superior to, total debt. (2) Includes depreciation of property, plant and equipment and amortization of intangible assets, exploration data costs and APS investments. (3) “Free cash flow” represents cash flow from operations less capital expenditures, APS investments and exploration data costs capitalized. Management believes that free cash flow is an important liquidity measure for the company and that it is useful to investors and management as a measure of our ability to generate cash. Once business needs and obligations are met, this cash can be used to reinvest in the company for future growth or to return to shareholders through dividend payments or share repurchases. Free cash flow does not represent the residual cash flow available for discretionary expenditures. Free cash flow is a non-GAAP financial measure that should be considered in addition to, not as a substitute for or superior to, cash flow from operations. Key liquidity events during 2022 and 2021 included: • Cash flow from operations of $3.7 billion in 2022 decreased approximately $1.0 billion as compared to 2021. This decrease was primarily due to working capital consuming $1.7 billion of liquidity in 2022 compared to $45 million in 2021. The increase in working capital was largely the result of receivables increasing $1.7 billion (32%) and inventories increasing $0.7 billion (22%), respectively, from 2021 to 2022, while these balances were relatively flat at the end of 2021 as compared to 2020. The increase in receivables was driven primarily by the fact that SLB’s fourth quarter 2022 revenue increased 27% as compared to the same period last year. The increase in inventories was a result of the significant activity growth that SLB experienced in 2022 that is expected to continue in 2023. These increases in working capital were partially offset by increases in accounts payable and accrued liabilities that were a source of cash of $0.7 billion in 2022 compared to $0.2 billion in 2021. The increase in working capital in 2022 was partially offset by the effects of a $1.3 billion increase in net income, excluding the effects of the previously mentioned charges and credits (which had no impact on cash flow from operations), in 2022 as compared to 2021. In addition, cash flow from operations in 2021 benefited from a federal tax refund of $477 million relating to the carryback of US net operating losses pursuant to the Coronavirus Aid, Relief and Economic Security Act. • In April 2022, SLB announced a 40% increase to its quarterly cash dividend from $0.125 per share of outstanding common stock to $0.175 per share, beginning with the dividend payable in July 2022. Dividends paid during 2022 and 2021 were $0.8 billion and $0.7 billion, respectively. In January 2023, SLB announced a further 43% increase to its quarterly cash dividend from $0.175 per share of outstanding common stock to $0.25 per share, beginning with the dividend payable in April 2023. • On January 21, 2016, the SLB Board of Directors approved a $10 billion share repurchase program for SLB common stock. SLB had repurchased $1.0 billion of SLB common stock under this program as of December 31, 2022. SLB did not repurchase any of its common stock during 2022 and 2021. SLB resumed repurchases under this program in the first quarter of 2023. • Capital investments (consisting of capital expenditures, APS investments and exploration data capitalized) were $2.3 billion in 2022 and $1.7 billion in 2021. Capital investments during 2023 are expected to be approximately $2.5 to $2.6 billion as SLB continues to support the strong revenue growth that is expected to continue in 2023. • During 2022, SLB sold 47.8 million of its shares of Liberty and received proceeds of $732 million. During 2021, SLB sold 9.5 million of its shares of Liberty and received proceeds of $109 million. • During the fourth quarter of 2022, SLB repurchased $395 million of its 3.75% Senior Notes due 2024 and $409 million of its 4.00% Senior Notes due 2025 for $790 million. • During the fourth quarter of 2022, SLB sold a portion of its equity interest in ADC in a secondary offering that resulted in SLB receiving net proceeds of $223 million. • During the second quarter of 2022, SLB sold certain real estate and received proceeds of $120 million. • During the fourth quarter of 2021, SLB deposited sufficient funds with the trustee for its $1.0 billion of 2.40% Senior Notes due 2022 to satisfy and discharge all of its obligations relating to such notes. • During the second quarter of 2021, SLB repurchased all $665 million of its 3.30% Senior Notes due 2021. As of December 31, 2022, SLB had $2.89 billion of cash and short-term investments and committed credit facility agreements with commercial banks aggregating $6.55 billion, all of which was available and unused. SLB believes these amounts, along with cash generated by ongoing operations, will be sufficient to meet future business requirements for the next 12 months and beyond. 23 The following table reflects the carrying amounts of SLB’s debt at December 31, 2022 by year of maturity: (Stated in millions) After 2023 2024 2025 2026 2027 2028 2029 2030 2031 Total Fixed rate debt 3.65% Senior Notes $ 1,499 1,499 4.00% Notes 79 79 0.00% Notes $ 531 531 3.75% Senior Notes 355 355 3.70% Notes 54 54 4.00% Senior Notes $ 522 522 1.40% Senior Notes 499 499 1.375% Guaranteed Notes $ 1,060 1,060 1.00% Guaranteed Notes 636 636 0.25% Notes $ 955 955 3.90% Senior Notes $ 1,464 1,464 4.30% Senior Notes $ 847 847 2.65% Senior Notes $ 1,250 1,250 2.00% Guaranteed Notes $ 1,055 1,055 0.50% Notes 954 954 7.00% Notes 202 202 5.95% Notes 112 112 5.13% Notes 98 98 Total fixed rate debt $ 1,578 $ 940 $ 1,021 $ 1,696 $ 955 $ 1,464 $ 847 $ 1,250 $ 2,421 $ 12,172 Variable rate debt 54 - - - - - - - - 54 Total $ 1,632 $ 940 $ 1,021 $ 1,696 $ 955 $ 1,464 $ 847 $ 1,250 $ 2,421 $ 12,226 Interest payments on fixed rate debt obligations by year are as follows: (Stated in millions) 2023 $ 386 2024 320 2025 301 2026 265 2027 235 Thereafter 706 $ 2,213 See Note 13, Leases of the Consolidated Financial Statements for details regarding SLB’s lease obligations. SLB has outstanding letters of credit/guarantees that relate to business performance bonds, custom/excise tax commitments, facility lease/rental obligations, etc. These were entered into in the ordinary course of business and are customary practices in the various countries where SLB operates. Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates The preparation of financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States requires SLB to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, the disclosure of contingent liabilities and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses. The following accounting policies involve “critical accounting estimates” because they are particularly dependent on estimates and assumptions made by SLB about matters that are inherently uncertain. SLB bases its estimates on historical experience and on various assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. Allowance for Doubtful Accounts SLB maintains an allowance for doubtful accounts in order to record accounts receivable at their net realizable value. Judgment is involved in recording and making adjustments to this reserve. Allowances have been recorded for receivables believed to be uncollectible, including amounts for the resolution of potential credit and other collection issues such as disputed invoices. Adjustments 24 to the allowance may be required in future periods depending on how such potential issues are resolved, or if the financial condition of SLB’s customers were to deteriorate resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments. As a large multinational company with a long history of operating in a cyclical industry, SLB has extensive experience in working with its customers during difficult times to manage its accounts receivable. During weak economic environments or when there is an extended period of weakness in oil and gas prices, SLB typically experiences delays in the payment of its receivables. However, except for a $469 million accounts receivable write-off during 2017 as a result of the political and economic condition in Venezuela, SLB has not historically had material write-offs due to uncollectible accounts receivable. SLB has a global footprint in more than 100 countries. As of December 31, 2022, three of those countries individually accounted for greater than 5% of SLB’s net accounts receivable balance, of which only two (the United States and Mexico) accounted for greater than 10% of such receivables. Included in Receivables, less allowance for doubtful accounts in the Consolidated Balance Sheet as of December 31, 2022 is approximately $1.0 billion of receivables relating to Mexico. SLB’s receivables from its primary customer in Mexico are not in dispute and SLB has not historically had any material write-offs due to uncollectible accounts receivable relating to this customer. Goodwill, Intangible Assets and Long-Lived Assets SLB records the excess of purchase price over the fair value of the tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed as goodwill. The goodwill relating to each of SLB’s reporting units is tested for impairment annually as well as when an event, or change in circumstances, indicates an impairment may have occurred. Under generally accepted accounting principles, SLB has the option to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether the existence of events or circumstances leads to a determination that it is more likely than not that the fair value of one or more of its reporting units is greater than its carrying amount. If, after assessing the totality of events or circumstances, SLB determines it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is greater than its carrying amount, there is no need to perform any further testing. However, if SLB concludes otherwise, then it is required to perform a quantitative impairment test by calculating the fair value of the reporting unit and comparing the fair value with the carrying amount of the reporting unit. If the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying value, an impairment loss is recorded based on that difference. SLB has the option to bypass the qualitative assessment for any reporting unit in any period and proceed directly to performing the quantitative goodwill impairment test. SLB elected to perform the qualitative assessment described above for purposes of its annual goodwill impairment test in 2022. Based on this assessment, SLB concluded it was more likely than not that the fair value of each of its reporting units was significantly greater than its carrying amount. Accordingly, no further testing was required. Long-lived assets, including fixed assets, intangible assets, and investments in APS projects, are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable. In reviewing for impairment, the carrying value of such assets is compared to the estimated undiscounted future cash flows expected from the use of the assets and their eventual disposition. If such cash flows are not sufficient to support the asset’s recorded value, an impairment charge is recognized to reduce the carrying value of the long-lived asset to its estimated fair value. The determination of future cash flows as well as the estimated fair value of long-lived assets involves significant estimates on the part of management. If there is a material change in economic conditions or other circumstances influencing the estimate of future cash flows or fair value, SLB could be required to recognize impairment charges in the future. Income Taxes SLB conducts business in more than 100 tax jurisdictions, a number of which have tax laws that are not fully defined and are evolving. SLB’s tax filings are subject to regular audits by the tax authorities. These audits may result in assessments for additional taxes that are resolved with the authorities or, potentially, through the courts. SLB recognizes the impact of a tax position in its financial statements if that position is more likely than not of being sustained on audit, based on the technical merits of the position. Tax liabilities are recorded based on estimates of additional taxes that will be due upon the conclusion of these audits. Estimates of these tax liabilities are judgmental and are made based upon prior experience, and are updated in light of changes in facts and circumstances. However, due to the uncertain and complex application of tax regulations, the ultimate resolution of audits may result in liabilities that could be materially different from these estimates. In such an event, SLB will record additional tax expense or tax benefit in the period in which such resolution occurs. Revenue Recognition for Certain Long-term Construction-type Contracts SLB recognizes revenue for certain long-term construction-type contracts over time. These contracts involve significant design and engineering efforts in order to satisfy custom designs for customer-specific applications. Under this method, revenue is recognized as work progresses on each contract. Progress is measured by the ratio of actual costs incurred to date on the project in relation to total estimated project costs. Approximately 5% of SLB’s revenue in 2022, 6% in 2021, and 5% in 2020, was recognized under this method. The estimate of total project costs has a significant impact on both the amount of revenue recognized as well as the related profit on a project. Revenue and profits on contracts can also be significantly affected by change orders and claims. Profits are recognized based on the estimated project profit multiplied by the percentage complete. Due to the nature of these projects, adjustments to estimates of contract revenue and total contract costs are often required as work progresses. Any expected losses on a project are recorded in full in the period in which they become probable. 25 Pension and Postretirement Benefits SLB’s pension and postretirement benefit obligations are described in detail in Note 16 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. The obligations and related costs are calculated using actuarial concepts, which include critical assumptions related to the discount rate and the expected rate of return on plan assets. These assumptions are important elements of expense and/or liability measurement and are updated on an annual basis, or upon the occurrence of significant events. The discount rate that SLB uses reflects the prevailing market rate of a portfolio of high-quality debt instruments with maturities matching the expected timing of payment of the related benefit obligations. The following summarizes the discount rates utilized by SLB for its various pension and postretirement benefit plans: • The discount rate utilized to determine the liability for SLB’s United States pension plans and postretirement medical plan was 5.50% at December 31, 2022 and 3.00% at December 31, 2021. • The weighted-average discount rate utilized to determine the liability for SLB’s international pension plans was 5.41% at December 31, 2022 and 2.83% at December 31, 2021. • The discount rate utilized to determine expense for SLB’s United States pension plans and postretirement medical plan was 3.00% in 2022 and 2.60% in 2021. • The weighted-average discount rate utilized to determine expense for SLB’s international pension plans was 2.83% in 2022 and 2.38% in 2021. The expected rate of return for SLB’s retirement benefit plans represents the long-term average rate of return expected to be earned on plan assets based on expectations regarding future rates of return for the portfolio considering the asset allocation and related historical rate of return. The average expected rate of return on plan assets for the United States pension plans was 4.40% in 2022 and 6.60% in 2021. The weighted average expected rate of return on plan assets for the international pension plans was 5.05% in 2022 and 6.73% in 2021. A lower expected rate of return increases pension expense. The following illustrates the sensitivity to changes in certain assumptions, holding all other assumptions constant, for SLB’s United States and international pension plans: (Stated in millions) Effect on Effect on 2022 Dec. 31, 2022 Change in Assumption Pretax Expense Obligation 25 basis point decrease in discount rate +$31 +$334 25 basis point increase in discount rate -$30 -$321 25 basis point decrease in expected return on plan assets +$38 - 25 basis point increase in expected return on plan assets -$38 - The following illustrates the sensitivity to changes in certain assumptions, holding all other assumptions constant, for SLB’s United States postretirement medical plans: (Stated in millions) Effect on Effect on 2022 Dec. 31, 2022 Change in Assumption Pretax Expense Obligation 25 basis point decrease in discount rate -$3 +$23 25 basis point increase in discount rate +$3 -$22 26 Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk. SLB is subject to market risks primarily associated with changes in foreign currency exchange rates. SLB’s functional currency is primarily the US dollar. Approximately 72% of SLB’s revenue in 2022 was denominated in US dollars. However, outside the United States, a significant portion of SLB’s expenses is incurred in foreign currencies. Therefore, when the US dollar weakens in relation to the foreign currencies of the countries in which SLB conducts business, the US dollar-reported expenses will increase. SLB is exposed to risks on future cash flows relating to its fixed rate debt denominated in currencies other than the functional currency. SLB uses cross-currency interest rate swaps to provide a hedge against these cash flow risks and effectively convert the debt to US-dollar denominated fixed rate debt. SLB maintains a foreign-currency risk management strategy that uses derivative instruments to manage the impact of changes in foreign exchange rates on its earnings. SLB enters into foreign currency forward contracts to provide a hedge against currency fluctuations on certain monetary assets and liabilities, and certain expenses denominated in currencies other than the functional currency. A 10% appreciation in the US dollar from the December 31, 2022 market rates would increase the unrealized value of SLB’s forward contracts by $28 million. Conversely, a 10% depreciation in the US dollar from the December 31, 2022 market rates would decrease the unrealized value of SLB’s forward contracts by $36 million. In either scenario, the gain or loss on the forward contract would be offset by the gain or loss on the underlying transaction, and therefore, would have no impact on future earnings. At December 31, 2022, contracts were outstanding for the US dollar equivalent of $7.2 billion in various foreign currencies, of which $5.1 billion related to hedges of debt balances denominated in currencies other than the functional currency.
