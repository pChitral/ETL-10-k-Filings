1364742,BLK,BlackRock Inc.,2023,"Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations — Non-GAAP Financial Measures. Aladdin, which represented the majority of technology services revenue for the year, continues to benefit from trends favoring global platform consolidation and multi-asset risk solutions across public and private markets. Approximately 25% of Aladdin’s revenue was denominated in non-US currencies. In addition, while Aladdin is a multi-asset system, the majority of positions managed on the platform are fixed income. 2022 technology services revenue growth reflected headwinds associated with the foreign exchange impact on Aladdin’s non-dollar revenue and bond market declines on Aladdin’s fixed income platform assets. BlackRock is focused on enhancing Aladdin, with continued investment into areas such as whole portfolio, private markets, wealth and sustainable investing solutions. BlackRock continues to evolve and enable clients to further simplify their operating infrastructure with Aladdin. Clients increasingly want to tailor how they use Aladdin to meet their specific needs, and BlackRock is providing them with choice and flexibility. BlackRock is creating connectivity with ecosystem providers and third-party technology solutions, which include asset servicers, cloud providers, digital asset platforms, trading systems and others, who can work with clients in their Aladdin environments to provide a more customized and seamless end-to-end experience. BlackRock is also investing to scale Aladdin for its next leg of growth through the substantially complete migration of Aladdin from BlackRock-hosted data centers to the cloud. This is expected to bring enhanced capabilities to BlackRock and its Aladdin clients, accelerating innovation and supporting greater computing scale and flexibility for clients. Through this migration as well as BlackRock’s partnership with Snowflake, an industry leader in cloud enabled data technology, BlackRock is building Aladdin Data Cloud, a next generation solution that brings Aladdin and non-Aladdin data together, so clients can nimbly access and use data across their organization, unlocking their full potential for collaboration, creativity, and innovation. In addition, BlackRock has made minority investments in the financial technology and digital distribution companies Human Interest, Circle, Envestnet, Scalable Capital, iCapital, Acorns and Clarity AI. BlackRock records its share of income related to minority investments accounted for under the equity method in other revenue and records gains and losses related to changes in value of other minority investments in nonoperating income (expense). Securities Lending Securities lending is managed by a dedicated team, supported by quantitative analysis, proprietary technology and disciplined risk management. BlackRock receives both cash (primarily for US domiciled portfolios) and noncash collateral under securities lending arrangements. The cash management team invests the cash received as collateral for securities on loan in other portfolios. Fees for securities lending for US domiciled portfolios can be structured as a share of earnings, or as a management fee based on a percentage of the value of the cash collateral or both. The value of the securities on loan and the revenue earned are captured in the corresponding asset class being managed. The value of the collateral is not included in AUM. Outstanding loan balances ended the year at approximately $355 billion, down from $389 billion at year-end 2021. Lower demand for general collateral securities resulted in lower balances compared to 2021. Intrinsic lending spreads were higher, while cash reinvestment spreads remained lower as cash yields continued to compress slightly. BlackRock employs a conservative investment style for cash and securities lending collateral that emphasizes quality, liquidity, and interest rate risk management. Disciplined risk management, including a rigorous credit surveillance process, is an integral part of the investment process. BlackRock’s Cash Management Credit Committee has established risk limits, such as aggregate issuer exposure limits and maturity limits, across many of the products BlackRock manages, including over all of its cash management products. In the ordinary course of our business, there may be instances when a portfolio may exceed an internal risk limit or when an internal risk limit may be changed. No such instances, individually or in the aggregate, have been material to the Company. To the extent that daily evaluation and reporting of the profile of the portfolios identify that a limit has been exceeded, the relevant portfolio will be adjusted. To the extent a portfolio manager would like to obtain a temporary waiver of a risk limit, the portfolio manager must obtain approval from the credit research team, which is independent from the cash management portfolio managers. While a risk limit may be waived temporarily, such waivers are infrequent. 10 Risk and Quantitative Analysis Across all asset classes, in addition to the efforts of the portfolio management teams, the Risk and Quantitative Analysis (“RQA”) group at BlackRock draws on extensive analytical systems and proprietary and third-party data to identify, measure and manage a wide range of risks. RQA provides risk management advice and independent risk oversight of the investment management processes, identifies and helps manage counterparty and enterprise risks, coordinates standards for firm wide investment performance measurement and determines risk management-related analytical and information requirements. Where appropriate, RQA will work with portfolio managers and developers to facilitate the development or improvement of risk models and analytics. COMPETITION BlackRock competes with investment management firms, mutual fund complexes, insurance companies, banks, brokerage firms, financial technology providers and other financial institutions that offer products that are similar to, or alternatives to, those offered by BlackRock. In order to grow its business, BlackRock must be able to compete effectively for AUM. Key competitive factors include investment performance track records, the efficient delivery of beta for index products, investment style and discipline, price, client service and brand name recognition. Historically, the Company has competed principally on the basis of its long-term investment performance track record, its investment process, its risk management and analytic capabilities and the quality of its client service. HUMAN CAPITAL With approximately 19,800 employees in more than 30 countries, as of December 31, 2022, BlackRock provides a broad range of investment and technology services to institutional and retail clients in more than 100 countries across the globe. As an asset manager, BlackRock’s long-term success depends on its people and how it manages its workforce. Culture and Principles BlackRock believes that maintaining a strong corporate culture is an important component of its human capital management practices and critical to the firm’s long-term success. BlackRock’s culture is underpinned by five core principles that unify its workforce and guide how it interacts with its employees, its clients, the communities in which it operates and its other stakeholders: (1) We are a fiduciary to our clients; (2) We are One BlackRock; (3) We are passionate about performance; (4) We take emotional ownership; and (5) We are committed to a better future. Diversity, Equity and Inclusion (“DEI”) BlackRock believes a diverse workforce and an equitable and inclusive work environment are key factors in achieving better outcomes across all levels of its business. BlackRock has made a long-term commitment to cultivating diversity, equity and inclusion in its workforce and leadership team through its hiring, retention, promotion and development practices. As part of this long-term commitment, BlackRock has instituted a multi-year DEI strategy that it believes is actionable, measurable and designed to apply across the many countries in which the firm operates. The Company has aligned its DEI strategy with the firm’s business priorities and long-term objectives. BlackRock’s DEI strategy centers on talent and culture, responding to the needs of our clients, and policy and social impact in the communities in which we operate. To advance its DEI strategy, BlackRock strives to: •Expand partnerships with external organizations and develop strategies to increase the diversity of applicant pools; •Strengthen talent acquisition and management processes in an effort to eliminate bias; and •Implement leadership development, networking, sponsorship and coaching initiatives to engage and develop underrepresented talent. Another focus of BlackRock’s DEI strategy is to foster an inclusive, equitable work environment in which employees feel connected to BlackRock’s culture and supported in pursuit of their professional goals. To this end, BlackRock has committed to raising employee awareness of racial equity issues and setting high behavioral expectations for employees, as well as to holding firm leaders and managers accountable for continued progress toward the firm’s goals. BlackRock views transparency and accountability as a critical part of its DEI strategy, including as a means to inform, measure and improve its human capital management practices. To that end, since 2020, the firm has published annual SASB-aligned disclosure and EEO-1 reports, and in 2022, the firm published its inaugural Global DEI Annual Report, each of which include information regarding workforce diversity. During 2020, BlackRock also set goals for increasing the overall workplace representation of US Black and Latinx employees and growing the number of senior women globally and US Black and Latinx leaders at the Director level and above. As of January 1, 2023, of the Company’s employees who self-identified their gender status, approximately 44% of the Company's global workforce, 32% of global senior leaders (Directors or above) and 47% of global new hires, were women. Additionally, as of January 1, 2023, of the Company’s US employees who self-identified their race/ethnicity status, approximately 8% of employees, 4% of senior leaders and 12% of new hires identified as Black or African American, 8% of employees, 4% of senior leaders and 10% of new hires identified as Latinx, and 27% of employees, 20% of senior leaders and 33% of new hires identified as Asian. Further, of the Company's approximately 19,800 employees as of December 31, 2022, 47% were based in the Americas, 31% were based in EMEA and 22% were based in Asia-Pacific regions. Board Oversight of Human Capital Management BlackRock’s Board of Directors (the “Board”) plays an important role in the oversight of human capital management and devotes one Board meeting annually to an in-depth review of BlackRock’s culture, talent development, retention and recruiting initiatives, DEI strategy, leadership and succession planning and employee feedback. Moreover, the Board’s Management Development and Compensation Committee (“MDCC”) periodically reviews the progress made toward the firm’s DEI goals and other human capital management objectives. This progress is considered in compensation outcomes, including individual compensation outcomes for executive officers, that are approved by the MDCC. Succession planning for BlackRock’s Chief Executive Officer and other senior executives is a key part of the Board’s annual review of human capital management issues. As part of this review, the Board focuses on whether BlackRock has the right people in place to execute the Company’s long-term strategic plans, and on BlackRock’s ability to identify, attract, develop, promote and retain future senior executives. An important element of the succession planning across the organization is a commitment to building leadership from within and increasing diversity in leadership roles. 11 Employee Engagement BlackRock values continuous dialogue with its employees to better understand their experiences at the firm and assess the efficacy of its human capital management practices. The Company uses several employee engagement mechanisms, including: (1) employee opinion pulse surveys; (2) interactive events and communications; and (3) the sponsorship of employee networks. The employee opinion pulse surveys, which BlackRock conducts multiple times per year, provide the Company with actionable feedback for its teams and for the Company as a whole. Additionally, BlackRock uses ongoing lifecycle surveys to collect feedback on various areas of employee focus. BlackRock works to keep employees informed and engaged through a regular cadence of communications and events, including weekly newsletters, global and local townhalls and messages from leaders with timely business and organizational updates and culture-building opportunities. BlackRock’s employee networks also provide additional forums and opportunities for employees with a diverse range of backgrounds, experiences and perspectives to connect with one another and enhance the firm’s culture. Open to all, the networks are designed by employees, for employees, are sponsored by senior leaders and strengthen the One BlackRock community. Compensation, Wellness and Benefits BlackRock is committed to responsible business practices and believes that investing in the physical, emotional, mental and financial well-being of its employees is a critical component of the firm’s human capital management strategy. To that end, the Company designs its compensation and benefits practices to: (1) attract, retain and motivate talented employees; (2) align employee incentives and risk-taking with that of the firm and the interests of its clients; and (3) support employees across many aspects of their lives. The Company has a strong pay-for-performance culture and an annual compensation process that takes into consideration firmwide results, individual business results and employee performance, as well as market benchmarks. BlackRock also offers a wide range of benefits that it regularly reviews in accordance with leading best practices and the local requirements of its offices, including, where applicable, retirement savings plans, a Flexible Time Off (“FTO”) policy and flexible working arrangements, and parental leave and family support benefits, including fertility benefits, adoption and surrogacy assistance, and backup elder and childcare benefits. The Company provides comprehensive healthcare and mental-health benefits to eligible employees, including medical, dental and vision coverage, health savings and spending accounts, counseling services, an employee assistance program and access to telemedicine services, where available. BlackRock prioritizes protecting the rights of its workforce and the equitable treatment of its employees. The Company has implemented policies related to harassment prevention and compliance with equal employment opportunity and overtime regulations. BlackRock is also committed to providing a safe and healthy work environment for its workforce. To do this, it designs global programs, including environmental and occupational health and safety programs, to meet or exceed local requirements. Moreover, BlackRock encourages all of its employees to raise issues of concern and assures employees that they may do so without fear of retaliation. As the COVID-19 pandemic highlighted the importance of keeping employees safe and healthy, BlackRock continues to communicate about the telemedicine and digital health resources it has available, including mental, emotional and physical health offerings. For example, the Company offers several benefits to support mental health, including a Mental Health Ambassador program that is comprised of global volunteers across office locations who act as allies for firmwide mental health awareness and direct interested colleagues to mental health resources. Training, Innovation and Development BlackRock is committed to innovation, learning and reinvention in all areas of its business and believes that developing the capabilities of its employees is integral to delivering long-term value. To that end, the Company’s human capital management practices are designed to provide opportunities for employees to learn, innovate and enhance their skillsets at every stage of their career. One example is the BlackRock Academies, the firm’s online suite of interactive resources and courses, which enable employees to build skills in specific facets of BlackRock’s business and purpose. The Company believes these opportunities play an important role in engaging BlackRock’s employees. In addition, BlackRock believes that a critical driver of its future success is its ability to grow strong leaders and people managers. The Company invests in leadership development programs designed to foster career growth. For leadership development, select employees are invited to participate in programs that include executive coaching, in-person and virtual learning and senior management sponsorship. Further, BlackRock provides training and makes coaching available to people managers to assist in building foundational skills. REGULATION Virtually all aspects of BlackRock’s business are subject to various laws and regulations around the world, some of which are summarized below. These laws and regulations are primarily intended to protect investment advisory clients, investors in registered and unregistered investment companies, and trust and other fiduciary clients of BlackRock Institutional Trust Company, N.A. (“BTC”). Under these laws and regulations, agencies that regulate investment advisers, investment funds and trust banks and other individuals and entities have broad administrative powers, including the power to limit, restrict or prohibit the regulated entity or person from carrying on business if it fails to comply with such laws and regulations. Possible sanctions for significant compliance failures include the suspension of individual employees, limitations on engaging in certain lines of business for specified periods of time, revocation of investment adviser and other registrations or bank charters, censures and fines both for individuals and BlackRock. The rules governing the regulation of financial institutions and their holding companies and subsidiaries are very detailed and technical. Accordingly, the discussion below is general in nature, does not purport to be complete and is current only as of the date of this report. BlackRock’s business may be impacted by numerous regulatory reform initiatives occurring around the world. Any such initiative, or any new laws or regulations or changes to, or in the enforcement of, existing laws or regulations, could materially and adversely impact the scope or profitability of BlackRock’s business activities, lead to business disruptions, require BlackRock to alter its business or operating activities and expose BlackRock to additional costs (including compliance and legal costs) as well as reputational harm. BlackRock’s profitability also could be materially and adversely affected by modification of the rules and regulations that impact the business and financial communities in general, including changes to the laws governing banking, securities, taxation, antitrust regulation and electronic commerce. GLOBAL REGULATORY REFORM Policymaking workstreams focused on the financial services sector led by global standard setters, such as the Financial Stability Board (“FSB”), International Organization of Securities Commissions (“IOSCO”) and Bank for International Settlements, may lead to or inform new regulations in multiple jurisdictions in which BlackRock operates. Most recently, such workstreams have focused on areas such as products and activities 12 of non-bank financial institutions, money market funds (“MMFs”), open-ended funds (“OEFs”), central counterparty margin practices and enhanced ESG disclosures. Macroprudential Policies for Asset Managers Concerns about liquidity and leverage risks in the asset management industry and wider market-based finance sector have been heightened since the COVID-19 pandemic and reinforced by the recent Liquidity Driven Investment events in the UK. Such events have prompted a broad review of existing regulations globally, including an assessment of the adequacy of certain structural market components in mitigating risks by the FSB, IOSCO, the US Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”) and the Financial Stability Oversight Council (“FSOC”). In November 2022, the SEC proposed, among other things, amendments to the rules governing OEF liquidity risk management and swing pricing. The European Union (“EU”) has also proposed reforms to increase the availability of liquidity management tools to OEFs, enhance reporting on the use of liquidity management tools by OEFs to national regulators and allow such regulators to require OEF managers to activate liquidity management tools in extreme market conditions. If any of these regulatory or policy actions result in broad application of macroprudential tools to OEFs or require BlackRock to make changes to structural features of certain OEFs, it could limit BlackRock’s ability to offer products to certain clients and/or result in clients altering their investment strategies or allocations in a manner that is adverse to BlackRock. Global MMF Reforms Following the market events of March 2020, US, EU and UK authorities initiated a review of existing regulatory frameworks with the aim of improving the resilience of MMFs in market downturns. The ongoing review of the EU Money Market Fund Regulation could result in significant changes to the rules around liquidity and how some MMFs price shares. The UK may materially depart from the EU approach as the UK develops its own legal and regulatory framework for MMFs domiciled or marketed in the UK. In the US, the SEC proposed changes to Rule 2a-7, the primary rule under the Investment Company Act of 1940 governing MMFs, including changes to required liquidity levels and certain operational aspects of such funds, and changes in pricing under certain circumstances. Such regulatory reforms, if adopted, could significantly and adversely impact certain of BlackRock’s MMF products. ESG and Sustainability ESG and sustainability have been the subject of increased regulatory focus across jurisdictions. Globally, the International Sustainability Standards Board and the development of its disclosure standards may inform national regulators’ approaches on these topics. In the US, the SEC has proposed a series of rules that would require, among other things: (1) corporate issuers to make substantial climate-related disclosures in their periodic reports, including with respect to governance, risk management, business strategy, financial statement metrics and greenhouse gas (""GHG"") emissions and (2) enhanced ESG disclosures by investment companies and investment advisers in fund and adviser filings, including disclosures regarding ESG strategies and how ESG factors are considered, and GHG emissions disclosure by certain environmentally focused funds. The SEC also announced plans to propose rules to require enhanced disclosure regarding human capital management and board diversity for public issuers. It has also increased its scrutiny of disclosure and compliance issues relating to investment advisers’ and funds’ ESG strategies, policies and procedures. In addition, the US Department of Labor (the “DOL”) recently issued final rules clarifying that Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended (“ERISA”) plan fiduciaries can, but are not required to, consider the economic effects of ESG factors for purposes of investing ERISA plan assets and exercising voting rights with respect to plan investments. Some US states and/or state officials have adopted or proposed legislation or otherwise have taken official positions restricting or prohibiting state government entities from doing certain business with entities identified by the state as “boycotting” or “discriminating” against particular industries or considering ESG factors in their investment processes and proxy voting. Other states and localities may adopt similar legislation or other ESG-related laws and positions. The EU has enacted numerous regulations on ESG and sustainability, including to require sustainability-related disclosure by financial market participants; require the integration of sustainability considerations into the investment and risk management processes of asset managers and other institutional investors; and make the advice and financial product distribution process more receptive to end-investor sustainability preferences. Further rules are expected to come into force in 2023 and beyond. In addition, requirements for asset managers to report against an EU-wide taxonomy of environmentally sustainable activities took effect in 2022, with a further phase expected in 2023, and new proposed regulation to enhance sustainability reporting for EU-based corporate issuers is expected to take effect in 2024. BlackRock’s EU asset management companies and investment firms will be required to publish granular disclosures relating to the ESG characteristics of their funds and portfolios starting in 2023. The EU also proposed a draft directive in 2022 that would apply new supply chain due diligence obligations pertaining to sustainability to a wide group of global companies. Furthermore, the EU released a consultation on ESG and sustainability factors in credit ratings. The EU and the UK Financial Conduct Authority (“FCA”) are developing guidelines for the use of ESG or sustainability related terms in fund names, focused on specifying a minimum threshold of assets meeting ESG or sustainable criteria for such funds. Within the UK, the government has mandated climate-related risk reporting based on the Task Force on Climate-Related Financial Disclosures (“TCFD”) framework at UK firm and product level with first disclosures due in 2023. In addition, the FCA has proposed UK-specific sustainability regulations, including a sustainable product classification system for funds, which are expected to come into force on a staggered basis from 2023 through 2025. In Asia, policymakers in Singapore, Hong Kong and Japan issued or proposed sustainability-related regulations. For instance, requirements for asset managers to integrate climate risk considerations in investment and risk management processes, together with relevant disclosure obligations, became effective in Hong Kong and Singapore in 2022. ESG fund naming and related disclosure rules became effective in Hong Kong in 2022 and in Singapore in January 2023. Further, Singapore and Japan announced enhanced sustainability reporting requirements for corporate issuers. In 2022, Japan finalized its voluntary code of conduct for ESG data and ratings providers. Meanwhile, Australia’s securities regulator issued information on “greenwashing"", and the Australian government is seeking input on the design and implementation of a climate-related financial disclosure regime. Taxation BlackRock’s businesses may be directly or indirectly affected by tax legislation and regulation, or the modification of existing tax laws, by US or non-US tax authorities. In the US, the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 (""IRA"") introduced new provisions including a corporate book minimum tax and an excise tax on net stock repurchases. BlackRock does not expect the IRA to have a material impact on its consolidated financial statements. In addition, legislation at both the US federal and state level has been previously proposed to enact a financial transaction tax (“FTT”) on stocks, bonds and a broad range of financial instruments and derivative transactions. In the EU, certain Member States have also enacted similar FTTs and the European Commission (“EC”) has proposed legislation to harmonize these taxes and provide for the adoption of 13 EU-level legislation applicable to some (but not all) EU Member States. If enacted as proposed, FTTs could have an adverse effect on BlackRock’s financial results and clients’ performance results. The Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (“OECD”) has proposed certain international tax reforms, which, among other things, would (1) shift taxing rights to the jurisdiction of the consumer and (2) establish a global minimum tax for multinational companies of 15%. In December 2022, EU member states agreed to adopt the OECD’s minimum tax rules, which are expected to begin going into effect in 2024. Several other countries, including the UK, are also considering changes to their tax law to implement the OECD’s minimum tax proposal. As a result of these developments, the tax laws of certain countries in which we do business could change, and any such changes could increase our tax liabilities. The application of tax regulations involves numerous uncertainties and, in the normal course of business, US and non-US tax authorities may review and challenge tax positions adopted by BlackRock. These challenges may result in adjustments to, or impact the timing or amount of, taxable income, deductions or other tax allocations, which may adversely affect BlackRock’s effective tax rate and overall financial condition. Similarly, the Company manages assets in products and accounts that have investment objectives which may conform to tax positions adopted by BlackRock or to specific tax rules. To the extent there are changes in tax law or policy, or regulatory challenges to tax positions adopted by BlackRock, the value or attractiveness of such investments may be diminished and BlackRock may suffer financial or reputational harm. LIBOR Transition The global transition away from the London Interbank Offered Rate (“LIBOR”) continues to progress. Tenors of non-USD LIBOR ceased to be published at the end of 2021 while publication of most USD LIBOR settings is expected to continue through June 2023. In March 2022, the Adjustable Interest Rate (LIBOR) Act (the “LIBOR Act”) was signed into law, establishing a framework for the replacement of LIBOR as a benchmark in US law contracts that reference certain tenors of USD LIBOR and do not provide for a clearly defined and practicable benchmark replacement rate following the cessation of publication. In July 2022, the Federal Reserve Board solicited public comment on proposed LIBOR transition regulations implementing the LIBOR Act. Other global regulatory authorities such as the FCA have issued consultations regarding the wind-down of LIBOR. If such proposals are not finalized, parties to unremediated contracts, and the markets more generally, face the potential for uncertainty, disputes, litigation and market disruption. Regulation of Exchange-Traded Funds As part of a focus on financial stability issues and due to the significant growth of this product class over the last few years, regulators globally are examining the implications of an increased presence of ETFs in the markets, including those related to transparency, liquidity and structural resiliency. Depending on the outcome of this renewed regulatory analysis, or any associated structural reforms, ETF products may become subject to increased regulatory scrutiny or restrictions, which may require BlackRock to incur additional compliance and reporting expenses and adversely affect the Company’s business. Regulation of Swaps and Derivatives Jurisdictions outside the US in which BlackRock operates have adopted and implemented, or are in the process of considering, adopting or implementing, more pervasive regulation of many elements of the financial services industry, which could further impact BlackRock and the broader markets. For example, various global rules and regulations applicable to the use of financial products by funds, accounts and counterparties that have been adopted or proposed will require BlackRock to build and implement new compliance monitoring procedures to address the enhanced level of oversight to which it and its clients will be subject. These rules impose requirements such as mandatory central clearing of certain swaps transactions, requiring execution of certain swaps transactions on or through registered electronic trading venues (as opposed to over the phone or other execution methods), reporting transactions to central data repositories, mandating certain documentation standards, requiring the posting and collection of initial and/or variation margin for bilateral swap transactions and subjecting certain types of listed and/or over-the-counter transactions to position limit or position reporting requirements. In the US, certain interest rate swaps and certain index credit default swaps are subject to central clearing and trading venue execution requirements under the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010 (""Dodd-Frank""), with additional products and asset classes potentially becoming subject to these requirements in the future. In the EU, central clearing and trading venue requirements for certain swap transactions have become effective for certain types of BlackRock funds and accounts. Further, most derivatives transactions that are not centrally cleared, including non-deliverable foreign exchange forward transactions and currency option transactions, are subject to requirements in the US, EU and numerous other jurisdictions to post or collect mark-to-market margin payments. For certain BlackRock funds and accounts, initial margin requirements may apply in the future in addition to such mark-to-market margin payments. These rules and regulations have the potential to increase the complexity and cost of trading non-cleared derivatives for BlackRock's clients, and may produce regulatory inconsistencies in global derivatives trading rules and increase BlackRock’s operational and legal risks. US REGULATORY REFORM Antitrust Rules and Guidance In 2020, the Federal Trade Commission (“FTC”) proposed certain changes to rules enacted under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976 (“HSR”) that require parties to certain transactions to provide the FTC and the Antitrust Division of the Department of Justice (the “DOJ”) prior notice and observe a waiting period before consummation of such transactions. The proposals would: (1) require that investors aggregate holdings in an issuer across all associated funds when assessing HSR filing and exemption thresholds and (2) create a new exemption for acquisitions resulting in aggregate holdings of up to 10% of an issuer, which would be unavailable to investors holding interests of more than 1% in competing firms. If enacted as drafted, the proposed aggregation requirement could, absent applicable exemptions, substantially increase BlackRock’s pre-merger notification obligations, which may be costly, impair funds’ ability to trade freely creating significant tracking error and cash drag for index funds and opportunity costs for actively managed funds, require implementation of monitoring tools and introduce additional compliance burdens for both BlackRock and the companies in which it invests. In instances where filing a pre-merger notification is not practicable, the proposed changes may serve to limit the size of BlackRock’s aggregate position in certain issuers if BlackRock is unable to satisfy the revised regulatory requirements. In 2021, the FTC voted to withdraw its approval of the Vertical Merger Guidelines, previously issued jointly with the DOJ. In 2022 the FTC and DOJ jointly released a request for public comment on modernizing the agencies’ approach to the merger guidelines, including whether to dispense with the guidelines’ traditional distinction between the treatment of horizontal and vertical mergers. Such changes could have an effect on the ability of the Company to expand its services through strategic investments or acquisitions. 14 SEC Rulemakings for US Registered Funds and Investment Advisers The SEC has engaged in various initiatives and reviews that seek to improve and modernize the regulatory structure governing the asset management industry and registered investment companies. For example, in October 2022, the SEC adopted rules requiring certain funds to provide tailored fund shareholder reports and proposed amendments expanding the scope of the application of the rule governing fund names, including to, among other things, fund names that include ESG or similar terms. Systemically Important Financial Institution (“SIFI”) Review The FSOC has the authority to designate nonbank financial institutions as SIFIs in the US under Dodd-Frank. In July 2014, the FSOC pivoted from an entity-specific approach and indicated that it would focus on a products and activities-based approach to designation in connection with addressing potential risks in the financial system related to asset management, which was re-affirmed in December 2019 guidance. However, recent public reports and statements by FSOC members have suggested a willingness to support a repeal or amendment to certain parts of the 2019 guidance to provide the FSOC more flexibility to designate nonbank financial institutions as SIFIs. If BlackRock is designated as a SIFI, it could become subject to enhanced regulatory requirements and direct supervision by the Federal Reserve. Regulation of Swaps and Derivatives The SEC, Federal Reserve, the Internal Revenue Service and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (“CFTC”) each continue to review practices and regulations relating to the use of futures, swaps and other derivatives. Such reviews could result in regulations that restrict or limit the use of such products by funds or accounts. If adopted, any such limitations or restrictions could require BlackRock to change certain business practices or implement new compliance processes, which could result in additional costs and/or restrictions. In October 2020, the SEC adopted regulations governing the use of derivatives by registered investment companies (“RICs”), including mutual funds (other than MMFs), ETFs and closed-end funds, as well as business development companies. RICs were required to implement and comply with this rule beginning in 2022. The rule, among other things, imposes limits on the amount of derivatives transactions a RIC can enter into, eliminates the asset segregation compliance framework and introduces new compliance requirements for funds, including the establishment of comprehensive risk management programs. The rule may impact certain RICs’ usage of derivatives and investment strategy. In December 2021, the SEC proposed rules in connection with security-based swaps (“SBS”) transactions to require public reporting of large SBS positions. These rules, if adopted as proposed, may affect the types of transactions BlackRock may choose to execute in SBS or other SBS-related assets, introduce or increase costs relating to such transactions, and impact the liquidity in the SBS markets in which BlackRock transacts. SEC Proposed Rules on Private Fund Advisers During 2022, the SEC proposed new rules and amendments to enhance regulation of private fund advisors. These include a series of proposed amendments to Form PF for registered investment advisers that: (1) add new required disclosures, (2) require advisers to file reports within one business day for certain significant events, (3) lower the threshold for large private equity adviser reporting, (4) increase reporting obligations on large liquidity fund advisers, and (5) enhance reporting on basic information about advisers and the funds they advise. The SEC proposed additional rules that would, among other things, require registered private fund advisers to: (1) provide quarterly reports to investors of fund performance, fees and expenses, (2) obtain an annual audit for each fund and (3) distribute to investors a fairness opinion and summary of certain material business relationships with the opinion provider in connection with an adviser-led secondary transaction. The proposed rules would also prohibit private fund advisers from engaging in certain activities and practices deemed to be contrary to the public interest and investor protection, providing certain types of preferential terms for selected investors and providing any other forms of preferential treatment unless disclosed. These rules and amendments, if adopted as proposed, could significantly increase BlackRock’s reporting, disclosure and compliance obligations and create operational complexity for BlackRock’s alternatives products. SEC Rule 15c2-11 SEC Rule 15c2-11 governs the submission of quotes into quotation systems by broker-dealers and has historically been applied to the over-the-counter (“OTC”) equity markets. However, the SEC has stated that it intends to apply the rule to fixed income securities. While SEC staff issued additional no-action relief in November 2022 delaying implementation of the rule to segments of the fixed income markets until 2025, full implementation may disrupt primary and secondary market liquidity. Proposed Rules on Regulation ATS In January 2022, the SEC proposed amendments to Regulation ATS. The proposed rules would expand the types of systems that could fall within the definition of “exchange” and extend Regulation ATS and Regulation Systems Compliance and Integrity to systems involving US government securities trading. If enacted as proposed, these rules may impact certain functionality and tools offered by Aladdin, which may increase compliance costs for BlackRock. Proposed US Treasury Clearing Mandate In September 2022, the SEC proposed rules that would mandate central clearing of certain US Treasury transactions. If enacted as proposed, the rules would require many market participants, including a large number of BlackRock funds and accounts, to clear cash Treasury securities transactions and Treasury repurchase transactions through a clearing agency registered with the SEC, which could result in increased transaction costs for our clients. INTERNATIONAL REGULATORY REFORM EU Market Access and Outsourcing The EU legislature continues to consider proposals amending both the Alternative Investment Fund Managers Directive (“AIFMD”) and Directive on Undertakings for Collective Investment in Transferable Securities fund frameworks. The proposed changes remain broadly consistent with the current regulatory framework but with increased notification requirements to national regulators and the European Securities and Markets Authority (“ESMA”), enhanced liquidity management requirements and new requirements for loan originating funds. There is also a proposal to require notification for instances of significant delegation of portfolio management or risk management functions to entities located outside the EU. ESMA would then be required to present market analysis and supervisory peer review every two years to the European 15 Parliament (“EP”). These proposals and any further regulatory actions could impact delegated activities, increase compliance costs and impact products and services offered to EU clients. Revised Capital Requirements for Investment Firms In June 2021, the Directive and Regulation on prudential requirements for investment firms in scope of the EU Markets in Financial Instruments Directive for investment firms proposed by the EC came into effect, resulting in changes to regulatory capital and liquidity requirements in the EU, changes to the method of calculating such capital and liquidity, and revised disclosure obligations for large investment firms. The UK has also adopted comparable rules under the Investment Firms Prudential Regime (“IFPR”), which have applied to UK-based investment firms from January 2022. Changes to the supervisory approach to assessing the risk of harm posed by BlackRock’s operations or asset management activities more broadly could increase the amount of regulatory capital and liquidity required to be held in the future, and the new rules impose other prudential requirements. Enhanced Regulatory Scrutiny of Technology Service Providers to Financial Services Firms The EU’s Digital Operational Resilience Act (“DORA”), which focuses on direct regulation of providers and users of technology and data services, entered into force in January 2023, with the requirements expected to become applicable in January 2025. DORA will, among other things: (1) introduce additional governance, risk management, incident reporting, resilience testing and information sharing requirements to several of BlackRock’s European entities and certain Aladdin clients; and (2) subject Aladdin to broad additional oversight. In parallel with DORA, the UK has signaled its intention to provide His Majesty's Treasury powers to designate certain third parties to the financial sector as “critical” and subject them to oversight by UK regulators. This regime is expected to build on existing UK requirements regarding firms’ operational resilience and use of technology. EU Central Securities Depository Regulation Aspects of the settlement discipline regime introduced by the Central Securities Depository Regulation came into effect in February 2022. These include rules for trade allocation and confirmation processing, along with cash penalties for failed transactions. However, the mandatory buy-in regime is delayed to June 2025. Implementation of the regime required new operational mechanisms to facilitate compliance, which may increase required resources and cost. UK Review of Retained EU Law Under the Financial Services and Markets Bill (the “FSM Bill”) introduced in July 2022, retained EU law relating to financial services and markets will be revoked and UK financial regulators will be delegated substantial rulemaking powers to amend and restate such retained laws. Several UK regimes are currently subject to regulatory changes as the UK considers changes to retained EU rules following the UK’s exit from the EU, including the Wholesale Markets Review of MiFID II (as defined below) and Markets in Financial Instruments Regulation (“MiFIR”) frameworks, consumer disclosures, and the regime for non-UK-based funds that are recognized for sale into the UK, which is also currently under government review. UK Overseas Fund Regime The Overseas Fund Regime (“OFR”), the simplified regime through which non-UK funds can register with the FCA to be marketed to UK retail investors, was enacted in February 2022 and is expected to be implemented over the next two years. The OFR will require consumer protection regimes in EU countries where BlackRock funds are domiciled to be found equivalent to the UK’s regime in order to market such funds in the UK. UK Conduct Regime The FCA continues to focus on conduct regulation, including the implementation of the Consumer Duty by all asset management firms, including BlackRock’s UK subsidiaries. The Consumer Duty rules require firms to act to deliver good outcomes for retail customers in their manufacture and distribution of products and services, in respect of price and value, consumer understanding and consumer support. The rules are expected to come into force in July 2023. Any failure to meet the FCA’s regulatory expectations could expose BlackRock to regulatory sanctions and increased reputational risk. Edinburgh Reforms In December 2022, the UK announced wide-ranging reforms to financial services regulation which build on the FSM Bill, marking further potential divergence from EU regimes. Potential impacts to the asset management sector include: (1) repeal and replacement of the packaged retail and insurance based investment products (""PRIIPs"") Regulation; (2) review of the UK’s green finance strategy, including potential regulation of ESG data providers; (3) review of governance through the Senior Managers and Certification Regime; (4) repeal of EU legislation on the European Long-Term Investment Fund; (5) market infrastructure reforms; (6) reassessment of the boundary between investment advice and financial guidance; and (7) independent review of the UK investment research landscape. Reform of Investment Markets BlackRock is subject to numerous regulatory reform initiatives that may affect the Company’s provision of investment services globally. In Europe, the Markets in Financial Instruments Directive (“MiFID”) governing the provision of investment services has been revised and is accompanied by an associated Regulation (together with certain secondary regulation, “MiFID II”). The Regulation’s requirements generally apply consistently across the EU. The MiFID II reforms were substantive, materially changing market transparency requirements, enhancing protections afforded to investors, and increasing operational complexity for the Company. Forthcoming proposals to review the operation of MiFID II and to develop a new EU Retail Investment Strategy may affect the European market structure and impact BlackRock’s ability to operate in European markets. The broad nature of MiFID II means future reforms could also affect product development, client servicing and distribution models. Similar reforms have been implemented in Switzerland and Australia. Regulatory Environment in China The Company’s operations in China are subject to a number of regulatory risks, including an evolving regulatory environment and complex data security and data transfer regulations. These factors may increase compliance risk and costs, limit the Company’s ability to source and execute new investment opportunities and lead to impairment losses on its investments. Restrictions on the transfer of the Company’s Chinese onshore data to offshore entities also may limit BlackRock’s ability to aggregate, report and monitor such data on its global platform. In addition, a number of regulators in China have jurisdiction over BlackRock’s business operations, increasing operational and regulatory engagement 16 complexity. These risks may be further heightened by additional scrutiny by Chinese regulators of certain sectors, such as technology and other industries that might be deemed to be of national importance. EXISTING US REGULATION - OVERVIEW BlackRock and certain of its US subsidiaries are currently subject to extensive regulation, primarily at the federal level, by the SEC, the DOL, the Federal Reserve, the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (“OCC”), the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (“FINRA”), the National Futures Association (“NFA”), the FTC, the Department of Justice, the CFTC and other federal government agencies and regulatory bodies. Certain of BlackRock’s US subsidiaries are also subject to various anti-terrorist financing, privacy, anti-money laundering and economic sanctions laws and regulations established by various agencies. In addition, the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 (the “Advisers Act”) imposes numerous obligations on registered investment advisers such as certain BlackRock subsidiaries, including record-keeping, operational and marketing requirements, disclosure obligations and prohibitions on fraudulent activities. State level regulation through attorneys general, insurance commissioners and other state level agencies also applies to certain BlackRock activities. The Investment Company Act of 1940 (the “Investment Company Act”) imposes stringent governance, compliance, operational, disclosure and related obligations on registered investment companies and their investment advisers and distributors, such as certain BlackRock subsidiaries and affiliates. The SEC is authorized to institute proceedings and impose sanctions for violations of the Advisers Act and the Investment Company Act, ranging from fines and censure to termination of an investment adviser’s registration. Investment advisers also are subject to certain state securities laws and regulations. Non-compliance with the Advisers Act, the Investment Company Act or other federal and state securities laws and regulations could result in investigations, sanctions, disgorgement, fines and reputational damage. BlackRock’s trading and investment activities for client accounts are regulated under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”), as well as the rules of various securities exchanges and self-regulatory organizations, including laws governing trading on inside information, market manipulation and a broad number of technical requirements (e.g., short sale limits, volume limitations and reporting obligations) and market regulation policies. Violation of any of these laws and regulations could result in fines or sanctions, as well as restrictions on BlackRock’s activities and damage to its reputation. Furthermore, Dodd-Frank requires one of BlackRock’s subsidiaries, BTC, to register as a municipal advisor (as that term is defined in the Exchange Act) with the SEC and Municipal Securities Rulemaking Board (“MSRB”). BTC's registration as a municipal advisor subjects BTC to additional regulation by the SEC and MSRB. BlackRock manages a variety of private pools of capital, including hedge funds, funds of hedge funds, private equity funds, collateralized debt obligations, collateralized loan obligations, real estate funds, collective trust funds, managed futures funds and hybrid funds. Congress, regulators, tax authorities and others continue to explore, on their own and in response to demands from the investment community and the public, increased regulation related to private pools of capital, including changes with respect to investor eligibility, certain limitations on trading activities, record-keeping and reporting, the scope of anti-fraud protections, safekeeping of client assets and a variety of other matters. BlackRock may be materially and adversely affected by new legislation, rulemaking or changes in the interpretation or enforcement of existing rules and regulations imposed by various regulators in this area. Certain BlackRock subsidiaries are subject to ERISA, and to regulations promulgated thereunder by the DOL, insofar as they act as a “fiduciary” under ERISA with respect to benefit plan clients that are subject to ERISA. ERISA and applicable provisions of the Internal Revenue Code impose certain duties on persons who are fiduciaries under ERISA, prohibit certain transactions involving ERISA plan clients and impose excise taxes for violations of these prohibitions, mandate certain required periodic reporting and disclosures and require certain BlackRock entities to carry bonds insuring against losses caused by fraud or dishonesty. ERISA also imposes additional compliance, reporting and operational requirements on BlackRock that otherwise are not applicable to clients that are not subject to ERISA. BlackRock has seven subsidiaries that are registered as commodity pool operators and/or commodity trading advisors with the CFTC and are members of the NFA. The CFTC and NFA each administer a comparable regulatory system covering futures contracts and various other financial instruments, including swaps as a result of Dodd-Frank, in which certain BlackRock clients may invest. In addition, two of BlackRock’s subsidiaries are registered with the SEC as broker-dealers and are member-firms of FINRA. Each broker-dealer has a membership agreement with FINRA that limits the scope of such broker-dealer’s permitted activities. One of the broker-dealers is also a member of the MSRB and is subject to MSRB rules. BlackRock’s business activity in California that involves the processing of personal information is subject to the California Consumer Privacy Act (“CCPA”) and the California Privacy Rights Act (“CPRA”), which provide for enhanced consumer protections for California residents. The CCPA and CPRA impose obligations on BlackRock for the handling, disclosure and deletion of personal information for California residents. In addition, several other US states have proposed or adopted similar privacy laws. Any failure by BlackRock to comply with the CCPA, CPRA or similar state privacy laws may result in fines, heightened regulatory scrutiny, litigation and/or reputational harm. US Banking Regulation One of BlackRock’s subsidiaries, BTC, is organized as a nationally-chartered limited purpose trust company that does not accept deposits or make commercial loans. Accordingly, BTC is examined and supervised by the OCC and is subject to various banking laws and regulations enforced by the OCC, such as laws and regulations governing capital adequacy, fiduciary activities, conflicts of interest, self-dealing, and the prevention of financial crime, including money laundering. BTC is also a member of the Federal Reserve System and is subject to various Federal Reserve regulations applicable to member institutions, such as regulations restricting transactions with affiliates. Many of these laws and regulations are meant for the protection of BTC and/or BTC’s customers rather than BlackRock, its affiliates or stockholders. EXISTING INTERNATIONAL REGULATION — OVERVIEW BlackRock’s international operations are subject to the laws and regulations of a number of international jurisdictions, as well as oversight by numerous regulatory agencies and bodies in those jurisdictions. In some instances, these operations are also affected by US laws and regulations that have extra-territorial application. Below is a summary of certain international regulatory standards to which BlackRock is subject. It is not meant to be comprehensive as there are parallel legal and regulatory arrangements in force in many jurisdictions where BlackRock’s subsidiaries conduct business. Of note among the various other international regulations to which BlackRock is subject, are the extensive and complex regulatory reporting requirements that necessitate the monitoring and reporting of issuer exposure levels (thresholds) across the holdings of managed funds and accounts and those of the Company. 17 European Regulation The FCA currently regulates certain BlackRock subsidiaries in the UK. It is also responsible for the conduct of business regulation of the UK branch of one of BlackRock’s US subsidiaries. In addition, the Prudential Regulation Authority (“PRA”) regulates one BlackRock UK insurance subsidiary. Authorization by the FCA and (where relevant) the PRA is required to conduct certain financial services-related business in the UK under the Financial Services and Markets Act 2000 (the “FSMA”). The FCA’s rules adopted under the FSMA govern the majority of a firm’s capital and liquidity resources requirements, senior management arrangements, conduct of business requirements, interaction with clients, and systems and controls, whereas the rules of the PRA focus solely on the prudential requirements that apply to BlackRock’s UK-based insurance subsidiary. The FCA supervises BlackRock’s UK-regulated subsidiaries through a combination of proactive engagement, event-driven and reactive supervision and thematic reviews in order to monitor BlackRock’s compliance with regulatory requirements. Breaches of the FCA’s rules may result in a wide range of disciplinary actions against BlackRock’s UK-regulated subsidiaries and/or its employees. In addition, BlackRock has regulated entities in France, Germany, Ireland, Jersey, Luxembourg, the Netherlands and Switzerland. Each of these entities is required to comply with regulatory rules in the country in which it has been established, including the branches of the Netherlands entity which operate across the EU. BlackRock’s EU subsidiaries and branches must comply with the EU regulatory regime set out in MiFID II. BlackRock’s UK-regulated subsidiaries must comply with the UK version of MiFID II, which regulates the provision of investment services and activities in the UK. MiFID II, and the UK equivalent of MiFID II, set out detailed requirements governing the organization and conduct of business of investment firms and regulated markets. The legislation also includes pre- and post-trade transparency requirements for equity and non-equity markets and extensive transaction reporting requirements. Certain BlackRock UK subsidiaries must also comply with the UK regulation which implements the Consolidated Life Directive and Insurance Distribution Directive. In addition, relevant entities must comply with revised obligations on capital resources for certain investment firms arising out of the IFPR. These include requirements to ensure capital adequacy, as well as matters of governance and remuneration. Relevant BlackRock entities must also comply with the requirements of the UCITS Directive and the AIFMD, as implemented in the relevant EU Member States and in the UK, which impose obligations on the authorization and capital, conduct of business, organization, transparency and marketing of retail and alternative investment funds respectively that are sold in, or marketed to, the EU. The obligations introduced through these regulations and directives will affect certain of BlackRock’s European operations. Compliance with the UCITS Directives and the AIFMD may subject BlackRock to additional expenses associated with depositary oversight and other organizational requirements. BlackRock’s EU-regulated subsidiaries are also subject to the European Market Infrastructure Regulation (""EMIR"") (or the UK version of EMIR transposed into UK law in accordance with The European Union (Withdrawal) Act 2018 in the case of BlackRock’s UK-regulated subsidiaries), an EU regulation governing derivatives, central counterparties and trade repositories, which requires (1) the central clearing of certain OTC derivatives; (2) the application of risk-mitigation techniques to non-centrally cleared OTC derivatives (including the exchange of collateral with certain counterparties); and (3) the reporting of all derivative contracts to an ESMA registered or recognized derivatives trade repository (or a UK authorized trade repository in the case of the UK version of EMIR). The EU has seen an increase in Common Supervisory Actions by ESMA to coordinate supervisory action by national EU regulators, most notably in areas such as product governance, liquidity management and fund costs and charges. BlackRock’s EU operations may be affected to the extent this initiative results in formal legislation or action. EU Member States, the UK and many other non-US jurisdictions have adopted statutes and/or regulations concerning privacy and data protection and requiring notification of personal data security breaches if certain thresholds are met. For example, the EU adopted the General Data Protection Regulation (“GDPR”), which became effective in 2018, and the UK transposed the GDPR into national law (“UK GDPR”), which became effective in 2021. In July 2020, the EU-US Privacy Shield was invalidated as a valid personal data transfer mechanism and in June 2021, the EC published a new set of standard contractual clauses, which only apply to the transfer of personal data outside of the EU to a country not approved by the EU as providing an adequate level of protection for the processing of personal data. The EU's adequacy decision with respect to the UK, which allows the continued flow of personal data from the EU to the UK, will be regularly reviewed and may be revoked if the UK diverges from its current adequate data protection laws. The UK has developed its own international data transfer agreement, which was implemented in March 2022. GDPR and UK GDPR, as well as other statutes and/or regulations concerning privacy and data protection, increase compliance obligations, affect BlackRock’s collection, processing, retention and transfer of personal data and reporting of personal data security breaches, and provide for increased penalties for non-compliance. BlackRock also maintains two offices in the Middle East, one in Dubai, which is regulated by the Dubai Financial Services Authority, and one in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, which is regulated by the Saudi Capital Markets Authority. Both offices are authorized to provide certain investment services and support BlackRock’s provision of investment products and services in their countries of domicile. Other countries across the Middle Eastern region are serviced on a cross-border basis. Regulation in the Asia-Pacific Region In Japan, a BlackRock subsidiary is subject to the Financial Instruments and Exchange Act (“FIEA”) and the Act on Investment Trusts and Investment Corporations. These laws are administered and enforced by the Japanese Financial Services Agency (“JFSA”), which establishes standards for compliance, including capital adequacy and financial soundness requirements, customer protection requirements and conduct of business rules. The JFSA is empowered to conduct administrative proceedings that can result in censure, fines, cease and desist orders or the suspension or revocation of registrations and licenses granted under the FIEA. This Japanese subsidiary also holds a license for real estate brokerage activities which subjects it to the regulations set forth in the Real Estate Brokerage Act. In Australia, BlackRock’s operating entity is principally regulated by the Australian Securities and Investments Commission (“ASIC”), which includes holding an Australian financial services license and operating registered managed investment schemes. ASIC is Australia’s integrated corporate, markets, financial services and consumer credit regulator. The activities of certain BlackRock subsidiaries in Hong Kong are subject to the Securities and Futures Ordinance (“SFO”), which governs the securities and futures markets and regulates, among others, offers of investments to the public and provides for the licensing of intermediaries. The SFO is administered by the Securities and Futures Commission (“SFC”). The SFC is also empowered to establish standards for compliance as well as codes and guidelines. The relevant BlackRock subsidiaries and the employees conducting any of the regulated activities specified in the SFO are required to be licensed with the SFC, and are subject to the rules, codes and guidelines issued by the SFC. BlackRock’s operations in Taiwan are regulated by the Taiwan Financial Supervisory Commission, which is responsible for regulating securities markets (including the Taiwan Stock Exchange and the Taiwan Futures Exchange), the banking industry and the insurance sector. 18 BlackRock’s Fund Management Company in China (“BlackRock FMC”) is regulated by the China Securities Regulatory Commission and is subject to the Securities Investment Fund Law and Measures for the Supervision and Administration of Mutual Fund Managers for the overall oversight from incorporation to the corporate governance and operations of fund managers and funds. BlackRock FMC is also subject to the China Securities Law and various other financial laws and regulations. BlackRock CCB Wealth Management Limited, which is BlackRock’s wealth management joint venture company with CCB Wealth Management Co., Ltd. and Fullerton Management Pte Ltd. in China, is regulated by the China Banking and Insurance Regulatory Commission (“CBIRC”). CBIRC have enacted Bank Wealth Management Supervision and Management Measures and Management Measures of Bank Wealth Management Subsidiaries since 2018 to regulate the setup, conduct of business and risk management of bank wealth management companies. In Singapore, a BlackRock subsidiary is regulated by the Monetary Authority of Singapore (“MAS”) and its business activities are subject to the Securities and Futures Act 2001 (“SFA”). The SFA governs the regulation of activities and institutions in the securities and derivatives industry, including leveraged foreign exchange trading of financial benchmarks and of clearing facilities. The MAS is Singapore’s central bank and integrated financial regulator, which regulates the financial services sector in Singapore and conducts integrated supervision of financial services and financial stability surveillance. This BlackRock subsidiary and the employees conducting any of the regulated activities specified in the SFA are required to be licensed with the MAS, and are subject to the SFA and the rules, codes and guidelines issued by the MAS. Other financial regulators oversee BlackRock subsidiaries, branches and representative offices across the Asia-Pacific region, including in South Korea. Regulators in all of these jurisdictions have authority with respect to financial services including, among other things, the authority to grant, suspend or cancel required licenses or registrations. In addition, these regulators may subject certain BlackRock subsidiaries to net capital requirements.

Risk Factors As a global investment management firm, risk is an inherent part of BlackRock’s business. Global markets, by their nature, are prone to uncertainty and subject participants to a variety of risks. While BlackRock devotes significant resources across all of its operations to identify, measure, monitor, manage and analyze market, operating, legal, compliance, reputational, fiduciary and investment risks, BlackRock’s business, financial condition, operating results and nonoperating results could be materially adversely affected and the Company’s stock price could decline as a result of any of these risks and uncertainties, including the ones discussed below. MARKET AND COMPETITION RISKS Changes in the value levels of equity, debt, real assets, commodities, foreign exchange or other asset markets, as well as the impact of global trade policies and tariffs, may cause assets under management (“AUM”), revenue and earnings to decline. BlackRock’s investment management revenue is primarily comprised of fees based on a percentage of the value of AUM and, in some cases, performance fees which are normally expressed as a percentage of returns to the client. Numerous factors, including price movements in the equity, debt or currency markets, or in the price of real assets, commodities or other alternative investments in which BlackRock invests on behalf of its clients, as well as the impact of global trade policies and tariffs, could cause: •the value of AUM, or the returns BlackRock realizes on AUM, to decrease; •client redemptions from BlackRock’s products; •client rebalancing or reallocating of assets into BlackRock products that yield lower fees; •an impairment to the value of intangible assets and goodwill; or •a decrease in the value of seed or co-investment capital. These risks may also be heightened by market volatility, illiquid market conditions or other market disruptions. The occurrence of any of the above events may cause the Company’s AUM, revenue and earnings to decline. Changes in interest or foreign exchange rates and/or divergent beta may cause BlackRock’s AUM and base fees to fluctuate and introduce volatility to the Company’s net income and operating cash flows. In past years, there were prolonged periods of historically low interest rates, interspersed with periods in which certain central banks globally began increasing rates. Recently, global markets have experienced substantial volatility, with significant downturns in both bond and equity markets. In addition, central banks worldwide have raised interest rates in an effort to moderate rising inflation. BlackRock’s business is directly and indirectly affected by changes in global interest rates. Similarly, due to the global nature of BlackRock’s operations, a portion of its business is conducted in currencies other than the United States (""US"") dollar. BlackRock’s exposure to foreign exchange rates relative to the US dollar and interest rates may cause BlackRock’s AUM to fluctuate and introduce volatility to the Company’s base fees, net income and operating cash flows. In addition, beta divergence between equity markets, where certain markets perform differently than others, may lead to an increase in the proportion of BlackRock AUM weighted toward lower fee equity products, resulting in a decline in BlackRock’s effective fee rate. Divergent market factors may also erode the correlation between the growth rates of AUM and base fees. BlackRock’s investment advisory contracts may be terminated or may not be renewed by clients and fund boards on favorable terms and the liquidation of certain funds may be accelerated at the option of investors. BlackRock derives a substantial portion of its revenue from providing investment advisory services. The advisory or management contracts BlackRock has entered into with its clients, including the agreements that govern many of BlackRock’s investment funds, provide investors or, in some cases, the independent directors of applicable investment funds, with significant latitude to terminate such contracts, withdraw funds or liquidate funds by simple majority vote with limited notice or penalty, or to remove BlackRock as a fund’s investment advisor (or equivalent). BlackRock also manages its US mutual funds, closed-end and exchange-traded funds under management contracts that must be renewed and approved annually by the funds’ respective boards of directors, a majority of whom are independent from the Company. BlackRock’s fee arrangements under any of its advisory or management contracts may be reduced (including at the behest of a fund’s board of directors). In addition, if a number of BlackRock’s clients terminate their contracts, or otherwise remove BlackRock from its advisory roles, liquidate funds or fail to renew management contracts on similar terms, the fees or carried interest BlackRock earns could be reduced, which may cause BlackRock’s AUM, revenue and earnings to decline. The failure or negative performance of products offered by competitors may cause AUM in similar BlackRock products to decline irrespective of BlackRock’s performance. Many competitors offer similar products to those offered by BlackRock and the failure or negative performance of competitors’ products could lead to a loss of confidence in similar BlackRock products, irrespective of the performance of such BlackRock products. Any loss of confidence in a product type could lead to withdrawals, redemptions and liquidity issues in such products, which may cause the Company’s AUM, revenue and earnings to decline. Increased competition may cause BlackRock’s AUM, revenue and earnings to decline. The investment management industry is highly competitive, and BlackRock competes based on a number of factors including: investment performance, liquidity, its technology and portfolio construction offerings, the level of fees charged, the quality and breadth of services and products provided, name recognition and reputation, and its ability to develop new investment strategies and products to meet the changing needs of investors. In addition, over the past several years, there has been significant consolidation in the asset management and financial services industries as investors increasingly seek out firms that have the capacity to deliver broad multi-asset investment capabilities and technological expertise, including in a manner that is responsive to ever more localized needs. This consolidation, together with the introduction of new technologies, as well as regulatory changes, continues to alter the competitive landscape for investment managers, which may lead to additional fee compression or require BlackRock to invest more to modify or adapt its product offerings to attract and retain customers and remain competitive with the products, services and geographic diversity offered by other financial institutions, technology companies, trading, advisory or asset management firms. Increased competition on the basis of any of these factors, including competition leading to fee reductions on existing or new business, may cause the Company’s AUM, revenue and earnings to decline. 20 Failure to maintain Aladdin’s competitive position in a dynamic market could lead to a loss of clients and could impede BlackRock’s productivity and growth. The sophisticated risk analytics, portfolio management, trade execution and investment operations that BlackRock provides via its technology platform to support investment advisory and Aladdin clients are important elements of BlackRock’s competitive success. Aladdin’s competitive position is based in part on its ability to combine risk analytics with portfolio management, trading and operations tools on a single platform. Increased competition from risk analytics and investment management technology providers, including as a result of growing industry consolidation giving rise to competitors with increasingly sophisticated and comprehensive product offerings, or a shift in client demand toward standalone or internally developed solutions, whether due to price competition, perceived client market share, platform offerings or flexibility, or market-based or regulatory factors, may weaken Aladdin’s competitive position and may cause the Company’s revenue and earnings to decline. In addition, to the extent that Aladdin competitors are able to innovate more effectively than BlackRock or leverage delivery models that provide clients faster time to market, lower costs or the ability to more seamlessly combine or bundle with other service offerings, BlackRock may lose existing clients or fail to capture future market share, which may impede its productivity and growth. Moreover, although BlackRock takes steps to safeguard against infringements of its intellectual property, there can be no assurance that the Company will be able to effectively protect and enforce its intellectual property rights in Aladdin. BlackRock may be unable to develop new products and services and the development of new products and services may expose BlackRock to reputational harm, additional costs or operational risk. BlackRock’s financial performance depends, in part, on its ability to react to changes in the asset management industry, respond to evolving client demands and develop, market and manage new investment products and services. The development and introduction of new products and services, including the creation of increasingly customizable products, requires continued innovative effort on the part of BlackRock and may require significant time and resources as well as ongoing support and investment. Substantial risk and uncertainties are associated with the introduction of new products and services, including the implementation of new and appropriate operational controls and procedures, shifting client and market preferences, the introduction of competing products or services, constraints on BlackRock’s ability to manage growth within client mandates, compliance with regulatory and disclosure requirements and intellectual property-related lawsuits or claims. A growing number of BlackRock’s new products and services also depend on data provided by third parties as analytical inputs and are subject to additional risks, including with respect to data quality, cost, availability and provider relationships. Data sets for certain developing analytics, such as those in the sustainability space, continue to evolve and difficulties approximating gaps in the data, sourcing data from reliable sources, or validating the data could adversely impact the accuracy and effectiveness of such tools. There can be no assurance that BlackRock will be able to innovate effectively in order to develop new products or services that address the needs of its clients on the timeline they require. Any failure to successfully develop new products and services, or effectively manage associated operational risks, could harm BlackRock’s reputation and expose the Company to additional costs, which may cause its AUM, revenue and earnings to decline. Changes in the value of seed and co-investments that BlackRock owns as well as certain of BlackRock’s minority investments could affect its income and could increase the volatility of its earnings. At December 31, 2022, BlackRock’s net economic investment exposure of approximately $3.3 billion in its investments (see Item 7, Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations-Investments) primarily resulted from co-investments and seed investments in its sponsored investment funds. Movements in the equity, debt or currency markets, or in the price of real assets, commodities or other alternative investments, could lower the value of these investments as well as certain minority investments, increase the volatility of BlackRock’s earnings and cause earnings to decline. BlackRock indemnifies certain securities lending clients for specified losses as a result of a borrower default. BlackRock provides borrower default indemnification to certain of its securities lending clients. In the event of a borrower default, BlackRock would use the collateral pledged by the borrower to repurchase securities out on loan in order to replace them in a client’s account. Borrower default indemnification is limited to the shortfall that occurs in the event the collateral available at the time of the borrower’s default is insufficient to repurchase those securities out on loan. BlackRock requires all borrowers to mark to market their pledged collateral daily to levels in excess of the value of the securities out on loan to mitigate the likelihood of the indemnity being triggered. Where the collateral is in the form of cash, the indemnities BlackRock provides do not guarantee, assume or otherwise insure the investment performance or return of any cash collateral vehicle into which that cash collateral is invested. The amount of securities on loan as of December 31, 2022 and subject to this type of indemnification was approximately $253 billion. In the Company’s capacity as lending agent, cash and securities totaling approximately $268 billion was held as collateral for indemnified securities on loan at December 31, 2022. Significant borrower defaults occurring simultaneously with rapid declines in the value of collateral pledged and/or increases in the value of the securities loaned may create collateral shortfalls, which could result in material liabilities under these indemnities and may cause the Company’s revenue and earnings to decline. BlackRock’s decision on whether to provide support to particular products from time to time, or the inability to provide support, may cause AUM, revenue and earnings to decline. While not legally mandated, BlackRock may, at its option, from time to time choose to seed, warehouse or otherwise support investment products through capital or credit support for commercial or other reasons. Any decision by BlackRock on whether to support products may utilize capital and liquidity that would otherwise be available for other corporate purposes. BlackRock’s ability to seed, warehouse or otherwise support certain products may be restricted by regulation or by the Company’s failure to have or make available sufficient capital or liquidity. Moreover, inherent constraints arising from the business models of certain asset managers, including BlackRock, may during periods of market volatility result in BlackRock having fewer options for accessing liquidity than asset managers with alternate business models, which may adversely impact its ability to support certain products. Any decision by BlackRock to support particular products, or the inability to provide such support, may result in losses, which may cause AUM, revenue and earnings to decline. Increased geopolitical unrest and other events outside of BlackRock’s control could adversely affect the global economy or specific international, regional and domestic markets, which may cause BlackRock’s AUM, revenue and earnings to decline. Geopolitical risks, including those arising from trade tension and/or the imposition of trade tariffs, terrorist activity or acts of civil or international hostility, are increasing. For instance, the war between Russia and Ukraine has and may continue to result in geopolitical instability and adversely affect the global economy, supply chains and specific markets. Strategic competition between the US and China and resulting tensions have also contributed to uncertainty in the geopolitical and regulatory landscapes. Similarly, other events outside of BlackRock’s control, including natural disasters, climate-related events, pandemics or health crises may arise from time to time and be accompanied by 21 governmental actions that may increase international tension. Any such events and responses, including regulatory developments, may cause significant volatility and declines in the global markets, disproportionate impacts to certain industries or sectors, disruptions to commerce (including to economic activity, travel and supply chains), loss of life and property damage, and may adversely affect the global economy or capital markets, as well as the Company’s products, operations, clients, vendors and employees, which may cause BlackRock’s AUM, revenue and earnings to decline. BlackRock’s exposure to geopolitical risks may be heightened to the extent such risks arise in countries in which BlackRock currently operates or is seeking to expand its presence. Climate-related risks could adversely affect BlackRock’s business, products, operations and clients, which may cause BlackRock’s AUM, revenue and earnings to decline. BlackRock’s business and those of its clients could be impacted by climate-related risks. Climate-related risks may impact BlackRock through changes in the physical climate or from the process of transitioning to a lower-carbon economy. Climate-related physical risks arise from the direct impacts of a changing climate in the short- and long-term. Such risks may include the risks of extreme weather events and changes in temperature, which may damage infrastructure and facilities, including BlackRock’s physical assets, as well as disrupt connectivity or supply chains. Climate-related transition risks arise from exposure to the transition to a lower-carbon economy through policy, regulatory, technology and market changes. For instance, new or divergent climate regulations or guidance, as well as differing perspectives of stakeholders regarding climate impacts, have affected and may continue to affect BlackRock’s business activities and reputation, increase scrutiny and complicate compliance requirements, which could increase the Company’s costs. Climate-related physical and transition risks could also impact BlackRock’s business both directly and indirectly through adverse impacts to its clients’ investments, including as a result of declines in asset values, changes in client preferences, increased regulatory and compliance costs and significant business disruptions. Any of these risks may cause the Company’s AUM, revenue and earnings to decline. RISKS RELATED TO INVESTMENT PERFORMANCE Poor investment performance could lead to the loss of clients and may cause AUM, revenue and earnings to decline. The Company’s management believes that investment performance, including the efficient delivery of beta, is one of the most important factors for the growth and retention of AUM. Poor investment performance relative to applicable portfolio benchmarks, aggregate fee levels or competitors may cause AUM, revenue and earnings to decline as a result of: •client withdrawals in favor of better performing products offered by competitors; •client shifts to products that charge lower fees; •the diminishing ability to attract additional funds from existing and new clients; •reduced, minimal or no performance fees; •an impairment to the value of intangible assets and goodwill; or •a decrease in the valuations of seed and co-investment capital. Performance fees may increase volatility of both revenue and earnings. A portion of BlackRock’s revenue is derived from performance fees on investment advisory assignments. Performance fees represented $514 million, or 3%, of total revenue for the year ended December 31, 2022. Generally, the Company is entitled to a performance fee only if the agreement under which it is managing the assets provides for one and if returns on the related portfolio exceed agreed-upon periodic or cumulative return targets. If these targets are not exceeded, a performance fee for that period will not be earned and, if targets are based on cumulative returns, the Company may not earn performance fees in future periods. The volatility of the Company’s future revenue and earnings may also be affected due to illiquid alternatives becoming an increasing component of the overall composition of the Company’s performance fee generating assets. In particular, the Company expects that as it manages more illiquid products, its performance fees will generally be recognized over substantially longer multi-year periods than those associated with more liquid products. Failure to identify errors in the quantitative models BlackRock utilizes to manage its business could adversely affect product performance and client relationships. BlackRock employs various quantitative models to support its investment processes, including those related to risk assessment, portfolio management, trading and hedging activities and product valuations. Any errors or limitations in the underlying models, model inputs or assumptions, including those from third-party sources, as well as any failure of BlackRock’s governance, approval, testing and validation standards in respect of such models, model inputs or assumptions or the failure to timely update such models, model inputs or assumptions, could have adverse effects on BlackRock’s business and reputation. These risks may be heightened by the rapid growth and complexity of new models, evolving data sets and standards and market volatility. RISKS RELATED TO THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC The COVID-19 pandemic has and may continue to adversely affect BlackRock’s business, operations and financial condition which may cause its AUM, revenue and earnings to decline. The COVID-19 pandemic has caused and may continue to cause significant harm to the US and global economies. It has also had and may continue to have an ongoing adverse impact on BlackRock’s business, including its operations and financial condition, as a result of, among other things, the negative impact of the pandemic on financial markets, BlackRock’s clients, key vendors (such as pricing providers), market participants and other third parties with whom it does business, and workforce disruption due to continued periods away from physical office locations in certain regions and illness and health concerns, any of which may cause the Company's AUM, revenue and earnings to decline. The extent to which COVID-19, and the related impact on the global economy, may continue to affect BlackRock’s business, results of operations and financial condition, will depend on future developments that are uncertain and cannot be predicted, including the emergence and spread of new variants of the COVID-19 virus and/or other concurrent or overlapping pandemics and health crises, the availability, adoption and efficacy of future treatments and vaccines, future actions taken by governmental authorities, central banks and other third parties (including new financial regulation and other regulatory reform) in response to the pandemic, and the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on BlackRock’s products, clients, vendors and employees, any of which may exacerbate the other risks described herein. 22 TECHNOLOGY AND OPERATIONAL RISKS A failure in, or disruption to, BlackRock’s operations, systems or infrastructure, including business continuity plans, could adversely affect operations, damage the Company’s reputation and cause BlackRock’s AUM, revenue and earnings to decline. BlackRock’s infrastructure, including its technological capacity, data centers and office space, is vital to the competitiveness of its business. Moreover, a significant portion of BlackRock’s critical business operations is concentrated in a limited number of geographic areas, including San Francisco, New York, London, Budapest, Atlanta and Gurgaon. The failure to maintain an infrastructure commensurate with the size and scope of BlackRock’s business, or the occurrence of a business outage or event outside BlackRock’s control, including a major earthquake, hurricane, fire, terrorist act, pandemic, health crisis or other catastrophic event, or the actions of individuals or groups seeking to disrupt BlackRock’s operations in any location at which BlackRock maintains a major presence, could materially impact operations, result in business disruption or impede the Company's growth. In addition, these risks may be heightened during BlackRock’s move to its new headquarters in New York, which is expected to be completed in 2023. Despite BlackRock’s efforts to ensure business continuity, if it fails to keep business continuity plans up-to-date or if such plans, including secure back-up facilities and systems and the availability of back-up employees, are improperly implemented or deployed during a disruption, the Company’s ability to operate could be adversely impacted which may cause AUM, revenue and earnings to decline or impact the Company’s ability to comply with regulatory obligations or contractual obligations leading to reputational harm, legal liability, regulatory fines and/or sanctions. A cyber-attack or a failure to implement effective information and cybersecurity policies, procedures and capabilities could disrupt operations and lead to financial losses and reputational harm, which may cause BlackRock’s AUM, revenue and earnings to decline. BlackRock is dependent on the effectiveness of the information and cybersecurity policies, procedures and capabilities it maintains to protect its computer and telecommunications systems and the data that resides on or is transmitted through them, including data provided by third parties that is significant to portions of BlackRock's business and products. An externally caused information security incident, such as a cyber-attack including a phishing scam, business email compromise, malware, or denial-of-service or ransomware attack, or an internally caused incident or disruption, such as failure to control access to sensitive systems, could materially interrupt business operations or cause disclosure or modification of sensitive or confidential client or competitive information. Moreover, developments in BlackRock’s use of process automation, as well as the use of remote access by employees and mobile and cloud technologies, could heighten these and other operational risks, as certain aspects of the security of such technologies may be complex, unpredictable or beyond BlackRock’s control. BlackRock’s growing exposure to the public Internet, as well as reliance on mobile or cloud technology or any failure by mobile technology and cloud service providers to adequately safeguard their systems and prevent cyber-attacks, could disrupt BlackRock’s operations and result in misappropriation, corruption or loss of personal, confidential or proprietary information or third-party data. In addition, there is a risk that encryption and other protective measures may be circumvented, particularly to the extent that new computing technologies increase the speed and computing power available. The financial services industry has been the subject of cyber-attacks involving the dissemination, theft and destruction of corporate information or other assets, as a result of failure to follow procedures by employees or contractors or as a result of actions by third parties, including nation state actors and terrorist organizations. BlackRock has been and continues to be the target of attempted cyber-attacks, as well as the co-opting of its brand, and continues to monitor and develop its systems to protect its technology infrastructure and data from misappropriation or corruption, as the failure to do so could disrupt BlackRock’s operations and cause financial losses. Although BlackRock has implemented policies and controls, and takes protective measures involving significant expense, to prevent and address potential data breaches, inadvertent disclosures, increasingly sophisticated cyber-attacks and cyber-related fraud, there can be no assurance that any of these measures proves effective. In addition, a successful cyber-attack may persist for an extended period of time before being detected, and it may take a considerable amount of time for an investigation to be completed and the severity and potential impact to be known. Moreover, due to the complexity and interconnectedness of BlackRock’s systems, the process of upgrading or patching the Company’s protective measures could itself create a risk of security issues or system disruptions for the Company, as well as for clients who rely upon, or have exposure to, BlackRock’s systems. In addition, due to BlackRock’s interconnectivity with third-party vendors, advisors, central agents, exchanges, clearing houses and other financial institutions, BlackRock or any such third party may be adversely affected if any of them is subject to a successful cyber-attack or other information security event, including those arising due to the use of mobile technology or a third-party cloud environment. BlackRock also routinely transmits and receives personal, confidential or proprietary information by email and other electronic means. The Company collaborates with clients, vendors and other third parties to develop secure transmission capabilities and protect against cyber-attacks. However, BlackRock or such third parties may not have all appropriate controls in place to protect the confidentiality of such information. Any information security incident or cyber-attack against BlackRock or third parties with whom it is connected, including any interception, mishandling or misuse of personal, confidential or proprietary information, could result in material financial loss, loss of competitive position, regulatory fines and/or sanctions, breach of client contracts, reputational harm or legal liability, which, in turn, may cause BlackRock’s AUM, revenue and earnings to decline. In addition, BlackRock’s cybersecurity insurance may not cover all losses and damages from such events and BlackRock’s ability to maintain or obtain sufficient insurance coverage in the future may be limited. Failure or unavailability of third-party dependencies may adversely affect Aladdin operations, which could cause reputational harm, lead to a loss of clients and impede BlackRock’s productivity and growth. BlackRock must maintain effective infrastructure, including a robust and secure technological framework, in order to maximize the benefit of the Aladdin platform. In so doing, it relies in part on certain third-party service providers, including for cloud hosting and technologies supporting cloud-based operations. For example, Aladdin’s data architecture depends on third-party providers of technology solutions, including the ability of such parties to scale and perform in response to Aladdin’s growth. In addition, the analytical capabilities of Aladdin depend on the ability of a number of third parties to provide data and other information as inputs into Aladdin’s analytical calculations. Although BlackRock has implemented internal controls and procedures and maintains a robust vendor management program designed to perform diligence and monitor third parties that support the Aladdin platform, there can be no assurance that these measures will prove effective. Any failure by third parties to maintain infrastructure that is commensurate with Aladdin’s size and growth, or provide the data or information required to support its varying capabilities, could compromise Aladdin’s resilience, result in operational difficulties, cause reputational harm and adversely impact BlackRock’s ability to provide services to its investment advisory and Aladdin clients. 23 Continuing enhancements to Aladdin’s capabilities, as well as the expansion of the Aladdin platform into new markets and geographies, have led to significant growth in Aladdin’s processing scale, which may expose BlackRock to reputational harm, increased regulatory scrutiny and heightened operational, data management, cyber- and information-security risks. The operation of BlackRock’s Aladdin platform routinely involves updating existing capabilities, configuration change management, developing, testing and rolling out new functionalities and expanding coverage into new markets and geographies, including in connection with inorganic transactions or to address client or regulatory requirements. These updates and expansion initiatives, which have led to significant growth in Aladdin’s processing scale, frequently occur on accelerated time frames and may expose BlackRock to additional cyber- and information-security risks, as well as increased execution, operational and data management risks. If BlackRock is unable to manage the pace of, or provide the operational resiliency and stability for, the expansion of Aladdin and associated growth of its processing scale, BlackRock may experience client attrition, reduced business, increased costs, reputational harm or regulatory fines and/or sanctions, which may cause BlackRock’s AUM, revenue and earnings to decline. In addition, the highly regulated business activities of many Aladdin clients may expose BlackRock to heightened regulatory scrutiny. For example, the changing political and regulatory environment in certain jurisdictions in which Aladdin clients are based has required BlackRock to open new data centers in those jurisdictions in order to host client data in the client’s home location. Operating new data centers in foreign jurisdictions may expose BlackRock to increased operational complexity, as well as additional regulatory risks associated with the compliance requirements of such jurisdictions. In addition, there has been increased regulatory scrutiny globally on technology and information providers, which may impact Aladdin. Failure to maintain adequate corporate and contingent liquidity may cause BlackRock’s AUM, liquidity and earnings to decline, as well as harm its prospects for growth. BlackRock’s ability to meet anticipated cash needs depends upon a number of factors, including its creditworthiness and ability to generate operating cash flows. In addition, while BlackRock, Inc. is not subject to regulatory capital or liquidity requirements, certain of its subsidiaries are subject to regulatory capital and liquidity frameworks as well as certain other prudential requirements and standards, which require them to maintain certain levels of capital and liquidity. Failure to maintain adequate liquidity could lead to unanticipated costs and force BlackRock to revise existing strategic and business initiatives. BlackRock’s access to equity and debt markets and its ability to issue public or private debt, or secure lines of credit or commercial paper back-up lines, on reasonable terms may be limited by adverse market conditions, a reduction in its long- or short-term credit ratings, or changes in government regulations, including tax and interest rates. Failure to obtain funds and/or financing, or any adverse change to the cost of obtaining such funds and/or financing, may cause BlackRock’s AUM, liquidity and earnings to decline, curtail its operations and limit or impede its prospects for growth. Operating risks associated with BlackRock’s securities lending program may result in client losses. BlackRock lends securities to banks and broker-dealers on behalf of certain of its clients. In these securities lending transactions, the borrower is required to provide and maintain collateral at or above regulatory minimums. Securities on loan are marked to market daily to determine if the borrower is required to pledge additional collateral. BlackRock must manage this process and is charged with mitigating the associated operational risks. The failure of BlackRock’s controls to mitigate such operational risks could result in financial losses for the Company’s clients that participate in its securities lending programs (separate from any losses related to the risks of collateral investments), and BlackRock may be held liable for any failure to manage such risks. Inorganic transactions may harm the Company’s competitive or financial position if they are not successful. BlackRock employs a variety of organic and inorganic strategies intended to enhance earnings, increase product offerings, deliver whole-portfolio solutions, access new clients, leverage advances in technology and expand into new geographies. Inorganic strategies have included hiring smaller-sized investment teams, making minority investments in early- to mid-stage technological and other ventures, entering into strategic joint ventures and acquiring investment management and technology businesses, analytics, models and other intellectual property. Inorganic transactions involve a number of financial, accounting, tax, regulatory, geographical and operational challenges and uncertainties, including in some cases, the assumption of pre-existing liabilities, which must be managed in order for BlackRock to realize the benefit of such transactions, and such transactions may be the subject of unanticipated liabilities arising from commercial disputes, information security vulnerabilities or breaches and intellectual property or other legal claims. The success of BlackRock’s inorganic strategy also depends in large part on its ability to integrate the workforce, operations, strategies, technologies and other components of a target business following the completion of an acquisition. BlackRock may be required to commit significant management time, as well as create new, or grow existing, operational and support functions, to facilitate the integration of acquired businesses, manage combined future growth and maintain a cohesive corporate culture. There can be no assurance that BlackRock will be able to successfully integrate acquired businesses, retain associated talent, scale support functions or realize other intended benefits of its inorganic strategy. Moreover, the challenges associated with BlackRock’s inorganic strategy may be heightened when inorganic transactions are in new geographic locations, involve new markets, products, business lines or early stage investments or are delivered via technology and systems that differ from those employed by BlackRock. In addition, in the case of minority investments and joint ventures, BlackRock may be subject to risks due to reputational harm, liability or loss resulting from, or relating to operating systems, risk management controls, and employees that are outside of BlackRock’s control, as well as risks related to the jurisdictions or markets in which such investees or joint ventures operate. For example, BlackRock has a minority investment in Circle Internet Financial (“Circle”), which is associated with crypto asset markets that recently experienced substantial volatility and high-profile enterprise failures and bankruptcies. The crypto asset markets are subject to significant regulatory uncertainty, which could also negatively impact BlackRock’s investment in Circle. Any failure to identify and mitigate the risks associated with acquisitions, joint ventures or minority investments through due diligence, governance or oversight rights, indemnification provisions and/or operational expertise, or to manage the integration of acquisitions effectively, could result in losses or impairments related to such transactions and have an adverse effect on BlackRock’s reputation or cause its AUM, revenue and earnings to decline, which may harm the Company’s competitive position in the investment management industry. BlackRock's alternatives products include investments in early-stage companies, private equity portfolio companies and real assets, such as real estate, infrastructure and energy assets, which may expose BlackRock and its funds and accounts to new or increased risks and liabilities, as well as reputational harm. BlackRock’s alternatives products include investments in early-stage companies, private equity portfolio companies and real assets, including real estate, infrastructure and energy assets, that may expose BlackRock and its funds and accounts to increased risks and liabilities that are inherent in the ownership and management of such investments and portfolio companies. These may include: 24 •risks related to the potential illiquidity, valuation and disposition of such investments; •risks related to emerging and less established companies that have, among other things, short operating histories, new technologies and products, nascent control functions, quickly evolving markets and limited financial resources; •construction risks, including as a result of force majeure, labor disputes or work stoppages, shortages of material or interruptions to the availability of necessary equipment; •accidents, pandemics, health crises or catastrophic events, such as explosions, fires or terrorist activity beyond BlackRock’s control; •climate-related risks, including greater frequency or intensity of adverse weather and natural disasters; •personal injury or property damage; •failures on the part of third-party managers or sub-contractors appointed in connection with investments or projects to adequately perform their contractual duties or operate in accordance with applicable laws; •exposure to stringent and complex foreign, federal, state and local laws, ordinances and regulations, including those related to financial crime, permits, government contracting, conservation, exploration and production, tenancy, occupational health and safety, foreign investment and environmental protection; •environmental hazards, such as natural gas leaks, product and waste spills, pipeline and tank ruptures, and unauthorized discharges of products, wastes and other pollutants; •changes to the supply and demand for properties and/or tenancies or fluctuations in the price of commodities; •risks related to the availability, cost, coverage and other limitations on insurance; •the financial resources of tenants; and •contingent liabilities on disposition of investments. The above risks may expose BlackRock’s funds and accounts to additional expenses and liabilities, including costs associated with delays or remediation, and increased legal or regulatory costs, all of which could impact the returns earned by BlackRock’s clients. These risks could also result in direct liability for BlackRock by exposing BlackRock to losses, regulatory sanctions or litigation, including claims for compensatory or punitive damages. Similarly, market conditions may change during the course of developments or projects in which BlackRock invests that make such development or project less attractive than at the time it was commenced and potentially harm the investment returns of BlackRock’s clients. The occurrence of any such events may expose BlackRock to reputational harm, divert management’s attention away from BlackRock’s other business activities or cause its AUM, revenue and earnings to decline. Operating in international markets increases BlackRock’s operational, political, regulatory and other risks. As a result of BlackRock’s extensive international operations, the Company faces associated operational, regulatory, reputational, political and foreign exchange rate risks, many of which are outside of the Company’s control. Operating outside the US may also expose BlackRock to increased compliance risks, as well as higher costs to comply with US and non-US anti-corruption, anti-money laundering and sanctions laws and regulations. Similarly, certain jurisdictions in which BlackRock operates may not have comparable levels of protection for corporate assets, such as intellectual property, and client information and records, as the US. As a result, there may also be heightened information security or privacy risks in those jurisdictions. Any theft of data, technology or intellectual property may negatively impact BlackRock’s business operations and reputation. The failure of the Company’s systems of internal control to mitigate such risks, or of its operating infrastructure to support its global activities, could result in operational failures and regulatory fines and/or sanctions, which may cause the Company’s AUM, revenue and earnings to decline. RISKS RELATED TO HUMAN CAPITAL The potential for human error in connection with BlackRock’s operational systems could disrupt operations, cause losses, lead to regulatory fines or damage the Company’s reputation and may cause BlackRock’s AUM, revenue and earnings to decline. Many of BlackRock’s operations are highly complex and are dependent on the Company’s ability to process and monitor a large number of transactions, many of which occur across numerous markets and currencies at high volumes and frequencies. Although BlackRock expends considerable resources on systemic controls, supervision, technology and training in an effort to ensure that such transactions do not violate client guidelines and applicable rules and regulations or adversely affect clients, counterparties or the Company, BlackRock’s operations are dependent on its employees. From time-to-time, employees make mistakes that are not always immediately detected by systems, controls, policies and procedures intended to prevent and detect such errors. These can include calculation errors, errors in software implementation or development, failure to ensure data security, follow processes, patch systems or report issues, or errors in judgment. Such risks may be exacerbated in times of increased market volatility, high trading volumes or workforce turnover. Human errors, even if promptly discovered and remediated, may disrupt operations or result in regulatory fines and/or sanctions, breach of client contracts, reputational harm or legal liability, which, in turn, may cause BlackRock’s AUM, revenue and earnings to decline. Fraud, the circumvention of controls or the violation of risk management and workplace policies could have an adverse effect on BlackRock’s reputation, which may cause the Company’s AUM, revenue and earnings to decline. BlackRock seeks to foster a positive workplace culture, has adopted a comprehensive risk management process and continues to enhance various controls, procedures, policies and systems to monitor and manage risks. Notwithstanding these measures, BlackRock cannot ensure that its workplace culture or such controls, procedures, policies and systems will successfully identify and manage internal and external risks and BlackRock employees have in the past engaged in improper conduct. In addition, BlackRock is subject to the risk that its employees, contractors or other third parties may in the future deliberately or recklessly seek to circumvent established controls to commit fraud, pay or solicit bribes or otherwise act in ways that are inconsistent with the Company’s controls, policies, procedures, workplace culture or principles. This risk may be heightened as BlackRock expands into new markets and increases the breadth of its business offerings and remote and alternative work models, all of which introduce additional complexity to its risk management program. Persistent attempts to circumvent policies and controls or repeated incidents involving fraud, conflicts of interests or transgressions of policies and controls could have an adverse effect on BlackRock’s reputation, cause adverse publicity, and result in litigation, regulatory inquiries, fines and/or sanctions, which may cause the Company’s AUM, revenue and earnings to decline. 25 The failure to recruit, train and retain employees and develop and implement effective executive succession could lead to the loss of clients and may cause AUM, revenue and earnings to decline. BlackRock’s success is largely dependent on the talents and efforts of its highly skilled workforce and the Company’s ability to plan for the future long-term growth of the business by identifying and developing those employees who can ultimately transition into key roles within BlackRock. The global market for qualified fund managers, investment analysts, technology and risk specialists and other professionals is highly competitive, and factors that affect BlackRock’s ability to attract, train and retain highly qualified and diverse employees include the Company’s reputation and workplace culture, the immigration and public health policies in the jurisdictions in which BlackRock has offices, its approach to remote and alternative work models, the compensation and benefits it provides, and its commitment to effectively managing executive succession, including the development and training of qualified individuals. In addition, a percentage of the deferred compensation that BlackRock pays to certain of its employees is tied to the Company’s share price. As such, decreases in BlackRock’s share price could impair the retention value of such deferred compensation. There can be no assurance that the Company will continue to be successful in its efforts to recruit and retain employees and effectively manage executive succession. If BlackRock is unable to offer competitive compensation or otherwise attract and retain talented individuals, or if it fails to effectively manage executive succession, the Company’s ability to compete effectively and retain its existing clients may be materially impacted. RISKS RELATED TO KEY THIRD-PARTY RELATIONSHIPS The impairment or failure of third parties may negatively impact the performance of products and accounts that BlackRock manages, which may cause BlackRock’s AUM, revenue and earnings to decline. BlackRock’s investment management activities expose the products and accounts it manages for its clients to many different industries and counterparties, including distributors, brokers and dealers, commercial and investment banks, clearing organizations, mutual and hedge funds, and other institutional clients. Transactions with counterparties expose BlackRock’s clients to credit risk in the event the applicable counterparty defaults. Although BlackRock regularly assesses risks posed by its counterparties, such counterparties may be subject to sudden swings in the financial and credit markets that may impair their ability to perform or they may fail to meet their obligations. Counterparties may also experience lapses in their internal controls or risk management systems or expose BlackRock and/or its clients to losses on account of employee malfeasance, negligence or human error. In addition, the concentration of certain financial institutions that BlackRock uses to facilitate securities and derivatives transactions for its clients, including clearing organizations, exchanges and central agents, increases the risk that a technical or operational issue at, or default by, one such institution could introduce operational issues or delays impacting multiple BlackRock clients. Any such operational issue, impairment or failure could negatively impact the performance of products or accounts that BlackRock manages for its clients, which may lead to client attrition and, in turn, cause BlackRock’s AUM, revenue and earnings to decline. The failure of key third-party providers to BlackRock to fulfill their obligations or a failure by BlackRock to maintain its relationships with key third-party providers could have a material adverse effect on BlackRock’s growth, reputation or business, which may cause the Company’s AUM, revenue and earnings to decline. BlackRock depends on a number of key third-party providers for various fund administration, accounting, custody, market and ESG data, market indices, insurance, technology, cloud hosting and transfer agent roles and other distribution and operational needs. Further, BlackRock relies upon a relatively concentrated group of third-party index providers to deliver services that are integral to its clients’ investment decisions. The index provider industry is characterized by large vendors and the use of long-term contracts remains the market standard. This industry structure may limit BlackRock’s ability to renegotiate its index provider contracts on favorable terms or at all. While BlackRock performs focused diligence on its vendors in an effort to ensure they operate in accordance with expectations, to the extent any significant deficiencies are uncovered, there may be few, or no, alternative vendors available. In addition, BlackRock’s operations and processes rely on commercially available data provided by third parties as well as providers of services, including technology services, and operating errors, process failures or failures to comply with data usage requirements with respect to these service providers may adversely impact BlackRock. Data providers commonly disclaim the accuracy and completeness of data and BlackRock does not have the ability to validate or verify the accuracy and completeness of commercially sourced datasets. Moreover, in situations where BlackRock has limited access to alternative vendors, or where the nature of BlackRock’s arrangement with a vendor requires a long term-commitment, BlackRock may be dependent on such vendor for continuous operational reliability and may be unable to avoid incurring costs if such vendor introduces required upgrades to its services. BlackRock may from time to time transfer key contracts from one third-party provider to another. Key contract transfers may be costly and complex and expose BlackRock to heightened operational risks. Any failure to mitigate such risks could result in reputational harm, as well as financial losses to BlackRock and its clients. The failure or inability of BlackRock to diversify its sources for key services or the failure of any key third-party provider to fulfill its obligations could result in activities inconsistent with clients’ investment management or other agreements, have an adverse financial impact on BlackRock products or lead to operational, legal and regulatory issues for the Company, which could result in reputational harm or legal liability, fines and/or sanctions and may cause BlackRock’s AUM, revenue and earnings to decline. Any disruption to the Company’s distribution channels may cause BlackRock’s AUM, revenue and earnings to decline. BlackRock relies on a number of third parties to provide distribution, portfolio administration and servicing for certain BlackRock investment management products and services through their various distribution channels. BlackRock’s ability to maintain strong relationships with its distributors may impact the Company’s future performance, and its relationships with distributors are subject to periodic renegotiation that may result in increased distribution costs and/or reductions in the amount of BlackRock products and services being marketed or distributed. Moreover, new fiduciary regulations could lead to significant shifts in distributors' business models and more limited product offerings, potentially resulting in reduced distribution and/or marketing of certain of the Company’s products and services and fee compression. If BlackRock is unable to distribute its products and services successfully or if it is unable to replace or renew existing distribution arrangements, BlackRock’s AUM, revenue and earnings may decline. In addition, improper activities, as well as inadequate anti-money laundering diligence conducted by third-party distributors, could create reputational and regulatory harm to BlackRock. Key technology partnerships may expose BlackRock to increased regulatory oversight, as well as migration, execution, technology and operational risks. In April 2020, BlackRock announced a strategic partnership to host Aladdin infrastructure on the Microsoft Azure cloud and commenced a multi-year plan to migrate the Aladdin environments for BlackRock and its external Aladdin clients to the cloud. In addition, BlackRock has also migrated certain systems that support its corporate functions to cloud-based platforms. The benefits of cloud-based platforms are significant and BlackRock has adopted a robust risk-based approach to its migration strategies; however these partnerships also introduce new risks, 26 including: (1) risks associated with relying on third-parties for aspects of infrastructure reliability and stability; (2) software and information security risks arising from the use of cloud technology; (3) operational and execution risks, including those related to migration; and (4) risks related to increased regulatory oversight and new compliance obligations, which risks may be further exacerbated as BlackRock and the Aladdin platform continue to grow. Any failure by BlackRock to manage these risks, and/or risks associated with future potential technology partnerships, may result in escalating costs, financial loss, client dissatisfaction or attrition, regulatory fines and/or sanctions, reputational harm or legal liability, which, in turn, may cause BlackRock’s AUM, revenue and earnings to decline. Disruption to the operations of third parties whose functions are integral to BlackRock’s exchange-traded fund (“ETF”) platform may adversely affect the prices at which ETFs trade, particularly during periods of market volatility. BlackRock is the largest provider of ETFs globally. Shares of ETFs trade on stock exchanges at prices at, above or below the ETF’s most recent net asset value (“NAV”). The NAV of an ETF is calculated at the end of each business day and fluctuates with changes in the market value of the ETF’s holdings. The trading price of the ETF’s shares fluctuates continuously throughout trading hours. The creation/redemption feature and arbitrage mechanism of an ETF are designed to make it more likely that the ETF’s shares normally will trade at prices close to the NAV. Notwithstanding these features, exchange prices have in the past deviated measurably from the NAV of certain ETFs and may under certain circumstances do so in the future. ETF market prices are subject to numerous potential risks, including trading halts invoked by a stock exchange, and the inability or unwillingness of market makers, authorized participants, settlement systems or other market participants to perform functions necessary for an ETF’s arbitrage mechanism to function effectively. These risks may be heightened as a result of significant market volatility, the growth of the ETF industry combined with increased market activity, as well as the complexity associated with certain products. Moreover, if market events lead to incidences where ETFs trade at prices that deviate meaningfully from an ETF’s NAV, or trading halts are invoked by the relevant stock exchange or market, investors may lose confidence in ETF products and redeem their holdings, which may cause BlackRock’s AUM, revenue and earnings to decline. LEGAL, REGULATORY AND REPUTATIONAL RISKS BlackRock is subject to extensive regulation around the world, which increases its cost of doing business. BlackRock’s business is subject to extensive regulation around the world. These regulations subject BlackRock’s business activities to an array of increasingly detailed operational requirements, compliance with which is costly and complex. In addition, many of BlackRock’s legal entities are subject to laws and regulations aimed at preventing corruption, money laundering, inappropriate employment practices, illegal payments and engaging in business activities with certain individuals, countries or groups, including but not limited to the US Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, the USA PATRIOT Act, the Bank Secrecy Act, the EU Anti-Money Laundering Directives, the Money Laundering, Terrorist Financing and Transfer of Funds Regulations 2017, the UK Bribery Act, sanctions imposed by the US Treasury’s Office of Foreign Assets Control, the United Nations and the EU and its member states, as well as those imposed by other countries in which BlackRock operates, such as His Majesty’s Treasury’s (“HMT”) Office of Financial Sanctions Implementation. BlackRock is also subject to certain risk retention rules and regulation, as well as regulatory capital requirements, which require the Company to maintain capital to support certain of its businesses. Furthermore, many jurisdictions in which BlackRock operates have laws and regulations relating to data privacy, cybersecurity and protection of personal information, including the GDPR and UK GDPR, which expand data protection rules for individuals within the European Economic Area (“EEA”) and UK, respectively, and for personal data exported outside the EEA and UK. BlackRock is additionally subject to scrutiny from various government agencies that focus on antitrust and competition laws and regulations within the US and internationally, including in connection with merger control proceedings and proposed investments. Any determination of a failure to comply with any such laws or regulations could result in fines and/or sanctions against the Company, as well as reputational harm. Moreover, to the extent that these laws and regulations become more stringent, or if BlackRock is required to hold increased levels of capital to support its businesses, the Company’s financial performance or plans for growth may be adversely impacted. BlackRock may also be adversely affected by a failure to comply with existing laws and regulations or by changes in the interpretation or enforcement of such laws and regulations, including those discussed above. Challenges associated with interpreting regulations issued in numerous countries in a globally consistent manner may add to such risks if regulators in different jurisdictions have inconsistent views or provide only limited regulatory guidance. In particular, violation of applicable laws or regulations could result in fines and/or sanctions, temporary or permanent prohibition of certain activities, reputational harm and related client terminations, suspensions of employees or revocation of their licenses, suspension or termination of investment adviser, broker-dealer or other registrations, or suspension or termination of BTC’s bank charter or other sanctions, which could have a material adverse effect on BlackRock’s reputation or business and may cause the Company’s AUM, revenue and earnings to decline. For a more extensive discussion of the laws, regulations and regulators to which BlackRock is subject and regulated by, see Item 1, Business – Regulation. New regulations informed by global standard setters and/or developed by various national authorities may expose BlackRock to increasing regulatory scrutiny and compliance costs in the jurisdictions in which it operates. Policymaking workstreams focused on the financial services sector led by global standard setters, such as the Financial Stability Board (“FSB”), International Organization of Securities Commissions (“IOSCO”) and Bank for International Settlements, may lead to or inform new regulations in multiple jurisdictions in which BlackRock operates. Most recently, such workstreams have focused on areas such as products and activities of non-bank financial institutions, money market funds (“MMFs”), open-ended funds (“OEFs”), central counterparty margin practices and enhanced ESG disclosures. BlackRock is, and may become, subject to increasing regulation in these areas, see Item 1, Business – Regulation, including: •Macroprudential Policies for Asset Managers: Concerns about liquidity and leverage risks in the asset management industry and wider market-based finance sector have been heightened since the COVID-19 pandemic and reinforced by the recent Liquidity Driven Investment events in the UK. Such events have prompted a broad review of existing regulations globally, including an assessment of the adequacy of certain structural market components in mitigating risks by the FSB, IOSCO, the US Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”) and the Financial Stability Oversight Council (“FSOC”). In November 2022, the SEC proposed, among other things, amendments to the rules governing OEF liquidity risk management and swing pricing. The EU has also proposed reforms to increase the availability of liquidity management tools to OEFs, enhance reporting on the use of liquidity management tools by OEFs to national regulators and allow such regulators to require OEF managers to activate liquidity management tools in extreme market conditions. If any of these regulatory or policy actions result in broad application of macroprudential tools to OEFs or require BlackRock to make changes to 27 structural features of certain OEFs, it could limit BlackRock’s ability to offer products to certain clients and/or result in clients altering their investment strategies or allocations in a manner that is adverse to BlackRock. •Global MMF Reforms: Following the market events of March 2020, US, EU and UK authorities initiated a review of existing regulatory frameworks with the aim of improving the resilience of MMFs in market downturns. The ongoing review of the EU Money Market Fund Regulation could result in significant changes to the rules around liquidity and how some MMFs price shares. The UK may materially depart from the EU approach as the UK develops its own legal and regulatory framework for MMFs domiciled or marketed in the UK. In the US, the SEC proposed changes to Rule 2a-7, the primary rule under the Investment Company Act of 1940 governing MMFs, including changes to required liquidity levels and certain operational aspects of such funds, and changes in pricing under certain circumstances. Such regulatory reforms, if adopted, could significantly and adversely impact certain of BlackRock’s MMF products. •ESG and Sustainability: ESG and sustainability have been the subject of increased regulatory focus across jurisdictions. Globally, the International Sustainability Standards Board and the development of its disclosure standards may inform national regulators’ approaches on these topics. In the US, the SEC has proposed a series of rules that would require, among other things: (1) corporate issuers to make substantial climate-related disclosures in their periodic reports, including with respect to governance, risk management, business strategy, financial statement metrics and greenhouse gas (“GHG”) emissions and (2) enhanced ESG disclosures by investment companies and investment advisers in fund and adviser filings, including disclosures regarding ESG strategies and how ESG factors are considered, and GHG emissions disclosure by certain environmentally focused funds. The SEC also announced plans to propose rules to require enhanced disclosure regarding human capital management and board diversity for public issuers. It has also increased its scrutiny of disclosure and compliance issues relating to investment advisers’ and funds’ ESG strategies, policies and procedures. In addition, the US Department of Labor recently issued final rules clarifying that Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended (“ERISA”) plan fiduciaries can, but are not required to, consider the economic effects of ESG factors for purposes of investing ERISA plan assets and exercising voting rights with respect to plan investments. Some US states and/or state officials have adopted or proposed legislation or otherwise have taken official positions restricting or prohibiting state government entities from doing certain business with entities identified by the state as “boycotting” or “discriminating” against particular industries or considering ESG factors in their investment processes and proxy voting. Other states and localities may adopt similar legislation or other ESG-related laws and positions. The EU has enacted numerous regulations on ESG and sustainability, including to require sustainability-related disclosure by financial market participants; require the integration of sustainability considerations into the investment and risk management processes of asset managers and other institutional investors; and make the advice and financial product distribution process more receptive to end-investor sustainability preferences. Further rules are expected to come into force in 2023 and beyond. In addition, requirements for asset managers to report against an EU-wide taxonomy of environmentally sustainable activities took effect in 2022, with a further phase expected in 2023, and new proposed regulation to enhance sustainability reporting for EU-based corporate issuers is expected to take effect in 2024. BlackRock’s EU asset management companies and investment firms will be required to publish granular disclosures relating to the ESG characteristics of their funds and portfolios starting in 2023. The EU also proposed a draft directive in 2022 that would apply new supply chain due diligence obligations pertaining to sustainability to a wide group of global companies. Furthermore, the EU released a consultation on ESG and sustainability factors in credit ratings. The EU and the UK Financial Conduct Authority (“FCA”) are developing guidelines for the use of ESG or sustainability related terms in fund names, focused on specifying a minimum threshold of assets meeting ESG or sustainable criteria for such funds. Within the UK, the government has mandated climate-related risk reporting based on the Task Force on Climate-Related Financial Disclosures (“TCFD”) framework at UK firm and product level with first disclosures due in 2023. In addition, the FCA has proposed UK-specific sustainability regulations, including a sustainable product classification system for funds, which are expected to come into force on a staggered basis from 2023 through 2025. In Asia, policymakers in Singapore, Hong Kong and Japan issued or proposed sustainability-related regulations. For instance, requirements for asset managers to integrate climate risk considerations in investment and risk management processes, together with relevant disclosure obligations, became effective in Hong Kong and Singapore in 2022. ESG fund naming and related disclosure rules became effective in Hong Kong in 2022 and in Singapore in January 2023. Further, Singapore and Japan announced enhanced sustainability reporting requirements for corporate issuers. In 2022, Japan finalized its voluntary code of conduct for ESG data and ratings providers. Meanwhile, Australia’s securities regulator issued information on “greenwashing”, and the Australian government is seeking input on the design and implementation of a climate-related financial disclosure regime. As jurisdictions continue to develop legal frameworks on ESG and sustainability regulations, BlackRock faces increased fragmentation risk related to local implementation, resulting in complex and potentially conflicting compliance obligations and legal and regulatory uncertainty. •LIBOR Transition: The global transition away from LIBOR continues to progress. Tenors of non-USD LIBOR ceased to be published at the end of 2021 while publication of most USD LIBOR settings is expected to continue through June 2023. In March 2022, the Adjustable Interest Rate (LIBOR) Act (the “LIBOR Act”) was signed into law, establishing a framework for the replacement of LIBOR as a benchmark in US law contracts that reference certain tenors of USD LIBOR and do not provide for a clearly defined and practicable benchmark replacement rate following the cessation of publication. In July 2022, the Federal Reserve Board solicited public comment on proposed LIBOR transition regulations implementing the LIBOR Act. Other global regulatory authorities such as the FCA have issued consultations regarding the wind-down of LIBOR. If such proposals are not finalized, parties to unremediated contracts, and the markets more generally, face the potential for uncertainty, disputes, litigation and market disruption. Global regulatory reforms could require BlackRock to alter its future business or operating activities, which could be time-consuming and costly, increase regulatory compliance costs, result in litigation, impede the Company’s growth and cause its AUM, revenue and earnings to decline. Regulatory reform may also impact BlackRock’s clients, which could cause them to change their investment strategies or allocations in manners that may be adverse to BlackRock. Regulatory reforms in the US expose BlackRock to increasing regulatory scrutiny, as well as regulatory uncertainty. In recent years, a number of regulatory reforms have been proposed or fully or partially implemented in the US, and the level of regulatory scrutiny to which BlackRock is subject has increased. These risks have been heightened as the pace of regulatory rulemaking has intensified. BlackRock, as well as its clients, vendors and distributors, have expended resources and altered certain of their business or operating activities to prepare for, address and meet the requirements that such regulatory reforms impose. While BlackRock is, and may become, subject to numerous reform initiatives in the US, see Item 1, Business – Regulation, key regulatory reforms that may impact the Company include: 28 •Antitrust Rules and Guidance: In 2020, the FTC proposed certain changes to rules enacted under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976 (“HSR”) that require parties to certain transactions to provide the FTC and the Antitrust Division of the Department of Justice (the “DOJ”) prior notice and observe a waiting period before consummation of such transactions. The proposals would: (1) require that investors aggregate holdings in an issuer across all associated funds when assessing HSR filing and exemption thresholds and (2) create a new exemption for acquisitions resulting in aggregate holdings of up to 10% of an issuer, which would be unavailable to investors holding interests of more than 1% in competing firms. If enacted as drafted, the proposed aggregation requirement could, absent applicable exemptions, substantially increase BlackRock’s pre-merger notification obligations, which may be costly, impair funds’ ability to trade freely creating significant tracking error and cash drag for index funds and opportunity costs for actively managed funds, require implementation of monitoring tools and introduce additional compliance burdens for both BlackRock and the companies in which it invests. In instances where filing a pre-merger notification is not practicable, the proposed changes may serve to limit the size of BlackRock’s aggregate position in certain issuers if BlackRock is unable to satisfy the revised regulatory requirements. In 2021, the FTC voted to withdraw its approval of the Vertical Merger Guidelines, previously issued jointly with the DOJ. In 2022 the FTC and DOJ jointly released a request for public comment on modernizing the agencies’ approach to the merger guidelines, including whether to dispense with the guidelines’ traditional distinction between the treatment of horizontal and vertical mergers. Such changes could have an effect on the ability of the Company to expand its services through strategic investments or acquisitions. •SEC Rulemakings for US Registered Funds and Investment Advisers: The SEC has engaged in various initiatives and reviews that seek to improve and modernize the regulatory structure governing the asset management industry and registered investment companies. For example, in October 2022, the SEC adopted rules requiring certain funds to provide tailored fund shareholder reports and proposed amendments expanding the scope of the application of the rule governing fund names, including to, among other things, fund names that include ESG or similar terms. •Designation as a Systemically Important Financial Institution (“SIFI”): The FSOC has the authority to designate nonbank financial institutions as SIFIs in the US under the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010. In July 2014, the FSOC pivoted from an entity-specific approach and indicated that it would focus on a products and activities-based approach to designation in connection with addressing potential risks in the financial system related to asset management, which was re-affirmed in December 2019 guidance. However, recent public reports and statements by FSOC members have suggested a willingness to support a repeal or amendment to certain parts of the 2019 guidance to provide the FSOC more flexibility to designate nonbank financial institutions as SIFIs. If BlackRock is designated as a SIFI, it could become subject to enhanced regulatory requirements and direct supervision by the Federal Reserve. •SEC Rules Governing Security-Based Swaps: In December 2021, the SEC proposed rules in connection with security-based swaps (“SBS”) transactions to require public reporting of large SBS positions. These rules, if adopted as proposed, may affect the types of transactions BlackRock may choose to execute in SBS or other SBS-related assets, introduce or increase costs relating to such transactions, and impact the liquidity in the SBS markets in which BlackRock transacts. •SEC Proposed Rules on Private Fund Advisers: During 2022, the SEC proposed new rules and amendments to enhance regulation of private fund advisors. These include a series of proposed amendments to Form PF for registered investment advisers that: (1) add new required disclosures, (2) require advisers to file reports within one business day for certain significant events, (3) lower the threshold for large private equity adviser reporting, (4) increase reporting obligations on large liquidity fund advisers, and (5) enhance reporting on basic information about advisers and the funds they advise. The SEC proposed additional rules that would, among other things, require registered private fund advisers to: (1) provide quarterly reports to investors of fund performance, fees and expenses, (2) obtain an annual audit for each fund and (3) distribute to investors a fairness opinion and summary of certain material business relationships with the opinion provider in connection with an adviser-led secondary transaction. The proposed rules would also prohibit private fund advisers from engaging in certain activities and practices deemed to be contrary to the public interest and investor protection, providing certain types of preferential terms for selected investors and providing any other forms of preferential treatment unless disclosed. These rules and amendments, if adopted as proposed, could significantly increase BlackRock’s reporting, disclosure and compliance obligations and create operational complexity for BlackRock’s alternatives products. •SEC Rule 15c2-11: Rule 15c2-11 governs the submission of quotes into quotation systems by broker-dealers and has historically been applied to the OTC equity markets. However, the SEC has stated that it intends to apply the rule to fixed income securities. While SEC staff issued additional no-action relief in November 2022 delaying implementation of the rule to segments of the fixed income markets until 2025, full implementation may disrupt primary and secondary market liquidity. •Proposed Rules on Regulation ATS: In January 2022, the SEC proposed amendments to Regulation ATS. The proposed rules would expand the types of systems that could fall within the definition of “exchange” and extend Regulation ATS and Regulation Systems Compliance and Integrity to systems involving US government securities trading. If enacted as proposed, these rules may impact certain functionality and tools offered by Aladdin, which may increase compliance costs for BlackRock. •Proposed US Treasury Clearing Mandate: In September 2022, the SEC proposed rules that would mandate central clearing of certain US Treasury transactions. If enacted as proposed, the rules would require many market participants, including a large number of BlackRock funds and accounts, to clear cash Treasury securities transactions and Treasury repurchase transactions through a clearing agency registered with the SEC, which could result in increased transaction costs for our clients. Regulatory reforms in the US could require BlackRock to alter its future business or operating activities, which could be time-consuming and costly, increase regulatory compliance costs, result in litigation, impede the Company’s growth and cause its AUM, revenue and earnings to decline. Regulatory reform may also impact BlackRock’s clients, which could cause them to change their investment strategies or allocations in manners that may be adverse to BlackRock. International regulatory reforms expose BlackRock and its clients to increasing regulatory scrutiny, as well as regulatory uncertainty. BlackRock’s business and operating activities are subject to increasing regulatory oversight outside of the US and the Company may be affected by several proposed or implemented reform initiatives in the EMEA and the Asia-Pacific regions, as well as volatility associated with international regulatory uncertainty. While BlackRock is, and may become, subject to numerous reform initiatives internationally, see Item 1, Business – Regulation, key reforms in these regions include: 29 European Union •EU Market Access and Outsourcing: The EU legislature continues to consider proposals amending both the Alternative Investment Fund Managers Directive (“AIFMD”) and Directive on Undertakings for Collective Investment in Transferable Securities fund frameworks. The proposed changes remain broadly consistent with the current regulatory framework but with increased notification requirements to national regulators and the European Securities and Markets Authority (“ESMA”), enhanced liquidity management requirements and new requirements for loan originating funds. There is also a proposal to require notification for instances of significant delegation of portfolio management or risk management functions to entities located outside the EU. ESMA would then be required to present market analysis and supervisory peer review every two years to the European Parliament (“EP”). These proposals and any further regulatory actions could impact delegated activities, increase compliance costs and impact products and services offered to EU clients. •Enhanced Regulatory Scrutiny of Technology Service Providers to Financial Services Firms: The EU’s Digital Operational Resilience Act (“DORA”), which focuses on direct regulation of providers and users of technology and data services, entered into force in January 2023, with the requirements expected to become applicable in January 2025. DORA will, among other things: (1) introduce additional governance, risk management, incident reporting, resilience testing and information sharing requirements to several of BlackRock’s European entities and certain Aladdin clients; and (2) subject Aladdin to broad additional oversight. In parallel with DORA, the UK has signaled its intention to provide HMT powers to designate certain third parties to the financial sector as “critical” and subject them to oversight by UK regulators. This regime is expected to build on existing UK requirements regarding firms’ operational resilience and use of technology. •Central Securities Depository Regulation: Aspects of the settlement discipline regime introduced by the Central Securities Depository Regulation came into effect in February 2022. These include rules for trade allocation and confirmation processing, along with cash penalties for failed transactions. However, the mandatory buy-in regime is delayed to June 2025. Implementation of the regime required new operational mechanisms to facilitate compliance, which may increase required resources and cost. United Kingdom •Review of Retained EU Law: Under the Financial Services and Markets Bill (the “FSM Bill”) introduced in July 2022, retained EU law relating to financial services and markets will be revoked and UK financial regulators will be delegated substantial rulemaking powers to amend and restate such retained laws. Several UK regimes are currently subject to regulatory changes as the UK considers changes to retained EU rules following the UK’s exit from the EU, including the Wholesale Markets Review of the revised Markets in Financial Instruments Directive and Markets in Financial Instruments Regulation frameworks, consumer disclosures, and the regime for non-UK-based funds that are recognized for sale into the UK, which is also currently under government review. •Overseas Fund Regime (“OFR”): The OFR, the simplified regime through which non-UK funds can register with the FCA to be marketed to UK retail investors, was enacted in February 2022 and is expected to be implemented over the next two years. The OFR will require consumer protection regimes in EU countries where BlackRock funds are domiciled to be found equivalent to the UK’s regime in order to market such funds in the UK. •Conduct Regulation: The FCA continues to focus on conduct regulation, including the implementation of the Consumer Duty by all asset management firms, including BlackRock’s UK subsidiaries. The Consumer Duty rules require firms to act to deliver good outcomes for retail customers in their manufacture and distribution of products and services, in respect of price and value, consumer understanding and consumer support. The rules are expected to come into force in July 2023. Any failure to meet the FCA’s regulatory expectations could expose BlackRock to regulatory sanctions and increased reputational risk. •Edinburgh Reforms: In December 2022, the UK announced wide-ranging reforms to financial services regulation which build on the FSM Bill, marking further potential divergence from EU regimes. Potential impacts to the asset management sector include: (1) repeal and replacement of the packaged retail and insurance based investment products (""PRIIPs"") Regulation; (2) review of the UK’s green finance strategy, including potential regulation of ESG data providers; (3) review of governance through the Senior Managers and Certification Regime; (4) repeal of EU legislation on the European Long-Term Investment Fund; (5) market infrastructure reforms; (6) reassessment of the boundary between investment advice and financial guidance; and (7) independent review of the UK investment research landscape. Asia-Pacific •Regulatory Environment in China: The Company’s operations in China are subject to a number of regulatory risks, including an evolving regulatory environment and complex data security and data transfer regulations. These factors may increase compliance risk and costs, limit the Company’s ability to source and execute new investment opportunities and lead to impairment losses on its investments. Restrictions on the transfer of the Company’s Chinese onshore data to offshore entities also may limit BlackRock’s ability to aggregate, report and monitor such data on its global platform. In addition, a number of regulators in China have jurisdiction over BlackRock’s business operations, increasing operational and regulatory engagement complexity. These risks may be further heightened by additional scrutiny by Chinese regulators of certain sectors, such as technology and other industries that might be deemed to be of national importance. International regulatory reforms could require BlackRock to alter its future business or operating activities, which could be time-consuming and costly, increase regulatory compliance costs, result in litigation, impede the Company’s growth and cause its AUM, revenue and earnings to decline. Regulatory reform may also impact BlackRock’s clients, which could cause them to change their investment strategies or allocations in manners that may be adverse to BlackRock. Legal proceedings may cause the Company’s AUM, revenue and earnings to decline. BlackRock is subject to a number of sources of potential legal liability and the Company, certain of the investment funds it manages and certain of its subsidiaries and employees have been named as defendants in various legal actions, including arbitrations, class actions and other litigation arising in connection with BlackRock’s activities. Certain of BlackRock’s subsidiaries and employees are also subject to periodic examination, special inquiries and potential proceedings by regulatory authorities, including the Securities and Exchange Commission, Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (“OCC”), Department of Labor, Commodity Futures Trading Commission, Financial Conduct Authority, Commission de Surveillance du Secteur Financial and Federal Reserve. Similarly, from time to time, BlackRock receives subpoenas or other requests for information from various US state and federal as well as non-US governmental and regulatory authorities in connection with certain industry-wide, company-specific or other investigations, proceedings or litigations. These examinations, inquiries and proceedings have in the 30 past and could in the future, if compliance failures or other violations are found, cause the relevant governmental or regulatory authority to institute proceedings and/or impose sanctions for violations. Any such action may also result in litigation by investors in BlackRock’s funds, other BlackRock clients or BlackRock’s shareholders. Such legal proceedings could harm the Company’s reputation and may cause its AUM, revenue and earnings to decline, potentially harm the investment returns of the applicable fund, or result in the Company being liable for damages. In addition, when clients retain BlackRock to manage their assets or provide them with products or services, they typically specify contractual requirements or guidelines that BlackRock must observe in the provision of its services. A failure to comply with these guidelines or requirements could expose BlackRock to lawsuits, harm its reputation or cause clients to withdraw assets or terminate contracts. Damage to BlackRock’s reputation may harm its business. BlackRock’s reputation is critical to its relationships with its clients, employees, shareholders and business partners. BlackRock’s reputation may be harmed by, among other factors, regulatory, enforcement or other governmental actions, technology or operational failures, poor investment performance, ineffective management or monitoring of key third-party relationships, ransomware or other cybersecurity incidents, privacy incidents, employee errors or misconduct, failures to manage risks or conflicts of interest, or legal actions related to BlackRock or its products and services. In addition, BlackRock’s business, scale and investments subject it to significant media coverage and increasing attention from a broad range of stakeholders. This heightened scrutiny has resulted in negative publicity and adverse actions for BlackRock and may continue to do so in the future. For example, different stakeholder groups have divergent views on ESG-related matters, including in the countries in which BlackRock operates and invests, as well as in states and localities where BlackRock serves public sector clients. This divergence has and continues to increase the risk that any perceived or actual action or lack thereof by BlackRock on such matters will be viewed differently by various stakeholders and adversely impact BlackRock’s reputation and business, including through redemptions or terminations by clients, and legal and governmental action and scrutiny. BlackRock’s global presence and investments on behalf of its clients around the world could also lead to heightened scrutiny and criticism in an increasingly fragmented geopolitical landscape. For example, BlackRock has received criticism from some stakeholders because of its operations and investments on behalf of clients in certain countries, including China. These criticisms could adversely impact BlackRock’s reputation and business. In addition, the increasing popularity of social media and non-mainstream Internet news sources may lead to faster and wider dissemination of adverse publicity or inaccurate information about BlackRock, making effective remediation more difficult. Damage to BlackRock’s reputation may impact BlackRock’s ability to attract and retain clients, employees, shareholders and business partners, which may cause its AUM, revenue and earnings to decline. A failure to effectively manage potential conflicts of interest could result in litigation or enforcement actions and/or adversely affect BlackRock’s business and reputation, which may cause BlackRock’s AUM, revenue and earnings to decline. As a global investment management firm that provides investment and technology services to a diverse range of clients, the Company must routinely address and manage conflicts of interest, as well as the perception of conflicts of interest, between itself and its clients, employees or vendors. While BlackRock has policies, controls and disclosure protocols in place to manage and address potential conflicts of interest, identifying and mitigating conflicts of interest can be complex and is the subject of increasing regulatory and media scrutiny. It is possible that actual, potential or perceived conflicts could give rise to investor or client dissatisfaction, adverse publicity, litigation or enforcement actions. In particular, BlackRock’s broad range of investment, advisory and technology offerings, and its focus on providing clients with whole portfolio solutions, may result in clients working with multiple BlackRock businesses and/or BlackRock being engaged by institutions that have a nexus to industries or jurisdictions in which BlackRock operates, which may increase the potential for actual or perceived conflicts of interest and improper information sharing. To the extent that BlackRock fails, or appears to fail, to deal appropriately with any conflict of interest, it may face adverse publicity, reputational damage, litigation, regulatory proceedings, client attrition, penalties, fines and/or sanctions, any of which may cause BlackRock’s AUM, revenue and earnings to decline. A subsidiary of BlackRock is subject to US banking regulations that may limit its business activities. BlackRock’s trust bank subsidiary, which is a national banking association chartered by the OCC, is subject to OCC regulation and capital requirements that may limit its business activities. The OCC has broad supervisory and enforcement authority over BlackRock’s trust bank. Having a subsidiary subject to banking regulation may put BlackRock at a competitive disadvantage because certain of its competitors are not subject to the limitations imposed by such regulation. The implications of complying with threshold limits and/or any failure to comply with ownership reporting requirements could result in harm to BlackRock’s reputation, impact the performance of certain BlackRock funds and may cause its AUM, revenue and earnings to decline. Of note among the various regulations to which BlackRock is subject are the extensive and increasingly stringent regulatory reporting requirements that necessitate the monitoring and reporting of issuer exposure levels (thresholds) across the holdings of managed funds and accounts and those of the Company. The specific triggers and the reporting methods that these threshold filings entail vary significantly by regulator and across jurisdictions. BlackRock continues to invest in technology, training and its employees to further enhance its monitoring and reporting functions. Despite these investments, the complexity of the various threshold reporting requirements combined with the breadth of the assets managed by the Company and high volume of securities trading have caused errors and omissions to occur in the past and pose a risk that errors or omissions may occur in the future. Any such errors may expose BlackRock to monetary penalties or other sanctions, which could have an adverse effect on BlackRock’s reputation and may cause its AUM, revenue and earnings to decline. Moreover, as BlackRock’s business grows it is becoming subject to a greater number of regulatory, industry-level or issuer-specific threshold limits that may prevent BlackRock from holding positions in certain equity securities, securities convertible into equity securities or futures contracts in excess of certain thresholds. Although BlackRock is actively engaged in regulatory, issuer-specific and structural initiatives to create additional investment capacity, threshold limits may nonetheless prevent the purchase of certain securities which may, in turn, impact the performance of certain BlackRock index funds by increasing tracking error relative to the funds’ benchmarks and impact the performance of certain BlackRock actively managed funds by preventing them from taking advantage of alpha generating opportunities. BlackRock has been the subject of commentary citing concerns about the scale of its index investing business, as well as purported competition issues relating to the common ownership theory. As a leader in the index investing and asset management industry, BlackRock has been the subject of commentary citing concerns about the growth of index investing and concentrated proxy voting power. Some commentators have argued that continued growth of index funds has the potential to impact stock market competitiveness by exacerbating stock price moves and market volatility. Some commentators, regulators and 31 lawmakers have also argued that index managers have accumulated outsized influence through the proxy voting power their clients have assigned them. Some have proposed limitations on the ability of index fund managers to vote on behalf of their clients, or that voting and engagement on certain topics should trigger changes in regulatory status. Additional commentary focuses on the common ownership theory, an academic theory stating that minority ownership of multiple companies within a single industry by the same investor leads to anticompetitive effects. This theory purports to link aggregated equity positions in certain industries with higher consumer prices and executive compensation and lower wages and employment rates, among other things. In the US, the FTC cited common ownership as a disqualifying factor in a proposed exemption from pre-merger notification rules and as a consideration underlying its consultation on rules applying to acquisitions of voting securities by investment entities. In 2021, the FTC identified common ownership as a key enforcement area and passed a resolution empowering individual commissioners to investigate shareholder conduct in connection with common ownership. In 2022, the FTC and Antitrust Division of the DOJ solicited public input on changes to their merger guidelines, including a question on whether the guidelines’ approach to common ownership is adequate. Common ownership may be given greater consideration in FTC and DOJ investigations, studies, rule proposals, policy decisions and/or the scrutiny of mergers and acquisitions. The debate on common ownership is still on the agenda of competition regulators globally, and common ownership may continue to be a consideration for the European Commission (“EC”), among others, including in the assessment of mergers and investigations. For example, EC and EP reports in 2020 suggested that more evidence was required on the impact of common ownership on competition, and a committee of the Australian House of Representatives held an inquiry in 2021 on the implications of common ownership and capital concentration on Australian companies and markets. There is substantial literature casting doubt on the assumptions, data, methodology and conclusions associated with the common ownership theory and competition regulators, including at the FTC and the UK Competition & Markets Authority, have acknowledged that the debate around the theory remains unsettled. Nevertheless, some commentators have proposed remedies, including limits on the ownership stakes of common owners that, if enacted into policy, could have a negative impact on the capital markets, as well as increase costs and limit the availability of products for investors. Such policy solutions could, in turn, adversely affect BlackRock. New tax legislation or changes to existing US and non-US tax laws, treaties and regulations or challenges to BlackRock’s historical taxation practices may adversely affect BlackRock’s effective tax rate, business and overall financial condition. BlackRock’s businesses may be directly or indirectly affected by tax legislation and regulation, or the modification of existing tax laws, by US or non-US tax authorities. In the US, the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 (""IRA"") introduced new provisions including a corporate book minimum tax and an excise tax on net stock repurchases. BlackRock does not expect the IRA to have a material impact on its consolidated financial statements. In addition, legislation at both the US federal and state level has been previously proposed to enact a financial transaction tax (“FTT”) on stocks, bonds and a broad range of financial instruments and derivative transactions. In the EU, certain Member States have also enacted similar FTTs and the EC has proposed legislation to harmonize these taxes and provide for the adoption of EU-level legislation applicable to some (but not all) EU Member States. If enacted as proposed, FTTs could have an adverse effect on BlackRock’s financial results and clients’ performance results. The Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (“OECD”) has proposed certain international tax reforms, which, among other things, would (1) shift taxing rights to the jurisdiction of the consumer and (2) establish a global minimum tax for multinational companies of 15%. In December 2022, EU member states agreed to adopt the OECD’s minimum tax rules, which are expected to begin going into effect in 2024. Several other countries, including the UK, are also considering changes to their tax law to implement the OECD’s minimum tax proposal. As a result of these developments, the tax laws of certain countries in which we do business could change, and any such changes could increase our tax liabilities. The application of tax regulations involves numerous uncertainties, and in the normal course of business US and non-US tax authorities may review and challenge tax positions adopted by BlackRock. These challenges may result in adjustments to, or impact the timing or amount of, taxable income, deductions or other tax allocations, which may adversely affect BlackRock’s effective tax rate and overall financial condition. Similarly, the Company manages assets in products and accounts that have investment objectives which may conform to tax positions adopted by BlackRock or to specific tax rules. To the extent there are changes in tax law or policy, or regulatory challenges to tax positions adopted by BlackRock, the value or attractiveness of such investments may be diminished and BlackRock may suffer financial or reputational harm. Item 1B. Unresolved Staff Comments The Company has no unresolved comments from the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) staff relating to BlackRock’s periodic or current reports filed with the SEC pursuant to the Exchange Act. Item 2. Properties BlackRock’s new principal office, which is leased, is located at 50 Hudson Yards, New York, New York, with occupancy beginning in December 2022. In addition, BlackRock continues to lease the office space for its prior principal office located at 55 East 52nd Street, New York, New York as well as 40 East 52nd Street and 49 East 52nd through April 2023 when the leases expire. BlackRock leases additional office space throughout the world, including Atlanta, Belgrade (Serbia), Budapest, Edinburgh, Gurgaon (India), Hong Kong, London, Mumbai (India), Princeton (New Jersey), San Francisco, Singapore. The Company also owns an 84,500 square foot office building in Wilmington, Delaware and a 43,000 square foot data center in Amherst, New York. Item 3.

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Overview BlackRock, Inc. (“BlackRock” or the “Company”) is one of the largest publicly traded investment management firms in the United States with $1.125 trillion of AUM at December 31, 2006. BlackRock manages assets on behalf of institutional and individual investors worldwide through a variety of fixed income, cash management, equity and alternative investment separate accounts and mutual funds. In addition, BlackRock provides risk management, investment system outsourcing and financial advisory services to institutional investors. On September 29, 2006, BlackRock and Merrill Lynch & Co., Inc. (“Merrill Lynch”) closed a transaction pursuant to which Merrill Lynch contributed its investment management business, Merrill Lynch Investment Managers (“MLIM”), to BlackRock in exchange for an aggregate of 65 million shares of newly issued BlackRock common and non-voting participating preferred stock (the “MLIM Transaction”). Immediately following the closing, Merrill Lynch owned 45% of the voting common stock and approximately 49.3% of the total capital stock on a fully diluted basis of the combined company and PNC owned approximately 34% of the total capital stock of the combined company (as compared with 69% immediately prior to the closing). Immediately prior to the MLIM Transaction, MLIM managed approximately $589.2 billion of AUM. Concurrent with the MLIM Transaction, BlackRock and Merrill Lynch entered into a global distribution agreement, which provides a framework under which Merrill Lynch provides portfolio administration and servicing of client investments in certain BlackRock products (including those of the former MLIM business). The following table summarizes BlackRock’s operating performance for the years ended December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004: BlackRock, Inc.

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Overview (continued) (a) While BlackRock reports its financial results on a GAAP basis, management believes that evaluating the Company’s ongoing operating results may not be as useful if investors are limited to reviewing only GAAP financial measures. Management reviews non-GAAP financial measures to assess ongoing operations and, for the reasons described below, considers them to be effective indicators, for both management and investors, of BlackRock’s financial performance over time. BlackRock’s management does not advocate that investors consider such non-GAAP financial measures in isolation from, or as a substitute for, financial information prepared in accordance with GAAP. Certain prior year non-GAAP data has been restated to conform to current year presentation. Operating margin, as adjusted, equals operating income, as adjusted, divided by revenue used for operating margin measurement, as indicated in the table below. Computations for all periods presented include affiliated and unaffiliated portfolio administration and servicing costs reported as a separate income statement line item and are derived from the Company's consolidated financial statements as follows: Year ended 2006 2005 2004 Operating income, GAAP basis $ 471,800 $ 340,541 $ 165,798 Non-GAAP adjustments: MLIM Transaction costs 141,932 — — PNC LTIP funding obligation 50,031 48,587 85,030 Fee sharing payment 34,450 — — Compensation expense related to deferred compensation plan asset appreciation 7,537 10,447 4,479 Merrill Lynch compensation contribution 1,848 — — SSR acquisition costs — 8,873 1,000 Trepp bonus — — 7,004 Operating income, as adjusted $ 707,598 $ 408,448 $ 263,311 Revenue, GAAP basis $ 2,097,976 $ 1,191,386 $ 725,311 Non-GAAP adjustments: Portfolio administration and servicing costs (165,364 ) (58,200 ) (42,943 ) Reimbursable property management compensation (22,618 ) (23,376 ) — Revenue used for operating margin measurement $ 1,909,994 $ 1,109,810 $ 682,368 Operating margin, GAAP basis 22.5 % 28.6 % 22.9 % Operating margin, as adjusted 37.0 % 36.8 % 38.6 % Management believes that operating income, as adjusted, and operating margin, as adjusted, are effective indicators of management's ability to, and useful to management in deciding how to, effectively employ BlackRock’s resources. As such, management believes that operating income, as adjusted, and operating margin, as adjusted, provide useful disclosure to investors. MLIM Transaction and SSR acquisition costs consist principally of certain professional fees and compensation costs related to those transactions which were reflected in GAAP net income. Also included in MLIM Transaction costs are rebranding costs. MLIM Transaction and SSR acquisition costs have been deemed non-recurring by management and have been excluded from net income, as adjusted, and diluted earnings per share, as adjusted, to help ensure the comparability of this information to prior periods. The portion of the LTIP expense associated with awards met by the distribution to participants of shares of BlackRock stock held by PNC has been excluded because, exclusive of the impact related to LTIP participants’ put options, these charges do not impact BlackRock’s book value. The 2006 fee sharing payment has been excluded because it represents a non-recurring payment (based upon a performance fee) pursuant to the SSRM Holdings, Inc. (“SSR”) acquisition agreement. Compensation expense associated with appreciation on assets related to BlackRock’s deferred compensation plans has been excluded because investment returns on these assets reported in non-operating income, net of the related impact on compensation expense, result in a nominal impact on net income. The portion of the current year compensation expense related to incentive awards to be funded by Merrill Lynch has been excluded from this charge because it is not expected to impact BlackRock’s book value. Bonus expense related to the Company’s sale of its equity interest in Trepp, LLC has been deemed to be non-recurring by management and has been excluded from operating income, as adjusted, in 2004 to help ensure the comparability of this information to subsequent reporting periods. Portfolio administration and servicing costs have been excluded from revenue used for operating margin measurement, as adjusted, because the Company receives offsetting revenue and expense for these services. Reimbursable property management compensation represents compensation and benefits paid to certain BlackRock Realty Advisors, Inc. (“Realty”) personnel. These employees are retained on Realty’s payroll when certain properties are acquired by Realty’s clients. The related compensation and benefits are fully reimbursed by Realty’s clients and have been excluded from revenue used for operating margin measurement, as adjusted, because they bear no economic cost to BlackRock. - 27 - Item 7. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Overview (continued) (b) While BlackRock reports its financial results on a GAAP basis, management believes that evaluating the Company’s ongoing operating results may not be as useful if investors are limited to reviewing only GAAP-basis financial measures. Management reviews non-GAAP financial measures to assess ongoing operations, and for the reasons described below, considers them to be effective indicators, for both management and investors, of BlackRock’s financial performance over time. BlackRock’s management does not advocate that investors consider such non-GAAP financial measures in isolation from, or as a substitute for, financial information prepared in accordance with GAAP. Year ended December 31, 2006 2005 2004 Net income, GAAP basis $ 322,602 $ 233,908 $ 143,141 Non-GAAP adjustments, net of tax: MLIM Transaction costs 89,417 — — PNC’s LTIP funding obligation 31,520 30,610 53,569 Merrill Lynch compensation contribution 1,164 — — SSR acquisition costs — 5,590 635 Impact of Trepp sale — (486 ) (1,572 ) Release of reserves related to New York State and New York City tax audits — — (18,064 ) Net income, as adjusted $ 444,703 $ 269,622 $ 177,709 Diluted weighted average shares outstanding 83,358,394 66,875,149 65,960,473 Diluted earnings per share, GAAP basis $ 3.87 $ 3.50 $ 2.17 Diluted earnings per share, as adjusted $ 5.33 $ 4.03 $ 2.69 Management believes that net income, as adjusted, and diluted earnings per share, as adjusted, are effective measurements of BlackRock’s profitability and financial performance. Professional fees, compensation costs and rebranding costs related to the SSR acquisition and the MLIM transaction reflected in GAAP net income have been deemed non-recurring by management and have been excluded from net income, as adjusted, and diluted earnings per share, as adjusted, to help ensure the comparability of this information to prior reporting periods. MLIM transaction costs consist principally of compensation costs, professional fees and rebranding costs incurred in 2006 in conjunction with the MLIM transaction. Compensation reflected in this amount represents retention payments with no future service requirement or severance payments made to certain employees as a result of the transaction. SSR acquisition costs consist of compensation costs and professional fees in 2005. Compensation reflected in this amount represents direct performance incentives paid to SSR employees assumed in conjunction with the acquisition and settled by BlackRock with no future service requirement. The portion of LTIP expense associated with awards funded by the distribution to participants of shares of BlackRock stock held by PNC has been excluded from net income, as adjusted, and diluted earnings per share, as adjusted, because, exclusive of the impact related to LTIP participants’ put options, these charges have not impacted BlackRock’s book value. The release of certain tax reserves and gains on the sale of the Company’s equity interest in Trepp, LLC reflected in GAAP net income, have been deemed non-recurring by management and have been excluded from net income, as adjusted, in 2005 and 2004 to help ensure the comparability of this information to subsequent reporting periods. (c) Series A non-voting participating preferred stock is considered to be common stock for purposes of per share calculations. - 28 - Item 7. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Overview (continued) BlackRock has portfolio managers located around the world, including the United States, the United Kingdom, The Netherlands, Japan and Australia. The Company provides a wide array of taxable and tax-exempt fixed income, equity and balanced mutual funds and separate accounts, as well as a wide assortment of index-based equity and alternative investment products to a diverse global clientele. BlackRock provides global advisory services for mutual funds and other non-U.S. equivalent retail products. The Company’s non-U.S. mutual funds are based in a number of domiciles and cover a range of asset classes, including cash management, fixed income and equities. The primary retail fund group offered outside the United States is the Merrill Lynch International Investment Funds (“MLIIF”), which is authorized for distribution in more than 30 jurisdictions worldwide. In the United States, the primary retail offerings include a wide variety of open-end and closed-end funds. Additional fund offerings include structured products, real estate funds, hedge funds, hedge funds of funds, private equity funds and funds of funds, managed futures funds and exchange funds. These products are sold to both U.S. and non-U.S. high net worth, retail and institutional investors in a wide variety of active and passive strategies covering both equity and fixed income assets. BlackRock’s client base consists of financial institutions and other corporate clients, pension funds, high net worth individuals and retail investors around the world. BlackRock maintains a significant sales and marketing presence both inside and outside the United States that is focused on acquiring and maintaining retail and institutional investment management relationships by marketing its services to retail and institutional investors directly and through financial professionals, pension consultants and establishing third-party distribution relationships. BlackRock also distributes certain of its products and services through Merrill Lynch. BlackRock derives a substantial portion of its revenue from investment advisory and administration fees, which are recognized as the services are performed. Such fees are primarily based on pre-determined percentages of the market value of AUM or, in the case of certain real estate equity separate accounts, net operating income generated by the underlying properties, and are affected by changes in AUM, including market appreciation or depreciation, foreign exchange gains or losses and net subscriptions or redemptions. Net subscriptions or redemptions represent the sum of new client assets, additional fundings from existing clients (including dividend reinvestment), withdrawals of assets from, and termination of, client accounts and purchases and redemptions of mutual fund shares. Market appreciation or depreciation includes current income earned on, and changes in the fair value of, securities held in client accounts. Investment advisory agreements for certain separate accounts and BlackRock’s alternative investment products provide for performance fees in addition to fees based on AUM. Performance fees generally are earned after a given period of time or when investment performance exceeds a contractual threshold. As such, performance fees may increase the volatility of BlackRock’s revenue and earnings. BlackRock provides a variety of risk management, investment analytic and investment system services to financial institutions, pension funds, asset managers, foundations, consultants, mutual fund sponsors, real estate investment trusts and government agencies. These services are provided under the brand name BlackRock Solutions® and include a wide array of risk management services and enterprise investment system outsourcing to clients. Fees earned for BlackRock Solutions services are based on a number of factors including pre-determined percentages of the market value of assets subject to the services and the number of individual investment accounts, or fixed fees. Fees earned on risk management, investment analytic and investment system assignments are recorded as other revenue in the consolidated statements of income. - 29 - Item 7. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Overview (continued) Operating expense primarily consists of employee compensation and benefits, portfolio administration and servicing costs, general and administration expense and amortization of intangible assets. Employee compensation and benefits expense reflects salaries, deferred and incentive compensation, BlackRock’s 2002 Long-Term Retention and Incentive Plan (“LTIP”) and related benefit costs. Portfolio administration and servicing costs reflect payments made to Merrill Lynch-affiliated entities and PNC-affiliated entities, as well as third parties, primarily associated with the administration and servicing of client investments in certain BlackRock products.

The growth in AUM was attributable to $589.2 billion acquired in the MLIM Transaction, $32.8 billion in net subscriptions, $42.4 billion in market appreciation and $7.6 billion in foreign exchange gains. Net subscriptions of $32.8 billion for the year ended December 31, 2006 were primarily attributable to net new business of $12.4 billion in cash management products, $10.7 billion in equity and balanced products, $6.8 billion in alternative products and $3.0 billion in fixed income products. Market appreciation of $42.4 billion largely reflected appreciation in equity and balanced assets of $25.3 billion, as equity markets improved during the period ended December 31, 2006 and market appreciation on fixed income products of $14.0 billion due to current income and changes in market interest rates. Foreign exchange gains of $7.6 billion consisted primarily of $5.0 billion in equity and balanced assets and $2.2 billion in fixed income assets. - 30 - Item 7.

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Operating results for the year ended December 31, 2006 as compared with the year ended December 31, 2005 (continued) Revenue (continued) Investment advisory and administration fees (continued) The increase in investment advisory base fees of $748.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2006 compared with the year ended December 31, 2005 consisted of increases of $442.4 million in equity and balanced products, $132.7 million in fixed income products, $96.3 million in cash management products and $77.1 million in alternative products. The increase in advisory fees for equity and balanced, fixed income, cash management and alternative investment products was driven by increases in AUM of $355.4 billion, $152.0 billion, $141.7 billion and $22.8 billion, respectively. The AUM growth in equity and balanced, fixed income, cash management and alternative products included assets acquired in the MLIM Transaction of $314.4 billion, $132.8 billion, $127.7 billion and $14.2 billion, respectively. Performance fees increased by $74.3 million, or 44.2%, for the year ended December 31, 2006 primarily due to fees earned on a large institutional real estate equity client account and the Company’s other alternative products. Other Revenue Other revenue of $257.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2006 primarily represented fees earned on BlackRock Solutions’ products and services of $126.4 million, property management fees of $32.1 million earned on real estate AUM (which represented direct reimbursement of the salaries of certain Realty employees) and distribution fees earned on BlackRock funds of $35.9 million. The increase in other revenue of $83.9 million, or 48.5%, for the year ended December 31, 2006 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2005 was primarily due to $24.6 million in distribution fees earned on mutual funds, increased revenues of $14.8 million from BlackRock Solutions’ products and services and $12.6 million in fund accounting services.

The increase was attributable to increases in employee compensation and benefits, portfolio administration and servicing costs, general and administration expense, a one-time fee sharing payment, and amortization of intangible assets. Integration charges related to the MLIM Transaction included $45.0 million in compensation and benefits and $96.9 million in general and administration expense. Employee Compensation and Benefits Employee compensation and benefits expense increased by $350.0 million, or 58.8%, to $945.6 million, compared to $595.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2005. The increase in employee compensation and benefits was primarily attributable to increases in salaries and benefits and incentive compensation of $193.6 million and $142.8 million, respectively. The $193.6 million, or 71.6%, increase in salaries and benefits was primarily attributable to higher staffing levels associated with business growth and the MLIM Transaction. Employees at December 31, 2006 totaled 5,113 as compared to 2,148 at December 31, 2005. The $142.8 million, or 54.0%, increase in incentive compensation is primarily attributable to growth in operating income and higher incentive compensation associated with performance fees earned on the Company’s alternative investment products and $45.0 million of integration costs. Portfolio Administration and Servicing Costs Portfolio administration and servicing costs increased $107.2 million to $165.4 million during the year ended December 31, 2006.

The increase in general and administration expense was primarily due to increases in marketing and promotional expense of $81.4 million, technology-related expense of $45.5 million, portfolio services expense of $37.6 million, occupancy expense of $27.9 million and other general and administration expense of $61.2 million. The increase in general and administration expense included $96.9 million of integration costs related to the MLIM Transaction. Marketing and promotional expense increased $81.4 million, or 135.4%, to $141.6 million, compared to $60.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2005, primarily due to increased marketing activities of $61.1 million (which included $28.2 million related to BlackRock’s rebranding campaign and $6.7 million of additional MLIM-related marketing expense) and $20.4 million of increased amortization of deferred mutual fund commissions assumed in the MLIM Transaction. Technology expenses increased $45.5 million to $68.2 million, compared to $22.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2005, primarily related to the integration of the MLIM business. Portfolio services costs increased $37.6 million to $51.7 million, related to supporting higher AUM levels and increased trading activities of the combined company. Occupancy costs for the year ended December 31, 2006 totaled $64.1 million, representing a $27.9 million increase from $36.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2005. The increase in occupancy costs during the year ended December 31, 2006 primarily reflect costs related to the expansion of corporate facilities associated with the MLIM Transaction and business growth. Other general and administration costs increased to $117.7 million from $56.5 million, and included $32.9 million in professional fees related to the MLIM Transaction. Fee Sharing Payment For the year ended December 31, 2006, BlackRock recorded a fee sharing payment of $34.5 million, representing a one-time expense related to a large institutional real estate equity client account acquired in the SSR acquisition in January 2005. Amortization of Intangible Assets The $30.0 million increase in amortization of intangible assets to $37.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2006, compared to $7.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2005, primarily reflects amortization of finite-lived intangible assets acquired in the MLIM Transaction. Non-Operating Income and Minority Interest Non-operating income increased $21.2 million, or 60.3%, to $56.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2006 as compared to $35.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2005 as a result of a $23.2 million, or 53.8%, increase in investment income, partially offset by a $2.0 million increase in interest expense related to liabilities assumed in the MLIM Transaction. The increase in investment income was primarily due to market appreciation and security gains on Company investments in 2006 and investments acquired in the MLIM Transaction. Minority interest in earnings of consolidated subsidiaries increased $12.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2006 primarily due to the increase in consolidated investments, the majority of which were acquired in the MLIM Transaction. Income Taxes Income tax expense was $189.5 million and $138.6 million, representing effective tax rates of 37.0% and 37.2%, for the years ended December 31, 2006 and 2005, respectively. - 35 - Item 7.

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Operating results for the year ended December 31, 2005 as compared with the year ended December 31, 2004 (continued) Revenue (continued) Investment advisory and administration fees The increase in investment advisory and administration fees of $384.7 million, or 60.7%, was comprised of higher advisory base fees of $258.4 million, or 43.6%, to $850.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2005, compared with $592.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2004 along with an increase in performance fees of $126.4 million. Investment advisory base fees increased in the year ended December 31, 2005 primarily due to increased AUM of $110.9 billion as a result of net new subscriptions of $50.2 billion, $50.0 billion of AUM acquired primarily in the Company’s acquisition of SSR and $10.8 billion due to market appreciation. The increase in base investment advisory fees of $258.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2005, compared with the year ended December 31, 2004, consisted of increases of $117.2 million in equity products, $75.1 million in alternative products, $58.8 million in fixed income products and $7.3 million in cash management products. The $117.2 million increase in advisory fees from equity products was primarily the result of an increase in AUM from the SSR acquisition of $17.6 billion and market appreciation of $3.3 billion. The $75.1 million increase in advisory fees from alternative products was primarily the result of an increase in AUM from the SSR acquisition of $10.6 billion and net subscriptions of $4.0 billion. The $58.8 million increase in advisory fees from fixed income products was primarily the result of an increase in AUM from net subscriptions of $37.3 billion, the SSR acquisition of $21.1 billion and market appreciation of $4.8 billion. The $7.3 million increase in advisory fees from cash management products was primarily the result of an increase in AUM from net subscriptions of $7.2 million. Performance fees increased in the year ended December 31, 2005 primarily due to fees earned on the Company’s equity hedge funds and real estate alternative products acquired in the SSR acquisition.

The increase in other revenue of $81.3 million, or 88.7%, for the year ended December 31, 2005 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2004 was primarily the result of property management fees of $32.3 million (which includes $23.4 million of direct reimbursement of the salaries of certain Realty employees), increased revenues of $31.0 million from BlackRock Solutions’ products and services driven by new assignments and distribution fees of $11.3 million earned on funds obtained in the SSR acquisition. - 38 - Item 7.

The increase was attributable to increases in compensation and benefits (other than the LTIP component of this expense, which decreased by $44.6 million), general and administration expense, portfolio administration and servicing costs and amortization of intangible assets, partially offset by a decrease in LTIP expense of $44.6 million and the recognition of an impairment of an acquired management contract of $6.1 million during the first quarter of 2004. Employee compensation and benefits Compensation and benefits expense increased by $204.5 million, or 52.3%, to $595.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2005 compared to $391.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2004. The increase in employee compensation and benefits was primarily attributable to increases in salaries and benefits and incentive compensation of $123.0 million and $122.1 million, respectively, partially offset by a $44.6 million decrease in LTIP costs, for which the Company initiated expense recognition during the third quarter of 2004. The increase of $123.0 million in salaries and benefits was primarily attributable to higher staffing levels associated with business growth and the SSR acquisition, which added 858 employees (including 511 Realty employees whose salaries are entirely reimbursed). The $122.1 million, or 85.6%, increase in incentive compensation is primarily attributable to operating income growth, additional SSR employees, higher performance fees earned on the Company’s alternative investment products and a $6.5 million acquisition-related bonus payment to continuing employees. Portfolio administration and servicing costs Portfolio administration and servicing costs increased $15.3 million, or 35.5%, during the year ended December 31, 2005 to $58.2 million, compared to $42.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2004. The rise was due to increases in shareholder servicing fees related to new closed-end funds and additional assets associated with BlackRock funds. - 39 - Item 7.

Marketing and promotional expense increased $32.9 million, or 120.8%, to $60.2 million, compared to $27.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2004 primarily due to increased marketing activities of $23.6 million associated with the Company’s institutional products and expanded international calling efforts, which included closed-end fund launch costs of $13.3 million for the year and $9.3 million in amortization of deferred mutual fund commissions assumed in the SSR acquisition. Occupancy costs for the year ended December 31, 2005 totaled $36.2 million, representing a $12.8 million, or 54.6%, increase, from $23.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2004. The increase in occupancy costs during the year ended December 31, 2005 primarily reflected costs related to occupying 85,000 square feet of additional office space in New York during the first quarter of 2005 and costs related to properties assumed in the SSR acquisition. Portfolio services costs increased by 97.0% to $14.0 million, related to supporting higher AUM levels and increased trading activities. Technology expenses increased $3.8 million, or 20.3%, to $22.7 million, compared to $18.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2004 primarily due to increased software maintenance expenses, consulting expenses and additional depreciation on assets assumed in the SSR acquisition to support business growth. Other general and administration costs increased by 35.2% to $56.5 million and included a $3.2 million increase in office-related expenses consistent with the increases in office space and number of employees and a $2.7 million increase in professional fees primarily related to the SSR integration and Sarbanes-Oxley Act and other compliance activities. Amortization of Intangible Assets The $6.6 million increase in amortization of intangible assets to $7.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2005, compared to $0.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2004, reflects amortization of finite-lived management contracts acquired in the SSR acquisition. During the first quarter 2004, in connection with the liquidation of a certain equity hedge fund, the Company recognized a $6.1 million impairment charge representing the carrying value of the fund’s acquired management contract. - 40 - Item 7. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Operating results for the year ended December 31, 2005 as compared with the year ended December 31, 2004 (continued) Non-Operating Income Non-operating income increased $0.6 million, or 1.7%, to $35.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2005 as compared to $34.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2004 as a result of a $7.7 million, or 21.6%, increase in investment income, partially offset by a $7.1 million increase in interest expense. The increase in investment income was primarily due to market appreciation and security gains on Company investments in 2005, partially offset by the Company’s $12.9 million gain on the sale of Trepp, LLC in April 2004. Borrowings used to finance the SSR acquisition resulted in $6.6 million of the increase in interest expense in 2005 as compared to 2004. Income Taxes Income tax expense was $138.6 million and $52.3 million, representing effective tax rates of 37.2% and 26.7%, for the years ended December 31, 2005 and 2004, respectively. The increase in the Company’s effective tax rate was primarily attributable to net income benefits of approximately $18.1 million in 2004 primarily associated with the resolution of an audit performed by New York State on the Company’s state income tax returns filed from 1998 through 2001. Net Income Net income totaled $233.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2005 and includes the after-tax impact of the portion of LTIP awards funded by a capital contribution of BlackRock common stock held by PNC and expenses related to the SSR acquisition, of $30.6 million and $5.6 million, respectively. SSR acquisition costs include acquisition-related bonus payments to continuing employees of BlackRock and certain professional fees. In addition, net income of $143.1 million during the year ended December 31, 2004 included the after-tax impact of the portion of LTIP awards funded by a capital contribution of common stock held by PNC of $53.6 million, New York State tax benefits and the impact of the sale of Trepp, LLC, discussed previously. Exclusive of these items, net income for the year ended December 31, 2005, as adjusted, increased $91.9 million, or 51.7%, compared to the year ended December 31, 2004. Business Outlook As fiscal 2007 began, domestic and international markets generally reflected positive economic and market performance, although they retrenched at the end of February. While management expects overall positive equity markets during 2007, that growth may be more volatile than during 2006. The timing and direction of market changes and the timing of new client asset flows will impact the timing and amount of revenue the Company recognizes. As a matter of policy, the Company does not provide earnings guidance. However, in the fourth quarter earnings release, the Company included information about the MLIM integration and an estimated range for 2007 earnings. The range was based on a number of factors, including a performance fee range of $100 to $250 million and an assumed growth in the equity markets from year-end 2006 levels. Based on current market conditions, the Company expects performance fees to be nearer the lower end of the range. The Company announced an increase in the quarterly dividend rate, effective with the March 23, 2007 payment, to $0.67 per share from $0.42 per share paid in 2006. Operating cash flows will be used to pay dividends, to invest in new products, expand the global footprint, to meet ongoing global net capital requirements, principally outside the United States, and to repay amounts under the revolving credit facility to the extent available. The Company expects to continue to utilize its revolving credit facility described below to fund U.S. activities throughout 2007 even though it will have excess cash outside the United States. - 41 - Item 7. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Liquidity and Capital Resources Sources of BlackRock’s operating cash include investment advisory and administration fees, revenues from BlackRock Solutions’ products and services, property management fees, mutual fund distribution fees and realized earnings on certain of the Company’s investments. BlackRock primarily uses its operating cash to pay compensation and benefits, portfolio administration and servicing costs, general and administration expenses, interest on the Company’s long-term debt, purchases of investments, capital expenditures and dividends on BlackRock’s stock. Management believes that the Company has sufficient access to cash through its operations and the revolving credit facility described below to fund its operations in the near term. Cash provided by the Company’s operating activities totaled $720.9 million, $254.9 million and $231.4 million for the years ended December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively. The $480.9 million increase in net cash provided by operating activities for 2006 as compared to 2005 was primarily the result of net income resulting from the MLIM Transaction and organic growth. In December 2006, the Company entered into a revolving credit agreement (the “Credit Agreement”) with a syndicate of banking institutions with an initial borrowing capacity of $600.0 million. The term of the facility is five years and interest currently accrues at the applicable London Interbank Offer Rate (“LIBOR”) plus 0.20%. The Company pays a commitment fee of 0.04% per annum on the undrawn balance. Additionally, for each day that the total amount outstanding is greater than 50% of the total commitments by all lenders, the Company pays a utilization fee of 0.05% per annum on the total amount outstanding. Financial covenants in the Credit Agreement require BlackRock to maintain a maximum debt/EBITDA ratio of 3.0 and a minimum EBITDA/interest expense ratio of 4.0. The facility is intended to fund various investment opportunities as well as BlackRock’s near-term operating cash requirements. As of December 31, 2006, the Company had no borrowings outstanding under this facility. In February 2007, the Company exercised its ability to increase the capacity of the facility to $800.0 million. The Credit Agreement allows BlackRock to request an additional $200 million of borrowing capacity, subject to lender credit approval, up to a maximum of $1 billion. During January and February 2007, the Company borrowed $540.0 million against this facility for general corporate purposes. The term for the outstanding debt is one month and as of February 28, 2007 accrues interest at a rate of 5.52%. Borrowings outstanding at February 28, 2007 are due March 13, 2007 and the Company has provided notice that it will continue $450 million of such borrowings. BlackRock granted awards in 2002 and 2003 under its LTIP of approximately $230 million, of which approximately $210 million were paid in January 2007. The awards were payable approximately 16.7% in cash and the remainder in BlackRock stock contributed by PNC and distributed to LTIP participants. As permitted under the plan, employees elected to put approximately 95% of the stock portion of the awards back to the Company at a total fair market value of approximately $165.7 million. These shares have been retained as treasury stock. The Company’s Investment Committee has approved warehouse facilities totaling $350 million for the purpose of funding investments to establish funds of private equity funds. As of December 31, 2006, the Company has committed to invest $130 million in certain funds, of which approximately $11 million was funded as of December 31, 2006. In addition, the Company has various capital commitments to fund other companies or investment funds in which it has an ownership stake. Generally, the timing of the funding of these commitments is uncertain. As of December 31, 2006, these unfunded commitments totaled approximately $210.0 million. - 42 - Item 7. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Liquidity and Capital Resources (continued) Net cash used in investing activities was $219.8 million during the year ended December 31, 2005 and net cash provided by investing activities was $3.6 and $7.0 million for the years ended December 31, 2006 and 2004, respectively. During the year ended December 31, 2006, net cash provided by investing activities primarily consisted of $272.4 million in net cash acquired in the MLIM Transaction and other acquisitions, partially offset by $212.6 million in purchases of investments and $84.0 million of capital expenditures primarily related to MLIM integration activities. During the year ended December 31, 2005, net cash used in investing activities consisted primarily of $275.2 million in cash consideration paid in the SSR acquisition and $55.2 million in capital expenditures primarily representing build-out costs associated with additional office space in New York and purchases of $51.6 million in investments, which was partially offset by the sale of real estate held for sale for $112.2 million. Net cash used in financing activities was $84.9 million, $4.3 million and $99.6 million for the years ended December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively. During the year ended December 31, 2006, net cash used in financing activities primarily represented the payment of $135.7 million in dividends and common stock repurchases of $30.9 million. Partially offsetting these cash outflows was $72.6 million in net subscriptions received from minority interest holders in consolidated investments. In January 2004, BlackRock’s Board of Directors approved a two million share repurchase program. The Company repurchased all remaining 180,825 shares under the program in open market transactions for approximately $72.0 million during the seven months ended July 31, 2006. On August 2, 2006, BlackRock announced that its Board had authorized a new program to purchase an additional 2.1 million shares. Pursuant to this repurchase program, BlackRock may make repurchases from time to time, as market conditions warrant, in the open market or in privately negotiated transactions at the discretion of management. The Company made no repurchases of shares under the new program during the year ended December 31, 2006. At December 31, 2006, long-term debt, including current maturities, was $253.2 million. Debt service requirements are $6.9 million in 2007, $6.8 million in 2008 and $6.7 million in 2009 and 2010. Approximately $90.9 million in cash and cash equivalents included in the Company’s 2006 consolidated statement of financial condition is held by products that are consolidated in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States (“GAAP”). As such, the Company may not be able to access such cash to use in its operating activities. In addition, approximately $1.5 billion of investments included in the Company’s consolidated statement of financial condition at December 31, 2006 are held by products that are consolidated in accordance with GAAP. The Company may not be readily able to sell such investments in order to obtain cash for use in its operations. The Company is required to maintain net capital in certain international jurisdictions, which is met in part by retaining cash and cash equivalent investments in those jurisdictions. As a result, the Company may be restricted in its ability to transfer cash between different jurisdictions. Additionally, transfer of cash between international jurisdictions, including repatriation to the United States, may have adverse tax consequences that could discourage such transfers. At December 31, 2006, the Company was required to maintain approximately $344.3 million in net capital at these subsidiaries and is in compliance with all regulatory minimum net capital requirements. - 43 - Item 7. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Contractual Obligations, Commitments and Contingencies (Dollar amounts in thousands) Total 2007 2008 2009 2010 2011 Thereafter Contractual Obligations: Convertible Debentures $ 270,603 $ 6,563 $ 6,563 $ 6,563 $ 250,914 $ — $ — Lease Commitments 538,253 70,590 74,065 70,933 68,851 63,317 190,497 Purchase Obligations 774,881 399,562 370,638 4,676 5 — — Investment Commitments 328,983 31,122 10,795 — 39,397 2,350 245,319 Acquired Management Contract 4,000 1,000 1,000 1,000 1,000 — — Total Contractual Obligations $ 1,916,720 $ 508,837 $ 463,061 $ 83,172 $ 360,167 $ 65,667 $ 435,816 Convertible Debentures, Line of Credit and Other Interest-Bearing Obligations In February 2005, the Company issued $250.0 million aggregate principal amount of convertible debentures due in 2035 and bearing interest at a rate of 2.625% per annum (the “Debentures”). Interest is payable semi-annually in arrears on February 15 and August 15 of each year, or approximately $6.6 million a year, and commenced August 15, 2005. The Debentures are callable by the Company at any time on or after February 20, 2010. In addition, the Debentures contain certain put and conversion provisions. On the contractual obligations table above, the principal balance of the Debentures is assumed to be repaid in 2010, and related interest has been included through the call date. In December 2006, the Company entered into a revolving credit agreement with a syndicate of banking institutions with an initial borrowing capacity of $600.0 million, subsequently increased in February 2007 to $800.0 million. As of December 31, 2006, the Company had no amounts outstanding under this facility as the first borrowings were made in January and February of 2007. As such, no amounts related to the revolving credit facility have been included in the contractual obligations table above. Lease Commitments The Company leases its primary office space and certain office equipment under agreements that expire through 2018. In connection with certain lease agreements, the Company is responsible for escalation payments. The contractual obligations table above includes only guaranteed minimum lease payments for such leases and does not project potential escalation or other lease-related payments. These leases are classified as operating leases and, as such, are not recorded as liabilities on the consolidated statements of financial condition. - 44 - Item 7. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Contractual Obligations, Commitments and Contingencies (continued) Purchase Obligations In the ordinary course of business, BlackRock enters into contracts or purchase obligations with third parties whereby the third parties provide services to or on behalf of BlackRock. Purchase obligations included in the contractual obligations table above represent executory contracts which are either non-cancelable or cancelable with a penalty. At December 31, 2006, the Company’s obligations primarily reflect shareholder servicing arrangements related to client investments in the BlackRock closed-end funds, sub-advisory agreements and standard service contracts with affiliated and unaffiliated third parties for portfolio, market data and office services. Purchase obligations are recorded on the Company’s financial statements only after the goods or services have been received and, as such, these obligations are not included in the Company’s consolidated statement of financial condition at December 31, 2006. Investment Commitments The Company has various capital commitments to fund companies or investment funds in which it has an ownership stake. Generally, the timing of the funding of these commitments is dependent upon the needs of the investment and, therefore, is uncertain. Capital commitments have been shown in the contractual obligations table above to be paid upon the expiration date of the commitment. Actual payments could be made at any time prior to such date and if not called by that date, such commitments would expire. These commitments have not been recorded on the Company’s consolidated statements of financial condition at December 31, 2006. The above schedule does not include potential future commitments approved by the Company’s Investment Committee, but which are not yet legally binding commitments. BlackRock is also obligated to maintain specified ownership levels in certain investment products, which may result in additional required contributions or distributions of capital. These amounts are inherently uncertain and have been excluded from the contractual obligations schedule above. In addition, as a general partner in certain private equity partnerships, the Company receives certain distributions from the partnerships according to the provisions of the partnership agreements. The Company may, from time to time, be required to return all or a portion of such distributions to the limited partners in the event the limited partners do not achieve a certain return as specified in the various partnership agreements. The Company’s Investment Committee has approved warehouse facilities totaling $350 million for the purpose of funding investments to establish private equity funds. As of December 31, 2006, the Company has committed to invest $130 million in certain funds, of which approximately $11 million was funded. The net unfunded commitment of $119 million has been included in the contractual obligations table above. Acquired Management Contract In connection with a management contract acquired on May 15, 2000, which was associated with the agreement and plan of merger of CORE Cap, Inc. with Anthracite Capital, Inc. (“Anthracite”), a BlackRock managed Real Estate Investment Trust, the Company recorded an $8.0 million liability using an imputed interest rate of 10.0%, the prevailing interest rate on the date of acquisition. For the year ended December 31, 2006, the related interest expense was $0.3 million. At December 31, 2006, the future commitment under the agreement is $4.0 million and has been included in the contractual obligations table above. If Anthracite’s management contract is terminated, not renewed or not extended for any reason other than cause, Anthracite would remit to the Company all future payments due under this obligation. At December 31, 2006, the discounted value of this obligation was $3.2 million and was included in long-term borrowings in the 2006 consolidated statement of financial condition. - 45 - Item 7. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Contractual Obligations, Commitments and Contingencies (continued) LTIP Put Obligation and Other Compensation and Benefit Obligations BlackRock granted awards in 2002 and 2003 under its LTIP of approximately $230 million, of which approximately $210 million were paid in January 2007. The awards were payable approximately 16.7% in cash and the remainder in BlackRock stock contributed by PNC and distributed to LTIP participants. As permitted under the plan, employees elected to put approximately 95% of the stock portion of the awards back to the Company at a total fair market value of approximately $165.7 million. In accordance with GAAP, this amount was not recorded on the statement of financial condition as of December 31, 2006 as the total put obligation was not known or estimable until January 2007. As such, this obligation was not included in the contractual obligations table above. The Company has various other compensation and benefit obligations, including bonuses, commissions and incentive payments payable, employee stock purchases and defined contribution plan matching contribution obligations, deferred compensation arrangements, defined benefit plan obligations, post-employment benefits and post-retirement benefits that are excluded from the table above primarily due to uncertainties in their payout periods. Accrued compensation and benefits at December 31, 2006 totaled $1,051.3 million and included incentive compensation of $629.9 million, deferred compensation of $321.6 million and other compensation and benefits related obligations of $99.8 million. Incentive compensation was primarily paid in January and February 2007, while the deferred compensation obligations are generally payable over periods up to five years, but include certain defined benefit plan liabilities whose payment patterns are uncertain. Acquisition Forward Commitment On April 30, 2003, the Company purchased 80% of an investment manager of a fund of hedge funds for approximately $4.1 million in cash. Additionally, the Company committed to purchase the remaining 20% equity of the investment manager on March 31, 2008, subject to certain acceleration provisions. The purchase price of this remaining interest is performance-based and is not subject to a minimum or maximum amount or to the continued employment of former employees of the investment manager with the Company. As the remaining obligation is dependent upon the performance of the investment manager through March 31, 2008, however, the ultimate liability is not certain at December 31, 2006 and, as such, this commitment has been excluded from the contractual obligations table above and from BlackRock’s consolidated statement of financial condition at December 31, 2006. Purchase Price Contingencies In January 2005, the Company closed its acquisition of SSR from MetLife for adjusted consideration of approximately $265.1 million in cash and 550,000 restricted shares of BlackRock common stock and certain additional contingent payments. On the fifth anniversary of the closing of the SSR acquisition, MetLife could receive an additional payment of up to a maximum of $10.0 million based on the Company’s retained AUM associated with the MetLife defined benefit and defined contribution plans. Due to its inherent uncertainty, this contingency has been excluded from the contractual obligations table above and has not been recorded on the Company’s consolidated statement of financial condition at December 31, 2006. - 46 - Item 7. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Contractual Obligations, Commitments and Contingencies (continued) Separate Account Liabilities The Company’s wholly-owned registered life insurance company, which was acquired in the MLIM Transaction, maintains separate account assets representing segregated funds held for purposes of funding individual and group pension contracts. The net investment income and net realized and unrealized gains and losses attributable to these separate account assets accrue directly to the contract owner and, as such, an offsetting separate account liability is recorded. At December 31, 2006, the Company had $4.3 billion of separate account liabilities on the 2006 consolidated statement of financial condition. The payment of these contractual obligations is inherently uncertain and varies by customer. As such, these liabilities have been excluded from the contractual obligations table above. Indemnifications In many of the Company’s contracts, including the MLIM Transaction Agreement, BlackRock agrees to indemnify third parties under certain circumstances. The terms of the indemnities vary from contract to contract and the amount of indemnification liability, if any, cannot be determined and has not been included in the table above or recorded in the Company’s consolidated statement of financial condition at December 31, 2006. See further discussion in Note 10 to the consolidated financial statements beginning on F-1 of this Form 10-K. - 47 - Item 7. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates The preparation of the consolidated financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods. Actual results could differ significantly from those estimates. Management considers the following accounting policies and estimates critical to an informed review of BlackRock’s consolidated financial statements. For a summary of these and additional accounting policies see Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements beginning on page F-1 of this Form 10-K. Investments Consolidation, Equity Method and Cost Method The accounting method used for the Company’s investments is generally dependent upon the influence the Company has on its investee. For investments where BlackRock has control over the financial and operating policies of the investee, which is generally shown through a 50% or greater voting interest, the investee is consolidated into BlackRock’s financial statements. For certain investments where the risks and rewards of ownership are not directly linked to voting interests (“variable interest entities”), an investee may be consolidated if BlackRock is considered the primary beneficiary of the investee. The Company, as general partner or managing member, is generally presumed to control investments in limited partnerships and certain limited liability companies. Such a presumption can be overcome if other limited partners or members in the investment have substantive participating or kick-out rights whereby the Company may be removed as investment manager. For investments where BlackRock does not control the investee, and is not the primary beneficiary of a variable interest entity, but can exert significant influence over the financial and operating policies of the investee, the Company uses the equity method of accounting. Under the equity method of accounting for investments, BlackRock’s share of the investee’s underlying net income is recorded as non-operating income for investments in funds and as other revenue for investments in operating or advisory companies since such operating or advisory companies are considered to be integral to BlackRock’s core business. Dividends received reduce the Company’s investment balance. For equity investments where BlackRock neither controls nor has significant influence over the investee and which are readily marketable, the investments are classified as either trading or available-for-sale securities based upon management’s intent in making the investment. Trading securities are those investments which are bought principally for the purpose of selling them in the near term. Trading securities are carried at fair value on the consolidated statements of financial condition with changes in fair value recorded in non-operating income in the consolidated statements of income during the period of the change. Available-for-sale securities are those securities which are not classified as trading securities. Available-for-sale securities are carried at fair value on the consolidated statements of financial condition with changes in fair value recorded to the accumulated other comprehensive income component of equity in the period of the change. Upon the disposition of an available-for-sale security, the Company reclassifies the gain or loss on the security from accumulated other comprehensive income to non-operating income on the Company’s consolidated financial statements. For equity investments where BlackRock neither controls nor has significant influence over the investee and which are non-marketable, the investments are accounted for using the cost method of accounting. Under the cost method, dividends received are recorded as non-operating income. Debt securities are classified as either held-to-maturity or as available-for-sale based upon management’s purpose for making the investment. If the Company has the ability and intent to hold a debt security to its maturity, the security is classified as held-to-maturity and is recorded at its amortized cost in the consolidated statements of financial condition. If the Company does not have the intent to hold the debt security to maturity or is unable to do so, the security is classified as available-for-sale. - 48 - Item 7. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates (continued) Investments (continued) Consolidation, Equity Method and Cost Method (continued) Dividend income on the Company’s investments in CDOs is recorded based upon the CDO’s projected investment yield. Expected future cash flows for the CDO are reviewed periodically and changes in the yield are recorded prospectively. Dividend income for these investments is recorded in non-operating income on the consolidated statements of income. Occasionally, the Company will acquire a controlling equity interest in a sponsored investment fund. All of the consolidated funds’ investments are carried at fair value, with corresponding changes in the securities’ fair values reflected in non-operating income in the Company’s consolidated statements of income. In the absence of a publicly available market value, fair value for an investment is estimated in good faith by the Company’s management based on such factors as the liquidity, financial condition and current and projected operating performance of the investment and, in the case of private investment fund investments, the net asset value as provided by the private investment fund’s investment manager which may or may not be BlackRock. When the Company can no longer control these funds due to reduced ownership percentage or other reasons, the funds are deconsolidated and accounted for under another accounting method, as appropriate. The evaluation of the control or significant influence that BlackRock may exert over the financial and operational policies of its investees requires significant management judgment based on the facts and circumstances surrounding each individual investment. Factors considered in these evaluations may include the type of investment, the legal structure of the investee, the terms and structure of the investment agreement including investor voting rights, the terms of BlackRock’s advisory agreement with the investee and any influence BlackRock may have on the governing board of the investee. Further, with regard to variable interest entities, significant judgment is required in the determination of whether the Company is the primary beneficiary. If the Company is determined to be the primary beneficiary of a variable interest entity, the entity will be consolidated within BlackRock’s consolidated financial statements. In order to determine whether the Company is the primary beneficiary of a variable interest entity, management must make significant estimates and assumptions of probable future cash flows and assign probabilities to different cash flow scenarios. Assumptions made in such analyses include, but are not limited to, market prices of securities, market interest rates, potential credit defaults on individual securities or default rates on a portfolio of securities, gain realization, liquidity or marketability of certain securities, discount rates and the probability of certain other outcomes. Fair Value BlackRock has certain investments which require fair value accounting under generally accepted accounting principles as described above. For certain investments, including investments classified as trading investments and consolidated fund investments, changes in the fair value affect net income in the period of the change. For other investments classified as available-for-sale securities, changes in fair value are recorded as a component of stockholders’ equity and generally do not directly impact BlackRock’s net income until such investments are sold or are considered impaired (see below). Marketable securities are priced using publicly available market data or external pricing services. Non-marketable securities, however, are generally priced using a variety of methods and resources, including internal valuation models, which utilize available market data and management assumptions. - 49 - Item 7. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates (continued) Investments (continued) Fair Value (continued) When launching a new fund, the Company will, on occasion, provide seed capital to the fund so that it may make investments and establish an investment history before being marketed to investors. In such circumstances, the Company will usually own 100% of the fund until it is offered to external investors and, as such, these funds are consolidated in BlackRock’s financial statements. Investments within such funds are carried at fair value, with changes in fair value impacting the Company’s consolidated statements of income. Investments held by these seed funds may be marketable or non-marketable depending upon the type of fund being established. Fair value of non-marketable investments within these funds is generally determined by the Company, as the fund manager, using similar models, assumptions and judgment as noted above. In addition, changes in fair value of certain illiquid investments held by these funds, including direct investments in equity or debt securities of privately held companies certain real estate products are recorded based upon the best information available at the reporting period date, considering any significant changes in the operations of the investment. As of December 31, 2006, BlackRock had approximately $2.1 billion in investments. Of that amount, changes in fair value of approximately $1.9 billion of such investments will impact the Company’s consolidated statement of income and approximately $0.2 billion will impact accumulated other comprehensive income. As of December 31, 2006, approximately $1.5 billion of such investments relate to consolidated funds whereby changes in fair value of such investments will impact BlackRock’s investment income and minority interest expense on the consolidated statement of income for the year ended December 31, 2006. Due to ownership levels, BlackRock’s net exposure to changes in fair value of such investments is $0.4 billion. Impairment of Investments The Company’s management periodically assesses impairment on its investments. If circumstances indicate that impairment may exist, investments are evaluated using market values, where available, or the expected future cash flows of the investment. If the undiscounted expected future cash flows are lower than the Company’s carrying value of the investment, an impairment charge is recorded to the consolidated statements of income. When the fair values of trading or available-for-sale securities are lower than their cost or amortized cost values, the Company evaluates the securities to determine whether the impairment is considered other than temporary. In making this determination, the Company considers, among other factors, the length of time the security has been in a loss position, the extent to which the security’s market value is less than its cost, the financial condition and near-term prospects of the security’s issuer and the Company’s ability and intent to hold the security for a length of time sufficient to allow for recovery. If the impairment is considered other than temporary, a charge is recorded to the consolidated statements of income. There were no impairments of investments, other than CDOs (see below) for the years ended December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004. The Company reviews its CDO investments for impairment periodically throughout the term of the investment. The Company estimates the fair value of its CDO investments using the present value of future cash flows. If the estimated future cash flows are lower than the previous estimate, an impairment is recognized based on the excess of the carrying amount of the investment over its estimated fair value if the impairment is considered other than temporary. CDO impairments were $2.3 million, $0.8 million and $1.1 million for the years ended December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively. Evaluations of impairments of securities involve significant assumptions and management judgments, which could differ from actual results and these differences could have a material impact on the Company’s consolidated statements of income. - 50 - Item 7. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates (continued) Goodwill and Intangible Assets At December 31, 2006, the carrying amounts of the Company’s goodwill and intangible assets were as follows: (Dollar amounts in thousands) December 31,2006 Goodwill $ 5,257,017 Management contracts acquired: Indefinite–lived 4,711,732 Finite–lived, net of accumulated amortization 1,170,698 Total goodwill and intangible assets $ 11,139,447 The value of contracts to manage assets in proprietary mutual funds is classified as an indefinite-lived intangible asset. The assignment of indefinite lives to proprietary mutual fund contracts is based upon the assumption that there is no foreseeable limit on the contract period to manage these funds due to the likelihood of continued renewal at little or no cost. Goodwill represents the excess cost of a business acquisition over the fair value of the net assets acquired. In accordance with SFAS No. 142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets, indefinite-lived intangible assets and goodwill are not amortized. Finite-lived management contracts are amortized over their expected useful lives, which, at December 31, 2006, ranged from 2 to 20 years with an original weighted average estimated useful life of 10.1 years. The Company assesses its indefinite-lived management contracts and goodwill for impairment at least annually, considering factors such as assets under management, product mix, projected cash flows, average base fees by product and revenue multiples to determine whether the values of each asset are impaired and whether the indefinite-life classification is still appropriate. The fair value of indefinite-lived intangible assets and goodwill is determined based on the discounted value of expected future cash flows. The fair values of finite-lived intangible assets are reviewed at least annually to determine whether circumstances exist which indicate there may be a potential impairment. If such circumstances are considered to exist, the Company will perform an impairment test, using an undiscounted cash flow analysis. If the asset is determined to be impaired, the difference between the book value of the asset and its current fair value is recognized as an expense in the period in which the impairment is determined. Expected future cash flows are estimated using many variables which require significant management judgment, including market interest rates, equity prices, credit default ratings, discount rates, revenue multiples, inflation rates and AUM growth rates. Actual results could differ materially from these estimates, which could materially impact the impairment conclusion. In 2004, the Company recorded an impairment of $6.1 million with regard to an acquired management contract. No such impairments were recorded in 2006 or 2005. In addition, management judgment is required to estimate the period that intangible assets will contribute to the Company’s cash flows and the pattern over which these assets will be consumed. A change in the remaining useful life of any of these assets could have a significant impact on the Company’s amortization expense, which was $37.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2006. - 51 - Item 7. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates (continued) Income Taxes The Company accounts for income taxes under the liability method prescribed by SFAS No. 109, Accounting for Income Taxes. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to the differences between the financial statement carrying amount of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases. Management periodically assesses the recoverability of its deferred tax assets based upon expected future earnings, future deductibility of the asset, changes in tax law and other factors. If management determines that it is not probable that the deferred tax asset will be fully recoverable in the future, a valuation allowance may be established for the difference between the asset balance and the amount expected to be recoverable in the future. This allowance will result in a charge to the Company’s consolidated statement of income. Further, the Company records its income taxes receivable and payable based upon its estimated income tax liability. The Company’s actual tax benefit or liability may differ from these estimates. Current and deferred tax balances require significant assumptions and estimates by management and actual results may differ significantly from these estimates. As of December 31, 2006, the Company had gross deferred tax assets of $14.7 million and had recorded no valuation allowances against those assets. The Company also had approximately $1.7 billion in deferred tax liabilities as of December 31, 2006. The Company had income taxes receivable of approximately $42.1 million and income taxes payable of $171.3 million as of December 31, 2006. PNC and BlackRock have entered into a tax disaffiliation agreement that sets forth each party’s rights and obligations with respect to income tax payments and refunds and addresses related matters such as the filing of tax returns and the conduct of audits or other proceedings involving claims made by taxing authorities. As such, the Company may be responsible for its pro rata share of tax positions taken by PNC for unaudited tax years which may be subsequently challenged by taxing authorities. Management does not anticipate that any such amounts would be material to the Company’s operations, financial position or cash flows. Revenue Recognition Investment advisory and administration fees are recognized as the services are performed. Such fees are primarily based on where noted pre-determined percentages of the market value of AUM or, in the case of certain real estate separate accounts, net operating income generated by the underlying properties, and are affected by changes in AUM, including market appreciation or depreciation and net subscriptions or redemptions. Investment advisory and administration fees for mutual funds are shown net of fees waived pursuant to expense limitations. Certain real estate fees are earned upon the acquisition or disposition of properties in accordance with applicable investment management agreements and are recognized at the closing of the respective real estate transactions. Subsequent to the MLIM Transaction, the Company contracts with third parties for various mutual fund administration and shareholder servicing to be performed on behalf of certain funds managed by the Company. Such arrangements are generally priced at a portion of the Company’s management fee paid by the fund. In certain cases, the fund takes on the primary responsibility for payment for services such that BlackRock bears no credit risk to the third party (“retrocessions”). The Company accounts for retrocessions in accordance with EITF No. 99-19, Reporting Revenue Gross as a Principal versus Net as an Agent, and has recorded its retrocession contracts net of management fees earned because management believes that the Company is not the primary obligor of the arrangement, does not perform part of the service, is not primarily responsible for fulfillment and has no credit risk. Retrocessions for the year ended December 31, 2006 amounted to $156.0 million and were included in investment advisory and administration fees on the 2006 consolidated statement of income. - 52 - Item 7. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates (continued) Revenue Recognition (continued) The Company also receives performance fees or incentive allocations from certain alternative investment products and certain separate accounts. These performance fees are earned upon exceeding specified investment return thresholds. Such fees are recorded upon completion of the measurement period. For the years ended December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004, performance fee revenue totaled $242.3 million, $168.0 million and $41.6 million, respectively. BlackRock provides a variety of risk management, investment analytic and investment system services to customers. These services are provided under the brand name BlackRock Solutions and include a wide array of risk management services and enterprise investment system outsourcing to clients. Fees earned for BlackRock Solutions services are either based on pre-determined percentages of the market value of assets subject to the services, on fixed monthly or quarterly payments or on attainment of certain pre-defined milestones. The fees earned on risk management, investment analytic and investment system assignments are recorded as other revenue in the consolidated statements of income. Certain investment advisory and administration fees calculated on the fair value of AUM are subject to the risks and uncertainties noted in Investments above to the extent the underlying investments are non-marketable and, as such, the Company’s earnings may be subject to variability based upon such estimates. In addition, certain revenues are based upon estimates of the fair value of AUM or of net operating income available at the end of the accounting period. Further, as a general partner in certain private equity partnerships, the Company receives distributions from the partnerships according to the provisions of the partnership agreements. The Company may, from time to time, be required to return all or a portion of such distributions to the limited partners in the event the limited partners do not achieve a certain return as specified in the various partnership agreements. Management does not believe this exposure is material to the consolidated financial statements as of December 31, 2006. Historically, adjustments to revenues arising from initial estimates have been immaterial since most of BlackRock’s fee revenue is calculated on the fair value of marketable investments and since, as a policy, the Company does not record revenues until they are relatively certain. Management can give no assurance, however, that these estimates would not result in a material adjustment in the future.

Recent Accounting Developments Recent accounting developments are discussed in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements beginning at page F-1 of this Form 10-K. - 53 - Item 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK In the normal course of its business, BlackRock is primarily exposed to equity market price risk, interest rate risk and foreign exchange rate risk. The tables below represent BlackRock’s total consolidated investment portfolio. Approximately $1,515.8 million of BlackRock’s total investment portfolio is maintained in investment funds which are consolidated in accordance with GAAP even though BlackRock may or may not own a majority of such funds. Equity risk inherent in those funds, as displayed below, would be limited to its net exposure of $370.3 million on these investments. As a leading investment management firm, BlackRock devotes significant resources across all of its operations to identifying, measuring, monitoring, managing and analyzing market and operating risks, including in the management and oversight of its own investment portfolio. The Board of Directors of the Company has adopted guidelines for the review of investments to be made by the Company, requiring, among other things, that all investments be reviewed by the Company’s Investment Committee, which consists of senior officers of the Company, and that certain investments over prescribed thresholds receive prior approval from the Audit Committee or the Board of Directors depending on the circumstances. Equity Market Price Risk BlackRock’s investments, including consolidated investments, may expose BlackRock to equity price risk. The following table summarizes the fair values of the investments exposed to equity price risk and provides a sensitivity analysis of the estimated fair values of those investments, assuming a 10% increase or decrease in equity prices: (Dollar amounts in thousands) Book Value Fair value assuming 10% increase Fair value assuming 10% decrease December 31, 2006 Equity securities $ 155,930 $ 171,523 $ 140,337 Commingled investments 125,115 137,627 112,604 Total investments, trading 281,045 309,150 252,941 Commingled investments 77,272 84,999 69,545 Total available-for-sale investments 77,272 84,999 69,545 Other fund investments 1,377,541 1,515,295 1,239,787 Deferred compensation plans 18,146 19,961 16,331 Total other investments 1,395,687 1,535,256 1,256,118 Total equity price risk on investments $ 1,754,004 $ 1,929,405 $ 1,578,604 December 31, 2005 Commingled investments $ 22,319 $ 24,550 $ 20,087 Equity securities 18,425 20,267 16,582 Total investments, trading 40,744 44,817 36,669 Commingled investments 766 842 689 Total available-for-sale investments 766 842 689 Other fund investments 84,843 93,327 76,358 Deferred compensation plans 24,495 26,944 22,045 Other 973 1,070 875 Total equity investments 110,311 121,341 99,278 Total equity price risk on investments $ 151,821 $ 167,000 $ 136,636 BlackRock’s deferred compensation plans comprise $31.3 million and $22.3 million of total trading investments, and $18.1 million and $24.5 million of total other investments, at December 31, 2006 and December 31, 2005, respectively, and reflect investments held by BlackRock with respect to senior employee elections under BlackRock’s deferred compensation plans. Any change in the fair value of these investments is offset by a corresponding change in the related deferred compensation expense. During 2007, the Company established a hedging program to hedge exposure to equity price risk in certain investments through the use of derivative instruments. - 54 - Item 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK (continued) Interest Rate Risk The following table summarizes the fair value of BlackRock’s investments in debt securities and funds that invest primarily in debt securities that expose BlackRock to interest rate risk at December 31, 2006. The table also provides a sensitivity analysis of the estimated fair value of these financial instruments, assuming 100 basis point upward and downward parallel shifts in the yield curve: (Dollar amounts in thousands) BookValue Fair market value assuming +100 basis point shift Fair market value assuming -100 basis point shift December 31, 2006 Municipal debt securities $ 154,510 $ 130,224 $ 178,796 Corporate notes and bonds 13,656 13,192 14,120 Commingled investments 23,272 23,275 23,269 Total trading investments 191,438 166,691 216,185 Commingled investments 48,377 48,305 48,449 Collateralized debt obligations 29,362 29,346 29,378 Other 3,431 3,397 3,465 Total available-for-sale investments 81,170 81,048 81,292 Other fund investments 70,962 71,209 70,715 Total investments $ 343,570 $ 318,948 $ 368,192 December 31, 2005 Mortgage-backed securities $ 13,069 $ 12,827 $ 13,311 Corporate notes and bonds 7,946 7,575 8,262 Municipal debt securities 123 117 128 Total trading investments 21,138 20,519 21,701 Commingled investments 3,543 3,426 3,660 Collateralized debt obligations 25,717 25,222 26,212 Total available-for-sale investments 29,260 28,648 29,872 Other fund investments 96,449 94,998 97,900 Total investments $ 146,847 $ 144,165 $ 149,473 - 55 - Item 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK (continued) Foreign Exchange Rate Risk The Company has increased its foreign exchange rate risk as a result of the MLIM Transaction. The Company has investments totaling approximately $163.0 million that are denominated in foreign currencies, primarily the British pound sterling and the euro. A 10% increase or decrease in foreign exchange rates as of December 31, 2006 would result in an increase or a decline in value of the investment portfolio of approximately $16.3 million. In addition, the Company maintains certain foreign currency denominated cash accounts totaling approximately $783.1 million at December 31, 2006, primarily in British pounds sterling. A 10% increase or decrease in foreign exchange rates as of December 31, 2006 would result in an increase or decline in value of such cash accounts of approximately $78.3 million. Other Market Risks In February 2005, the Company issued $250 million aggregate principal amount of convertible debentures, which will be due in 2035 and bear interest at 2.625% per annum. Due to the debentures’ conversion feature, these financial instruments are exposed to both interest rate risk and equity price risk. At December 31, 2006, the fair value of the debentures was $372.8 million. Assuming 100 basis point upward and downward parallel shifts in the yield curve, based on the fair value of the debentures on December 31, 2006, the fair value of the debentures would fluctuate to $365.7 million and $379.9 million, respectively. Assuming a 10% increase and 10% decrease in the Company’s stock price, based on the fair value of the debentures on December 31, 2006, the fair value of the debentures would fluctuate to $404.9 million and $341.2 million, respectively. In addition, BlackRock’s investment management revenues are comprised of fees based on a percentage of the value of AUM and, in some cases, performance fees expressed as a percentage of the returns realized on AUM. Declines in equity market prices or interest rates, or both, could cause revenues to decline because of lower investment management fees by: • causing the value of AUM to decrease; • causing the returns realized on AUM to decrease; • causing clients to withdraw funds in favor of investments in markets that they perceive to offer greater opportunity and that the Company does not serve; and • causing clients to rebalance assets away from investments that BlackRock manages into investments that BlackRock does not manage.",2023-12-30 18:58:23.511915

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Overview BlackRock, Inc. (“BlackRock” or the “Company”) is one of the largest publicly traded investment management firms in the United States with $1.357 trillion of assets under management (“AUM”) at December 31, 2007. BlackRock manages assets on behalf of institutional and individual investors worldwide through a variety of fixed income, cash management, equity and balanced and alternative investment separate accounts and funds. In addition, BlackRock provides risk management, strategic advisory and enterprise investment system services to a broad base of clients. On September 29, 2006, BlackRock and Merrill Lynch & Co., Inc. (“Merrill Lynch”) closed a transaction pursuant to which Merrill Lynch contributed its investment management business, Merrill Lynch Investment Managers (“MLIM”), to BlackRock in exchange for an aggregate of 65 million shares of newly issued BlackRock common and non-voting participating preferred stock (the “MLIM Transaction”). On October 1, 2007, BlackRock acquired certain assets and assumed certain liabilities of the fund of funds business of Quellos Group, LLC (“Quellos”) for up to $1.719 billion in a combination of cash and common stock (the “Quellos Transaction”). At December 31, 2007, Merrill Lynch owned approximately 45.1% of the Company’s voting common stock and approximately 49.0% of the capital stock on a fully diluted basis of the Company and The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. (“PNC”) owned approximately 33.5% of the capital stock. The following table summarizes BlackRock’s operating performance for the years ended December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005: BlackRock, Inc.

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Overview (continued) (a) BlackRock reports its financial results on a GAAP basis, however management believes that evaluating the Company’s ongoing operating results may not be as useful if investors are limited to reviewing only GAAP financial measures. Management reviews non-GAAP financial measures to assess ongoing operations and, for the reasons described below, considers them to be effective indicators, for both management and investors, of BlackRock’s financial performance over time. BlackRock’s management does not advocate that investors consider such non-GAAP financial measures in isolation from, or as a substitute for, financial information prepared in accordance with GAAP. Operating margin, as adjusted, equals operating income, as adjusted, divided by revenue used for operating margin measurement, as indicated in the table below. As a result of recent changes in BlackRock’s business, management has altered the way it views its operating margin, as adjusted. As such, the calculation of operating income, as adjusted, and operating margin, as adjusted, were modified in the second quarter 2007 primarily to adjust for costs associated with closed-end fund issuances and amortization of deferred sales costs, as shown below. Revenue used for operating margin, as adjusted, for all periods presented includes affiliated and unaffiliated portfolio administration and servicing costs. Certain prior period non-GAAP data has been reclassified to conform to current presentation. Computations for all years are derived from the Company’s consolidated statements of income as follows: Year ended 2007 2006 2005 Operating income, GAAP basis $ 1,293,664 $ 471,800 $ 340,541 Non-GAAP adjustments: Termination of closed-end fund administration and servicing arrangements 128,114 — — PNC LTIP funding obligation 53,517 50,031 48,587 Merrill Lynch compensation contribution 10,000 1,848 — MLIM integration costs 20,201 141,932 — Quellos integration costs 460 — — SSR integration costs — — 8,873 Closed-end fund launch costs 35,594 11,586 13,259 Closed-end fund launch commissions 6,029 3,374 4,105 Compensation expense related to appreciation on deferred compensation plans 11,844 7,537 10,447 Operating income, as adjusted $ 1,559,423 $ 688,108 $ 425,812 Revenue, GAAP basis $ 4,844,655 $ 2,097,976 $ 1,191,386 Non-GAAP adjustments: Portfolio administration and servicing costs (547,620 ) (172,531 ) (64,611 ) Amortization of deferred sales costs (108,091 ) (29,940 ) (9,346 ) Reimbursable property management compensation (26,811 ) (22,618 ) (23,376 ) Revenue used for operating margin measurement, as adjusted $ 4,162,133 $ 1,872,887 $ 1,094,053 Operating margin, GAAP basis 26.7 % 22.5 % 28.6 % Operating margin, as adjusted 37.5 % 36.7 % 38.9 % 30 Item 7. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Overview (continued) BlackRock, Inc. Financial Highlights (continued) (a) (continued) Management believes that operating income, as adjusted, and operating margin, as adjusted, are effective indicators of management’s ability to effectively employ BlackRock’s resources. As such, management believes that operating income, as adjusted, and operating margin, as adjusted, provide useful disclosure to investors. Non-GAAP Operating Income Adjustments: The expense related to the termination of the closed-end fund administration and servicing arrangements with Merrill Lynch has been excluded from operating income, as adjusted, as the termination of the arrangements is deemed non-recurring by management. The portion of the Long-Term Incentive Plan (“LTIP”) expense associated with awards funded through the distribution to participants of shares of BlackRock common stock held by PNC and the anticipated Merrill Lynch compensation contribution have been excluded because, exclusive of the impact related to LTIP participants’ put options, these charges do not impact BlackRock’s book value. MLIM and Quellos integration costs, as well as SSR acquisition costs consist principally of certain professional fees, rebranding costs and compensation costs related to the integration which were reflected in GAAP operating income. Integration and acquisition costs have been deemed non-recurring by management and have been excluded from operating income, as adjusted, to help ensure the comparability of this information to prior periods. Closed-end fund launch costs and commissions have been excluded from operating income, as adjusted, because such costs can fluctuate considerably and revenues associated with the expenditure of such costs will not fully impact the Company’s results until future periods. As such, management believes that operating margins exclusive of these costs are more representative of the operating performance for the respective periods. Compensation expense associated with appreciation (depreciation) on assets related to certain BlackRock deferred compensation plans has been excluded as returns on investments for these plans are reported in non-operating income. Non-GAAP Revenue Adjustments: Portfolio administration and servicing costs have been excluded from revenue used for operating margin, as adjusted, because the Company receives offsetting revenue and expense for these services. Amortization of deferred sales costs are excluded from revenue used for operating margin measurement, as adjusted, because such costs offset distribution fee revenue earned by the Company. Reimbursable property management compensation represents compensation and benefits paid to certain BlackRock Realty Advisors, Inc. (“Realty”) personnel. These employees are retained on Realty’s payroll when certain properties are acquired by Realty’s clients. The related compensation and benefits are fully reimbursed by Realty’s clients and have been excluded from revenue used for operating margin, as adjusted, because they bear no economic cost to BlackRock. 31 Item 7. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Overview (continued) (b) BlackRock reports its financial results on a GAAP basis, however management believes that evaluating the Company’s ongoing operating results may not be as useful if investors are limited to reviewing only GAAP-basis financial measures. Management reviews non-GAAP financial measures to assess ongoing operations and for the reasons described below, considers them to be effective indicators, for both management and investors, of BlackRock’s financial performance over time. BlackRock’s management does not advocate that investors consider such non-GAAP financial measures in isolation from, or as a substitute for, financial information prepared in accordance with GAAP. Year ended December 31, 2007 2006 2005 Net income, GAAP basis $ 995,272 $ 322,602 $ 233,908 Non-GAAP adjustments, net of tax: Termination of closed-end fund administration and servicing arrangements 81,993 — — PNC’s LTIP funding obligation 34,251 31,520 30,610 Merrill Lynch compensation contribution 6,400 1,164 — MLIM integration costs 12,929 89,417 — Quellos integration costs 294 — — SSR integration costs — — 5,590 Corporate deferred income tax rate changes (51,445 ) — — Impact of Trepp sale — — (486 ) Net income, as adjusted $ 1,079,694 $ 444,703 $ 269,622 Diluted weighted average shares outstanding (c) 132,088,810 83,358,394 66,875,149 Diluted earnings per share, GAAP basis (c) $ 7.53 $ 3.87 $ 3.50 Diluted earnings per share, as adjusted (c) $ 8.17 $ 5.33 $ 4.03 Management believes that net income, as adjusted, and diluted earnings per share, as adjusted, are effective measurements of BlackRock’s profitability and financial performance. The termination of the closed-end fund administration and servicing arrangements with Merrill Lynch has been excluded from net income, as adjusted, as the termination of the arrangements is deemed non-recurring by management. The portion of the LTIP expense associated with awards funded through the distribution to participants of shares of BlackRock common stock held by PNC and the anticipated Merrill Lynch compensation contribution have been excluded from net income, as adjusted, and diluted earnings per share, as adjusted, because, exclusive of the impact related to LTIP participants’ put options, these charges do not impact BlackRock’s book value. MLIM, Quellos and SSR integration costs, reflected in GAAP net income have been deemed non-recurring by management and have been excluded from net income, as adjusted, and diluted earnings per share, as adjusted, to help ensure the comparability of this information to prior reporting periods. Integration costs consist principally of compensation costs, professional fees and rebranding costs incurred in conjunction with the integrations. The United Kingdom and Germany, during third quarter 2007, enacted legislation reducing corporate income taxes, effective in April and January of 2008, respectively, which resulted in a revaluation of certain deferred tax liabilities. The resulting decrease in deferred income taxes has been excluded from net income, as adjusted, as it is non-recurring and to ensure comparability to prior reporting periods. The gain on the sale of the Company’s equity interest in Trepp, LLC reflected in GAAP net income, has been deemed non-recurring by management and has been excluded from net income, as adjusted, to help ensure the comparability of this information to subsequent reporting periods. (c) Series A non-voting participating preferred stock is considered to be common stock for purposes of earnings per share calculations. 32 Item 7. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Overview (continued) BlackRock has portfolio managers located around the world, including the United States, the United Kingdom, The Netherlands, Japan and Australia. The Company provides a wide array of taxable and tax-exempt fixed income, equity and balanced mutual funds and separate accounts, as well as a wide assortment of index-based equity and alternative investment products to a diverse global clientele. BlackRock provides global advisory services for mutual funds and other non-U.S. equivalent retail products. The Company’s non-U.S. mutual funds are based in a number of domiciles and cover a range of asset classes, including cash management, fixed income and equities. The primary retail fund group offered outside the United States is the Merrill Lynch International Investment Funds (“MLIIF”), which is authorized for distribution in more than 35 jurisdictions worldwide. In the United States, the primary retail offerings include a wide variety of open-end and closed-end funds. Additional fund offerings include structured products, real estate funds, hedge funds, hedge funds of funds, private equity funds and funds of funds, managed futures funds and exchange funds. These products are sold to both U.S. and non-U.S. high net worth, retail and institutional investors in a wide variety of active and passive strategies covering both equity and fixed income assets. BlackRock’s client base consists of financial institutions and other corporate clients, pension funds, high net worth individuals and retail investors around the world. BlackRock maintains a significant sales and marketing presence both inside and outside the United States that is focused on establishing and maintaining retail and institutional investment management relationships by marketing its services to retail and institutional investors directly and through financial professionals, pension consultants and establishing third-party distribution relationships. BlackRock also distributes certain of its products and services through Merrill Lynch. BlackRock derives a substantial portion of its revenue from investment advisory and administration fees, which are recognized as the services are performed. Such fees are primarily based on pre-determined percentages of the market value of AUM, percentages of committed capital during investment periods of certain or, in the case of certain real estate equity separate accounts, net operating income generated by the underlying properties, and are affected by changes in AUM, including market appreciation or depreciation, foreign exchange gains or losses and net subscriptions or redemptions. Net subscriptions or redemptions represent the sum of new client assets, additional fundings from existing clients (including dividend reinvestment), withdrawals of assets from, and termination of, client accounts and purchases and redemptions of mutual fund shares. Market appreciation or depreciation includes current income earned on, and changes in the fair value of, securities held in client accounts. Investment advisory agreements for certain separate accounts and BlackRock’s alternative investment products provide for performance fees in addition to fees based on AUM. Performance fees generally are earned after a given period of time or when investment performance exceeds a contractual threshold. As such, the timing of recognition of performance fees may increase the volatility of BlackRock’s revenue and earnings. BlackRock provides a variety of risk management, investment analytic and investment system services to financial institutions, pension funds, asset managers, foundations, consultants, mutual fund sponsors, real estate investment trusts and government agencies. These services are provided under the brand name BlackRock Solutions and include a wide array of risk management services and enterprise investment system outsourcing to clients. Fees earned for BlackRock Solutions services are based on a number of factors including pre-determined percentages of the market value of assets subject to the services and the number of individual investment accounts, or fixed fees. Fees earned on risk management, investment analytic and investment system assignments are recorded as other revenue in the consolidated statements of income. 33 Item 7. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Overview (continued) Operating expenses consist of employee compensation and benefits, portfolio administration and servicing costs, amortization of deferred mutual fund sales commissions, general and administration expense and amortization of intangible assets. Employee compensation and benefits expense reflects salaries, deferred and incentive compensation, stock-based compensation and related benefit costs. Portfolio administration and servicing costs reflect payments made to Merrill Lynch-affiliated entities and PNC-affiliated entities, as well as third parties, primarily associated with the administration and servicing of client investments in certain BlackRock products. Assets Under Management AUM increased approximately $232.0 billion, or 20.6%, to $1.357 trillion at December 31, 2007, compared with $1.125 trillion at December 31, 2006. The growth in AUM was attributable to $137.6 billion in net subscriptions, $60.1 billion in net market appreciation, $21.9 billion acquired in the Quellos Transaction and $12.4 billion in net foreign exchange gains.

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Assets Under Management (continued) Net subscriptions of $137.6 billion for the year ended December 31, 2007 were primarily the result of net new business of $75.3 billion in cash management products, $27.2 billion in fixed income products, $23.5 billion in equity and balanced products and $11.7 billion in alternative investment products. Market appreciation of $60.1 billion largely reflected appreciation in equity and balanced products of $35.0 billion, as equity markets improved during the year ended December 31, 2007 and market appreciation on fixed income products of $20.1 billion due to current income and changes in market interest rates. BlackRock acquired $21.9 billion in alternative investment products from the Quellos Transaction. The following table presents the component changes in BlackRock’s AUM for the years ended December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005.

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Business Outlook As fiscal 2008 began, domestic and international markets generally reflected mixed economic and market performance due to a downturn in the United States housing market and ongoing credit market concerns. Low interest rates and a weaker dollar suggest increased allocations outside the United States over time, as well as faster adoption of new strategies, including liability driven investing, the increased use of multiple asset class products and the mainstreaming of alternatives. The timing and direction of market changes, investment performance and new client asset flows will impact the revenue the Company recognizes. The Company notes that the liquidity crunch and associated market disruption have impacted our business, which may be affected by further market changes during the remainder of 2008. • The build-up of institutional liquidity assets experienced in the fourth quarter of 2007 may be temporary, as these assets are expected to be redeployed to longer-dated strategies as market conditions stabilize. The Company’s strategic focus on performance, globalization and product diversification, client service and independent advice may enable retention of a portion of these assets. • The liquidity crunch and associated market disruption have given rise to greater demand for our advisory services, marrying our extensive capital markets and structuring expertise with rigorous modeling and analytical capabilities. While we anticipate demand for these services to remain high through the volatile markets, demand may return to historical levels should market concerns ease. • In early 2008, returns on many major equity indices have declined from year-end 2007, which may impact the Company’s revenue in future periods. 36 Item 7. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Operating results for the year ended December 31, 2007, as compared with the year ended December 31, 2006 Operating results for the year ended December 31, 2007 reflect the full year impact of the MLIM Transaction, which closed on September 29, 2006. With the exception of BlackRock Solutions, the magnitude of the acquired business is the primary driver of most line item variances in the analysis below comparing the year ended December 31, 2007 to the year ended December 31, 2006. Certain prior year amounts have been reclassified to conform to the current presentation.

Investment advisory and administration fees The increase in investment advisory and administration fees of $2,519.2 million, or 136.8%, was the result of an increase in investment advisory and administration base fees of $2,411.3 million, or 150.8%, to $4,010.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2007, compared with $1,598.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2006 along with an increase of $107.9 million in performance fees. Investment advisory and administration base fees increased for the year ended December 31, 2007 primarily due to the MLIM Transaction which added $589.2 billion in AUM on September 29, 2006 and additional increased AUM of $232.0 billion during 2007. 37 Item 7. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Operating results for the year ended December 31, 2007, as compared with the year ended December 31, 2006 (continued) Revenue (continued) Investment advisory and administration fees (continued) The increase in investment advisory and administration base fees of $2,411.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2007, compared with the year ended December 31, 2006 consisted of increases of $1,576.7 million in equity and balanced products, $327.2 million in fixed income products, $317.2 million in cash management products and $190.3 million in alternative products. The increase in investment advisory and administration fees for equity and balanced, fixed income, cash management and alternative investment products was driven by AUM acquired in the MLIM Transaction on September 29, 2006, as well as increases in AUM of $66.5 billion, $65.0 billion, $77.6 billion and $23.0 billion, respectively, over the past twelve months, which includes the $21.9 billion of alternative investment AUM acquired in the Quellos Transaction. Performance fees increased by $107.9 million, or 44.5%, to $350.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2007, compared to $242.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2006 primarily due to higher performance fees on equity and fixed income hedge funds, as well as real estate equity products. Distribution Fees Distribution fees increased by $87.1 million to $123.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2007, as compared to $35.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2006. The increase in distribution fees is primarily the result of the acquisition of distribution financing arrangements from the MLIM Transaction in third quarter 2006 and from PNC in second quarter 2007. Other Revenue Other revenue of $361.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2007 increased $140.3 million compared with the year ended December 31, 2006. Other revenue primarily represents fees earned on BlackRock Solutions products and services of $198.3 million, property management fees of $38.2 million earned on real estate products (primarily related to reimbursement of salaries and benefits of certain Realty employees from certain real estate products), fees for fund accounting of $27.2 million, fees related to securities lending of $27.1 million and $13.9 million for other advisory service fees. The increase in other revenue of $140.3 million, or 63.5%, for the year ended December 31, 2007 as compared to $221.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2006 was primarily the result of an increase of $50.3 million from BlackRock Solutions products and services driven by new Aladdin® and advisory valuation assignments, an increase of $24.6 million in unit trust sales commissions, an increase of $20.8 million in fees earned related to securities lending, $14.6 million in fund accounting services, and $13.7 million for other advisory service fees. 38 Item 7.

The increase in employee compensation and benefits was primarily attributable to increases in incentive compensation, salaries and benefits and stock-based compensation of $405.7 million, $368.4 million and $66.3 million, respectively. The $405.7 million, increase in incentive compensation is primarily attributable to higher operating income and direct incentives associated with higher performance fees earned on the Company’s alternative investment products. The $368.4 million increase in salaries and benefits was primarily attributable to higher staffing levels associated with the MLIM and Quellos Transactions and business growth. Employees (including employees of Metric Property Management, Inc. (“Metric”) at December 31, 2007 totaled 5,952 as compared to 5,113 at December 31, 2006. 39 Item 7.

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Operating results for the year ended December 31, 2007, as compared with the year ended December 31, 2006 (continued) Expenses (continued) Portfolio services costs increased by $118.0 million to $169.7 million, relating to supporting higher AUM levels and increased trading activities. Marketing and promotional expense increased $69.1 million, or 69.1%, to $169.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2007, compared to $100.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2006 primarily due to increased marketing activities, including $84.8 million related to domestic and international marketing efforts, partially offset by a decrease of $15.7 million related to BlackRock’s advertising and rebranding campaign in 2006. Occupancy costs for the year ended December 31, 2007 totaled $130.1 million, representing a $66.0 million, or 103.0%, increase from $64.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2006.

Non-operating income, net of non-controlling interest, increased $125.2 million to $165.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2007, compared to $40.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2006 as a result of a $121.6 million increase in net gain on investments, net of non-controlling interest, and a $45.0 million increase in interest and dividend income, partially offset by a $39.5 million increase in interest expense primarily related to borrowings under BlackRock’s revolving credit agreement and the $700 million issuance of long-term debt in September 2007. The increase in net gain on investments, net of non-controlling interest, was primarily due to market appreciation and investment gains from seed investments in private equity products, real estate equity products and other alternative products including hedge funds and funds of funds, partially offset by $14.2 million of increased impairments related to seed investments in collateralized debt obligations. 42 Item 7. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Operating results for the year ended December 31, 2007, as compared with the year ended December 31, 2006 (continued) Income Taxes Income tax expense was $463.8 million and $189.5 million for the years ended December 31, 2007 and 2006, respectively, representing effective income tax rates of 31.8% and 37.0%, respectively. The reduction in the effective tax rate is primarily the result of a one-time deferred income tax benefit of $51.4 million, recognized in the third quarter of 2007, due to tax legislation changes enacted in third quarter 2007 in the United Kingdom and Germany that will reduce corporate income tax rates in those jurisdictions in 2008. Accordingly, BlackRock revalued its deferred tax liabilities in these jurisdictions. Absent this deferred income tax benefit, the 2007 effective tax rate would have been 35.3%. Net Income Net income totaled $995.3 million, or $7.53 per diluted share, for the year ended December 31, 2007, which was an increase of $672.7 million, or $3.66 per diluted share, compared to the year ended December 31, 2006. Net income for the year ended December 31, 2007 includes $82.0 million related to the after-tax impacts of the termination of closed-end fund administration and servicing arrangements with Merrill Lynch, $34.3 million related to the portion of certain LTIP awards to be funded through a capital contribution of BlackRock common stock held by PNC, $12.9 million related to integration costs associated with the MLIM and Quellos Transactions and $6.4 million related to an expected contribution by Merrill Lynch to fund certain compensation of former MLIM employees. In addition, the United Kingdom and Germany enacted legislation reducing corporate income tax rates resulting in a one-time decrease of $51.4 million in income tax expense which is included in net income. MLIM and Quellos integration costs primarily include compensation costs, professional fees and rebranding costs. Net income of $322.6 million during the year ended December 31, 2006 included the after-tax impacts of the portion of certain LTIP awards to be funded through a capital contribution of $31.5 million of BlackRock common stock held by PNC, MLIM integration costs of $89.4 million and an expected contribution by Merrill Lynch of $1.2 million to fund certain compensation of former MLIM employees. Exclusive of these items, fully diluted earnings per share, as adjusted, for the year ended December 31, 2007 increased $2.84, or 53.3%, to $8.17 compared to $5.33 for the year ended December 31, 2006. Operating Margin The Company’s operating margin was 26.7% for the year ended December 31, 2007 compared to 22.5% for the year ended December 31, 2006. Operating margin for the year ended December 31, 2007 includes the impacts of $128.1 million for the termination of closed-end fund administration and servicing arrangements with Merrill Lynch, $41.6 million of closed-end fund launch costs and commissions and $20.7 million of integration costs. Operating margin for the year ended December 31, 2006 includes the impact of $15.0 million of closed-end fund launch costs and commissions and $141.9 million of integration costs. Including the impact of a $92 million increase in amortization of intangible assets associated with the MLIM and Quellos acquisitions, operating margin improved 4.2% primarily due to the reduction of integration costs as well as operating leverage associated with the growth in revenue, partially offset by the impact of the termination of certain closed-end fund administration and servicing agreements. Operating margin, as adjusted, was 37.5% and 36.7% for the years ended December 31, 2007 and 2006, respectively. Operating margin, as adjusted, is described in more detail in the Overview to Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. 43 Item 7. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Operating results for the year ended December 31, 2006, as compared with the year ended December 31, 2005 The following table presents the component changes in BlackRock’s AUM for 2006.

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Operating results for the year ended December 31, 2006, as compared with the year ended December 31, 2005 (continued) Revenue (continued) Total revenue for the year ended December 31, 2006 increased $906.6 million, or 76.1%, to $2,098.0 million, compared with $1,191.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2005. Total Investment advisory and administration fees increased $822.7 million to $1,841.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2006, compared with $1,018.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2005. Distribution fees increased by $24.6 million to $35.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2006 compared with $11.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2005. Other revenue increased by $59.4 million, or 36.7%, to $221.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2006, compared with $161.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2005. Investment advisory and administration fees The increase in total investment advisory and administration fees of $822.7 million, or 80.8%, was the result of an increase in investment advisory and administration base fees of $748.4 million, or 88.0%, to $1,598.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2006, compared with $850.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2005 along with an increase of $74.3 million in performance fees. Investment advisory and administration base fees increased in the year ended December 31, 2006 primarily due to increased AUM of $671.9 billion, including $589.2 billion of AUM acquired in the MLIM Transaction. The increase in investment advisory and administration base fees of $748.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2006 compared with the year ended December 31, 2005 consisted of increases of $449.1 million in equity and balanced products, $136.5 million in fixed income products, $97.1 million in cash management products and $65.7 million in alternative investment products. The increase in investment advisory and administration fees for equity and balanced, fixed income, cash management and alternative investment products was driven by increases in AUM of $355.4 billion, $149.6 billion, $144.1 billion and $22.8 billion, respectively, over the past twelve months, which included the AUM acquired in the MLIM Transaction on September 29, 2006. Performance fees increased by $74.3 million, or 44.2%, to $242.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2006 compared to $168.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2005 primarily due to fees earned on a large institutional real estate client account and the Company’s other alternative products. Distribution Fees Distribution fees increased by $24.6 million to $35.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2006, as compared to $11.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2005. The increase in distribution fees was primarily the result of the acquisition of distribution financing arrangements from the MLIM Transaction in the third quarter 2006. Other Revenue Other revenue of $221.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2006 increased $59.4 million compared with the year ended December 31, 2005 and primarily represents fees earned on BlackRock Solutions’ products and services of $148.0 million, property management fees of $32.1 million earned on real estate products (primarily related to reimbursement of salaries and benefits of certain Realty employees from certain real estate products), fees for fund accounting of $12.6 million and fees related to securities lending of $6.3 million. The increase in other revenue of $59.4 million, for the year ended December 31, 2006 as compared to $161.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2005 was primarily the result of an increase of $24.4 million from BlackRock Solutions’ products and services primarily driven by new Aladdin assignments, and increases of $12.6 million in fund accounting services and $6.3 million in fees earned related to securities lending. 45 Item 7.

The increase was attributable to increases in employee compensation and benefits, portfolio administration and servicing costs, general and administration expense, a fee sharing payment, and amortization of intangible assets. Integration charges related to the MLIM Transaction included $45.0 million in employee compensation and benefits and $96.9 million in general and administration expense. Employee Compensation and Benefits Employee compensation and benefits expense increased by $347.1 million, or 59.1%, to $934.9 million, at December 31, 2006 compared to $587.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2005. The increase in employee compensation and benefits was primarily attributable to increases in salaries and benefits and incentive compensation of $193.6 million and $142.8 million, respectively. The $193.6 million, increase in salaries and benefits was primarily attributable to higher staffing levels associated with business growth and the MLIM Transaction. Employees (including employees of Metric) at December 31, 2006 totaled 5,113 as compared to 2,148 at December 31, 2005. The $142.8 million, increase in incentive compensation is primarily attributable to growth in operating income and higher incentive compensation associated with performance fees earned on the Company’s alternative investment products and $45.0 million of MLIM integration costs. Portfolio Administration and Servicing Costs Portfolio administration and servicing costs increased $107.9 million to $172.5 million during the year ended December 31, 2006. These costs include payments to third parties, including Merrill Lynch and PNC, primarily associated with the administration and servicing of client investments in certain BlackRock products. Portfolio administration and servicing costs included $96.4 million of expense in the fourth quarter 2006 payable to Merrill Lynch and affiliates and $24.1 million of expense for the year ended December 31, 2006 payable to PNC and affiliates. 46 Item 7.

The increase in general and administration expense was primarily due to increases in marketing and promotional expense of $62.5 million, professional services of $54.4 million, technology expense of $38.4 million, portfolio services expense of $37.6 million, occupancy expense of $27.9 million and other general and administration expense of $16.1 million, partially offset by a reduction in closed-end fund launch costs of $1.7 million. The increase in general and administration expense included $96.9 million of integration costs primarily related to marketing and promotional and professional services in connection with the MLIM Transaction. 47 Item 7. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Operating results for the year ended December 31, 2006, as compared with the year ended December 31, 2005 (continued) General and Administration (continued) Marketing and promotional expense increased $62.5 million, or 166.4%, to $100.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2006, compared to $37.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2005 primarily due to increased marketing activities, including $29.6 million related to domestic and international marketing efforts and $32.9 million related to BlackRock’s advertising and rebranding campaign. Professional services expenses increased $54.4 million, or 296.2%, to $72.7 million compared to $18.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2005 primarily related to the MLIM Transaction. Technology expenses increased $38.4 million, to $61.0 million compared to $22.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2005 primarily related to the integration of the MLIM business. Portfolio services increased by $37.6 million to $51.7 million, relating to supporting higher AUM levels and increased trading activities of the combined Company. Occupancy costs for the year ended December 31, 2006 totaled $64.1 million, representing a $27.9 million, increase from $36.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2005. The increase in occupancy costs primarily reflects costs related to the expansion of corporate facilities as a result of the MLIM Transaction and business growth. Closed-end fund launch costs totaled $11.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2006 related to three new closed-end funds launched during the period, generating approximately $2.2 billion in AUM. Closed-end fund launch costs for the year ended December 31, 2005 totaled $13.3 million relating to four new closed-end funds launched during the period, generating $2.1 billion in AUM. Other general and administration costs increased by $16.1 million to $55.6 million from $39.5 million, as a result of increased operating growth and the MLIM Transaction.

Non-operating income, net of non-controlling interest, increased $8.3 million to $40.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2006 compared to $31.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2005 as a result of a $10.5 million increase in interest and dividend income, partially offset by a $2.0 million increase in interest expense primarily related to interest owed to Merrill Lynch on certain liabilities assumed in the MLIM Transaction and a $2.9 million decrease in net gain on investments, net of non-controlling interest. The decrease in the net gain on investments, net of non-controlling interest, was primarily due to a decrease in net investment gains on seed investments in real estate and other alternative products, partially offset by significant growth of the Company’s investments in sponsored investment products. Income Taxes Income tax expense was $189.5 million and $138.6 million for the years ended December 31, 2006 and 2005, representing effective tax rates of 37.0% and 37.2%, respectively. 49 Item 7. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Operating results for the year ended December 31, 2006, as compared with the year ended December 31, 2005 (continued) Net Income Net income totaled $322.6 million, or $3.87 per diluted share, for the year ended December 31, 2006 an increase of $88.7 million, or $0.37 per diluted share, compared to the year ended December 31, 2005. Net income for the year ended December 31, 2006 included the after-tax impacts of integration costs related to the MLIM Transaction, the portion of certain LTIP awards to be funded through a capital contribution of BlackRock common stock held by PNC, and an expected contribution by Merrill Lynch to fund certain compensation of former MLIM employees, of $89.4 million, $31.5 million and $1.2 million, respectively. MLIM integration costs primarily include compensation costs, professional fees and rebranding costs. Net income of $233.9 million during the year ended December 31, 2005 included the after-tax impacts of the portion of LTIP awards funded by a capital contribution of BlackRock stock held by PNC and SSR integration costs of $30.6 million and $5.6 million, respectively. SSR integration costs included acquisition-related payments to continuing employees of BlackRock and professional fees. Exclusive of these items, fully diluted earnings per share, as adjusted, for the year ended December 31, 2006 increased $1.30, or 32.3%, compared to the year ended December 31, 2005. Other Operating Items Support of Two Enhanced Cash Funds At December 31, 2007, BlackRock managed approximately $313 billion in cash management assets. Of this amount, approximately $1.7 billion was held by two private placement enhanced cash funds. During the third and fourth quarters, market events reduced the liquidity of certain securities, including those issued by asset-backed structured investment vehicles, held by these two funds. During 2007 BlackRock made investments in the funds to enhance fund liquidity and to facilitate redemptions. At December 31, 2007, BlackRock’s total net investment in these two funds was approximately $89 million. BlackRock also provided capital contributions totaling $24 million during 2007 to help preserve a one dollar net asset value per share for these two funds. The capital contributions resulted in an increase to general and administration expense of $24 million for 2007. In December 2007, BlackRock entered into capital support agreements with the two funds, backed by letters of credit drawn under BlackRock’s existing credit facility. Pursuant to the capital support agreements, BlackRock has agreed to make subsequent capital contributions to the funds to cover realized losses, up to $100 million, related to specified securities held by the funds. The terms of the capital support agreements expire in December 2008 unless renewed by BlackRock. In addition, due to continuing market illiquidity, BlackRock suspended cash redemptions from these two funds in December 2007. As of February 2008, subsequent to the suspension of cash redemptions, the funds distributed approximately $930 million in aggregate to investors as a result of security sales and maturities. In addition, BlackRock recorded $12 million in general and administration expense in the fourth quarter and a corresponding liability at December 31, 2007 related to the fair value of the capital support agreements with the two funds. The fair value of the potential liability related to the capital support agreements will fluctuate in subsequent periods based principally on projected cash flows of the specified securities covered by the capital support agreements and market liquidity. In addition, BlackRock may, at its option, from time to time, purchase securities from the funds at the greater of the funds’ amortized cost or fair value. In the event securities are purchased at amortized cost, a loss would be recorded based on its difference from fair value. 50 Item 7. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Other Operating Items (continued) Support of Two Enhanced Cash Funds (continued) Under FASB Interpretation No. 46(R) (“FIN 46(R)”) these two funds meet the definition of variable interest entities. In applying the provisions of FIN 46(R) the Company applies an expected loss model to the funds to determine the primary beneficiary of the funds. As a result of the application of the model, BlackRock has concluded that it is not the primary beneficiary of either fund. The Company will perform the expected loss model calculation quarterly to determine whether BlackRock is the primary beneficiary. Exposure to Collateralized Debt Obligations In the normal course of business, BlackRock manages various collateralized debt obligations (“CDOs”). A CDO is a managed investment vehicle that purchases a portfolio of assets or enters into swaps. A CDO funds its activities, through the issuance of several tranches of debt and equity, the repayment and return of which are linked to the performance of the assets in the CDO. Typically, BlackRock’s role is as collateral manager. The Company also may invest in a percentage of the debt or equity issued. These entities meet the definition of a variable interest entity under FIN 46(R). BlackRock has concluded that it is not the primary beneficiary of these CDOs, and as a result it does not consolidate these CDOs in its consolidated financial statements. At December 31, 2007, BlackRock’s carrying value on the statement of financial condition, of investments in these CDOs was approximately $10.5 million, of which approximately $9.3 million was in CDOs backed by leveraged finance assets and approximately $1.2 million backed by structured finance securities. In addition, BlackRock manages a series of credit default swap transactions, referred to collectively as the Pillars synthetic CDO transaction, which is backed by a portfolio of both investment grade corporate and structured finance exposures. In connection with the transaction, BlackRock has entered into a credit default swap with a counterparty to provide credit protection of $16.7 million, which represents the Company’s maximum risk of loss with respect to the provision of credit protection. Under the terms of its credit default swap, the Company is entitled to an annual coupon of 4% of the swap’s notional balance of $16.7 million and 25% of the structure’s residual balance at its expected termination date of December 23, 2009. Management has performed an assessment of the Company’s variable interest under FIN 46(R) and has concluded the Company is not the primary beneficiary of the CDO transaction. At December 31, 2007, the fair value of the credit default swap was approximately $4.9 million and was included on the Company’s consolidated statement of financial condition in other assets. At December 31, 2007, BlackRock’s maximum risk of loss related to CDOs was approximately $32.1 million. Liquidity and Capital Resources Capital Resources The Company manages its consolidated financial condition and funding to maintain appropriate liquidity for the business. At December 31, 2007, the Company had total cash and cash equivalents on its consolidated statements of financial condition of $1,656.2 million. Cash and cash equivalents, net of amounts in consolidated sponsored investment funds of $67.0 million and net of regulatory capital requirements ($217.4 million, partially met with cash and cash equivalents) was $1,371.8 million. In addition, at December 31, 2007, the Company had committed access to $2,100 million of undrawn cash via its 2007 five-year credit facility, resulting in cash, net of cash in consolidated sponsored investment funds and regulatory capital requirements, plus credit capacity of $3,471.8 million. Approximately $67.0 million in cash and cash equivalents and $1,054.2 million in investments included in the Company’s consolidated statement of financial condition at December 31, 2007 are held by sponsored investment funds that are consolidated by BlackRock in accordance with GAAP. The Company may not be able to access such cash or investments to use in its operating activities. In addition, a significant portion of the Company’s investments are illiquid in nature and, as such, are not readily convertible to cash. 51 Item 7. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Liquidity and Capital Resources (continued) Operating Activities Sources of BlackRock’s operating cash include investment advisory and administration fees, revenues from BlackRock Solutions’ products and services, property management fees, mutual fund distribution fees and realized earnings and distributions on certain of the Company’s investments. BlackRock primarily uses its operating cash to pay compensation and benefits, portfolio administration and servicing costs, general and administration expenses, interest on the Company’s borrowings, purchases of investments, capital expenditures, income taxes and dividends on BlackRock’s capital stock. Investment Activities At December 31, 2007, the Company had $513.9 million of various capital commitments to fund sponsored investment funds and unfunded commitments related to one private equity warehouse facility. Generally, the timing of the funding of capital commitments is uncertain and such commitments could expire before funding. The Company intends to make additional capital commitments from time to time to seed additional investment products for and with clients. At December 31, 2007, the Company had loaned approximately $79.5 million to certain funds of funds managed by the Company and warehouse entities established for such funds. At December 31, 2007, the Company had committed to make additional loans of approximately $89.6 million under the agreements. The Company anticipates making additional commitments under these facilities from time to time, but is not obligated to do so. Borrowings In December 2006, the Company entered into an unsecured revolving credit facility with a syndicate of banking institutions. This facility, as amended in February 2007 (the “2006 facility”), permitted the Company to borrow up to $800 million. In August 2007, the Company terminated the 2006 facility and entered into a new five year $2.5 billion unsecured revolving credit facility (the “2007 facility”), which permits the Company to request an additional $500 million of borrowing capacity, subject to lender credit approval, up to a maximum of $3.0 billion. The 2007 facility requires the Company not to exceed a maximum leverage ratio (ratio of net debt to EBITDA, where net debt equals total debt less domestic unrestricted cash) of 3 to 1, which was satisfied at December 31, 2007. The 2007 facility was used to refinance the 2006 facility and will provide back-up liquidity, fund ongoing working capital for general corporate purposes and fund investment opportunities. At December 31, 2007, the Company had $300 million outstanding under the 2007 facility with interest rates between 5.105% to 5.315% and maturity dates between March 2008 and September 2008 in addition to the $100 million of letters of credit outstanding related to the capital support agreements for the two enhanced cash funds. In September 2007, the Company issued $700 million in aggregate principal amount of 6.25% senior unsecured notes maturing on September 15, 2017 (the “Notes”). The Notes were issued at a discount of $5.6 million, which is being amortized over the ten-year term. A portion of the net proceeds of the Notes was used to fund the initial cash payment for the acquisition of the fund of funds business of Quellos and the remainder was used for general corporate purposes. At December 31, 2007, long-term borrowings were $947.0 million. Debt service and repayment requirements, assuming the convertible debentures (discussed later) are repaid at BlackRock’s option in 2010, are $51.0 million in 2008 and 2009, $297.7 million in 2010 and $43.8 million in 2011 and 2012. 52 Item 7. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Liquidity and Capital Resources (continued) Capital Activities In June 2007, the Company announced that it had entered into an asset purchase agreement under which it would acquire certain assets of the fund of funds business of Quellos for up to $1.719 billion. This transaction closed on October 1, 2007, and BlackRock paid Quellos $562.5 million in cash and $187.5 million in BlackRock common stock. The common stock will be held in escrow for up to three years and is available to satisfy certain indemnification obligations of Quellos under the asset purchase agreement. In addition, Quellos may receive up to an additional $969 million in a combination of cash and stock contingent upon achieving certain operating measures through December 31, 2010. On August 2, 2006, BlackRock announced that its Board of Directors had authorized a share repurchase program to purchase an additional 2.1 million shares of BlackRock common stock. Pursuant to this repurchase program, BlackRock may make repurchases from time to time, as market conditions warrant, in the open market or in privately negotiated transactions at the discretion of management. The Company repurchased 1,348,600 shares under the program in open market transactions for approximately $200.9 million through December 31, 2007. As a result, the Company is currently authorized to repurchase an additional 751,400 shares under its share repurchase program. In 2007, under the terms of the 2002 LTIP Awards, employees elected to put approximately 95% of the stock portion of the awards back to BlackRock at a total fair market value of approximately $166 million. During 2007, BlackRock paid cash dividends of $353.5 million, or 35.5% of its net income. BlackRock announced an increase to the quarterly dividend rate, effective with the March 24, 2008 payment, to $0.78 per share from $0.67 per share paid in 2007. Net Capital Requirements The Company is required to maintain net capital in certain international jurisdictions, which is met in part by retaining cash and cash equivalent investments in those jurisdictions. As a result, the Company may be restricted in its ability to transfer cash between different jurisdictions. Additionally, transfer of cash between international jurisdictions, including repatriation to the United States, may have adverse tax consequences that could discourage such transfers. At December 31, 2007, the Company was required to maintain approximately $217.4 million in net capital at these subsidiaries and is in compliance with all applicable regulatory minimum net capital requirements. 53 Item 7. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Contractual Obligations, Commitments and Contingencies The following table sets forth contractual obligations, commitments and contingencies by year of payment as of December 31, 2007: (Dollar amounts in thousands) 2008 2009 2010 2011 2012 Thereafter Total Contractual obligations and commitments: Long-term borrowings1 Long-term notes $ 43,750 $ 43,750 $ 43,750 $ 43,750 $ 43,750 $ 918,750 $ 1,137,500 Convertible debentures 6,563 6,563 253,278 — — — 266,404 Other 684 684 684 — — — 2,052 Short-term borrowings1 309,086 — — — — — 309,086 Operating leases 71,696 65,463 62,919 60,576 54,944 216,982 532,580 Purchase obligations 48,310 32,270 14,180 9,537 6,164 — 110,461 Investment / loan commitments 98,795 89,642 49,548 643 — 364,927 603,555 Total contractual obligations and commitments 578,884 238,372 424,359 114,506 104,858 1,500,659 2,961,638 Contingent obligations: Contingent distribution obligations 409,363 307,022 — — — — 716,385 Contingent payments related to business acquisitions — 295,000 10,000 595,000 — — 900,000 Total contractual obligations, commitments and contingent obligations2 $ 988,247 $ 840,394 $ 434,359 $ 709,506 $ 104,858 $ 1,500,659 $ 4,578,023 1 Amounts include principal repayments and interest payments. 2 The table above does not include: (a) approximately $61.8 million of uncertain tax positions and potential interest on such positions in accordance with FIN No. 48 and (b) $100 million related to capital support agreements for the two enhanced cash funds as the Company is unable to estimate the timing of the ultimate outcome. 54 Item 7. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Contractual Obligations, Commitments and Contingencies (continued) Long-term Notes In September 2007, the Company issued $700.0 million in aggregate principal amount of 6.25% senior unsecured notes maturing on September 15, 2017. Interest is payable semi-annually on March 15 and September 15 of each year. The Notes may be redeemed prior to maturity at any time in whole or in part at the option of the Company at a “make-whole” premium. The Notes were issued at a discount of $5.6 million, which is being amortized over their ten-year term. Convertible Debentures In February 2005, the Company issued $250.0 million aggregate principal amount of convertible debentures due in 2035 and bearing interest at a rate of 2.625% per annum. Interest is payable semi-annually in arrears on February 15 and August 15 of each year, or approximately $6.6 million per year. The convertible debentures are callable by the Company at any time on or after February 20, 2010. In addition, the convertible debentures contain certain put and conversion provisions. On the contractual obligations table above, the principal balance of the convertible debentures is assumed to be repaid at BlackRock’s option in 2010, and the related interest has been included through the call date. However, beginning in February 2009 the convertible debentures may be converted at the option of the holders. Short-term Borrowings At December 31, 2007, the Company had $300.0 million outstanding under the 2007 facility with interest rates between 5.105% to 5.315% and maturity dates between March 2008 and September 2008. Operating Leases The Company leases its primary office space and certain office equipment under agreements that currently expire through 2023. In connection with certain lease agreements, the Company is responsible for escalation payments. The contractual obligations table above includes only guaranteed minimum lease payments for such leases and does not project potential escalation or other lease-related payments. These leases are classified as operating leases and, as such, are not recorded as liabilities on the consolidated statements of financial condition. Purchase Obligations In the ordinary course of business, BlackRock enters into contracts or purchase obligations with third parties whereby the third parties provide services to or on behalf of BlackRock. Purchase obligations included in the contractual obligations table above represent executory contracts which are either non-cancelable or cancelable with a penalty. At December 31, 2007, the Company’s obligations primarily reflect standard service contracts for portfolio, market data and office related services. Purchase obligations are recorded on the Company’s financial statements only after the goods or services have been received and, as such, obligations for services not received are not included in the Company’s consolidated statement of financial condition at December 31, 2007. 55 Item 7. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Contractual Obligations, Commitments and Contingencies (continued) Investment /Loan Commitments The Company has various capital commitments to fund companies or investment funds in which it has an ownership stake as well as loan commitments to certain funds of funds managed by the Company and warehouse entities established for such funds. Generally, the timing of the funding of these commitments is unknown. Therefore, amounts are shown to be paid upon the expiration date of the commitment. Actual payments could be made at any time prior to such date and, if not called by that date, such commitments would expire. These commitments have not been recorded on the Company’s consolidated statements of financial condition at December 31, 2007. The above schedule does not include potential future commitments approved by the Company’s Capital Committee, but which are not yet legally binding commitments. BlackRock is also obligated to maintain specified ownership levels in certain investment products, which may result in additional required contributions or distributions of capital. These amounts are inherently uncertain and have been excluded from the contractual obligations schedule above. In addition, as a general partner in certain private equity partnerships, the Company receives certain carried interest distributions from the partnerships according to the provisions of the partnership agreements. The Company may, from time to time, be required to return all or a portion of such distributions to the limited partners in the event the limited partners do not achieve a certain return as specified in the various partnership agreements. Contingent Distribution Obligations BlackRock has entered into a global distribution agreement with Merrill Lynch which requires the Company to make payments to Merrill Lynch contingent upon sales of products and level of assets under management maintained in BlackRock products. The economic terms of the agreement will remain in effect until September 30, 2009. After such term, the agreement will renew for additional one-year terms, subject to certain conditions. Contingent Payments Related to Business Acquisitions Amounts included in the table above are additional contingent payments to be paid in cash related to its acquisitions of: (i) SSRM Holdings, Inc., and (ii) certain assets of Quellos. As the remaining contingent obligations are primarily dependent upon achievement of certain operating measures, the ultimate liabilities are not certain as of December 31, 2007 and have not been recorded on the Company’s consolidated statements of financial condition. The amount of contingent payments reflected for any year represents the maximum amount of cash that could be payable at the earliest possible date under the terms of the business purchase agreements. In January 2005, the Company closed its acquisition of SSRM Holdings, Inc. from MetLife for adjusted consideration of approximately $265.1 million in cash and 550,000 restricted shares of BlackRock common stock and certain additional contingent payments. On the fifth anniversary of the closing of the SSR Transaction, MetLife may be entitled to receive an additional payment of up to a maximum of $10.0 million based on the Company’s retained AUM associated with the MetLife defined benefit and defined contribution plans. In connection with the Quellos Transaction, Quellos may be entitled to receive two contingent payments upon achieving certain investment advisory revenue measures through December 31, 2010, totaling up to an additional $969 million in a combination of cash and stock. The first contingent payment, of up to $374 million, is payable up to 25% in BlackRock common stock and the remainder in cash. The second contingent payment of up to $595 million is payable in cash. At December 31, 2007, the Company believes it is likely that the first contingent payment will be paid in full, however the ultimate outcome is not certain. 56 Item 7. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Contractual Obligations, Commitments and Contingencies (continued) The following items have not been included in the contractual obligations, commitments and contingencies table: Compensation and benefit obligations The Company has various compensation and benefit obligations, including bonuses, commissions and incentive payments payable, defined contribution plan matching contribution obligations, and deferred compensation arrangements, that are excluded from the table above primarily due to uncertainties in their payout periods. These arrangements are discussed in more detail in Notes 12 and 13 to the consolidated financial statements contained herein. Accrued compensation and benefits at December 31, 2007 totaled $1,086.6 million and included incentive compensation of $834.6 million, deferred compensation of $133.0 million and other compensation and benefits related obligations of $119.0 million. Incentive compensation was primarily paid in the first quarter of 2008, while the deferred compensation obligations are generally payable over periods up to five years. Separate Account Liabilities The Company’s wholly-owned registered life insurance company in the United Kingdom maintains separate account assets representing segregated funds held for purposes of funding individual and group pension contracts. The net investment income and net realized and unrealized gains and losses attributable to these separate account assets accrue to the contract owner and, as such, an offsetting separate account liability is recorded. At December 31, 2007, the Company had $4.7 billion of assets and offsetting liabilities on the consolidated statement of financial condition. The payment of these contractual obligations is inherently uncertain and varies by customer. As such, these liabilities have been excluded from the contractual obligations table above. Indemnifications In many of the Company’s contracts, including the MLIM and Quellos Transaction agreements, BlackRock agrees to indemnify third parties under certain circumstances. The terms of the indemnities vary from contract to contract and the amount of indemnification liability, if any, cannot be determined and has not been included in the table above or recorded in the Company’s consolidated statement of financial condition at December 31, 2007. See further discussion in Note 11 to the consolidated financial statements beginning on F-1 of this Form 10-K. 57 Item 7. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Critical Accounting Policies The preparation of the consolidated financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods. Actual results could differ significantly from those estimates. Management considers the following critical accounting policies important to understanding our consolidated financial statements. For a summary of these and additional accounting policies see Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements beginning on page F-1 of this Form 10-K. Investments Consolidation of Investments The accounting method used for the Company’s investments generally is dependent upon the influence the Company has on its investee. For investments where BlackRock can exert control over the financial and operating policies of the investee, which generally exists if BlackRock has a 50% or greater voting interest, the investee is consolidated into BlackRock’s financial statements. For certain investments where the risks and rewards of ownership are not directly linked to voting interests (“variable interest entities” or “VIEs”), an investee may be consolidated if BlackRock is considered the primary beneficiary of the investee. Significant judgment is required in the determination of whether the Company is the primary beneficiary of a VIE. If the Company, with its related parties, is determined to be the primary beneficiary of a VIE, the entity will be consolidated within BlackRock’s consolidated financial statements. In order to determine whether the Company is the primary beneficiary of a VIE, management must make significant estimates and assumptions of probable future cash flows and assign probabilities to different cash flow scenarios. Assumptions made in such analyses include, but are not limited to, market prices of securities, market interest rates, potential credit defaults on individual securities or default rates on a portfolio of securities, gain realization, liquidity or marketability of certain securities, discount rates and the probability of certain other outcomes. The Company, as general partner or managing member of its funds, is generally presumed to control funds that are limited partnerships or limited liability companies. The Company reviews such investment vehicles to determine if such a presumption can be overcome by determining if other non-related party partners or members of the limited partnership or limited liability company have the substantive ability to dissolve (liquidate) the investment vehicle, or otherwise to remove BlackRock as the general partner or managing member without cause, or have substantive participating rights. If the investment vehicle is not a VIE and the presumption of control is not overcome, the investment vehicle will be consolidated into BlackRock’s financial statements. BlackRock acts as general partner or managing member for consolidated private equity funds of funds. In December 2007, BlackRock took necessary steps to grant additional rights to the third party investors in approximately 14 funds with net assets at December 31, 2007 of approximately $1 billion. The granting of these rights resulted in the deconsolidation of such investment funds from the consolidated financial statements as of December 31, 2007. 58 Item 7. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Critical Accounting Policies (continued) Fair Value of Investments BlackRock records substantially all investments on its consolidated statements of financial condition at fair value or amounts that approximate fair value. For certain investments, including investments classified as trading investments and consolidated sponsored investment funds, changes in fair value affect net income in the period of the change. For other investments classified as available-for-sale securities, changes in fair value are recorded as a component of stockholders’ equity and generally do not directly impact BlackRock’s net income until such investments are sold or are considered impaired (see below). Marketable securities are priced using publicly available market data. Non-marketable securities, however, generally are priced using a variety of methods and resources, including the most currently available net asset values or capital accounts of the investment, internal valuation models which utilize available market data and management assumptions or in the absence of other methods and resources the fair value for an investment is estimated in good faith by the Company’s management based on a number of factors including the liquidity, financial condition and current and projected operating performance of the investment. At December 31, 2007, BlackRock had approximately $2.0 billion in investments. Changes in fair value on approximately $1.736 billion of such investments will impact the Company’s consolidated statements of income and approximately $264 million will impact accumulated other comprehensive income. As of December 31, 2007, approximately $1.054 billion of such investments related to investments within consolidated funds whereby changes in fair value of such investments will impact BlackRock’s investment income and non-controlling interest expense on the consolidated statements of income. BlackRock’s net exposure to changes in fair value of such consolidated investment funds is $325 million. Equity Method Investments For equity investments where BlackRock does not control the investee, and where the Company is not the primary beneficiary of a VIE, but can exert significant influence over the financial and operating policies of the investee, the Company uses the equity method of accounting. The evaluation of whether the Company exerts control or significant influence over the financial and operational policies of its investees requires significant judgment based on the facts and circumstances surrounding each individual investment. Factors considered in these evaluations may include the type of investment, the legal structure of the investee, the terms and structure of the investment agreement including investor voting or other rights, the terms of BlackRock’s advisory agreement or other agreements with the investee, any influence BlackRock may have on the governing board of the investee, the legal rights of other investors in the entity pursuant to the fund’s operating documents and the relationship between BlackRock and other investors in the entity. Under the equity method of accounting, BlackRock’s share of the investee’s underlying net income, based upon the most currently available information, is recorded as non-operating income. At December 31, 2007 and 2006 the Company had $554.0 million and $326.5 million, respectively, of equity method investees reflected within investments. 59 Item 7. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Critical Accounting Policies (continued) Impairment of Investments The Company’s management periodically assesses impairment on its investments. If circumstances indicate that impairment may exist, investments are evaluated using market values, where available, or the expected future cash flows of the investment. If the undiscounted expected future cash flows are lower than the Company’s carrying value of the investment, an impairment charge is recorded to the consolidated statements of income. When the fair value of an available-for-sale security is lower than its cost or amortized cost value, the Company evaluates the security to determine whether the impairment is considered “other-than-temporary”. In making this determination, the Company considers, among other factors, the length of time the security has been in a loss position, the extent to which the security’s market value is less than its cost, the financial condition and near-term prospects of the security’s issuer and the Company’s ability and intent to hold the security for a length of time sufficient to allow for recovery. If the impairment is considered other-than-temporary, a charge is recorded to the consolidated statements of income. There were no impairments of investments, other than CDOs (see below), for the years ended December 31, 2007, 2006 or 2005. The Company evaluates its CDO investments for impairment quarterly throughout the term of the investment. The Company reviews cash flow estimates throughout the life of each CDO investment. If the net present value of the estimated future cash flows is lower than the carrying value of the investment and also is lower than the net present value of the previous estimate of cash flows, an impairment is considered other-than-temporary. The impairment loss is then recognized based on the excess of the carrying amount of the investment over its estimated fair value. CDO impairments were $16.4 million, $2.3 million and $0.8 million for the years ended December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively. Evaluations of impairments of securities involve significant assumptions and management judgments, which could differ from actual results and these differences could have a material impact on the Company’s consolidated statements of income. Goodwill and Intangible Assets At December 31, 2007, the carrying amounts of the Company’s goodwill and intangible assets were as follows: (Dollar amounts in thousands) December 31,2007 Goodwill $ 5,519,714 Intangible assets Indefinite–lived 5,351,132 Finite–lived, net of accumulated amortization 1,201,990 Total goodwill and intangible assets $ 12,072,836 60 Item 7. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Critical Accounting Policies (continued) Goodwill and Intangible Assets (continued) The value of contracts to manage assets in proprietary open-end funds and closed-end funds without a specified termination date is classified as an indefinite-lived intangible asset. The assignment of indefinite lives to such mutual fund contracts is based upon the assumption that there is no foreseeable limit on the contract period to manage these funds due to the likelihood of continued renewal at little or no cost. Goodwill represents the cost of a business acquisition in excess of the fair value of the net assets acquired. In accordance with SFAS No. 142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets, indefinite-lived intangible assets and goodwill are not amortized. Finite-lived management contracts are amortized over their expected useful lives, which, at December 31, 2007, ranged from less than 1 year to 20 years with a weighted average remaining estimated useful life of 8.7 years. The Company assesses its indefinite-lived management contracts and goodwill for impairment at least annually, considering factors such as AUM, product mix, projected cash flows, average base fees by product and revenue multiples to determine whether the values of each asset are impaired and whether the indefinite-life classification is still appropriate. The fair value of indefinite-lived intangible assets and goodwill is determined based on the discounted value of expected future cash flows. The fair value of finite-lived intangible assets is reviewed at least annually to determine whether circumstances exist which indicate there may be a potential impairment. If such circumstances are considered to exist, the Company will perform an impairment test, using an undiscounted cash flow analysis. If the asset is determined to be impaired, the difference between the book value of the asset and its current fair value is recognized as an expense in the period in which the impairment is determined. Expected future cash flows are estimated using many variables which require significant management judgment, including market interest rates, equity prices, credit default ratings, discount rates, revenue multiples, inflation rates and AUM growth rates. Actual results could differ from these estimates, which could materially impact the impairment conclusion. No such impairments were recorded in 2007, 2006 or 2005. In addition, management judgment is required to estimate the period over which intangible assets will contribute to the Company’s cash flows and the pattern in which these assets will be consumed. A change in the remaining useful life of any of these assets, or the reclassification of an indefinite-lived intangible asset to a finite-lived intangible asset, could have a significant impact on the Company’s amortization expense, which was $129.7 million, $37.5 million and 7.5 million for the years ended December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively. Income Taxes The Company accounts for income taxes under the asset and liability method prescribed by SFAS No. 109, Accounting for Income Taxes. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amount of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases using currently enacted tax rates. The effect of a change in tax rates on deferred tax assets and liabilities is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date. BlackRock adopted the provisions of FASB Interpretation (“FIN”) No. 48, Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes, on January 1, 2007. FIN No. 48 clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in a company’s financial statements in accordance with SFAS No. 109. FIN No. 48 prescribes a threshold and measurement attribute for recognition in the financial statements of an asset or liability resulting from a tax position taken or expected to be taken in an income tax return. FIN No. 48 also provides guidance on, among other things, de-recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities and interest and penalties on uncertain tax positions. 61 Item 7. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Critical Accounting Policies (continued) Income Taxes (continued) The application of SFAS No. 109 and FIN No. 48 requires management to make estimates of the ranges of possible outcomes, the probability of favorable or unfavorable tax outcomes and potential interest and penalties related to such unfavorable outcomes, which require significant management judgment. Actual future tax consequences of uncertain tax positions may be materially different than the Company’s current estimates. At December 31, 2007, BlackRock had $66.3 million of unrecognized tax benefits, of which $40.6 million, if recognized, would affect the effective tax rate. In accordance with SFAS No. 109, management is required to estimate the timing of the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities, make assumptions about the future deductibility of deferred tax assets and assesses deferred tax liabilities based on enacted tax rates for the appropriate tax jurisdictions to determine the amount of such deferred tax assets and liabilities. Changes in the calculated deferred tax assets and liabilities may occur in certain circumstances, including statutory income tax rate changes, statutory tax law changes, changes in the anticipated timing of recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities or changes in the structure or tax status of the Company. Such changes in circumstance would cause the Company to revalue its deferred tax balances with the resulting change impacting the income statement in the period of the change. Such changes may be material to the Company’s consolidated financial statements. At December 31, 2007, the Company had deferred tax assets of $9.1 million and deferred tax liabilities of approximately $2.1 billion. Further, the Company records its income taxes based upon its estimated income tax liability or benefit. The Company’s actual tax liability or benefit may differ from the estimated income tax liability or benefit. The Company had current income taxes receivable of approximately $47.1 million and current income taxes payable of $228.4 million at December 31, 2007. Revenue Recognition Investment advisory and administration fees are recognized as the services are performed. Such fees are primarily based on pre-determined percentages of the market value of AUM or, in the case of certain real estate separate accounts, net operating income generated by the underlying properties, and are affected by changes in AUM, including market appreciation or depreciation and net subscriptions or redemptions. Investment advisory and administration fees for mutual funds are shown net of fees waived pursuant to expense limitations or voluntary waivers. Certain real estate fees are earned upon the acquisition or disposition of properties in accordance with applicable investment management agreements and are generally recognized at the closing of the respective real estate transactions. The Company contracts with third parties, as well as related parties, for various mutual fund administration and shareholder servicing to be performed on behalf of certain funds managed by the Company. Such arrangements generally are priced as a portion of the Company’s management fee paid by the fund. In certain cases, the fund takes on the primary responsibility for payment for services such that BlackRock bears no credit risk to the third party. The Company accounts for such retrocession arrangements in accordance with Emerging Issues Task Force (“EITF”) No. 99-19, Reporting Revenue Gross as a Principal versus Net as an Agent, and records its investment advisory and administration fees net of retrocessions. Retrocessions for the year ended December 31, 2007 and 2006 were $780.4 million and $156.0 million, respectively. The Company also receives performance fees or incentive allocations from alternative investment products and certain separate accounts. These performance fees generally are earned upon exceeding specified investment return thresholds. Such fees are recorded upon completion of the measurement period. For the years ended December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005, performance fee revenue totaled $350.2 million, $242.3 million and $168.0 million, respectively. 62 Item 7. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates (continued) Revenue Recognition (continued) The Company receives carried interest from certain alternative investment funds upon exceeding performance thresholds. BlackRock may be required to return all, or part, of such carried interest depending upon future performance of these investments. BlackRock records carried interest subject to such claw-back provisions as revenue on its consolidated statements of income upon the earlier of the termination of the alternative investment fund or when the likelihood of claw-back is mathematically improbable. The Company records a deferred carried interest liability to the extent it receives cash or capital allocations prior to meeting the revenue recognition criteria. At December 31, 2007 and 2006 the Company had $28.6 million and $0, respectively of deferred carried interest recorded in other liabilities on the consolidated statements of financial condition. Adjustments to revenue arising from initial estimates historically have been immaterial since the majority of BlackRock’s investment advisory and administration revenue is calculated on the fair value of AUM and since the Company does not record revenues until performance thresholds have been exceeded and the likelihood of claw-back of carried interest is mathematically improbable. Management can give no assurance, however, that these estimates would not result in a material adjustment in the future.

Recent Accounting Developments Recent accounting developments are discussed in Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements beginning on page F-1 of this Form 10-K. 63 Item 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK As a leading investment management firm, BlackRock devotes significant resources across all of its operations to identifying, measuring, monitoring, managing and analyzing market and operating risks, including the management and oversight of its own investment portfolio. The Board of Directors of the Company has adopted guidelines for the review of investments to be made by the Company, requiring, among other things, that all investments be reviewed by the Company’s Capital Committee, which consists of senior officers of the Company, and that certain investments over prescribed thresholds receive prior approval from the Audit Committee or the Board of Directors depending on the circumstances. AUM Market Price Risk BlackRock’s investment management revenues are primarily comprised of fees based on a percentage of the value of AUM and, in some cases, performance fees expressed as a percentage of the returns realized on AUM. At December 31, 2007, the majority of our investment advisory and administration fees were based on AUM of the applicable mutual funds or separate accounts. Movements in equity market prices, interest rates, foreign exchange rates, or all three could cause the following, which would result in lower investment advisory and administration fees: • the value of AUM to decrease; • the returns realized on AUM to decrease; • clients to withdraw funds in favor of products in markets that they perceive to offer greater opportunity and that BlackRock does not serve; • clients to rebalance assets away from products that BlackRock manages into products that BlackRock does not manage; and • clients to reallocate assets away from products that earn higher fees into products with lower fees. Corporate Investments Portfolio Risks In the normal course of its business, BlackRock is exposed to equity market price risk, interest rate risk and foreign exchange rate risk associated with its corporate investments. BlackRock has investments primarily in sponsored investment products that invest in a variety of asset classes. Investments generally are made to establish a performance track record, for co-investment purposes or to hedge exposure to certain deferred compensation plans. Currently, the Company has a seed capital hedging program in which it enters into total return swaps to hedge exposure to certain equity investments. At December 31, 2007, the outstanding total return swaps had an aggregate notional value of approximately $94 million. At December 31, 2007, approximately $1,054 million of BlackRock’s total investments were maintained in sponsored investment funds that are deemed to be controlled by BlackRock in accordance with GAAP and therefore are consolidated even though BlackRock may not own a majority of such funds. The Company’s net economic exposure to its investment portfolio is as follows: (Dollar amounts in millions) December 31,2007 December 31,2006 Total investments $ 2,000 $ 2,098 Consolidated sponsored investments funds (1,054 ) (1,470 ) Net exposure to consolidated investment funds 325 325 Total net “economic” investment exposure $ 1,271 $ 953 64 Item 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK (continued) Equity Market Price Risk At December 31, 2007, the Company’s net exposure to equity price risk is approximately $835 million (net of $94 million of certain equity investments that are hedged via total return swaps) of the Company’s net economic investment exposure. The Company estimates that a 10% adverse change in equity prices would result in a decrease of approximately $83.5 million in the carrying value of such investments. Interest Rate Risk At December 31, 2007, the Company was exposed to interest-rate risk as a result of approximately $342 million of investments in debt securities and sponsored investment products that invest primarily in debt securities. Management considered a hypothetical 100 basis point fluctuation in interest rates and estimates that the impact of such a fluctuation on these investments, in the aggregate, would result in a decrease, or increase, of approximately $5.1 million in the carrying value of such investments. Foreign Exchange Rate Risk As discussed above, the Company invests in sponsored investment products that invest in a variety of asset classes. The carrying value of the net economic investment exposure denominated in foreign currencies, primarily the British pound sterling and the Euro, was $93 million. A 10% adverse change in foreign exchange rates would result in approximately a $9.3 million decline in the carrying value of such investments.",2023-12-30 18:58:33.535312

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Overview BlackRock, Inc. (“BlackRock” or the “Company”) is one of the largest publicly traded investment management firms in the United States with $1.307 trillion of assets under management (“AUM”) at December 31, 2008. BlackRock manages assets on behalf of institutional and individual investors worldwide through a variety of fixed income, cash management, equity and balanced and alternative investment separate accounts and funds. In addition, BlackRock Solutions® provides market risk management, financial strategic advisory and enterprise investment system services to a broad base of clients. Financial markets advisory services include valuation of illiquid securities, dispositions and workouts, risk management and strategic planning and execution. Severe market dislocations continued in 2008, with a broad range of markets delivering sharply negative returns. Such conditions continue to challenge investors worldwide, many of which have withdrawn from long-dated markets in favor of safe havens, such as money markets, deposits and U.S. Treasuries. The deterioration in net asset values adversely affected investors and investment managers. AUM ended the year at $1.307 trillion, down 4% since December 31, 2007. For the year, net new business totaled $167.6 billion, representing a 12% organic growth rate, which was overwhelmed by a $217.1 billion decline in asset values due to the severe fall in markets and U.S. dollar strengthening. During the last twelve months, we were awarded net inflows of $135.0 billion from U.S. investors and $32.6 billion from international investors. BlackRock Solutions had exceptionally robust results, adding 72 assignments during the year and completing 46 short-term mandates. For the year, BlackRock Solutions and advisory revenue exceeded $400 million, more than doubling the amount earned in 2007. On September 29, 2006, Merrill Lynch & Co., Inc. (“Merrill Lynch”) contributed the entities and assets that constituted its investment management business, Merrill Lynch Investment Managers (“MLIM”), to BlackRock in exchange for common and non-voting preferred stock such that immediately after such closing Merrill Lynch held approximately 45% of BlackRock’s common stock outstanding and approximately 49.3% of the Company’s capital stock on a fully diluted basis (the “MLIM Transaction”). On October 1, 2007, BlackRock acquired certain assets and assumed certain liabilities of the fund of funds business of Quellos Group, LLC (“Quellos”) for up to $1.719 billion in a combination of cash and common stock (the “Quellos Transaction”). At December 31, 2008, Merrill Lynch owned approximately 44.2% of BlackRock’s voting common stock outstanding and approximately 48.2% of the Company’s capital stock on a fully diluted basis. The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. (“PNC”) owned approximately 36.5% of BlackRock’s voting common stock outstanding and approximately 32.1% of the Company’s capital stock on a fully diluted basis. On January 1, 2009, Bank of America Corporation (“Bank of America”) acquired Merrill Lynch. In connection with this transaction, BlackRock entered into exchange agreements with each of Merrill Lynch and PNC pursuant to which each agreed to exchange a portion of the BlackRock voting common stock they hold for non-voting preferred stock. Following the closing of these exchanges on February 27, 2009, Bank of America/Merrill Lynch and PNC owned approximately 4.9% and 46.5% of BlackRock’s voting common stock, respectively. The capital stock held by Bank of America/Merrill Lynch and PNC in BlackRock remained largely unchanged at approximately 47.4% and 31.5% on a fully diluted basis, respectively. 33 Item 7.

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Overview (continued) BlackRock reports its financial results on a GAAP basis; however, management believes that evaluating the Company’s ongoing operating results may be enhanced if investors have additional non-GAAP basis financial measures. Management reviews non-GAAP financial measures to assess ongoing operations and, for the reasons described below, considers them to be effective indicators, for both management and investors, of BlackRock’s financial performance over time. BlackRock’s management does not advocate that investors consider such non-GAAP financial measures in isolation from, or as a substitute for, financial information prepared in accordance with GAAP. Certain prior period non-GAAP data has been reclassified to conform to the current presentation. Computations for all periods are derived from the Company’s consolidated statements of income as follows: (a) Operating income, as adjusted and operating margin, as adjusted: Operating income, as adjusted, equals operating income, GAAP basis, excluding certain items deemed non-recurring by management or transactions that ultimately will not impact BlackRock’s book value, as indicated in the table below. Operating income used for operating margin measurement equals operating income, as adjusted, excluding the impact of closed-end fund launch costs and commissions. Operating margin, as adjusted, equals operating income used for operating margin measurement, divided by revenue used for operating margin measurement, as indicated in the table below. Year ended 2008 2007 2006 Operating income, GAAP basis $ 1,593 $ 1,294 $ 472 Non-GAAP adjustments: Restructuring charges 38 — — PNC LTIP funding obligation 59 54 50 Merrill Lynch compensation contribution 10 10 2 MLIM/Quellos integration costs — 20 142 Termination of closed-end fund administration and servicing arrangements — 128 — Compensation expense related to (depreciation) appreciation on deferred compensation plans (38 ) 12 8 Operating income, as adjusted 1,662 1,518 674 Closed-end fund launch costs 9 36 11 Closed-end fund launch commissions — 6 3 Operating income used for operating margin measurement $ 1,671 $ 1,560 $ 688 Revenue, GAAP basis $ 5,064 $ 4,845 $ 2,098 Non-GAAP adjustments: Portfolio administration and servicing costs (598 ) (548 ) (173 ) Amortization of deferred mutual fund sales commissions (130 ) (108 ) (30 ) Reimbursable property management compensation (21 ) (27 ) (22 ) Revenue used for operating margin, as adjusted, measurement $ 4,315 $ 4,162 $ 1,873 Operating margin, GAAP basis 31.4 % 26.7 % 22.5 % Operating margin, as adjusted 38.7 % 37.5 % 36.7 % 35 Item 7. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Overview (continued) BlackRock, Inc. Financial Highlights (continued) (a) (continued) Management believes that operating income, as adjusted, and operating margin, as adjusted, are effective indicators of BlackRock’s performance over time. As such, management believes that operating income, as adjusted, and operating margin, as adjusted, provide useful disclosure to investors. Operating income, as adjusted: Restructuring charges recorded in 2008 consist of compensation costs and professional fees. MLIM and Quellos integration costs recorded in 2007 consist principally of certain professional fees, rebranding costs and compensation costs incurred in conjunction with these integrations. The expenses associated with: (i) the 2008 restructuring, (ii) MLIM and Quellos integration costs and (iii) the 2007 termination of the closed-end fund administration and servicing arrangements with Merrill Lynch have been deemed non-recurring by management and have been excluded from operating income, as adjusted, to help ensure the comparability of this information to prior periods. As such, management believes that operating margins exclusive of these costs are useful measures in evaluating BlackRock’s operating performance for the respective periods. The portion of compensation expense associated with certain long-term incentive plans (“LTIP”) that will be funded through the distribution to participants of shares of BlackRock stock held by PNC and the anticipated Merrill Lynch compensation contribution have been excluded because, exclusive of the impact related to the exercise of LTIP participants’ put options, primarily in the three months ended March 31, 2007, these charges do not impact BlackRock’s book value. Compensation expense associated with appreciation (depreciation) on assets related to certain BlackRock deferred compensation plans has been excluded as returns on investments set aside for these plans, which substantially offset this expense, are reported in non-operating income. Operating margin, as adjusted: Operating income used for measuring operating margin, as adjusted, is equal to operating income, as adjusted, excluding the impact of closed-end fund launch costs and commissions. Management believes that excluding such costs and commissions is useful because these costs can fluctuate considerably and revenues associated with the expenditure of these costs will not fully impact the Company’s results until future periods. Revenue used for operating margin, as adjusted, excludes portfolio administration and servicing costs paid to related parties and to other third parties. Management believes that excluding such costs is useful because the Company receives offsetting revenue for these services. Amortization of deferred mutual fund sales commissions is excluded from revenue used for operating margin measurement, as adjusted, because such costs, over time, offset distribution fee revenue earned by the Company. Reimbursable property management compensation represents compensation and benefits paid to personnel of Metric Property Management, Inc. (“Metric”), a subsidiary of BlackRock Realty Advisors, Inc. (“Realty”). These employees were retained on Metric’s payroll when certain properties were acquired by Realty’s clients. The related compensation and benefits were fully reimbursed by Realty’s clients and have been excluded from revenue used for operating margin, as adjusted, because they bear no economic cost to BlackRock. 36 Item 7. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Overview (continued) BlackRock, Inc. Financial Highlights (continued) (b) Non-operating income (expense), net of non-controlling interests, as adjusted: Non-operating income (expense), net of non-controlling interests, as adjusted, equals non-operating income (expense), GAAP basis, net of non-controlling interests, GAAP basis, adjusted for compensation expense associated with depreciation (appreciation) on assets related to certain BlackRock deferred compensation plans, which is recorded in operating income. This compensation expense has been included in non-operating income (expense), net of non-controlling interests, as adjusted, to offset returns on investments set aside for these plans, which are reported in non-operating income (expense), GAAP basis. Year ended December 31, 2008 2007 2006 Non-operating income (expense), GAAP basis $ (574 ) $ 529 $ 56 Non-controlling interests, GAAP basis (155 ) 364 16 Non-operating income (expense), net of non-controlling interests (419 ) 165 40 Compensation expense related to depreciation (appreciation) on deferred compensation plans 38 (12 ) (8 ) Non-operating income (expense), net of non-controlling interests, as adjusted $ (381 ) $ 153 $ 32 Management believes that non-operating income (expense), as adjusted, provides for comparability of this information to prior periods and is an effective measure for reviewing BlackRock’s non-operating contribution to its results. As compensation expense on the deferred compensation plans, which is included in operating income, offsets the gain/(loss) on the investments set aside for these plans, management believes that non-operating income (expense), net of non-controlling interests, as adjusted, provides useful measures to investors of BlackRock’s non-operating results. 37 Item 7. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Overview (continued) BlackRock, Inc. Financial Highlights (continued) (c) Net income, as adjusted: Management believes that net income, as adjusted, and diluted earnings per share, as adjusted, are useful measures of BlackRock’s profitability and financial performance. Net income, as adjusted, equals net income, GAAP basis, adjusted for significant non-recurring items as well as charges that ultimately will not impact BlackRock’s book value. Year endedDecember 31, 2008 2007 2006 Net income, GAAP basis $ 786 $ 995 $ 323 Non-GAAP adjustments, net of tax: (d) Restructuring charges 26 — — PNC’s LTIP funding obligation 39 34 32 Merrill Lynch compensation contribution 7 6 1 MLIM/Quellos integration costs — 13 89 Termination of closed-end fund administration and servicing arrangements — 82 — Corporate deferred income tax rate changes — (51 ) — Net income, as adjusted $ 858 $ 1,079 $ 445 Diluted weighted average shares outstanding (e) 132,996,426 132,088,810 83,358,394 Diluted earnings per share, GAAP basis (e) $ 5.91 $ 7.53 $ 3.87 Diluted earnings per share, as adjusted (e) $ 6.45 $ 8.17 $ 5.33 The restructuring charges and the MLIM and Quellos integration costs reflected in GAAP net income have been deemed non-recurring by management and have been excluded from net income, as adjusted, to help ensure the comparability of this information to prior reporting periods. The portion of the compensation expense associated with LTIP awards that will be funded through the distribution to participants of shares of BlackRock stock held by PNC and the anticipated Merrill Lynch compensation contribution have been excluded from net income, as adjusted, because, exclusive of the impact related to the exercise of LTIP participants’ put options, primarily in the three months ended March 31, 2007, these charges do not impact BlackRock’s book value. The termination of the closed-end fund administration and servicing arrangements with Merrill Lynch has been excluded from net income, as adjusted, as the termination of the arrangements is deemed non-recurring by management. During third quarter 2007, the United Kingdom and Germany enacted legislation reducing corporate income taxes, effective in April and January of 2008, respectively, which resulted in a revaluation of certain deferred tax liabilities. The resulting decrease in income taxes has been excluded from net income, as adjusted, as it is non-recurring and to ensure comparability to current reporting periods. (d) For the year ended December 31, 2008, non-GAAP adjustments were tax effected at 33%, BlackRock’s 2008 effective tax rate. Non-GAAP adjustments, for the year ended December 31, 2007, were tax effected at 36%, which approximated BlackRock’s 2007 effective tax rate after adjusting primarily for the impact of the United Kingdom and Germany corporate income tax rate reductions. (e) Series A non-voting participating preferred stock is considered to be a common stock equivalent for purposes of earnings per share calculations. 38 Item 7. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Overview (continued) BlackRock has portfolio managers located around the world, including the United States, the United Kingdom, The Netherlands, Japan, Hong Kong and Australia. The Company manages a wide array of taxable and tax-exempt fixed income, equity and balanced mutual funds and separate accounts, as well as a wide assortment of index-based equity and alternative investment products for a diverse global clientele. BlackRock provides global advisory services for mutual funds and other non-U.S. equivalent retail products. The Company’s non-U.S. mutual funds are based in a number of domiciles and cover a range of asset classes, including cash management, fixed income and equities. The Merrill Lynch International Investment Funds, the primary retail fund group offered outside the United States, were rebranded in April 2008 as the BlackRock Global Funds. The BlackRock Global Funds are authorized for distribution in more than 37 jurisdictions worldwide. In the United States, the primary retail offerings include various open-end and closed-end funds. Additional fund offerings include structured products, real estate funds, hedge funds, hedge funds of funds, private equity funds and funds of funds, managed futures funds and exchange funds. These products are sold to both U.S. and non-U.S. high net worth, retail and institutional investors in a wide variety of active and passive strategies covering both equity and fixed income assets. BlackRock’s client base consists of financial institutions and other corporate clients, pension funds, high net worth individuals and retail investors around the world. BlackRock maintains a significant sales and marketing presence both inside and outside the United States that is focused on establishing and maintaining retail and institutional investment management relationships by marketing its services to retail and institutional investors directly and through financial professionals, pension consultants and establishing third-party distribution relationships. BlackRock also distributes its products and services through Merrill Lynch under a global distribution agreement, which, following Bank of America’s acquisition of Merrill Lynch, runs through January 2014. After such term, the agreement will renew for one automatic three-year extension if certain conditions are met. See Note 15, Related Party Transactions, to the consolidated financial statements beginning on page F-1 of this Form 10-K. BlackRock derives a substantial portion of its revenue from investment advisory and administration base fees, which are recognized as the services are performed. Such fees are primarily based on pre-determined percentages of the market value of AUM, percentages of committed capital during investment periods of certain products, or, in the case of certain real estate equity separate accounts, net operating income generated by the underlying properties, and are affected by changes in AUM, including market appreciation or depreciation, foreign exchange gains or losses and net subscriptions or redemptions. Net subscriptions or redemptions represent the sum of new client assets, additional fundings from existing clients (including dividend reinvestment), withdrawals of assets from, and termination of, client accounts and purchases and redemptions of mutual fund shares. Market appreciation or depreciation includes current income earned on, and changes in the fair value of, securities held in client accounts. Investment advisory agreements for certain separate accounts and BlackRock’s alternative investment products provide for performance fees, based upon relative and/or absolute investment performance, in addition to base fees based on AUM. Investment advisory performance fees generally are earned after a given period of time or when investment performance exceeds certain contractual thresholds. As such, the timing of the recognition of performance fees may increase the volatility of BlackRock’s revenue and earnings. BlackRock provides a variety of risk management, investment analytic, investment system and advisory services to financial institutions, pension funds, asset managers, foundations, consultants, mutual fund sponsors, real estate investment trusts and government agencies. These services are provided under the brand name BlackRock Solutions and include a wide array of risk management services, valuation services relating to illiquid securities, disposition and workout assignments (including long-term portfolio liquidation assignments), strategic planning and execution, and enterprise investment system outsourcing for clients. Fees earned for BlackRock Solutions and advisory services are determined using some, or all, of the following methods: (i) fixed fees, (ii) percentages of various attributes of advisory assets under management and (iii) performance fees if contractual thresholds are met. 39 Item 7. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Overview (continued) Operating expenses reflect employee compensation and benefits, portfolio administration and servicing costs, amortization of deferred mutual fund sales commissions, general and administration expense and amortization of intangible assets. Employee compensation and benefits expense reflects salaries, deferred and incentive compensation, stock-based compensation and related benefit costs. Portfolio administration and servicing costs include payments made to Merrill Lynch-affiliated entities under the global distribution agreement and to PNC-affiliated entities, as well as to third parties, primarily associated with the administration and servicing of client investments in certain BlackRock products. BlackRock holds investments primarily in sponsored investment products that invest in a variety of asset classes including real estate, private equity, and hedge funds. Investments generally are made to establish a performance track record, for co-investment purposes or to hedge exposure to certain deferred compensation plans. Non-operating income (expense) includes the impact of the change in the valuations of these investments. Assets Under Management AUM for reporting purposes is generally based upon how investment advisory and administration fees are calculated for each portfolio. Net asset values, total assets, committed assets or other measures may be used to determine portfolio AUM. AUM decreased approximately $49 billion, or 4%, to $1.307 trillion at December 31, 2008, compared with $1.357 trillion at December 31, 2007. The decline in AUM was attributable to $189 billion in net market depreciation and $28 billion in net foreign exchange losses, partially offset by $168 billion in net subscriptions. BlackRock, Inc.

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Assets Under Management (continued) Market depreciation of $189 billion was primarily due to depreciation in equity and balanced AUM of $160 billion, as equity markets declined during the year ended December 31, 2008, depreciation on fixed income products of $17 billion and alternative investment products of $13 billion. The $28 billion reduction in AUM from foreign exchange was across all asset classes due to the strengthening of the U.S. dollar which resulted in foreign exchange translation loss from converting non-dollar denominated AUM into U.S. dollars. Net subscriptions of $168 billion for the year ended December 31, 2008 were attributable to net new business of $145 billion in long-term advisory liquidation assignments, $26 billion in cash management products and $3 billion in alternative investment products, partially offset by $7 billion of net outflows in fixed income products.

Business Outlook As fiscal 2009 began, domestic and international markets continued to reflect a difficult market environment due to a downturn in the global economy. Illiquid capital markets, lack of financing and forced deleveraging have resulted in extreme price declines across many asset classes. The U.S. housing market and credit markets continue to be ongoing concerns, and revelations of a massive alleged hedge fund fraud (in which none of BlackRock’s funds of funds were invested) have contributed to investors, industry-wide, seeking to redeem hedge fund and fund of funds holdings in record numbers. The timing and direction of volatile markets, investment performance and new client asset flows will continue to impact the revenue the Company recognizes. The direction of markets, particularly real estate and private equity, will also affect the valuation of the assets on the Company’s balance sheet. The Company notes that the global recession, declining asset values, the liquidity crunch and associated market disruption have impacted our business, including the value and mix of AUM and associated base fees. AUM and base fees may be affected by further market changes during the remainder of 2009. • The build-up of institutional liquidity assets experienced since the fourth quarter of 2007 may be temporary, as these assets are expected to be redeployed to longer-dated strategies as market conditions stabilize. The Company’s strategic focus on performance, globalization and product diversification, client service and independent advice may enable it to retain a portion of these assets. 42 Item 7. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Business Outlook (continued) • The liquidity crunch and associated market disruption have given rise to greater demand for our advisory services, marrying our extensive capital markets and structuring expertise with rigorous modeling and analytical capabilities. While we anticipate demand for these services to remain high through the volatile markets, demand may return to historical levels should market concerns ease. A meaningful percentage of BlackRock Solutions and advisory revenues in 2008 was composed of one-time advisory and portfolio structuring fees. Because this type of revenue is non-recurring, it is dependent on new assignments which may or may not continue, particularly at the same pace. • Alternative investment products with performance fee hurdles based on absolute performance measures and high water marks may not contribute performance fee revenue at levels that the Company has earned in prior periods. • The value of the Company’s co-investments in alternative products may continue to decline as the underlying value in certain assets classes, particularly real estate and private equity, continue to decline. • In early 2009, returns on many major equity indices have continued to decline from year-end 2008, which may impact the Company’s revenue in future periods. • The Company will continue to assess the appropriateness of its cost structure relative to the external environment. The Company may decide to take additional measures to reduce costs. While any measure would be expected to lower the cost base over time, certain measures may or may not have upfront implementation costs. • Given the severity of the market-driven revenue impacts mentioned above, the operating margins of the Company would be expected to decline, even in the face of cost saving measures. • There may be certain circumstances in which the Company may consider temporarily waiving fees on certain products. If these circumstances were to occur and fee waivers were to be granted, the revenues of the Company would be adversely affected. • The effective tax rate of the Company is affected, among other things, by the geographic distribution of earnings and global changes in tax legislation. The effective tax rate may vary from period to period as a result of these factors. 43 Item 7. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Operating results for the year ended December 31, 2008, as compared with the year ended December 31, 2007 Revenue Year endedDecember 31, Variance (Dollar amounts in millions) 2008 2007 Amount % Investment advisory and administration fees: Fixed income $ 892 $ 901 $ (9 ) (1 )% Equity and balanced 2,101 2,218 (117 ) (5 )% Cash management 708 520 188 36 % Alternative investment products 531 371 160 43 % Investment advisory and administration base fees 4,232 4,010 222 6 % Fixed income 4 4 — 0 % Equity and balanced 95 107 (12 ) (11 )% Alternative investment products 78 239 (161 ) (67 )% Investment advisory performance fees 177 350 (173 ) (49 )% Total investment advisory and administration fees 4,409 4,360 49 1 % BlackRock Solutions and advisory 406 198 208 105 % Distribution fees 139 123 16 13 % Other revenue 110 164 (54 ) (32 )% Total revenue $ 5,064 $ 4,845 $ 219 5 % Total revenue for the year ended December 31, 2008 increased $219 million, or 5%, to $5,064 million, compared with $4,845 million for the year ended December 31, 2007. The $219 million increase was primarily the result of a $208 million increase in BlackRock Solutions and advisory revenue and a $49 million increase in total investment advisory and administration fees, partially offset by a $54 million decrease in other revenue. Investment Advisory and Administration Fees The increase in investment advisory and administration fees of $49 million, or 1%, was the result of an increase in investment advisory and administration base fees of $222 million, or 6%, to $4,232 million for the year ended December 31, 2008, compared with $4,010 million for the year ended December 31, 2007, partially offset by a decrease of $173 million in investment advisory performance fees. The increase in investment advisory and administration base fees of $222 million for the year ended December 31, 2008, compared with the year ended December 31, 2007, consisted of increases in base fees of $188 million in cash management products and $160 million in alternative investment products, partially offset by decreases of $117 million in equity and balanced products and $9 million in fixed income products. Investment advisory and administration base fees increased for the year ended December 31, 2008 primarily as a result of increased average AUM in 2008 compared to 2007 for cash management products due to net subscriptions and alternative investment products due to the full year impact of the Quellos Transaction, offset by lower fees in equity and balanced products due to the impact of market depreciation on AUM. 44 Item 7. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Operating results for the year ended December 31, 2008, as compared with the year ended December 31, 2007 (continued) Revenue (continued) Investment Advisory and Administration Fees (continued) Investment advisory performance fees decreased by $173 million, or 49%, to $177 million for the year ended December 31, 2008, as compared to $350 million for the year ended December 31, 2007 primarily as a result of lower investment advisory performance fees earned on other alternative investment products, including real estate funds, fixed income hedge funds and international equity products. BlackRock Solutions and Advisory BlackRock Solutions and advisory revenue of $406 million for the year ended December 31, 2008 increased $208 million, or 105%, compared with the year ended December 31, 2007. The increase in BlackRock Solutions and advisory revenue was primarily the result of additional advisory assignments and Aladdin® assignments during the period. A portion of the revenue earned on advisory assignments was comprised of one-time advisory and portfolio structuring fees and ongoing fees based on AUM of the respective portfolio assignments. Distribution Fees Distribution fees increased by $16 million to $139 million for the year ended December 31, 2008, as compared to $123 million for the year ended December 31, 2007. The increase in distribution fees is primarily due to the full-year impact of the acquisition of distribution financing arrangements from PNC in second quarter 2007, which resulted in the Company receiving distribution fees from such arrangements, as well as an increase in contingent deferred sales commissions as a result of redemptions in certain share classes of open-ended funds. Other Revenue Other revenue of $110 million for the year ended December 31, 2008 decreased $54 million, or 32%, compared with the year ended December 31, 2007. Other revenue represents property management fees of $31 million earned on real estate products (primarily related to reimbursement of salaries and benefits of certain Metric employees from certain real estate products), $25 million of net interest related to securities lending, $23 million of unit trust sales commissions and $31 million of other revenue, including fund accounting services. The decrease in other revenue of $54 million for the year ended December 31, 2008, as compared to the year ended December 31, 2007, was primarily the result of a decrease in fees earned for fund accounting services of $16 million, a $14 million decline in other advisory service fees earned in 2007, a $12 million decline in unit trust sales commissions and a $7 million decline in property management fees primarily related to the termination in the fourth quarter of 2008 of certain Metric contracts with BlackRock real estate clients. Certain Metric employees have been transferred to a third party, which will provide to real estate clients the property management services formerly provided by Metric. At December 31, 2008, Metric had no remaining employees. 45 Item 7.

The decrease was attributable to a one-time expense of $128 million related to the termination of certain closed-end fund administration and servicing arrangements in 2007 and a $125 million decrease in general and administration expenses, partially offset by increases in portfolio administration and servicing costs, employee compensation and benefits, restructuring charges, amortization of deferred mutual fund sales commissions, and amortization of intangible assets. The year ended December 31, 2007, included $20 million of MLIM and Quellos integration costs, which were primarily recorded in general and administration expense. Employee Compensation and Benefits Employee compensation and benefits expense increased $48 million, or 3%, to $1,815 million at December 31, 2008, compared to $1,767 million for the year ended December 31, 2007. The increase in employee compensation and benefits expense was primarily attributable to a $91 million increase in salaries and benefits offset by a $38 million decrease in deferred compensation which is primarily linked to depreciation on assets related to certain deferred compensation plans. The increase of $91 million in salaries and benefits was primarily due to an increase in headcount throughout the majority of 2007 and 2008 (including the impact associated with the fund of funds acquisition in 2007). Full time employees at December 31, 2008 totaled 5,341 (including the impact of a reduction in force in the fourth quarter) as compared to 5,952 (including Metric) at December 31, 2007. The decline in deferred compensation of $38 million is substantially offset by the change in valuations of investments set aside for these plans, which are included in non-operating income (expense). 46 Item 7. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Operating results for the year ended December 31, 2008, as compared with the year ended December 31, 2007 (continued) Expenses (continued) Portfolio Administration and Servicing Costs Portfolio administration and servicing costs increased $49 million, or 9%, to $597 million during the year ended December 31, 2008, compared to $548 million for the year ended December 31, 2007. These costs include payments to Merrill Lynch under the global distribution agreement, and payments to PNC as well as other third parties, primarily associated with the administration and servicing of client investments in certain BlackRock products. The $49 million increase related primarily to higher levels of average AUM in cash management products. Portfolio administration and servicing costs for the year ended December 31, 2008 included $464 million of costs attributable to Merrill Lynch and affiliates and $30 million of costs attributable to PNC and affiliates as compared to $444 million and $28 million, respectively, in the year ended December 31, 2007. The increased costs attributable to Merrill Lynch is offset by approximately $10 million expense reduction associated with the 2007 termination of closed-end fund administration and servicing arrangements. Portfolio administration and servicing costs related to other non-related third parties increased $30 million as a result of an expansion of distribution platforms. Amortization of Deferred Mutual Fund Sales Commissions Amortization of deferred mutual fund sales commissions increased by $22 million to $130 million for the year ended December 31, 2008, as compared to $108 million for the year ended December 31, 2007. The increase in amortization of deferred mutual fund sales commissions was primarily the result of the acquisition of distribution financing arrangements from PNC in second quarter 2007 as well as higher sales and redemptions in certain share classes of open-ended funds.

Other general and administration costs decreased $75 million, or 50%, to $78 million from $153 million, primarily related to a $49 million decrease in foreign currency remeasurement costs and $26 million decrease in costs associated with the support of two enhanced cash funds. Closed-end funds launch costs decreased $27 million as compared to the year ended December 31, 2007 due to three closed-end funds launched during the year ended December 31, 2007, which generated approximately $3.0 billion in AUM as compared to two closed-end funds launched in the year ended December 31, 2008, which generated approximately $400 million in AUM. Professional services decreased $17 million, or 18%, to $77 million compared to $94 million for the year ended December 31, 2007 primarily due to decreases in accounting, tax and other consulting costs related to the MLIM integration in 2007. Marketing and promotional expenses decreased $13 million, or 8%, primarily due to a decline in travel and promotional expenses. The decrease was partially offset by an $8 million, or 6%, increase in occupancy expenses to $138 million compared to $130 million for the year ended December 31, 2007 as a result of expansion of offices worldwide (including the full-year impact of the Quellos Transaction). Restructuring Charges For the year ended December 31, 2008, BlackRock recorded pre-tax restructuring charges of $38 million, primarily related to severance, outplacement costs and accelerated amortization of certain previously granted stock awards associated with a 9% reduction in work force. See Restructuring charges discussion in Note 18 to the consolidated financial statements beginning on page F-1 of this Form 10-K. Termination of Closed-end Fund Administration and Servicing Arrangements For the year ended December 31, 2007, BlackRock recorded a one-time expense of $128 million related to the termination of administration and servicing arrangements with Merrill Lynch on 40 closed-end funds with original terms of 30-40 years. Amortization of Intangible Assets The $16 million increase in the amortization of intangible assets to $146 million for the year ended December 31, 2008, compared to $130 million for the year ended December 31, 2007, primarily reflects the full-year impact of the amortization of finite-lived intangible assets acquired in the Quellos Transaction. 48 Item 7.

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Operating results for the year ended December 31, 2008, as compared with the year ended December 31, 2007 (continued) Non-Operating Income (Expense), Net of Non-Controlling Interests (continued) Non-operating income, net of non-controlling interests, decreased $584 million to $419 million of expense for the year ended December 31, 2008, as compared to non-operating income, net of non-controlling interests of $165 million for the year ended December 31, 2007. The decrease in net non-operating income primarily reflects declines in valuations from seed investments and co-investments in real estate funds, private equity and hedge funds/funds of hedge funds (which includes the impact of a $141 million decline in valuations of distressed credit products) and a $50 million decline in valuations of investments associated with certain deferred compensation plans. In addition, net interest expense increased $26 million primarily related to incremental interest expense related to the full year impact of the issuance of long-term debt in September 2007. Income Taxes Income tax expense was $388 million and $464 million for the years ended December 31, 2008 and 2007, respectively. The effective income tax rate for the year ended December 31, 2008 was 33.0%, as compared to 31.8% for the year ended December 31, 2007. The increase in the effective income tax rate was primarily the result of a one-time tax benefit of $51 million recognized in 2007 due to tax legislation changes enacted in the third quarter 2007 in the United Kingdom and Germany, which resulted in a revaluation of certain deferred tax liabilities. Accordingly, BlackRock revalued its deferred tax liabilities in these jurisdictions. Excluding this deferred income tax benefit, the 2007 adjusted effective tax rate was 35.3%. The effective income tax rate for the year ended December 31, 2008 declined as compared to the 2007 adjusted effective tax rate, primarily as a result of the impact of foreign taxes. Operating Income and Operating Margin GAAP Operating income totaled $1,593 million for the year ended December 31, 2008, which was an increase of $299 million compared to the year ended December 31, 2007. The Company’s operating margin was 31.4% for the year ended December 31, 2008, compared to 26.7% for the year ended December 31, 2007. Operating income and operating margin for the year ended December 31, 2008 included the impact of a $50 million foreign currency remeasurement benefit and a $38 million deferred compensation benefit due to depreciation on assets related to certain deferred compensation plans, offset by $38 million of restructuring charges. Operating income and operating margin for the year ended December 31, 2007 included the impact related to the termination of certain closed-end fund servicing and administration arrangements of $128 million, $42 million of closed-end fund launch costs and commissions and $20 million of MLIM integration costs. As Adjusted Operating income, as adjusted, totaled $1,662 million for the year ended December 31, 2008, which was an increase of $144 million compared to the year ended December 31, 2007. Operating margin, as adjusted, was 38.7% and 37.5% for the years ended December 31, 2008 and 2007, respectively. The growth of operating income, as adjusted, and operating margin, as adjusted, for the year ended December 31, 2008 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2007 is primarily related to the impact of $219 million of revenue growth (including the full year impact of the Quellos Transaction) and the impact of a $49 million decline in foreign currency remeasurement costs, offset by a $91 million increase in salaries and benefits and a $16 million increase in amortization of finite-lived intangible assets primarily associated with the Quellos Transaction. Operating income, as adjusted, and operating margin, as adjusted, are described in more detail in the Overview to Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. 50 Item 7.

Net income totaled $786 million, or $5.91 per diluted share, for the year ended December 31, 2008, which was a decrease of $209 million, or $1.62 per diluted share, compared to the year ended December 31, 2007. Net income for the year ended December 31, 2008 included the after-tax impact of the portion of LTIP awards which will be funded through a capital contribution of BlackRock stock held by PNC, an expected contribution by Merrill Lynch to fund certain compensation of former MLIM employees and restructuring charges of $39 million, $7 million, and $26 million, respectively.

Operating results for the year ended December 31, 2007 reflect the full year impact of the MLIM Transaction, which closed on September 29, 2006. With the exception of BlackRock Solutions and advisory, the magnitude of the acquired business is the primary driver of most line item variances in the analysis below comparing the year ended December 31, 2007 to the year ended December 31, 2006. Certain prior year amounts have been reclassified to conform to the current presentation.

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Operating results for the year ended December 31, 2007, as compared with the year ended December 31, 2006 (continued) Revenue (continued) Total revenue for the year ended December 31, 2007 increased $2,747 million, or 131%, to $4,845 million, compared with $2,098 million for the year ended December 31, 2006. The $2,747 million increase was primarily the result of a $2,519 million increase in total investment advisory and administration fees, an $87 million increase in distribution fees, a $50 million increase in BlackRock Solutions and advisory, and a $91 million increase in other revenue. Investment Advisory and Administration Fees The increase in investment advisory and administration fees of $2,519 million, or 137%, was the result of an increase in investment advisory and administration base fees of $2,411 million, or 151%, to $4,010 million for the year ended December 31, 2007, compared with $1,599 million for the year ended December 31, 2006, along with an increase of $108 million in investment advisory performance fees. Investment advisory and administration base fees increased for the year ended December 31, 2007 primarily due to the MLIM Transaction, which added $589 billion in AUM on September 29, 2006 and additional increased AUM of $232 billion during 2007. The increase in investment advisory and administration base fees of $2,411 million for the year ended December 31, 2007, compared with the year ended December 31, 2006 consisted of increases of $1,593 million in equity and balanced products, $317 million in cash management products, $311 million in fixed income products, and $190 million in alternative investment products. The increase in investment advisory and administration base fees for all products was driven by AUM acquired in the MLIM Transaction on September 29, 2006, as well as increases in AUM of $66 billion, $65 billion, $78 billion and $23 billion, respectively, over the past twelve months, which includes the $22 billion of alternative investment AUM acquired in the Quellos Transaction. Investment advisory performance fees increased by $108 million, or 45%, to $350 million for the year ended December 31, 2007, compared to $242 million for the year ended December 31, 2006 primarily due to higher performance fees on equity and fixed income hedge funds, as well as real estate equity products. BlackRock Solutions and Advisory BlackRock Solutions and advisory revenue of $198 million for the year ended December 31, 2007 increased $50 million, or 34%, compared with the year ended December 31, 2006. The increase in BlackRock Solutions and advisory revenue was primarily the result of additional advisory and Aladdin assignments during the period. Distribution Fees Distribution fees increased by $87 million to $123 million for the year ended December 31, 2007, as compared to $36 million for the year ended December 31, 2006. The increase in distribution fees is primarily due to the acquisition of distribution financing arrangements from the MLIM Transaction in third quarter 2006 and from PNC in second quarter 2007, which resulted in the Company receiving distribution fees from such arrangements. Other Revenue Other revenue of $164 million for the year ended December 31, 2007 increased $91 million compared with the year ended December 31, 2006. Other revenue represents property management fees of $38 million earned on real estate products (primarily related to reimbursement of salaries and benefits of certain Metric employees from certain real estate products), fees for fund accounting of $27 million, net interest related to securities lending of $27 million and $14 million for other advisory service fees. 53 Item 7. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Operating results for the year ended December 31, 2007, as compared with the year ended December 31, 2006 (continued) Revenue (continued) The increase in other revenue of $91 million, or 125%, for the year ended December 31, 2007 as compared to $73 million for the year ended December 31, 2006 was primarily the result of an increase of $25 million in unit trust sales commissions, an increase of $21 million in fees earned related to securities lending, a $15 million increase in fund accounting services, and a $14 million increase for other advisory service fees. Expenses (Dollar amounts in millions) Year endedDecember 31, Variance 2007 2006 Amount % Expenses: Employee compensation and benefits $ 1,767 $ 934 $ 833 89 % Portfolio administration and servicing costs 548 173 375 217 % Amortization of deferred mutual fund sales commissions 108 30 78 260 % General and administration 870 417 453 109 % Termination of closed-end fund administration and servicing arrangements 128 — 128 NM Fee sharing payment — 34 (34 ) (100 )% Amortization of intangible assets 130 38 92 242 % Total expenses $ 3,551 $ 1,626 $ 1,925 118 % NM – Not Meaningful Total expenses, which reflect the full-year impact of the MLIM Transaction on September 29, 2006, increased $1,925 million, or 118%, to $3,551 million for the year ended December 31, 2007, compared with $1,626 million for the year ended December 31, 2006. Total expenses included integration charges related to the MLIM Transaction of $20 million and $142 million in 2007 and 2006, respectively. The year ended December 31, 2007 included $20 million of total MLIM and Quellos integration charges primarily in general and administration, compared to integration charges of $45 million related to employee compensation and benefits and $97 million related to general and administration, respectively, in the year ended December 31, 2006. Employee Compensation and Benefits Employee compensation and benefits increased by $833 million, or 89%, to $1,767 million, at December 31, 2007 compared to $934 million for the year ended December 31, 2006. The increase in employee compensation and benefits was primarily attributable to increases in incentive compensation, salaries and benefits and stock-based compensation of $406 million, $368 million and $66 million, respectively. The $406 million, increase in incentive compensation is primarily attributable to higher operating income and direct incentives associated with higher performance fees earned on the Company’s alternative investment products. The $368 million increase in salaries and benefits was primarily attributable to higher staffing levels associated with the MLIM and Quellos Transactions and business growth. Employees (including employees of Metric) at December 31, 2007 totaled 5,952 as compared to 5,113 at December 31, 2006. 54 Item 7. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Operating results for the year ended December 31, 2007, as compared with the year ended December 31, 2006 (continued) Expenses (continued) Portfolio Administration and Servicing Costs Portfolio administration and servicing costs increased $375 million to $548 million during the year ended December 31, 2007, compared to $173 million for the year ended December 31, 2006. These costs include payments to Merrill Lynch under the global distribution agreement, and payments to PNC as well as other third parties, primarily associated with the administration and servicing of client investments in certain BlackRock products. Portfolio administration and servicing costs for the year ended December 31, 2007 included $444 million of costs attributable to Merrill Lynch and affiliates and $28 million of costs attributable to PNC and other affiliates as compared to $96 million and $25 million, respectively, in the year ended December 31, 2006. Portfolio administration and servicing costs related to other non-related parties increased $28 million as a result of an expansion of distribution platforms. Amortization of Deferred Mutual Fund Sales Commissions Amortization of deferred mutual fund sales commissions increased by $78 million to $108 million for the year ended December 31, 2007, as compared to $30 million for the year ended December 31, 2006. The increase in amortization of deferred mutual fund sales commissions was primarily the result of the acquisition of distribution financing arrangements from MLIM at the end of third quarter 2006 and from PNC in second quarter 2007. General and Administration Expense (Dollar amounts in millions) Year endedDecember 31, Variance 2007 2006 Amount % General and administration expense: Portfolio services $ 170 $ 52 $ 118 228 % Marketing and promotional 169 100 69 69 % Occupancy 130 64 66 103 % Technology 118 61 57 93 % Professional services 94 73 21 30 % Closed-end fund launch costs 36 11 25 207 % Other general and administration 153 56 97 177 % Total general and administration expense $ 870 $ 417 $ 453 109 % General and administration expense increased $453 million, or 109%, for the year ended December 31, 2007 to $870 million, compared to $417 million for the year ended December 31, 2006. 55 Item 7. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Operating results for the year ended December 31, 2007, as compared with the year ended December 31, 2006 (continued) Expenses (continued) General and Administration Expense (continued) Portfolio services costs increased by $118 million to $170 million, relating to supporting higher AUM levels and increased trading activities. Marketing and promotional expense increased $69 million, or 69%, to $169 million for the year ended December 31, 2007, compared to $100 million for the year ended December 31, 2006 primarily due to increased marketing activities, including $85 million related to domestic and international marketing efforts, partially offset by a decrease of $16 million related to BlackRock’s advertising and rebranding campaign in 2006. Occupancy costs for the year ended December 31, 2007 totaled $130 million, representing a $66 million, or 103%, increase from $64 million for the year ended December 31, 2006. The increase in occupancy costs primarily reflects costs related to the expansion of corporate facilities as a result of the MLIM and Quellos Transactions and business growth. Technology expenses increased $57 million, or 93%, to $118 million compared to $61 million for the year ended December 31, 2006 primarily due to a $13 million increase in technology consulting expenses, a $19 million increase in hardware depreciation expense and a $15 million increase in software licensing and maintenance costs. Closed-end fund launch costs totaled $36 million for the year ended December 31, 2007 relating to three new closed-end funds launched during the year, generating approximately $3.0 billion in AUM. Closed-end fund launch costs for the year ended December 31, 2006 totaled $11 million relating to three new closed-end funds launched during the period, generating $2.2 billion in AUM. Professional services increased $21 million, or 30%, to $94 million compared to $73 million for the year ended December 31, 2006 primarily due to increased accounting, tax and legal services necessary to support business growth. Other general and administration costs increased by $97 million to $153 million from $56 million, including $24 million of capital contributions to two enhanced cash funds in support of fund net asset values and a $12 million charge reflecting the valuation of capital support agreements covering certain securities remaining in the funds and a $32 million increase in office related expenses. Termination of Closed-end Fund Administration and Servicing Arrangements For the year ended December 31, 2007, BlackRock recorded an expense of $128 million related to the termination of administration and servicing arrangements with Merrill Lynch on 40 closed-end funds with original terms of 30-40 years.

Amortization of Intangible Assets The $92 million increase in the amortization of intangible assets to $130 million for the year ended December 31, 2007, compared to $38 million for the year ended December 31, 2006, primarily reflects amortization of finite-lived intangible assets acquired in the MLIM and Quellos Transactions. 56 Item 7.

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Operating results for the year ended December 31, 2007, as compared with the year ended December 31, 2006 (continued) Non-Operating Income, Net of Non-Controlling Interests (continued) Non-operating income, net of non-controlling interests, increased $125 million to $165 million for the year ended December 31, 2007, compared to $40 million for the year ended December 31, 2006 as a result of a $121 million increase in net gain on investments, net of non-controlling interests, and a $45 million increase in interest and dividend income, partially offset by a $39 million increase in interest expense primarily related to borrowings under BlackRock’s revolving credit agreement and the $700 million issuance of long-term debt in September 2007. The increase in net gain on investments, net of non-controlling interests, was primarily due to market appreciation and investment gains from seed investments in private equity products, real estate equity products and other alternative products including hedge funds and funds of funds, partially offset by $14 million of increased impairments related to seed investments in collateralized debt obligations. Income Taxes Income tax expense was $464 million and $189 million for the years ended December 31, 2007 and 2006, respectively, representing effective income tax rates of 31.8% and 37.0%, respectively. The reduction in the effective tax rate is primarily the result of a one-time deferred income tax benefit of $51 million, recognized in the third quarter of 2007, due to tax legislation changes enacted in third quarter 2007 in the United Kingdom and Germany that reduced corporate income tax rates in those jurisdictions in 2008. Accordingly, BlackRock revalued its deferred tax liabilities in these jurisdictions. Excluding this deferred income tax benefit, the 2007 adjusted effective tax rate was 35.3%. Operating Income and Operating margin GAAP Operating income totaled $1,294 million for the year ended December 31, 2007 which was an increase of $822 million compared to the year ended December 31, 2006. Operating margin was 26.7% for the year ended December 31, 2007 compared to 22.5% for the year ended December 31, 2006. Operating income and operating margin for the year ended December 31, 2007 reflect the impact of $128 million for the termination of closed-end fund administration and servicing arrangements with Merrill Lynch, $42 million of closed-end fund launch costs and commissions, $20 million of integration costs, as well as the full year impact of the MLIM Transaction. Operating income and operating margin for the year ended December 31, 2006 reflect $142 million of integration costs, $14 million of closed-end fund launch costs and commissions, the impact of the MLIM Transaction subsequent to closing on September 29, 2006, as well as a $34 million fee sharing payment in conjunction with the SSR Transaction. As Adjusted Operating income, as adjusted, totaled $1,518 million for the year ended December 31, 2007 which was an increase of $844 million compared to the year ended December 31, 2006. Operating margin, as adjusted, was 37.5% and 36.7% for the years ended December 31, 2007 and 2006, respectively. Operating income and operating margin, as adjusted, for the year ended December 31, 2007 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2006 include the full year impact of the MLIM Transaction, as well as the impact of the Quellos Transaction which closed on October 1, 2007.

Net income for the year ended December 31, 2007 includes $82 million related to the after-tax impacts of the termination of closed-end fund administration and servicing arrangements with Merrill Lynch, $34 million related to the portion of certain LTIP awards to be funded through a capital contribution of BlackRock common stock held by PNC, $13 million related to integration costs associated with the MLIM Transactions and $6 million related to an expected contribution by Merrill Lynch to fund certain compensation of former MLIM employees. In addition, the United Kingdom and Germany enacted legislation reducing corporate income tax rates resulting in a one-time decrease of $51 million in income tax expense which is included in net income. MLIM integration costs primarily include compensation costs, professional fees and rebranding costs. Net income of $323 million during the year ended December 31, 2006 included the after-tax impacts of the portion of certain LTIP awards to be funded through a capital contribution of $32 million of BlackRock common stock held by PNC, MLIM integration costs of $89 million and an expected contribution by Merrill Lynch of $1 million to fund certain compensation of former MLIM employees. Exclusive of these items, fully diluted earnings per share, as adjusted, for the year ended December 31, 2007 increased $2.84, or 53%, to $8.17 compared to $5.33 for the year ended December 31, 2006. Liquidity and Capital Resources Operating Activities Sources of BlackRock’s operating cash include investment advisory and administration fees, revenues from BlackRock Solutions and advisory products and services, mutual fund distribution fees and realized earnings and distributions on the Company’s investments. BlackRock primarily uses its cash to pay compensation and benefits, portfolio administration and servicing costs, general and administration expenses, interest on the Company’s borrowings, purchases of co- and seed investments, capital expenditures, income taxes and dividends on BlackRock’s capital stock. 59 PART I — FINANCIAL INFORMATION (continued) Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (continued) Liquidity and Capital Resources (continued) BlackRock Cash Flows Excluding the Impact of Consolidated Sponsored Investment Funds In accordance with GAAP, certain BlackRock sponsored investment funds are consolidated into the consolidated financial statements of BlackRock, notwithstanding the fact that BlackRock may only have a minority economic interest in these funds. As a result, BlackRock’s consolidated statements of cash flows include the cash flows of consolidated sponsored investment funds. The Company uses an adjusted cash flow, which excludes the impact of consolidated sponsored investment funds, as a supplemental non-GAAP measure to assess liquidity and capital requirements. The Company believes that its cash flows, excluding the impact of the consolidated sponsored investment funds, provide investors with useful information on the cash flows of BlackRock relating to our ability to fund additional operating, investing and financing activities. BlackRock’s management does not advocate that investors consider such non-GAAP measures in isolation from, or as a substitute for, its cash flows presented in accordance with GAAP. The following table presents a reconciliation of the Company’s consolidated statements of cash flows presented on a GAAP basis to the Company’s consolidated statements of cash flows, excluding the impact on cash flows of consolidated sponsored investment funds: Year EndedDecember 31, 2008 (Dollar amounts in millions) GAAPBasis Impact onCash Flows ofConsolidatedSponsoredInvestmentFunds Cash FlowsExcludingImpact ofConsolidatedSponsoredInvestmentFunds Cash flows from operating activities $ 1,916 $ 413 $ 1,503 Cash flows from investing activities (394 ) (9 ) (385 ) Cash flows from financing activities (887 ) (410 ) (477 ) Effect of exchange rate changes on cash and cash equivalents (259 ) — (259 ) Net change in cash and cash equivalents 376 (6 ) 382 Cash and cash equivalents, beginning of period 1,656 67 1,589 Cash and cash equivalents, end of period $ 2,032 $ 61 $ 1,971 Cash and cash equivalents, excluding cash held by consolidated sponsored investment funds, at December 31, 2008 increased $382 million from December 31, 2007, primarily resulting from $1,503 million of cash inflows from operating activities, offset by $385 million of cash outflows from investing activities, $477 million of cash outflows from financing activities, and a $259 million decrease due to the effect of foreign exchange rates. 60 PART I — FINANCIAL INFORMATION (continued) Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (continued) Liquidity and Capital Resources (continued) BlackRock Cash Flows Excluding the Impact of Consolidated Sponsored Investment Funds (continued) Cash inflows from operating activities, excluding the impact of consolidated sponsored investment funds, for the year ended December 31, 2008, primarily include the receipt of investment advisory and administration fees and other revenue offset by the payment of operating expenses incurred in the normal course of business. Cash flows from operating activities, excluding the impact of consolidated sponsored investment funds, in the year ended December 31, 2008 included cash payments related to year end incentive compensation that is paid in the first quarter. Cash outflows from investing activities, excluding the impact of consolidated sponsored investment funds, for the year ended December 31, 2008 primarily include net purchases of investments that are made to establish a performance track record, to co-invest with clients or to hedge exposure to certain deferred compensation plans. Cash outflows from financing activities, excluding the impact of consolidated sponsored investment funds, for the year ended December 31, 2008 primarily include $419 million of payments for cash dividends and a net $100 million repayment of short-term borrowings. Capital Resources The Company manages its consolidated financial condition and funding to maintain appropriate liquidity for the business. Capital resources at December 31, 2008 and 2007 were as follows: December 31,2008 December 31,2007 Cash and cash equivalents $ 2,032 $ 1,656 Cash and cash equivalents held by consolidated sponsored investment funds1 (61 ) (67 ) Regulatory capital2 (172 ) (217 ) 2007 credit facility - undrawn3,4 2,171 2,100 Committed access $ 3,970 $ 3,472 1 The Company may not be able to access such cash to use in its operating activities. 2 Partially met with cash and cash equivalents. 3 Net of outstanding letters of credit totaling $0 million and $100 million at December 31, 2008 and 2007, respectively. 4 Excludes $129 million of undrawn amounts at December 31, 2008 related to Lehman Commercial Paper, Inc. In addition, a significant portion of the Company’s $1,011 million of net economic investments are illiquid in nature and, as such, may not be readily convertible to cash. Short-term Borrowings In August 2007, the Company entered into a five-year $2.5 billion unsecured revolving credit facility (the “2007 facility”), which permits the Company to request an additional $500 million of borrowing capacity, subject to lender credit approval, up to a maximum of $3 billion. The 2007 facility requires the Company not to exceed a maximum leverage ratio (ratio of net debt to EBITDA, where net debt equals total debt less domestic unrestricted cash) of 3 to 1, which was satisfied with a ratio of less than 0.5 to 1 at December 31, 2008. At December 31, 2008, the Company had $200 million outstanding under the 2007 facility with an interest rate of 0.61% and a maturity date during January 2009. During January 2009, the Company rolled over the $200 million in borrowings with an interest rate of 0.56% and a maturity date during February 2009. 61 Item 7. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Liquidity and Capital Resources (continued) Short-term Borrowings (continued) Lehman Commercial Paper Inc. has a $140 million participation under the 2007 facility; however, BlackRock does not expect that Lehman Commercial Paper Inc. will honor its commitment to fund additional amounts. In addition, in December 2007, in order to support two enhanced cash funds that BlackRock manages, BlackRock elected to procure two letters of credit under the 2007 facility in an aggregate amount of $100 million. In December 2008, the letters of credit were terminated. In June 2008, BlackRock Japan Co., Ltd., a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company, entered into a five billion Japanese yen commitment-line agreement with a banking institution (the “Japan Commitment-line”). The term of the Japan Commitment-line is one year and interest will accrue at the applicable Japanese short-term prime rate. The Japan Commitment-line is intended to provide liquidity flexibility for operating requirements in Japan. At December 31, 2008, the Company had no borrowings outstanding under the Japan Commitment-line. Conversion of Convertible Debentures During 2008 During October 2008, the convertible debentures became convertible at the option of the holders into cash and shares of the Company’s common stock after the trustee determined that the trading price for the convertible debentures on each day of a five consecutive trading day period was less than 103% of the product of the last reported sale price of the Company’s common stock on such date and the conversion rate on such date. During the conversion period holders of $0.5 million of convertible debentures elected to convert their holdings into cash and shares. Support of Two Enhanced Cash Funds At December 31, 2008, BlackRock managed approximately $338 billion in cash management assets. Of this amount, approximately $350 million was held by two private placement enhanced cash funds. During 2007 and 2008, market events reduced the liquidity of certain securities, including securities issued by asset-backed structured investment vehicles held by these two funds. During 2007, BlackRock made investments in the funds to enhance fund liquidity and to facilitate redemptions. At December 31, 2008, BlackRock’s total net investment in these two funds was approximately $82 million. BlackRock also provided capital contributions in 2007 and 2008 totaling $24 million and $3 million, respectively, to help preserve a one dollar net asset value per share for these two funds. These capital contributions resulted in an increase to general and administration expense. In December 2007, BlackRock entered into capital support agreements with the two funds, backed by letters of credit drawn under BlackRock’s existing credit facility. Pursuant to the capital support agreements, BlackRock agreed to make subsequent capital contributions to the funds to cover realized losses, up to $100 million, related to specified securities held by the funds. In December 2008, BlackRock’s maximum potential obligation under the capital support agreements was reduced to $45 million, and in January 2009, one capital support agreement was terminated, due to the closure of the related fund, leaving only one capital support agreement, with a total $20 million potential obligation outstanding. Subsequent to December 31, 2008, the funds distributed approximately $100 million in aggregate to investors as a result of security sales and maturities. 62 Item 7. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Liquidity and Capital Resources (continued) Support of Two Enhanced Cash Funds (continued) BlackRock recorded $12 million and $7 million in general and administration expense in 2007 and 2008, respectively, and a corresponding liability at December 31, 2008 related to the fair value of the capital support agreements with the two funds. The fair value of the potential liability related to the capital support agreements will fluctuate in subsequent periods based principally on projected cash flows of the specified securities covered by the capital support agreements and market liquidity. In addition, BlackRock may, at its option, from time to time, purchase securities from the funds at the greater of the funds’ amortized cost or fair value. In the event securities are purchased at amortized cost, a loss would be recorded based on the difference from fair value. During 2008, BlackRock purchased one security resulting in $6 million of non-operating losses. At December 31, 2008, in applying the provisions of Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) Interpretation No. 46(R), Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities (“FIN 46(R)”), BlackRock concluded that it is the primary beneficiary of the two enhanced cash funds which resulted in consolidation of the funds on its consolidated statement of financial condition. At December 31, 2007, BlackRock concluded it was not the primary beneficiary of these funds. Exposure to Collateralized Debt Obligations In the normal course of business, BlackRock acts as a collateral manager to various CDOs. A CDO is a managed investment vehicle that purchases a portfolio of assets or enters into swaps. A CDO funds its activities through the issuance of several tranches of debt and equity, the repayment and return of which are linked to the performance of the assets in the CDO. The Company also may invest in a portion of the debt or equity issued. These entities meet the definition of a variable interest entity under FIN 46(R). BlackRock has concluded that it is not the primary beneficiary of these CDOs, and as a result it does not consolidate these CDOs on its consolidated financial statements. At December 31, 2008, BlackRock’s carrying value of investments in these CDOs on the statement of financial condition was approximately $4 million. In addition, BlackRock manages a series of credit default swap transactions, referred to collectively as the Pillars synthetic CDO transaction, which is backed by a portfolio of both investment grade corporate and structured finance exposures. In connection with the transaction, BlackRock has entered into a credit default swap with a counterparty to provide credit protection of $17 million, which represents the Company’s maximum risk of loss with respect to the provision of credit protection. At December 31, 2008, the fair value of the credit default swap was approximately $0.5 million and was included on the Company’s consolidated statement of financial condition in other liabilities. At December 31, 2008, BlackRock’s maximum risk of additional loss related to CDOs was approximately $20 million. Capital Activities On August 2, 2006, BlackRock announced that its Board of Directors had authorized a share repurchase program to purchase an additional 2.1 million shares of BlackRock common stock. Pursuant to this repurchase program, BlackRock may make repurchases from time to time, as market conditions warrant, in the open market or in privately negotiated transactions at the discretion of management. The Company repurchased 1,348,600 shares under the program in open market transactions for approximately $200.9 million through December 31, 2008. The Company did not repurchase any shares under the program during 2008. As a result, the Company is currently authorized to repurchase an additional 751,400 shares under its share repurchase program. 63 Item 7. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Liquidity and Capital Resources (continued) Net Capital Requirements The Company is required to maintain net capital in certain international jurisdictions, which is met in part by retaining cash and cash equivalent investments in those jurisdictions. As a result, the Company may be restricted in its ability to transfer cash between different jurisdictions. Additionally, transfers of cash between international jurisdictions, including repatriation to the United States, may have adverse tax consequences that could discourage such transfers. At December 31, 2008, the Company was required to maintain approximately $172 million in net capital at these subsidiaries and is in compliance with all applicable regulatory minimum net capital requirements. Contractual Obligations, Commitments and Contingencies The following table sets forth contractual obligations, commitments and contingencies by year of payment as of December 31, 2008: (Dollar amounts in millions) 2009 2010 2011 2012 2013 Thereafter Total Contractual obligations and commitments: Long-term borrowings1 Long-term notes $ 44 $ 44 $ 44 $ 44 $ 44 $ 875 $ 1,095 Convertible debentures 257 — — — — — 257 Other 1 1 — — — — 2 Short-term borrowings 200 — — — — — 200 Operating leases 62 58 55 50 47 274 546 Purchase obligations 35 18 7 3 — — 63 Investment / loan commitments 9 49 16 1 34 192 301 Total contractual obligations and commitments 608 170 122 98 125 1,341 2,464 Contingent obligations: Contingent distribution obligations 401 401 401 401 401 — 2,005 Contingent payments related to business acquisitions 285 10 595 — — — 890 Total contractual obligations, commitments and contingent obligations2 $ 1,294 $ 581 $ 1,118 $ 499 $ 526 $ 1,341 $ 5,359 1 Amounts include principal repayments and interest payments. 2 The table above does not include: (a) approximately $76 million of uncertain tax positions and potential interest on such positions in accordance with FIN No. 48 and (b) $45 million related to capital support agreements (of which $25 million terminated in January 2009) for the two enhanced cash funds as the Company is unable to estimate the timing of the ultimate outcome. 64 Item 7. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Contractual Obligations, Commitments and Contingencies (continued) Long-term Borrowings Long-term Notes At December 31, 2008, long-term borrowings were $946 million. Debt service and repayment requirements, assuming the Company’s 2.625% Convertible Debenture due 2035 (the “convertible debentures”) are converted at the option of the holders in 2009 are $302 million in 2009, $45 million in 2010 and $44 million in each of 2011, 2012 and 2013. In September 2007, the Company issued $700 million in aggregate principal amount of 6.25% senior unsecured notes maturing on September 15, 2017 (the “Notes”). A portion of the net proceeds of the Notes was used to fund the initial cash payment for the acquisition of the fund of funds business of Quellos and the remainder was used for general corporate purposes. Interest is payable semi-annually on March 15 and September 15 of each year. The Notes may be redeemed prior to maturity at any time in whole or in part at the option of the Company at a “make-whole” premium. The Notes were issued at a discount of $6 million, which is being amortized over the ten-year term. Convertible Debentures In February 2005, the Company issued $250 million aggregate principal amount of convertible debentures due in 2035 and bearing interest at a rate of 2.625% per annum. Interest is payable semi-annually in arrears on February 15 and August 15 of each year, or approximately $6.5 million per year. The convertible debentures are callable by the Company at any time on or after February 20, 2010. In addition, the convertible debentures contain certain put and conversion provisions. However, beginning in February 2009 the convertible debentures became convertible at the option of the holders. On the contractual obligations table above, the remaining $249.5 million principal balance of the convertible debentures is assumed, although not determined, to be repaid in 2009. Short-term Borrowings At December 31, 2008, the Company had $200 million outstanding under the 2007 facility with an interest rate of 0.61% and a maturity date during January 2009. During January 2009, the Company rolled over the $200 million in borrowings with an interest rate of 0.56% and maturity date during February 2009. Operating Leases The Company leases its primary office space under agreements that currently expire through 2023. In connection with certain lease agreements, the Company is responsible for escalation payments. The contractual obligations table above includes only guaranteed minimum lease payments for such leases and does not project potential escalation or other lease-related payments. These leases are classified as operating leases and, as such, are not recorded as liabilities on the consolidated statements of financial condition. Purchase Obligations In the ordinary course of business, BlackRock enters into contracts or purchase obligations with third parties whereby the third parties provide services to or on behalf of BlackRock. Purchase obligations included in the contractual obligations table above represent executory contracts which are either non-cancelable or cancelable with a penalty. At December 31, 2008, the Company’s obligations primarily reflect standard service contracts for portfolio, market data and office related services. Purchase obligations are recorded on the Company’s financial statements only after the goods or services have been received and, as such, obligations for services not received are not included in the Company’s consolidated statement of financial condition at December 31, 2008. 65 Item 7. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Contractual Obligations, Commitments and Contingencies (continued) Investment /Loan Commitments At December 31, 2008, the Company had $292 million of various capital commitments to fund sponsored investment funds. Generally, the timing of the funding of these commitments is unknown. Therefore, amounts are shown to be paid upon the expiration date of the commitment. Actual payments could be made at any time prior to such expiration date and, if not called by that date, such commitments would expire. These commitments have not been recorded on the Company’s consolidated statements of financial condition at December 31, 2008. The above schedule does not include potential future commitments approved by the Company’s Capital Committee, but which are not yet legally binding commitments. The Company intends to make additional capital commitments from time to time to fund additional investment products for, and with, its clients. At December 31, 2008, the Company had loans outstanding of approximately $167 million to a warehouse entity established for certain private equity funds of funds, which was included in due from related parties on the Company’s consolidated statement of financial condition. At December 31, 2008, the Company was not committed to make additional loans to the warehouse entity. In January 2009, approximately $29 million was repaid while the remainder is expected to be fully repaid on, or about, March 31, 2009. At December 31, 2008, the Company was committed to provide financing to Anthracite Capital, Inc. (“Anthracite”), a specialty commercial real estate finance company that is managed by a subsidiary of BlackRock, of up to $60 million until March 2010. The financing is collateralized by Anthracite pledging its ownership interest in an investment fund which is also managed by a subsidiary of BlackRock. At December 31, 2008, $30 million of financing was outstanding, which matures in April 2009 at an interest rate of 6.02%, which was included in due from related parties on the Company’s consolidated statement of financial condition. Subsequent to December 31, 2008, Anthracite borrowed an additional $3.5 million, which matures in April 2009, at a current interest rate of 4.76%. The $33.5 million of financing outstanding may be renewed upon maturity for an additional period of time. As a general partner in certain private equity partnerships, the Company receives certain carried interest distributions from the partnerships according to the provisions of the partnership agreements. The Company may, from time to time, be required to return all or a portion of such distributions to the limited partners in the event the limited partners do not achieve a certain return as specified in the various partnership agreements. Contingent Distribution Obligations BlackRock has entered into an Amended and Restated global distribution agreement with Merrill Lynch which requires the Company to make payments to Merrill Lynch contingent upon sales of products and level of assets under management maintained in BlackRock products. The economic terms of the agreement will remain in effect until January 2014. After such term, the agreement will renew for one automatic 3-year extension if certain conditions are satisfied. The above schedule reflects the Company’s estimate for 2009, which due to uncertainty of future sales and asset levels, has been held constant for 2010 through 2013. Contingent Payments Related to Business Acquisitions Amounts included in the table above are additional contingent payments to be paid in cash related to its acquisitions of: (i) SSRM Holdings, Inc. and (ii) certain assets of Quellos. As the remaining contingent obligations are primarily dependent upon achievement of certain operating measures, the ultimate liabilities are not certain as of December 31, 2008 and have not been recorded on the Company’s consolidated statements of financial condition. The amount of contingent payments reflected for any year represents the maximum amount of cash that could be payable at the earliest possible date under the terms of the business purchase agreements. 66 Item 7. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Contractual Obligations, Commitments and Contingencies (continued) Contingent Payments Related to Business Acquisitions (continued) SSRM Holdings: In January 2005, the Company closed its acquisition of SSRM Holdings, Inc. from MetLife for adjusted consideration of approximately $265 million in cash and 550,000 restricted shares of BlackRock common stock and certain additional contingent payments. In January 2010, the fifth anniversary of the closing of the SSR Transaction, MetLife may be entitled to receive an additional payment of up to a maximum of $10 million based on the Company’s retained AUM associated with the MetLife defined benefit and defined contribution plans. Quellos: In connection with the Quellos Transaction, Quellos may be entitled to receive two contingent payments upon achieving certain investment advisory base and performance fee measures through December 31, 2010, totaling up to an additional $969 million in a combination of cash and stock. The first contingent payment, of up to $374 million, is payable in April 2009 up to 25% in BlackRock common stock and the remainder in cash. As of December 31, 2008, it is estimated that the first contingent payment will equal approximately $300 million, of which $11 million has been paid in cash during 2008. Of the remaining $289 million, $217 million will be paid in cash and $72 million in common stock based on a price of $157.33 in April 2009. The ultimate amount of the first contingent payment will not be certain until March 31, 2009. The second contingent payment, of up to $595 million, is payable in cash in 2011. Quellos may also be entitled to a “catch-up” payment in 2011 if certain investment advisory base fee measures are met through 2010 to the extent that the value of the first contingent payment is less than $374 million. A portion of the second contingent payment, not to exceed $90 million, may be paid to Quellos based on factors including continued employment with BlackRock. Therefore, this portion, not to exceed $90 million, would be recorded as employee compensation. On the contractual obligation table above, the maximum remaining payments are included for each contingent payment. The following items have not been included in the contractual obligations, commitments and contingencies table: Impact Investing In connection with the Impact Investing acquisition, the Company may be required to make several additional contingent payments, which are not expected to be material, upon completion of certain operating measures through 2010. Currently, the payments are anticipated to be recorded as employee compensation. Compensation and Benefit Obligations The Company has various compensation and benefit obligations, including bonuses, commissions and incentive payments payable, defined contribution plan matching contribution obligations, and deferred compensation arrangements, that are excluded from the table above primarily due to uncertainties in their payout periods. These arrangements are discussed in more detail in Notes 13 and 14 to the consolidated financial statements beginning on page F-1 of this Form 10-K. Accrued compensation and benefits at December 31, 2008 totaled $826 million and included incentive compensation of $645 million, deferred compensation of $71 million and other compensation and benefits related obligations of $110 million. Incentive compensation was primarily paid in the first quarter of 2009, while the deferred compensation obligations are generally payable over periods up to five years. 67 Item 7. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Contractual Obligations, Commitments and Contingencies (continued) Separate Account Liabilities The Company’s wholly-owned registered life insurance company in the United Kingdom maintains separate account assets representing segregated funds held for purposes of funding individual and group pension contracts. The net investment income and net realized and unrealized gains and losses attributable to these separate account assets accrue to the contract owner and, as such, an offsetting separate account liability is recorded. At December 31, 2008, the Company had $2.6 billion of assets and offsetting liabilities on the consolidated statement of financial condition. The payment of these contractual obligations is inherently uncertain and varies by customer. As such, these liabilities have been excluded from the contractual obligations table above. Indemnifications In many of the Company’s contracts, including the MLIM and Quellos Transaction agreements, BlackRock agrees to indemnify third parties under certain circumstances. The terms of the indemnities vary from contract to contract and the amount of indemnification liability, if any, cannot be determined and has not been included in the table above or recorded in the Company’s consolidated statement of financial condition at December 31, 2008. See further discussion in Note 12 to the consolidated financial statements beginning on page F-1 of this Form 10-K. Critical Accounting Policies The preparation of the consolidated financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods. Actual results could differ significantly from those estimates. Management considers the following critical accounting policies important to understanding the consolidated financial statements. For a summary of these and additional accounting policies see Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements beginning on page F-1 of this Form 10-K. Investments Consolidation of Investments The accounting method used for the Company’s investments generally is dependent upon the influence the Company has over its investee. For investments where BlackRock can exert control over the financial and operating policies of the investee, which generally exists if there is a 50% or greater voting interest or if partners or members of certain products do not have substantive rights, the investee is consolidated into BlackRock’s financial statements. Pursuant to FIN 46(R), for certain investments where the risks and rewards of ownership are not directly linked to voting interests (“variable interest entities” or “VIEs”), an investee may be consolidated if BlackRock is considered the primary beneficiary of the VIE. The primary beneficiary of a VIE is the party that absorbs a majority of the entity’s expected losses, receives a majority of the entity’s expected residual returns or both as a result of holding variable interests. Significant judgment is required in the determination of whether the Company is the primary beneficiary of a VIE. If the Company, and its related parties, is determined to be the primary beneficiary of a VIE, the entity will be consolidated within BlackRock’s consolidated financial statements. In order to determine whether the Company is the primary beneficiary of a VIE, management must make significant estimates and assumptions of probable future cash flows and assign probabilities to different cash flow scenarios. Assumptions made in such analyses include, but are not limited to, market prices of securities, market interest rates, potential credit defaults on individual securities or default rates on a portfolio of securities, gain realization, liquidity or marketability of certain securities, discount rates and the probability of certain other outcomes. 68 Item 7. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Critical Accounting Policies (continued) Investments (continued) Consolidation of Investments (continued) At December 31, 2008, the Company applied an expected loss model to certain VIEs and determined that it is the primary beneficiary of two enhanced cash funds and one private equity fund of funds, resulting in the consolidation of the funds on its consolidated statement of financial condition. The Company, as general partner or managing member of its funds, is generally presumed to control funds that are limited partnerships or limited liability companies. Pursuant to Emerging Issues Task Force (“EITF”) Issue No. 04-5, Determining Whether a General Partner, or the General Partners as a Group, Controls a Limited Partnership or Similar Entity When the Limited Partners Have Certain Rights, the Company reviews such investment vehicles to determine if such a presumption can be overcome by determining if other non-affiliated partners or members of the limited partnership or limited liability company have the substantive ability to dissolve (liquidate) the investment vehicle, or otherwise to remove BlackRock as the general partner or managing member without cause based on a simple unaffiliated majority vote, or have substantive participating rights. If the investment vehicle is not a VIE and the presumption of control is not overcome, the investment vehicle will be consolidated into BlackRock’s financial statements. BlackRock acts as general partner or managing member for consolidated private equity funds. In December 2008, BlackRock took necessary steps to grant additional rights to the unaffiliated investors in three funds with net assets at December 31, 2008 of approximately $210 million. The granting of these rights resulted in the deconsolidation of such investment funds from the consolidated financial statements as of December 31, 2008. At December 31, 2008 and 2007, as a result of consolidation of various investment products, the Company had the following balances on its consolidated statements of financial condition: December 31,2008 December 31,2007 Cash and cash equivalents $ 61 $ 67 Investments 728 1,054 Other net assets (liabilities) 12 (218 ) Non-controlling interests (491 ) (578 ) Total exposure to consolidated investment funds $ 310 $ 325 The Company has retained the specialized accounting of these investment funds pursuant to EITF No. 85-12, Retention of Specialized Accounting for Investments in Consolidation. 69 Item 7. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Critical Accounting Policies (continued) Investments (continued) Equity Method Investments For equity investments where BlackRock does not control the investee, and where the Company is not the primary beneficiary of a VIE, but can exert significant influence over the financial and operating policies of the investee, the Company uses the equity method of accounting. The evaluation of whether the Company exerts control or significant influence over the financial and operational policies of its investees requires significant judgment based on the facts and circumstances surrounding each individual investment. Factors considered in these evaluations may include the type of investment, the legal structure of the investee, the terms and structure of the investment agreement including investor voting or other rights, the terms of BlackRock’s advisory agreement or other agreements with the investee, any influence BlackRock may have on the governing board of the investee, the legal rights of other investors in the entity pursuant to the fund’s operating documents and the relationship between BlackRock and other investors in the entity. Substantially all of BlackRock’s equity method investees are investment companies which record its underlying investments at fair value. Therefore, under the equity method of accounting, BlackRock’s share of the investee’s underlying net income predominantly represents fair value adjustments in the investments held by the equity method investees. BlackRock’s share of the investee’s underlying net income or loss is based upon the most currently available information and is recorded as non-operating income (expense) for investments in investment companies, or as other revenue for operating or advisory company investments, which are recorded in other assets, since such operating or advisory companies are considered to be integral to BlackRock’s core business. At December 31, 2008, the Company had $501 million and $16 million of equity method investees reflected within investments and other assets, respectively, and at December 31, 2007 the Company had $517 million and $5 million of equity method investees reflected in investments and other assets, respectively. Impairment of Investments The Company’s management periodically assesses its equity method, available-for-sale and cost investments for impairment. If circumstances indicate that impairment may exist, investments are evaluated using market values, where available, or the expected future cash flows of the investment. If the undiscounted expected future cash flows are lower than the Company’s carrying value of the investment, an impairment charge is recorded to the consolidated statements of income. When the fair value of an available-for-sale security is lower than its cost or amortized cost value, the Company evaluates the security to determine whether the impairment is considered “other-than-temporary”. In making this determination, the Company considers, among other factors, the length of time the security has been in a loss position, the extent to which the security’s market value is less than its cost, the financial condition and near-term prospects of the security’s issuer and the Company’s ability and intent to hold the security for a period of time sufficient to allow for recovery of such unrealized losses. If the impairment is considered other-than-temporary, a charge is recorded to the consolidated statements of income. The Company evaluates its CDO investments for impairment quarterly throughout the term of the investment. The Company reviews cash flow estimates throughout the life of each CDO investment. If the net present value of the estimated future cash flows is lower than the carrying value of the investment and also is lower than the net present value of the previous estimate of cash flows, an impairment is considered other-than-temporary. The impairment loss is then recognized based on the excess of the carrying amount of the investment over its estimated fair value. 70 Item 7. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Critical Accounting Policies (continued) Impairment of Investments (continued) For the years ended December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006, the Company recorded other-than-temporary impairments of $8 million, $16 million and $2 million, respectively, related to debt securities and CDO available-for-sale investments. The other-than-temporary impairments are due to a reduction in estimated cash flows of CDO investments as well as adverse credit conditions for a debt instrument that was purchased from an enhanced cash management fund in which the Company determined that it did not have the ability to hold the securities for a period of time sufficient to allow for recovery of such unrealized losses. Evaluations of securities impairments involves significant assumptions and management judgments, which could differ from actual results, and these differences could have a material impact on the Company’s consolidated statements of income. Fair Value Measurements BlackRock adopted Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (“SFAS”) No. 157, Fair Value Measurements (“SFAS No. 157”) as of January 1, 2008, which requires, among other things, enhanced disclosures about investments that are measured and reported at fair value. SFAS No. 157 establishes a hierarchy that prioritizes inputs to valuation techniques used to measure fair value and requires companies to disclose the fair value of their financial instruments according to a fair value hierarchy (i.e., Level 1, 2, and 3 inputs, as defined). The fair value hierarchy gives the highest priority to quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities and the lowest priority to unobservable inputs. Additionally, companies are required to provide enhanced disclosure regarding instruments in the Level 3 category (which have inputs to the valuation techniques that are unobservable and require significant management judgment), including a reconciliation of the beginning and ending balances separately for each major category of assets and liabilities. Financial instruments measured and reported at fair value are classified and disclosed in one of the following categories: Level 1 Inputs – Quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities at the reporting date. Level 1 assets include listed mutual funds, equities and certain debt securities. Level 2 Inputs – Quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets; quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities that are not active; and inputs other than quoted prices that are observable, such as models or other valuation methodologies. Assets which generally are included in this category may include short-term floating rate notes and asset-backed securities held by a consolidated sponsored cash management fund, securities held within consolidated hedge funds, certain limited partnership interests in hedge funds in which the valuations for substantially all of the investments within the fund are based upon Level 1 or Level 2 inputs, as well as restricted public securities valued at a discount. Level 3 Inputs – Unobservable inputs for the valuation of the asset or liability. Level 3 assets include investments for which there is little, if any, market activity. These inputs require significant management judgment or estimation. Assets included in this category generally include general and limited partnership interests in private equity funds, funds of private equity funds, real estate funds, hedge funds, and funds of hedge funds. The Company’s assessment of the significance of a particular input to the fair value measurement in its entirety requires judgment and considers factors specific to the financial instrument. 71 Item 7. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Critical Accounting Policies (continued) Fair Value Measurements (continued) BlackRock records substantially all investments on its consolidated statements of financial condition at fair value or amounts that approximate fair value. For certain investments, including investments classified as trading investments, equity method investments and consolidated sponsored investment funds, changes in fair value affect net income in the period of the change. For other investments classified as available-for-sale securities, changes in fair value are recorded as a component of stockholders’ equity and generally do not directly impact BlackRock’s net income until such investments are sold or are considered impaired (see below). Marketable securities are priced using publicly available market data. Non-marketable securities, however, generally are priced using a variety of methods and resources, including the most currently available net asset values or capital accounts of the investment, valuation services from third party providers, internal valuation models which utilize available market data and management assumptions or, in the absence of other market data and resources, the fair value for an investment is estimated in good faith by the Company’s management based on a number of factors, including the liquidity, financial condition and current and projected operating performance of the investment. Changes in fair value on approximately $1.3 billion of investments will impact the Company’s non-operating income (expense) and approximately $100 million will impact accumulated other comprehensive income. As of December 31, 2008, changes in fair value of approximately $728 million of such investments within consolidated sponsored investment funds will also impact BlackRock’s non-controlling interests expense on the consolidated statements of income. BlackRock’s net exposure to changes in fair value of such consolidated sponsored investment funds is $310 million. BlackRock’s $813 million of Level 3 investments at December 31, 2008 primarily include co-investments in real estate equity products, private equity fund of funds and private equity funds, funds of hedge funds as well as funds that invest in distressed credit and mortgage securities. Many of these investees are investment companies which record their underlying investments at fair value based on fair value policies established by management of the underlying fund, which could include BlackRock employees. Fair value policies at the underlying fund generally utilize pricing information from third party sources, however, in some instances current valuation information, for illiquid securities or securities in markets that are not active, may not be available from any third party source or fund management may conclude that the valuations that are available from third party sources are not reliable. In these instances fund management may perform model-based analytical valuations that may be used to value these investments. During the year ended December 31, 2008, the Company reclassified approximately $29 million of net investments out of Level 3. The majority of the net reclassification was related to equity method investments which the Company uses that certain significant inputs, including performance attributes, for the fair value measurement of these investments that became observable. In addition, during the year ended December 31, 2008, the Company deconsolidated three private equity funds that held at time of deconsolidation approximately $200 million of Level 3 investments. BlackRock reports its investments on a GAAP basis, which includes investment balances which are owned by sponsored investment funds that are deemed to be controlled by BlackRock in accordance with GAAP and therefore are consolidated even though BlackRock may not own a majority of such funds. As a result, management reviews its investments on an “economic” basis, which eliminates the portion of investments that do not impact BlackRock’s book value. BlackRock’s management does not advocate that investors consider such non-GAAP measures in isolation from, or as a substitute for, financial information prepared in accordance with GAAP. 72 Item 7. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Critical Accounting Policies (continued) Fair Value Measurements (continued) The following table represents investments measured at fair value on a recurring basis at December 31, 2008: (Dollar amounts in millions) Quoted Pricesin ActiveMarkets forIdenticalAssets(Level 1) SignificantOtherObservableInputs(Level 2) SignificantUnobservableInputs(Level 3) OtherInvestmentsNot Held atFair Value (3) Investments atDecember 31, 2008 Total investments, GAAP $ 176 $ 400 $ 813 $ 40 $ 1,429 Net assets for which the Company does not bear “economic” exposure (1) (6 ) (255 ) (157 ) — (418 ) Net “economic” investments (2) $ 170 $ 145 $ 656 $ 40 $ 1,011 (1) Consists of net assets attributable to non-controlling investors of consolidated sponsored investment funds. (2) Includes BlackRock’s portion of cash and cash equivalents, other assets, accounts payable and accrued liabilities, and other liabilities that are consolidated from sponsored investment funds. (3) Includes investments in equity method investees and investments held at cost, which in accordance with GAAP are not accounted for under a fair value measure. Goodwill and Intangible Assets At December 31, 2008, the carrying amounts of the Company’s goodwill and intangible assets were as follows: (Dollar amounts in millions) December 31,2008 Goodwill $ 5,533 Intangible assets Indefinite–lived 5,378 Finite–lived, net of accumulated amortization 1,063 Total goodwill and intangible assets $ 11,974 The value of contracts to manage assets in proprietary open-end funds and closed-end funds without a specified termination date is classified as an indefinite-lived intangible asset. The assignment of indefinite lives to such mutual fund contracts is based upon the assumption that there is no foreseeable limit on the contract period to manage these funds due to the likelihood of continued renewal at little or no cost. Goodwill represents the cost of a business acquisition in excess of the fair value of the net assets acquired. In accordance with SFAS No. 142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets, indefinite-lived intangible assets and goodwill are not amortized. Finite-lived management contracts are amortized over their expected useful lives, which, at December 31, 2008, ranged from 1 year to 20 years with a weighted average remaining estimated useful life of 7.7 years. 73 Item 7. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Critical Accounting Policies (continued) Goodwill and Intangible Assets (continued) Goodwill The Company assesses its goodwill for impairment at least annually, considering such factors as the book value and the market capitalization of the Company. At July 31, 2008 the impairment test that was performed indicated no impairment charges were required. The Company continues to monitor its book value per share as compared to closing prices of its common stock for potential indicators of impairment. At December 31, 2008 the Company’s common stock closed at $134.15 which exceeded its book value of approximately $93 per share. Intangibles The Company assesses its indefinite-lived management contracts for impairment at least annually, considering such factors as AUM, product mix, product margins, and projected cash flows to determine whether the values of each asset are impaired and whether the indefinite-life classification is still appropriate. The fair value of indefinite-lived intangible assets is determined based on the discounted value of expected future cash flows. The fair value of finite-lived intangible assets is reviewed at least annually to determine whether circumstances exist which indicate there may be a potential impairment. In addition, if such circumstances are considered to exist, the Company will perform an impairment test, using an undiscounted cash flow analysis. If the asset is determined to be impaired, the difference between the book value of the asset and its current fair value is recognized as an expense in the period in which the impairment is determined. Expected future cash flows are estimated using many variables which require significant management judgment, including market interest rates, equity prices, credit default ratings, discount rates, revenue multiples, inflation rates and AUM growth rates. Actual results could differ from these estimates, which could materially impact the impairment conclusion. In both July and September 2008, as well as during 2007 and 2006, the Company performed impairment tests, which indicated no impairment charges were required. The Company continues to monitor various factors, including AUM, for potential indicators of impairment. In addition, management judgment is required to estimate the period over which intangible assets will contribute to the Company’s cash flows and the pattern in which these assets will be consumed. A change in the remaining useful life of any of these assets, or the reclassification of an indefinite-lived intangible asset to a finite-lived intangible asset, could have a significant impact on the Company’s amortization expense, which was $146 million, $130 million and $38 million for the years ended December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively. 74 Item 7. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Critical Accounting Policies (continued) Income Taxes The Company accounts for income taxes under the asset and liability method prescribed by SFAS No. 109, Accounting for Income Taxes (“SFAS No. 109”). Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amount of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases using currently enacted tax rates. The effect of a change in tax rates on deferred tax assets and liabilities is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date. BlackRock adopted the provisions of FASB Interpretation (“FIN”) No. 48, Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes, on January 1, 2007. FIN No. 48 clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in a company’s financial statements in accordance with SFAS No. 109. FIN No. 48 prescribes a threshold for measurement and recognition in the financial statements of an asset or liability resulting from a tax position taken or expected to be taken in an income tax return. FIN No. 48 also provides guidance on, among other things, de-recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities and interest and penalties on uncertain tax positions. The application of SFAS No. 109 and FIN No. 48 requires management to make estimates of the ranges of possible outcomes, the probability of favorable or unfavorable tax outcomes and potential interest and penalties related to such unfavorable outcomes, which require significant management judgment. Actual future tax consequences of uncertain tax positions may be materially different than the Company’s current estimates. At December 31, 2008, BlackRock had $114 million of gross unrecognized tax benefits, of which $60 million, if recognized, would affect the effective tax rate. In accordance with SFAS No. 109, management is required to estimate the timing of the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities, make assumptions about the future deductibility of deferred tax assets and assess deferred tax liabilities based on enacted tax rates for the appropriate tax jurisdictions to determine the amount of such deferred tax assets and liabilities. At December 31, 2008, the Company had net deferred tax assets of $11 million and net deferred tax liabilities of approximately $1,825 million on the statement of financial condition. Changes in the calculated deferred tax assets and liabilities may occur in certain circumstances, including statutory income tax rate changes, statutory tax law changes, changes in the anticipated timing of recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities or changes in the structure or tax status of the Company. SFAS 109 requires the Company to assess whether a valuation allowance should be established against its deferred tax assets based on consideration of all available evidence, both positive and negative, using a more likely than not standard. This assessment considers, among other matters, the nature, frequency and severity of recent losses, forecast of future profitability, the duration of statutory carry back and carry forward periods, the Company’s experience with tax attributes expiring unused, and tax planning alternatives. As of December 31, 2008, the Company has recorded a deferred tax asset of $157 million for unrealized investment losses however no valuation allowance has been established because the Company expects to be able to carry back a portion of its unrealized capital losses when realized, hold certain fixed income securities over a period sufficient for them to recover their unrealized losses, and generate future capital gains sufficient to offset the unrealized capital losses. Based on the weight of available evidence, it is more likely than not that the deferred tax asset will be realized. However, changes in circumstance could cause the Company to revalue its deferred tax balances with the resulting change impacting the income statement in the period of the change. Such changes may be material to the Company’s consolidated financial statements. See Note 19 to the consolidated financial statements beginning on page F-1 of this Form 10-K for further details. Further, the Company records its income taxes based upon its estimated income tax liability or benefit. The Company’s actual tax liability or benefit may differ from the estimated income tax liability or benefit. The Company had current income taxes receivable of approximately $44 million and current income taxes payable of $120 million at December 31, 2008. 75 Item 7. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Critical Accounting Policies (continued) Revenue Recognition Investment advisory and administration fees are recognized as the services are performed. Such fees are primarily based on pre-determined percentages of the market value of AUM or, in the case of certain real estate separate accounts, net operating income generated by the underlying properties, and are affected by changes in AUM, including market appreciation or depreciation and net subscriptions or redemptions. Investment advisory and administration fees for mutual funds are shown net of fees waived pursuant to contractual expense limitations of the funds or voluntary waivers. Certain real estate fees are earned upon the acquisition or disposition of properties in accordance with applicable investment management agreements and are generally recognized at the closing of the respective real estate transactions. The Company contracts with third parties, as well as related parties, for various mutual fund administration and shareholder servicing to be performed on behalf of certain non U.S. funds managed by the Company. Such arrangements generally are priced as a portion of the Company’s management fee paid by the fund. In certain cases, the fund takes on the primary responsibility for payment for services such that BlackRock bears no credit risk to the third party. The Company accounts for such retrocession arrangements in accordance with EITF No. 99-19, Reporting Revenue Gross as a Principal versus Net as an Agent, and records its investment advisory and administration base fees net of retrocessions. Retrocessions for the years ended December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006 were $762 million, $780 million and $156 million, respectively. The Company has additional contracts for similar services with third parties which, due to the terms of the contracts, are recorded as portfolio administration and servicing costs on the consolidated statements of income. The Company also receives performance fees or incentive allocations from alternative investment products and certain separate accounts. These performance fees generally are earned upon exceeding specified relative or absolute investment return thresholds. Such fees are recorded upon completion of the measurement period which vary by product. For the years ended December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006, performance fee revenue totaled $177 million, $350 million and $242 million, respectively. The Company receives carried interest from certain alternative investment funds upon exceeding performance thresholds. BlackRock may be required to return all, or part, of such carried interest depending upon future performance of these investments. BlackRock records carried interest subject to such claw-back provisions as revenue on its consolidated statements of income upon the earlier of the termination of the alternative investment fund or when the likelihood of claw-back is mathematically improbable. The Company records a deferred carried interest liability to the extent it receives cash or capital allocations prior to meeting the revenue recognition criteria. At December 31, 2008 and 2007, the Company had $21 million and $29 million, respectively of deferred carried interest recorded in other liabilities on the consolidated statements of financial condition. Fees earned for BlackRock Solutions, which include advisory services, are recorded as services are performed and are determined using some, or all, of the following methods: (i) fixed fees, (ii) percentages of various attributes of advisory assets under management and (iii) performance fees if contractual thresholds are met. Revenue earned in 2008 on advisory assignments was comprised of one-time advisory and portfolio structuring fees and ongoing fees based on AUM of the respective portfolio assignment. For the years ended December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006, BlackRock Solutions and advisory revenue totaled $406 million, $198 million and $148 million, respectively. Adjustments to revenue arising from initial estimates historically have been immaterial since the majority of BlackRock’s investment advisory and administration revenue is calculated on the fair value of AUM and since the Company does not record revenues until performance thresholds have been exceeded and the likelihood of claw-back of carried interest is mathematically improbable. 76 Item 7. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Recent Accounting Developments EPS Impact Related to Retrospective Application of Recent Accounting Developments Pursuant to FSP APB 14-1, Accounting for Convertible Debt Instruments That May Be Settled in Cash upon Conversion (Including Partial Cash Settlement) (“FSP APB 14-1”), the Company will allocate a component of the initial proceeds of its convertible debentures to create a debt discount which will be amortized over the expected life of the convertible debentures. Pursuant to FSP EITF 03-6-1, Determining Whether Instruments Granted in Share-Based Payment Transactions Are Participating Securities (“FSP EITF 03-6-1”), the Company’s outstanding unvested stock-based payment awards are considered participating securities as the awards contain non-forfeitable rights to dividend equivalents. In accordance with FSP EITF 03-6-1, the two-class method is used to determine EPS for common stock and for participating securities. The two-class method is an earnings allocation formula that allocates distributed and undistributed earnings to each class of common shareholders and participating RSUs. The tables below present the basic and diluted EPS impact of the retrospective application upon adoption of both FSP APB 14-1 and FSP EITF 03-6-1.

Related Party Transactions See related party transactions discussion in Note 15 to the consolidated financial statements beginning on page F-1 of this Form 10-K. 79 Item 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK As a leading investment management firm, BlackRock devotes significant resources across all of its operations to identifying, measuring, monitoring, managing and analyzing market and operating risks, including the management and oversight of its own investment portfolio. The Board of Directors of the Company has adopted guidelines for the review of investments to be made by the Company, requiring, among other things, that all investments be reviewed by the Company’s Capital Committee, which consists of senior officers of the Company, and that certain investments may be referred to the Audit Committee or the Board of Directors depending on the circumstances for approval. AUM Market Price Risk BlackRock’s investment management revenues are primarily comprised of fees based on a percentage of the value of AUM and, in some cases, performance fees expressed as a percentage of the returns realized on AUM. At December 31, 2008, the majority of our investment advisory and administration fees were based on average or period end AUM of the applicable mutual funds or separate accounts. Movements in equity market prices, interest rates/credit spreads, foreign exchange rates, or all three could cause the value of AUM to decline, which would result in lower investment advisory and administration fees. Corporate Investments Portfolio Risks In the normal course of its business, BlackRock is exposed to equity market price risk, interest rate/credit spread risk and foreign exchange rate risk associated with its corporate investments. BlackRock has investments primarily in sponsored investment products that invest in a variety of asset classes including real estate, private equity, and hedge funds. Investments generally are made to establish a performance track record, for co-investment purposes or to hedge exposure to certain deferred compensation plans. Currently, the Company has a seed capital hedging program in which it enters into total return swaps to hedge exposure to certain equity investments. At December 31, 2008, the outstanding total return swaps had an aggregate notional value of approximately $49 million. At December 31, 2008, approximately $728 million of BlackRock’s total investments were maintained in sponsored investment funds that are deemed to be controlled by BlackRock in accordance with GAAP and therefore are consolidated even though BlackRock may not own a majority of such funds. Including the impact of the seed capital hedging program, the Company’s net economic exposure to its investment portfolio is as follows: (Dollar amounts in millions) December 31, 2008 December 31, 2007 Total investments $ 1,429 $ 2,000 Consolidated sponsored investments funds (728 ) (1,054 ) Net exposure to consolidated investment funds 310 325 Total net “economic” investments 1,011 1,271 Hedged investments (49 ) (94 ) Total net “economic” investment exposure $ 962 $ 1,177 The net “economic” investment exposure of the portfolio is presented in either the market price or the interest rate/credit spread risk disclosures below: Market Price Risk At December 31, 2008, the Company’s net exposure to price risk in its investment portfolio is approximately $655 million of the Company’s net economic investment exposure. Investments that are subject to market price risk include private equity and real estate investments. The Company estimates that a 10% adverse change in market prices would result in a decrease of approximately $65.5 million in the carrying value of such investments. 80 Item 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK (continued) Interest Rate/Credit Spread Risk At December 31, 2008, the Company was exposed to interest-rate risk and credit spread risks as a result of approximately $307 million of investments in debt securities and sponsored investment products that invest primarily in debt securities. Management considered a hypothetical 100 basis point fluctuation in interest rates or credit spreads and estimates that the impact of such a fluctuation on these investments, in the aggregate, would result in a decrease, or increase, of approximately $2.8 million in the carrying value of such investments. Foreign Exchange Rate Risk As discussed above, the Company invests in sponsored investment products that invest in a variety of asset classes. The carrying value of the net economic investment exposure denominated in foreign currencies, primarily the British pound sterling and the Euro, was $46 million. A 10% adverse change in foreign exchange rates would result in approximately a $4.6 million decline in the carrying value of such investments.",2023-12-30 18:58:48.931118

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Overview BlackRock, Inc. (“BlackRock” or the “Company”) is the largest publicly traded investment management firm which as of December 31, 2009 managed $3.346 trillion of assets under management (“AUM”) on behalf of institutional and individual investors worldwide. The Company’s products include equities, fixed income, multi-asset class, alternatives and cash management, and offer clients diversified access to global markets through separate accounts, common trust funds, mutual funds, exchange traded funds, hedge funds, and closed-end funds. In addition, BlackRock Solutions® provides market risk management, financial markets advisory and enterprise investment system services to a broad base of clients. Financial markets advisory services include valuation of illiquid securities, dispositions and workout assignments (including long-term portfolio liquidation assignments), risk management and strategic planning and execution. On September 29, 2006, Merrill Lynch & Co., Inc. (“Merrill Lynch”) contributed the entities and assets that constituted its investment management business, Merrill Lynch Investment Managers (“MLIM”), to BlackRock in exchange for common and non-voting preferred stock such that immediately after such closing Merrill Lynch held approximately 45% of BlackRock’s common stock outstanding and approximately 49.3% of the Company’s capital stock on a fully diluted basis (the “MLIM Transaction”). On October 1, 2007, BlackRock acquired certain assets and assumed certain liabilities of the fund of funds business of Quellos Group, LLC (“Quellos”) for up to $1.719 billion in a combination of cash and common stock (the “Quellos Transaction”). On January 1, 2009, Bank of America Corporation (“Bank of America”) acquired Merrill Lynch & Co., Inc. (“Merrill Lynch”). In connection with this transaction, BlackRock entered into exchange agreements with each of Merrill Lynch and The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. (“PNC”) pursuant to which each agreed to exchange a portion of the BlackRock voting common stock they held for non-voting preferred stock. On December 1, 2009, BlackRock acquired from Barclays Bank PLC (“Barclays”) all of the outstanding equity interests of subsidiaries of Barclays conducting the business of Barclays Global Investors (“BGI”) in exchange for capital shares valued at closing of $8.53 billion and $6.65 billion in cash, both of which are subject to certain adjustments. As of December 31, 2009, equity ownership of BlackRock was as follows: VotingCommonStock Capital Stock Bank of America/Merrill Lynch 3.7 % 34.2 % PNC 35.2 % 24.5 % Barclays 4.8 % 19.8 % Other 56.3 % 21.5 % 100.0 % 100.0 % 41 Table of Contents Item 7.

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Overview (continued) BlackRock reports its financial results on a GAAP basis; however, management believes that evaluating the Company’s ongoing operating results may be enhanced if investors have additional non-GAAP basis financial measures. Management reviews non-GAAP financial measures to assess ongoing operations and, for the reasons described below, considers them to be effective indicators, for both management and investors, of BlackRock’s financial performance over time. BlackRock’s management does not advocate that investors consider such non-GAAP financial measures in isolation from, or as a substitute for, financial information prepared in accordance with GAAP. Certain prior period non-GAAP data has been reclassified to conform to the current presentation. Computations for all periods are derived from the Company’s consolidated statements of income as follows: (a) Operating income, as adjusted, and operating margin, as adjusted: Operating income, as adjusted, equals operating income, GAAP basis, excluding certain items deemed non-recurring by management or transactions that ultimately will not impact BlackRock’s book value, as indicated in the table below. Operating income used for operating margin measurement equals operating income, as adjusted, excluding the impact of closed-end fund launch costs and commissions. Operating margin, as adjusted, equals operating income used for operating margin measurement, divided by revenue used for operating margin measurement, as indicated in the table below. Year ended (Dollar amounts in millions) 2009 2008 2007 Operating income, GAAP basis $ 1,278 $ 1,593 $ 1,294 Non-GAAP adjustments: BGI transaction/integration costs 183 — — MLIM/Quellos integration costs — — 20 PNC LTIP funding obligation 59 59 54 Merrill Lynch compensation contribution 10 10 10 Restructuring charges 22 38 — Termination of closed-end fund administration and servicing arrangements — — 128 Compensation expense related to (depreciation) appreciation on deferred compensation plans 18 (38 ) 12 Operating income, as adjusted 1,570 1,662 1,518 Closed-end fund launch costs 2 9 36 Closed-end fund launch commissions 1 — 6 Operating income used for operating margin measurement $ 1,573 $ 1,671 $ 1,560 Revenue, GAAP basis $ 4,700 $ 5,064 $ 4,845 Non-GAAP adjustments: Distribution and servicing costs (477 ) (591 ) (539 ) Amortization of deferred mutual fund sales commissions (100 ) (130 ) (108 ) Reimbursable property management compensation — (21 ) (27 ) Revenue used for operating margin measurement $ 4,123 $ 4,322 $ 4,171 Operating margin, GAAP basis 27.2 % 31.5 % 26.7 % Operating margin, as adjusted 38.2 % 38.7 % 37.4 % 43 Table of Contents Item 7. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Overview (continued) BlackRock, Inc. Financial Highlights (continued) (a) (continued) Management believes that operating income, as adjusted, and operating margin, as adjusted, are effective indicators of BlackRock’s financial performance over time. As such, management believes that operating income, as adjusted, and operating margin, as adjusted, provide useful disclosure to investors. Operating income, as adjusted: Restructuring charges recorded in 2008 and 2009 consist of compensation costs, occupancy costs and professional fees. MLIM and Quellos integration costs recorded in 2007 consist principally of certain professional fees, rebranding costs and compensation costs incurred in conjunction with these integrations. BGI transaction/integration costs recorded in 2009 consist principally of certain advisory fees, compensation expense, legal fees and consulting expenses incurred in conjunction with the BGI transaction. The expenses associated with: (i) the 2008 and 2009 restructuring, (ii) BGI transaction and integration costs, (iii) MLIM and Quellos integration costs and (iv) the 2007 termination of the closed-end fund administration and servicing arrangements with Merrill Lynch have been deemed non-recurring by management and have been excluded from operating income, as adjusted, to help enhance the comparability of this information to prior periods. As such, management believes that operating margins exclusive of these costs are useful measures in evaluating BlackRock’s operating performance for the respective periods. The portion of compensation expense associated with certain long-term incentive plans (“LTIP”) that will be funded through the distribution to participants of shares of BlackRock stock held by PNC and a Merrill Lynch cash compensation contribution, a portion of which has been received, have been excluded because these charges ultimately do not impact BlackRock’s book value. Compensation expense associated with appreciation (depreciation) on assets related to certain BlackRock deferred compensation plans has been excluded as returns on investments set aside for these plans, which substantially offset this expense, are reported in non-operating income. Operating margin, as adjusted: Operating income used for measuring operating margin, as adjusted, is equal to operating income, as adjusted, excluding the impact of closed-end fund launch costs and commissions. Management believes that excluding such costs and commissions is useful because these costs can fluctuate considerably and revenues associated with the expenditure of these costs will not fully impact the Company’s results until future periods. Operating margin, as adjusted, allows the Company to compare performance from period-to-period by adjusting for items that may not recur, recur infrequently or may fluctuate based on market movements, such as restructuring charges, transaction/integration costs, closed-end fund launch costs and fluctuations in compensation expense based on mark-to-market movements in investments held to fund certain compensation plans. The Company also uses operating margin, as adjusted, to monitor corporate performance and efficiency and as a benchmark to compare its performance to other companies. Management uses both the GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures in evaluating the financial performance for BlackRock. The non-GAAP measure by itself may pose limitations because it does not include all of the Company’s revenues and expenses. Revenue used for operating margin, as adjusted, excludes distribution and servicing costs paid to related parties and to other third parties. Management believes that excluding such costs is useful to BlackRock because it creates consistency in the treatment for certain contracts for similar services, which due to the terms of the contracts, are accounted under GAAP on a net basis within investment advisory, administration fees and securities lending revenue. Amortization of deferred mutual fund sales commissions is excluded from revenue used for operating margin measurement, as adjusted, because such costs, over time, offset distribution fee revenue earned by the Company. Reimbursable property management compensation represented compensation and benefits paid to personnel of Metric Property Management, Inc. (“Metric”), a subsidiary of BlackRock Realty Advisors, Inc. (“Realty”). Prior to the transfer in 2008, these employees were retained on Metric’s payroll when certain properties were acquired by Realty’s clients. The related compensation and benefits were fully reimbursed by Realty’s clients and have been excluded from revenue used for operating margin, as adjusted, because they did not bear an economic cost to BlackRock. For each of these items, BlackRock excludes from revenue used for operating margin, as adjusted, the costs related to each of these items as a proxy for such offsetting revenues. 44 Table of Contents Item 7.

The compensation expense offset is recorded in operating income. This compensation expense has been included in non-operating income (expense), less net income (loss) attributable to NCI, as adjusted, to offset returns on investments set aside for these plans, which are reported in non-operating income (expense), GAAP basis.

Management believes that non-operating income (expense), less net income (loss) attributable to non-controlling interests, as adjusted, provides for comparability of this information to prior periods and is an effective measure for reviewing BlackRock’s non-operating contribution to its results. As compensation expense associated with depreciation (appreciation) on assets related to certain BlackRock deferred compensation plans, which is included in operating income, offsets the gain/(loss) on the investments set aside for these plans, management believes that non-operating income (expense), less net income (loss) attributable to NCI, as adjusted, provides a useful measure, for both management and investors, of BlackRock’s non-operating results that impact book value. 45 Table of Contents Item 7.

The portion of the compensation expense associated with LTIP awards that will be funded through the distribution to participants of shares of BlackRock stock held by PNC and the Merrill Lynch cash compensation contribution, a portion of which has been received, have been excluded from net income attributable to BlackRock, Inc., as adjusted, because these charges ultimately do not impact BlackRock’s book value. The termination of the closed-end fund administration and servicing arrangements with Merrill Lynch has been excluded from net income attributable to BlackRock, Inc., as adjusted, as the termination of the arrangements is deemed non-recurring by management. During third quarter 2009, legislation was enacted primarily with respect to New York City corporate income taxes, effective January 1, 2009, which resulted in a revaluation of deferred income tax assets and liabilities. The resulting decrease in income taxes has been excluded from net income attributable to BlackRock, Inc., as adjusted, as it is non-recurring, it does not ultimately impact cash flows and to enhance comparability to prior reporting periods. 46 Table of Contents Item 7. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Overview (continued) BlackRock, Inc. Financial Highlights (continued) (c) Net income attributable to BlackRock, Inc., as adjusted (continued): During third quarter 2007, the United Kingdom and Germany enacted legislation reducing corporate income taxes, effective in April and January of 2008, respectively, which resulted in a revaluation of certain deferred tax liabilities. The resulting decrease in income taxes has been excluded from net income, as adjusted, as it is non-recurring, it does not ultimately impact cash flows and to enhance comparability to current and prior reporting periods. (d) For the years ended December 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007 non-GAAP adjustments were tax effected at 30%, 33% and 36%, respectively, which reflect the blended rate applicable to the adjustments.

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Overview (continued) BlackRock has portfolio managers located around the world, including the United States, the United Kingdom, the Netherlands, Japan, Hong Kong, Australia and Germany. The Company provides a wide array of taxable and tax-exempt fixed income, equity and balanced investment funds, including exchange traded funds and mutual funds, and separate accounts, as well as a wide assortment of index-based equity and alternative investment products for a diverse global clientele. BlackRock provides global advisory services for investment funds and other non-U.S. equivalent retail products. The Company’s non-U.S. mutual funds are based in a number of domiciles and cover a range of asset classes, including cash management, fixed income and equities. The BlackRock Global Funds, the Company’s primary retail fund group offered outside the United States, are authorized for distribution in more than 35 jurisdictions worldwide. In the United States, the primary retail offerings include various open-end and closed-end funds. Additional fund offerings include structured products, real estate funds, hedge funds, hedge funds of funds, private equity funds and funds of funds, managed futures funds and exchange funds. These products are sold to both U.S. and non-U.S. high net worth, retail and institutional investors in a wide variety of active and passive strategies covering both equity and fixed income assets. BlackRock’s client base consists of financial institutions and other corporate clients, pension funds, high net worth individuals and retail investors around the world. BlackRock maintains a significant sales and marketing presence both inside and outside the United States that is focused on establishing and maintaining retail and institutional investment management relationships by marketing its services to retail and institutional investors directly and through financial professionals, pension consultants and establishing third-party distribution relationships. BlackRock also distributes its products and services through Merrill Lynch under a global distribution agreement, which, following Bank of America’s acquisition of Merrill Lynch, runs through January 2014. After such term, the agreement will renew for one automatic three-year extension if certain conditions are met. See Note 17, Related Party Transactions, to the consolidated financial statements beginning on page F-1 of this Form 10-K. BlackRock derives a substantial portion of its revenue from investment advisory and administration fees, which are recognized as the services are performed. Such fees are primarily based on pre-determined percentages of the market value of AUM, percentages of committed capital during investment periods of certain alternative products, or, in the case of certain real estate equity clients, net operating income generated by the underlying properties, and are affected by changes in AUM, including market appreciation or depreciation, foreign exchange gains or losses and net subscriptions or redemptions. Net subscriptions or redemptions represent the sum of new client assets, additional fundings from existing clients (including dividend reinvestment), withdrawals of assets from, and termination of, client accounts, purchases and redemptions of investment fund shares and distributions to investors representing return of capital and return on investments to investors. Market appreciation or depreciation includes current income earned on, and changes in the fair value of, securities held in client accounts. BlackRock also earns revenue by lending securities on behalf of clients, primarily to brokerage institutions. Such revenues are accounted for on an accrual basis. The security loans are secured by collateral in the form of cash and securities, ranging from approximately 102% to 108% of the value of the loaned securities. The net income earned on the collateral is shared between BlackRock and the funds or other third-party accounts managed by the Company from which the securities are borrowed. Investment advisory agreements for certain separate accounts and BlackRock’s alternative investment products provide for performance fees, based upon relative and/or absolute investment performance, in addition to base fees based on AUM. Investment advisory performance fees generally are earned after a given period of time and when investment performance exceeds a contractual threshold. As such, the timing of recognition of performance fees may increase the volatility of BlackRock’s revenue and earnings. 48 Table of Contents Item 7. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Overview (continued) BlackRock provides a variety of risk management, investment analytic and investment system and advisory services to financial institutions, pension funds, asset managers, foundations, consultants, mutual fund sponsors, real estate investment trusts and government agencies. These services are provided under the brand name BlackRock Solutions and include a wide array of risk management services, valuation services related to illiquid securities, disposition and workout assignments (including long-term portfolio liquidation assignments), strategic planning and execution, and enterprise investment system outsourcing to clients. Fees earned for BlackRock Solutions and advisory services are determined using some, or all, of the following methods: (i) fixed fees, (ii) percentages of various attributes of advisory assets under management and (iii) performance fees if contractual thresholds are met. The Company also earns fees for transition management services comprised of referral fees or agency commissions from acting as an introducing broker-dealer in buying and selling securities on behalf of its customers. Commissions and related clearing expenses related to transition management services are recorded on a trade-date basis as securities transactions occur. Operating expenses reflect employee compensation and benefits, distribution and servicing costs, amortization of deferred mutual fund sales commissions, direct fund expenses, general and administration expenses and amortization of finite-lived intangible assets. • Employee compensation and benefits expense reflects salaries, commissions, deferred and incentive compensation, employer payroll taxes and related benefit costs. • Distribution and servicing costs include payments made to Merrill Lynch-affiliated entities under a global distribution agreement and to PNC-affiliated entities, as well as other third parties, primarily associated with the distribution and servicing of client investments in certain BlackRock products. • Direct fund expenses consist primarily of third party non-advisory expenses incurred by BlackRock related to certain funds for the use of certain index trademarks, reference data for certain indices, custodial services, fund administration, fund accounting, transfer agent services, shareholder reporting services, legal expenses, audit and tax services as well as other fund related expenses directly attributable to the non-advisory operations of the fund. These expenses may vary over time with fluctuations in AUM, number of shareholder accounts, or other attributes directly related to volume of business. BlackRock holds investments primarily in sponsored investment products that invest in a variety of asset classes, including private equity, distressed credit/mortgage debt securities, hedge funds and real estate. Investments generally are made for co-investment purposes, to establish a performance track record, to hedge exposure to certain deferred compensation plans, or for regulatory purposes. Non-operating income (expense) and other comprehensive income for available-for-sale investments includes the impact of changes in the valuations or pick up of equity method earnings of these investments, as well as interest income and interest expense. 49 Table of Contents Item 7. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Assets Under Management AUM for reporting purposes is generally based upon how investment advisory and administration fees are calculated for each portfolio.

Business Outlook The Company began 2010 with a substantially increased AUM base as a result of the BGI Transaction and strong market and organic growth in 2009. At the same time, domestic and international markets continue to be volatile as a result of investor concerns that the global economy is weaker than investors expected. The U.S. housing market, employment levels, debt levels in European nations and the stability of certain foreign currencies are heightening investor anxiety in the early part of 2010. The timing and direction of these volatile markets, investment performance and the level of new client asset flows will have a direct impact on the Company’s revenue. With the BGI Transaction, the Company offers an expanded range of products with investment objectives to track various indices and others that target returns in excess of specified benchmarks as well as liquidity funds. Consequently, BlackRock should be well positioned to meet these challenges, as well as navigate the following issues that may also impact the Company’s results in 2010: • The levels of institutional liquidity assets may continue to decline from year-end levels. These assets are expected to be redeployed to direct investment, bank deposits or longer-dated strategies as market conditions stabilize. The Company’s diversified global product offerings, client service and independent advice may enable it to retain a portion of these assets. • Additionally, as investors shift their preferences between active and passive investment styles, the Company’s broad active and passive product profile ability should enable it to retain and capture AUM as it has a wide array of offerings in both product styles. 53 Table of Contents Item 7. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Business Outlook (continued) • The regulatory environment is evolving for financial institutions. The SEC has enacted reforms to Rule 2a-7 under the Investment Company Act, governing money market funds with the intent to protect the industry and our clients. The SEC indicated there is likely to be a second round of changes governing money market funds. These changes, should they be enacted, may affect the margins of the money market industry and may affect industry participants differently depending on scale. Other financial services reforms may favor the separation of fiduciary management and banking activities from proprietary investing. BlackRock acts as an independent asset manager and does not engage in proprietary trading or deposit taking activities. • The liquidity crunch and associated market disruption gave rise to greater demand for our advisory services, combining our extensive capital markets and structuring expertise with rigorous modeling and analytical capabilities. While the demand for these services remained high through the volatile markets, demand for short-term advisory services may decline as market concerns ease. A meaningful percentage of BlackRock Solutions and advisory revenues in 2009 was composed of one-time advisory and portfolio structuring fees. At the same time, as markets have stabilized, we have seen clients investing in longer-term risk and systems solutions. • A return to higher market levels may enable the Company’s alternative investment products with absolute return objectives to contribute additional performance fee revenue. However, such fees are dependent on achieving investor “high water marks”. • The global exchange traded funds market is expected to continue to grow. BlackRock has a large array of products and assets under management in this market. As a first mover in several products, many of the iShares products have achieved a critical mass, providing both liquidity to investors and minimizing the difference between the unit exchange traded market values and the underlying unit net asset values. As additional asset managers enter the marketplace to offer exchange traded funds, the Company’s market share may decline even while the overall market grows. • The Company will continue to assess the appropriateness of its cost structure as it integrates BGI. The Company may decide to take additional measures to reduce costs. The benefits of any cost reduction measures may be realized over time and may or may not require upfront costs. • At the same time, the Company plans to invest in future growth opportunities. There may be opportunities where the cost in the current period will precede the expected future revenue. • Certain costs, such as direct fund expenses and cash incentive compensation, will tend to move in line with revenue. As stock awards are expensed subsequent to their grant date, the associated expense will not vary with future revenues. The stock awards related to 2009 performance will be expensed in 2010 and subsequent years. • Real estate costs are expected to increase. We leased new space, most notably in London, on which we will begin incurring rent expense even though we will not move into that space until it is fully built out in 2011. The Company has not completed analyzing its requirements in all other locations impacted by the acquisition of BGI. • Marketing expenses, including travel and entertainment, are expected to increase to levels which reflect our increased client base, a more geographically diverse firm and additional client opportunities. • The effective tax rate of the Company is affected, among other things, by the geographic distribution of earnings and global changes in tax legislation, including efforts by governments to raise taxes to reduce projected deficits. The effective tax rate may vary from period to period as a result of these factors. 54 Table of Contents Item 7.

Total revenue for the year ended December 31, 2009 includes $312 million of incremental revenue related to the BGI acquisition. The $364 million decrease was the result of a $431 million decrease in total investment advisory, administration fees and securities lending revenue, a $39 million decrease in distribution fees and a $3 million decrease in other revenue, offset by an $84 million increase in BlackRock Solutions and advisory revenue and a $25 million increase in performance fees. 55 Table of Contents Item 7. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Operating results for the year ended December 31, 2009, as compared with the year ended December 31, 2008 (continued) Revenue (continued) Investment Advisory, Administration Fees and Securities Lending Revenue Investment advisory, administration fees and securities lending revenue for the year ended December 31, 2009 included approximately $278 million of fees related to the BGI acquisition. The decrease in investment advisory, administration fees and securities lending revenues of $431 million for the year ended December 31, 2009, compared with the year ended December 31, 2008 consisted of decreases of $357 million in active equity products, $40 million in multi-asset class products, $141 million in alternative investment products, $7 million in active fixed income products and $83 million in cash management products primarily associated with a market driven reduction in average AUM for equity, multi-asset class and alternative products and net redemptions in cash management products. The decrease is offset by a $164 million increase in equity index products and a $33 million increase in fixed income index products primarily related to products acquired in the BGI acquisition. Performance Fees Investment advisory performance fees increased $25 million, or 14%, to $202 million for the year ended December 31, 2009, as compared to $177 million for the year ended December 31, 2008, primarily due to an increase in performance fees in alternative equity hedge funds, fixed income and multi-asset class separate accounts, offset by a decrease in international equity separate accounts. The year ended December 31, 2009 included $24 million of performance fees related to the BGI acquisition. BlackRock Solutions and Advisory BlackRock Solutions and advisory revenue for the year ended December 31, 2009 increased $84 million, or 21%, compared with the year ended December 31, 2008. The increase in BlackRock Solutions and advisory revenue was primarily the result of additional advisory assignments during the period, as well as additional Aladdin and risk management mandates. Revenue earned on advisory assignments was comprised of advisory and portfolio structuring assignment fees and ongoing fees based on AUM of the respective portfolio assignments. Distribution Fees Distribution fees decreased $39 million to $100 million for the year ended December 31, 2009, as compared to $139 million for the year ended December 31, 2008. The decrease in distribution fees was primarily the result of lower sales, redemptions and AUM in certain share classes of open-end mutual funds. 56 Table of Contents Item 7.

Other revenue of $95 million for the year ended December 31, 2009 decreased $3 million, or 3%, compared with the year ended December 31, 2008. Other revenue for the year ended December 31, 2009 included $10 million of incremental revenue related to the operations of BGI. The decrease in other revenue was primarily the result of a $31 million decline in property management fees primarily related to the outsourcing in the fourth quarter of 2008 of Metric contracts with BlackRock real estate clients, partially offset by a $14 million increase in BlackRock’s share of underlying earnings from certain operating and advisory company investments and a $9 million increase in fees earned for transition management services. 57 Table of Contents Item 7.

Total GAAP expenses decreased $49 million, or 1%, to $3,422 million for the year ended December 31, 2009, compared to $3,471 million for the year ended December 31, 2008. Excluding certain items deemed non-recurring by management or transactions that ultimately will not effect the Company’s book value, total expenses, as adjusted, decreased $272 million, or 8%. The decrease in total expenses, as adjusted, is primarily attributable to decreases in employee compensation and benefits, distribution and servicing costs and amortization of deferred mutual funds sales commissions. 58 Table of Contents Item 7. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Operating results for the year ended December 31, 2009, as compared with the year ended December 31, 2008 (continued) Expenses (continued) Employee Compensation and Benefits Employee compensation and benefits expense decreased $13 million, or 1%, to $1,802 million, for the year ended December 31, 2009, compared to $1,815 million for the year ended December 31, 2008. Employee compensation and benefits expense for the year ended December 31, 2009 included $89 million of incremental expense related to an increase in the number of employees related to BGI. The decrease in employee compensation and benefits expense was attributable to a $118 million decrease in salaries, benefits and commissions, a $12 million decrease in incentive compensation associated with lower operating income, partially offset by a $60 million increase related to the BGI integration costs and a $57 million increase in deferred compensation, which is offset primarily by an increase in non-operating income related to appreciation on assets associated with certain deferred compensation plans. The $118 million decrease in salaries, benefits and commissions is due to lower employment levels as a result of the Company’s cost control efforts and outsourcing of Metric services, partially offset by a one month impact of the increase in employees related to the BGI Transaction. Employees at December 31, 2009 totaled 8,629 as compared to 5,341 at December 31, 2008. Distribution and Servicing Costs Distribution and servicing costs decreased $114 million to $477 million for the year ended December 31, 2009, compared to $591 million for the year ended December 31, 2008. These costs include payments to Bank of America/Merrill Lynch under a global distribution agreement, and payments to PNC as well as other third parties, primarily associated with the distribution and servicing of client investments in certain BlackRock products. The $114 million decrease primarily related to lower levels of average AUM serviced by related parties across all asset classes and an increase in waivers within certain cash management funds, resulting in lower distribution payments. Distribution and servicing costs for the year ended December 31, 2009 included $349 million of costs attributable to Bank of America/Merrill Lynch and affiliates and $19 million of costs attributable to PNC and affiliates as compared to $464 million and $30 million, respectively, in the year ended December 31, 2008. Distribution and servicing costs related to other third parties increased $12 million to $109 million for the year ended December 31, 2009, as compared to $97 million for the year ended December 31, 2008 due to an expansion of distribution platforms. Amortization of Deferred Mutual Fund Sales Commissions Amortization of deferred mutual fund sales commissions decreased $30 million to $100 million for the year ended December 31, 2009, as compared to $130 million for the year ended December 31, 2008. The decrease in amortization of deferred mutual fund sales commissions was primarily the result of lower sales and redemptions in certain share classes of U.S. open-end mutual funds. 59 Table of Contents Item 7. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Operating results for the year ended December 31, 2009, as compared with the year ended December 31, 2008 (continued) Expenses (continued) Direct Fund Expenses Direct fund expenses incurred by BlackRock related to non-advisory operating expenses of certain funds increased $9 million primarily related to the addition of BGI funds with these arrangements.

General and administration expenses increased $114 million, or 17%, for the year ended December 31, 2009 compared with the year ended December 31, 2008. The year ended December 31, 2009 included $91 million, $11 million, $7 million, $1 million, and $13 million of professional services, marketing and promotional, technology, occupancy, and other general and administration expenses, respectively, related to the acquisition and integration of BGI. Excluding these expenses, general and administration expenses decreased $9 million, or 1%, for the year ended December 31, 2009 compared to the year ended December 31, 2008. Total general and administration expenses for the year ended December 31, 2009 included $43 million of incremental BGI expenses related to each category, excluding closed-end fund launch costs. Marketing and promotional expenses decreased $69 million, or 45%, primarily due to a decline in travel and promotional expenses. Occupancy increased $26 million which included an $11 million expense related to the write-off of certain leasehold improvements. Portfolio service costs increased $12 million, or 14%, to $100 million, due to fund expense reimbursements. Professional services increased $86 million, or 113%, to $162 million compared to $76 million for the year ended December 31, 2008 primarily related to legal, advisory and consulting costs incurred in connection with the BGI Transaction. Other general and administration expenses increased $68 million, or 82%, to $151 million from $83 million, primarily related to a $61 million increase in balance sheet related foreign currency remeasurement costs, a $21 million increase to a provision related to an outstanding loan to Anthracite Capital Inc., and a $10 million expense for potentially uncollectible fee receivables, partially offset by a reduction of various expenses primarily the result of cost control efforts. 60 Table of Contents Item 7.

Amortization of Intangible Assets Amortization of intangible assets increased $1 million to $147 million for the year ended December 31, 2009, as compared to $146 million for the year ended December 31, 2008. The increase in amortization of intangible assets reflects amortization of finite-lived management contracts acquired in the BGI Transaction. 61 Table of Contents Item 7.

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Non-operating results for the year ended December 31, 2009, as compared with the year ended December 31, 2008 (continued) Non-Operating Income (Expense), Less Net Income (Loss) Attributable to Non-Controlling Interests (continued) Non-operating expense, less net income (loss) attributable to non-controlling interests, decreased $394 million to $28 million for the year ended December 31, 2009, as compared to $422 million for the year ended December 31, 2008. The $20 million net gain on investments, less non-controlling interests, related to the Company’s co-investment and seed investments, included valuation gains in distressed credit/mortgage funds of $100 million, investments related to deferred compensation plans of $18 million, hedge funds/funds of hedge funds of $18 million and private equity products of $9 million offset by net losses in real estate products of $114 million and other investments of $11 million. Net interest expense was $48 million, an increase of $44 million primarily due to a decline in interest rates earned on cash equivalents and interest rates paid on its line of credit, offset by an $8 million increase in interest expense related to $2.5 billion in issuances of long-term notes in December 2009. Net Economic Investment Portfolio The Company reviews its net economic exposure to its investment portfolio by reducing its GAAP investments by the net assets attributable to non-controlling interests of consolidated sponsored investment funds. Changes in the investment portfolio are due to purchases, sales, maturities, distributions as well as the impact of valuations.

The year over year tax rate decrease is primarily attributable to approximately $45 million of tax benefits related to legislation which was enacted in 2009 with respect to New York City corporate income taxes. 63 Table of Contents Item 7. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Operating results for the year ended December 31, 2009, as compared with the year ended December 31, 2008 (continued) Operating Income and Operating Margin GAAP Operating income totaled $1,278 million for the year ended December 31, 2009, which was a decrease of $315 million compared to the year ended December 31, 2008. Year ended December 31, 2009 operating income included $141 million resulting from incremental revenue and expenses related to the operations of BGI and $183 million of BGI transaction and integration costs. The transaction and integration expenses are not part of the on-going business and are principally comprised of advisory fees, compensation expense, legal fees and consulting expenses. Operating income for the year ended December 31, 2009 included the effect of a $431 million decrease in investment advisory, administration fees and securities lending revenue, associated with a market driven reduction in average AUM for all asset classes for the year ended December 31, 2009 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2008, a $42 million reduction in distribution fees and other revenue, offset by an $84 million increase in BlackRock Solutions and advisory revenue, a $25 million increase in performance fees revenue and a $49 million net decrease in operating expenses primarily due to declines in employee compensation and benefits, distribution and servicing costs, amortization of deferred mutual fund sales commissions and restructuring expenses, offset by increases in direct fund expenses and general and administration expenses. The Company’s operating margin was 27.2% for the year ended December 31, 2009, compared to 31.5% for the year ended December 31, 2008. The reduction in operating margin in 2009 as compared to 2008 included the effect of $183 million of BGI transaction and integration costs and a change from $50 million of foreign currency remeasurement benefits in 2008 to $11 million of foreign currency remeasurement costs in 2009. As Adjusted Operating income, as adjusted, totaled $1,570 million for the year ended December 31, 2009, which was a decrease of $92 million compared to the year ended December 31, 2008. The decline of operating income, as adjusted, for the year ended December 31, 2009 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2008 is related to the effect of the $364 million decrease in total revenue offset by a $272 million decrease in operating expenses due to decreases in employee compensation and benefits, distribution and servicing costs and general and administration expenses. Operating margin, as adjusted, was 38.2% and 38.7% for the years ended December 31, 2009 and 2008, respectively. The reduction in margin includes the effect of the $61 million increase in expenses related to the change in foreign currency remeasurement offset by a reduction of certain expenses as a result of additional cost controls in 2009. Operating income, as adjusted, and operating margin, as adjusted, are described in more detail in the Overview to Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. 64 Table of Contents Item 7.

(continued) Net income attributable to BlackRock, Inc. for the year ended December 31, 2009 included the after-tax effect of the portion of LTIP awards, which will be funded through a capital contribution of BlackRock stock held by PNC of $41 million, BGI transaction/integration costs of $129 million, restructuring charges of $14 million, and an expected cash contribution, a portion of which has been paid by Merrill Lynch in third quarter 2009 of $7 million to fund certain compensation of former MLIM employees. In addition, net income for the year ended December 31, 2009 included a $45 million one-time reduction in income tax expense as a result of enacted legislation primarily with respect to New York City corporate income taxes, which resulted in a revaluation of certain deferred income tax assets and liabilities. Net income attributable to BlackRock, Inc. of $784 million for the year ended December 31, 2008 included the after-tax effect of the portion of certain LTIP awards, which will be funded through a capital contribution of BlackRock stock held by PNC of $39 million, restructuring charges of $26 million and an expected contribution by Merrill Lynch of $7 million to fund certain compensation of former MLIM employees, a portion of which was received by BlackRock in third quarter 2009. As Adjusted Exclusive of the items discussed above, diluted earnings per common share, as adjusted, of $7.13 for the year ended December 31, 2009 increased $0.83, or 13%, compared to the year ended December 31, 2008. Net income attributable to BlackRock, Inc., as adjusted, for the year ended December 31, 2009 includes operating income of $1,570 million, or $7.35 per diluted common share, non-operating expenses, less net income attributable to non-controlling interests, of $46 million, or $0.22 per diluted common share. Diluted earnings per common share, as adjusted, is described in more detail in the Overview to Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. 66 Table of Contents Item 7. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Operating results for the year ended December 31, 2008, as compared with the year ended December 31, 2007 AUM decreased $49 billion, or 4%, to $1.307 trillion at December 31, 2008, compared with $1.357 trillion at December 31, 2007. The decline in AUM was attributable to $189 billion in net market depreciation and $28 billion in net foreign exchange movements, partially offset by $168 billion in net subscriptions. The following table presents the component changes in BlackRock’s AUM1 for 2008. (Dollar amounts in millions) December 31,2007 Netsubscriptions(redemptions)1 Marketappreciation(depreciation) Foreignexchange2 December 31,2008 Equity Index $ 71,381 $ 11,183 $ (31,354 ) $ (134 ) $ 51,076 Active 291,324 (17,204 ) (109,867 ) (12,037 ) 152,216 Fixed income Index 3,942 (612 ) 162 (81 ) 3,411 Active 506,265 (6,247 ) (16,134 ) (5,930 ) 477,954 Multi-asset class 98,623 5,087 (20,134 ) (6,060 ) 77,516 Alternative 71,771 4,971 (13,201 ) (1,997 ) 61,544 Long-dated 1,043,306 (2,822 ) (190,528 ) (26,239 ) 823,717 Cash management 313,338 25,670 1,339 (1,908 ) 338,439 Sub-total 1,356,644 22,848 (189,189 ) (28,147 ) 1,162,156 Advisory3 — 144,756 239 — 144,995 Total $ 1,356,644 $ 167,604 $ (188,950 ) $ (28,147 ) $ 1,307,151 1 Includes distributions representing return of capital and return on investment to investors. 2 Foreign exchange reflects the impact of converting non-U.S. dollar denominated AUM into U.S. dollars for reporting purposes. 3 Advisory AUM represents long-term portfolio liquidation assignments. Net market depreciation of $189 billion was primarily due to depreciation in equity products of $141 billion, as equity markets declined during the year ended December 31, 2008, net depreciation on fixed income products of $16 billion, depreciation on multi-asset products of $20 billion and alternative investment products of $13 billion. The $28 billion reduction in AUM from foreign exchange was across all asset classes due to the strengthening of the U.S. dollar which resulted in foreign exchange translation loss from converting non U.S.-dollar denominated AUM into U.S. dollars. Net subscriptions of $168 billion for the year ended December 31, 2008 were attributable to net new business of $145 billion in long-term advisory liquidation assignments, $26 billion in cash management products, $5 billion in multi-asset class products and $5 billion in alternative investment products, partially offset by $6 billion and $7 billion of net outflows in equity and fixed income products, respectively. 67 Table of Contents Item 7.

The $219 million increase was primarily the result of a $220 million increase in total investment advisory, administration fees and securities lending revenue, a $203 million increase in BlackRock Solutions and advisory revenue and a $16 million increase in distribution fees, offset by a $173 million decrease in investment advisory performance fees and a $47 million decrease in other revenue. 68 Table of Contents Item 7. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Operating results for the year ended December 31, 2008, as compared with the year ended December 31, 2007 (continued) Revenue (continued) Investment Advisory, Administration Fees and Securities Lending Revenue The increase in investment advisory, administration fees and securities lending revenue of $220 million for the year ended December 31, 2008, compared with the year ended December 31, 2007, consisted of increases of, $169 million in alternative investment products, $185 million in cash management products and $100 million in multi-asset class products, offset by decreases of $211 million in active and index equity products and $23 million in active fixed income products. Investment advisory and administration base fees increased for the year ended December 31, 2008 primarily as a result of increased average AUM in 2008 compared to 2007 for cash management products due to net subscriptions and alternative investment products due to the full year effect of the Quellos Transaction, offset by lower fees in equity products due to the impact of market depreciation on AUM. Investment Advisory Performance Fees Investment advisory performance fees decreased by $173 million, or 49%, to $177 million for the year ended December 31, 2008, as compared to $350 million for the year ended December 31, 2007 primarily as a result of lower investment advisory performance fees earned on alternative investment products, including real estate funds and fixed income hedge funds, and international equity products. BlackRock Solutions and Advisory BlackRock Solutions and advisory revenue of $393 million for the year ended December 31, 2008 increased $203 million, or 107%, compared with the year ended December 31, 2007. The increase in BlackRock Solutions and advisory revenue was primarily the result of additional advisory assignments and Aladdin® assignments during the period. A portion of the revenue earned on advisory assignments was comprised of one-time advisory and portfolio structuring fees and ongoing fees based on AUM of the respective portfolio assignments. Distribution Fees Distribution fees increased by $16 million to $139 million for the year ended December 31, 2008, as compared to $123 million for the year ended December 31, 2007. The increase in distribution fees was primarily due to the full-year effect of the acquisition of distribution financing arrangements from PNC in second quarter 2007, which resulted in the Company receiving distribution fees from such arrangements, as well as an increase in contingent deferred sales commissions as a result of redemptions in certain share classes of open-ended funds. 69 Table of Contents Item 7.

The decrease in other revenue of $47 million for the year ended December 31, 2008, as compared to the year ended December 31, 2007, was primarily the result of a decrease in fees earned for fund accounting services of $16 million, a $14 million decline in other advisory service fees earned in 2007, a $11 million decline in unit trust and class A mutual fund commissions revenue and a $6 million decline in property management fees primarily related to the termination in the fourth quarter of 2008 of certain Metric contracts with BlackRock real estate clients. Certain Metric employees have been transferred to a third party, which provides real estate clients the property management services formerly provided by Metric. At December 31, 2008, Metric had no remaining employees. The decreases discussed above were offset by a $5 million increase in fees for transition management services. 70 Table of Contents Item 7.

Excluding certain items deemed non-recurring by management or transactions that ultimately will not affect the Company’s book value, total expenses, as adjusted, increased $75 million, or 2%. The increase was attributable to increases in distribution and servicing costs, employee compensation and benefits, amortization of deferred mutual fund sales commissions and amortization of intangible assets. 71 Table of Contents Item 7. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Operating results for the year ended December 31, 2008, as compared with the year ended December 31, 2007 (continued) Expenses (continued) Employee Compensation and Benefits Employee compensation and benefits expense increased $48 million, or 3%, to $1,815 million at December 31, 2008, compared to $1,767 million for the year ended December 31, 2007. The increase in employee compensation and benefits expense was primarily attributable to a $91 million increase in salaries and benefits offset by a $38 million decrease in deferred compensation, which was primarily linked to depreciation on assets related to certain deferred compensation plans. The increase of $91 million in salaries and benefits was primarily due to an increase in headcount throughout the majority of 2007 and 2008 (including the effect associated with the fund of funds acquisition in 2007). Full time employees at December 31, 2008 totaled 5,341 (including the effect of a reduction in force in the fourth quarter) as compared to 5,952 (including Metric) at December 31, 2007. The decline in deferred compensation of $38 million was substantially offset by the change in valuations of investments set aside for these plans, which are included in non-operating income (expense). Distribution and Servicing Costs Distribution and servicing costs increased $52 million, or 10%, to $591 million during the year ended December 31, 2008, compared to $539 million for the year ended December 31, 2007. These costs include payments to Merrill Lynch under the global distribution agreement, and payments to PNC as well as other third parties, primarily associated with the distribution and servicing of client investments in certain BlackRock products. The $52 million increase related primarily to higher levels of average AUM in cash management products. Distribution and servicing costs for the year ended December 31, 2008 included $464 million of costs attributable to Merrill Lynch and affiliates and $30 million of costs attributable to PNC and affiliates as compared to $444 million and $28 million, respectively, in the year ended December 31, 2007. The increased costs attributable to Merrill Lynch was offset by approximately $10 million expense reduction associated with the 2007 termination of closed-end fund administration and servicing arrangements. Distribution and servicing costs related to other non-related third parties increased $30 million as a result of an expansion of distribution platforms. Amortization of Deferred Mutual Fund Sales Commissions Amortization of deferred mutual fund sales commissions increased by $22 million to $130 million for the year ended December 31, 2008, as compared to $108 million for the year ended December 31, 2007. The increase in amortization of deferred mutual fund sales commissions was primarily the result of the acquisition of distribution financing arrangements from PNC in second quarter 2007 as well as higher sales and redemptions in certain share classes of open-ended funds. Direct Fund Expenses Direct fund expenses increased $6 million, or 8%, to $86 million during the year ended December 31, 2008 compared to $80 million for the year ended December 31, 2007. 72 Table of Contents Item 7.

Other general and administration costs decreased $80 million, or 49%, to $83 million from $163 million, primarily related to a $49 million decrease in foreign currency remeasurement costs and $26 million decrease in costs associated with the support of two enhanced cash funds. Closed-end funds launch costs decreased $27 million as compared to the year ended December 31, 2007 due to three closed-end funds launched during the year ended December 31, 2007, which generated approximately $3.0 billion in AUM as compared to two closed-end funds launched in the year ended December 31, 2008, which generated approximately $400 million in AUM. Professional services decreased $18 million, or 19%, to $76 million compared to $94 million for the year ended December 31, 2007 primarily due to decreases in accounting, tax and other consulting costs related to the MLIM integration in 2007. Marketing and promotional expenses decreased $15 million, or 9%, primarily due to a decline in travel and promotional expenses. The decreases discussed above were partially offset by a $9 million, or 7%, increase in occupancy expenses to $139 million compared to $130 million for the year ended December 31, 2007 as a result of expansion of offices worldwide (including the full-year effect of the Quellos Transaction). Restructuring Charges For the year ended December 31, 2008, BlackRock recorded pre-tax restructuring charges of $38 million, primarily related to severance, outplacement costs and accelerated amortization of certain previously granted stock awards associated with a 9% reduction in work force. See Restructuring charges discussion in Note 20 to the consolidated financial statements beginning on page F-1 of this Form 10-K. 73 Table of Contents Item 7.

Amortization of Intangible Assets The $16 million increase in the amortization of intangible assets to $146 million for the year ended December 31, 2008, compared to $130 million for the year ended December 31, 2007, primarily reflects the full-year impact of the amortization of finite-lived intangible assets acquired in the Quellos Transaction.

Non-operating income (expense), less net income (loss) attributable to non-controlling interests, decreased $584 million to $422 million of expense for the year ended December 31, 2008, as compared to non-operating income, less net income (loss) attributable to non-controlling interests of $162 million for the year ended December 31, 2007. The decrease in net non-operating income (expense), less net income (loss) attributable to non-controlling interests, primarily reflects declines in valuations from seed investments and co-investments in real estate funds, private equity and hedge funds/funds of hedge funds (which includes the impact of a $141 million decline in valuations of distressed credit products) and a $50 million decline in valuations of investments associated with certain deferred compensation plans. In addition, net interest expense increased $26 million primarily related to incremental interest expense related to the full year effect of the $700 million issuance of long-term debt in September 2007. 75 Table of Contents Item 7. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Operating results for the year ended December 31, 2008, as compared with the year ended December 31, 2007 (continued) Income Tax Expense Income tax expense was $387 million and $463 million for the years ended December 31, 2008 and 2007, respectively. The effective income tax rate for the year ended December 31, 2008 was 33.0%, as compared to 31.8% for the year ended December 31, 2007. The increase in the effective income tax rate was primarily the result of a one-time tax benefit of $51 million recognized in 2007 due to tax legislation changes enacted in the third quarter 2007 in the United Kingdom and Germany, which resulted in a revaluation of certain deferred tax liabilities. Accordingly, BlackRock revalued its deferred tax liabilities in these jurisdictions. Excluding this deferred income tax benefit, the 2007 adjusted effective tax rate was 35.3%. The effective income tax rate for the year ended December 31, 2008 declined as compared to the 2007 adjusted effective tax rate, primarily as a result of the impact of foreign taxes. Operating Income and Operating Margin GAAP Operating income totaled $1,593 million for the year ended December 31, 2008, which was an increase of $299 million compared to the year ended December 31, 2007. The Company’s operating margin was 31.5% for the year ended December 31, 2008, compared to 26.7% for the year ended December 31, 2007. Operating income and operating margin for the year ended December 31, 2008 included a $50 million foreign currency remeasurement benefit and a $38 million deferred compensation benefit due to depreciation on assets related to certain deferred compensation plans, offset by $38 million of restructuring charges. Operating income and operating margin for the year ended December 31, 2007 included to the termination of certain closed-end fund servicing and administration arrangements of $128 million, $42 million of closed-end fund launch costs and commissions and $20 million of MLIM integration costs. As Adjusted Operating income, as adjusted, totaled $1,662 million for the year ended December 31, 2008, which was an increase of $144 million compared to the year ended December 31, 2007. Operating margin, as adjusted, was 38.7% and 37.5% for the years ended December 31, 2008 and 2007, respectively. The growth of operating income, as adjusted, and operating margin, as adjusted, for the year ended December 31, 2008 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2007 is primarily related to $219 million of revenue growth (including the full year impact of the Quellos Transaction) and a $49 million decline in foreign currency remeasurement costs, offset by a $91 million increase in salaries and benefits and a $16 million increase in amortization of finite-lived intangible assets primarily associated with the Quellos Transaction. Operating income, as adjusted, and operating margin, as adjusted, are described in more detail in the Overview to Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. 76 Table of Contents Item 7.

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Operating results for the year ended December 31, 2008, as compared with the year ended December 31, 2007 (continued) Net Income Attributable to BlackRock, Inc. (continued) Net income attributable to BlackRock, Inc. for the year ended December 31, 2008 included operating income of $1,593 million, or $7.86 per diluted share, and non-operating losses, less net income (loss) attributable to non-controlling interests, of $422 million, or $2.08 per diluted common share, versus a $0.78 gain per diluted common share in 2007. Net income attributable to BlackRock, Inc. totaled $784 million, or $5.78 per diluted common share, for the year ended December 31, 2008, which was a decrease of $209 million, or $1.59 per diluted common share, compared to the year ended December 31, 2007. Net income attributable to BlackRock, Inc. for the year ended December 31, 2008 included the after-tax impact of the portion of LTIP awards which will be funded through a capital contribution of BlackRock stock held by PNC, an expected contribution by Merrill Lynch to fund certain compensation of former MLIM employees, a portion of which has been received by BlackRock in 2009, and restructuring charges of $39 million, $7 million, and $26 million, respectively. Net income attributable to BlackRock, Inc. of $993 million for the year ended December 31, 2007 included the after-tax effect related to the termination of certain closed-end fund administration and servicing arrangements of $82 million, the portion of certain LTIP awards which will be funded through a capital contribution of BlackRock stock held by PNC of $34 million, MLIM integration costs of $13 million and an expected contribution by Merrill Lynch of $6 million to fund certain compensation of former MLIM employees, a portion of which has been received by BlackRock in 2009. In addition, the United Kingdom and Germany enacted legislation reducing corporate income tax rates resulting in a one-time decrease of $51 million in income tax expense which is included in net income. Exclusive of these items in both periods, diluted earnings per common share, as adjusted, for the year ended December 31, 2008 decreased $1.69, or 21%, to $6.30 compared to the year ended December 31, 2007. Diluted earnings per common share, as adjusted, is described in more detail in the Overview to Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. Liquidity and Capital Resources BlackRock Cash Flows Excluding the Impact of Consolidated Sponsored Investment Funds In accordance with GAAP, certain BlackRock sponsored investment funds are consolidated into the financial statements of BlackRock, notwithstanding the fact that BlackRock may only have a minority economic interest in these funds. As a result, BlackRock’s consolidated statements of cash flows include the cash flows of consolidated sponsored investment funds. The Company uses an adjusted cash flow statement, which excludes the impact of consolidated sponsored investment funds, as a supplemental non-GAAP measure to assess liquidity and capital requirements. The Company believes that its cash flows, excluding the impact of the consolidated sponsored investment funds, provide investors with useful information on the cash flows of BlackRock relating to our ability to fund additional operating, investing and financing activities. BlackRock’s management does not advocate that investors consider such non-GAAP measures in isolation from, or as a substitute for its cash flow presented in accordance with GAAP. 78 Table of Contents PART II—FINANCIAL INFORMATION (continued) Item 7. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Liquidity and Capital Resources (continued) BlackRock Cash Flows Excluding the Impact of Consolidated Sponsored Investment Funds (continued) The following table presents a reconciliation of the Company’s consolidated statements of cash flows presented on a GAAP basis to the Company’s consolidated statements of cash flows, excluding the impact of the cash flows of consolidated sponsored investment funds: Year endedDecember 31,2009 Year endedDecember 31,2008(1) Variance (Dollar amounts in millions) GAAPBasis Impact onCash FlowsofConsolidatedSponsoredInvestmentFunds Cash FlowsExcludingImpact ofConsolidatedSponsoredInvestmentFunds Cash FlowsExcludingImpact ofConsolidatedSponsoredInvestmentFunds Amount % Cash flows from operating activities $ 1,399 $ 168 $ 1,231 $ 1,503 $ (272 ) (18 %) Cash flows from investing activities (5,519 ) 31 (5,550 ) (385 ) (5,165 ) NM Cash flows from financing activities 6,749 (185 ) 6,934 (477 ) 7,411 NM Effect of exchange rate changes on cash and cash equivalents 47 — 47 (259 ) 306 NM Net change in cash and cash equivalents 2,676 14 2,662 382 2,280 NM Cash and cash equivalents, beginning of period 2,032 61 1,971 1,589 382 24 % Cash and cash equivalents, end of period $ 4,708 $ 75 $ 4,633 $ 1,971 $ 2,662 135 % NM – Not Meaningful (1) For further information see the Company’s Current Report on Form 8-K, which updated the financial information in the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2008, which was filed with the SEC on September 17, 2009. Cash and cash equivalents, excluding cash held by consolidated sponsored investment funds, at December 31, 2009 increased $2,662 million from December 31, 2008, primarily resulting from $1,231 million of cash inflows from operating activities, $6,934 million of cash inflows from financing activities, $5,550 million of cash outflows from investing activities and a $47 million increase due to the effect of foreign exchange rate changes. 79 Table of Contents PART II—FINANCIAL INFORMATION (continued) Item 7. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Liquidity and Capital Resources (continued) BlackRock Cash Flows Excluding the Impact of Consolidated Sponsored Investment Funds (continued) Operating Activities Sources of BlackRock’s operating cash primarily include investment advisory, administration fees and securities lending revenue, revenues from BlackRock Solutions and advisory products and services and mutual fund distribution fees. BlackRock uses its cash to pay compensation and benefits, distribution and servicing costs, general and administration expenses, interest and principal on the Company’s borrowings, income taxes and dividends on BlackRock’s capital stock and to purchase co-investments and seed investments, and pay for capital expenditures. Net cash inflows from operating activities, excluding the impact of consolidated sponsored investment funds, for the year ended December 31, 2009, primarily include the receipt of investment advisory and administration fees, securities lending revenue and other revenue offset by the payment of operating expenses incurred in the normal course of business. In addition, in December 2009 subsequent to the close of the BGI Transaction, there was an operating cash outflow of $356 million related to the payment of certain accrued BGI employee compensation assumed by BlackRock, which was funded by cash and investments acquired in connection with the BGI Transaction. Investing Activities Cash outflows from investing activities, excluding the impact of consolidated sponsored investment funds, for the year ended December 31, 2009 primarily included a $5.6 billion outflow, net of $1,055 million of cash acquired related to the BGI Transaction, a $156 million contingent consideration payment to Quellos paid in the second quarter, $73 million of purchases of investments and $65 million of purchases of property and equipment, partially offset by $260 million of net proceeds from sales and maturities of investments and $89 million of return of capital from equity method investees. Financing Activities Cash inflows from financing activities, excluding the impact of consolidated sponsored investment funds, for the year ended December 31, 2009 primarily included the receipt of $2.8 billion from equity raised in connection with financing the BGI Transaction, $2.5 billion of long-term note issuances, $2 billion of net commercial paper financing and a $25 million receipt of a Merrill Lynch cash capital contribution to fund certain compensation expense, partially offset by $422 million of payments for cash dividends. 80 Table of Contents PART II—FINANCIAL INFORMATION (continued) Item 7. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Liquidity and Capital Resources (continued) Capital Resources The Company manages its financial condition and funding to maintain appropriate liquidity for the business. Capital resources at December 31, 2009 and 2008 were as follows: December 31,2009 December 31,2008 Variance (Dollar amounts in millions) Amount % Cash and cash equivalents $ 4,708 $ 2,032 $ 2,676 132 % Cash and cash equivalents held by consolidated sponsored investment funds1 (75 ) (61 ) (14 ) (23 )% Subtotal 4,633 1,971 2,662 135 % 2007 credit facility – undrawn2 2,171 2,171 — — % Commercial paper3 (2,034 ) — (2,034 ) NM Committed access before required regulatory capital $ 4,770 $ 4,142 $ 628 15 % Required regulatory capital4 $ 857 $ 172 $ 685 398 % 1 The Company may not be able to access such cash to use in its operating activities. 2 Excludes $129 million of undrawn amounts at December 31, 2009 and 2008 related to Lehman Commercial Paper, Inc. 3 The outstanding commercial paper notes that are supported by the 2007 credit facility reduce the availability of the facility. 4 A portion of the required regulatory capital is partially met with cash and cash equivalents. In addition, a significant portion of the Company’s $844 million of net economic investments are illiquid in nature and, as such, may not be readily convertible to cash. Short-term Borrowings 2007 Facility In August 2007, the Company entered into a five-year, $2.5 billion unsecured revolving credit facility (the “2007 facility”). The 2007 facility requires the Company not to exceed a maximum leverage ratio (ratio of net debt to earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, where net debt equals total debt less domestic unrestricted cash) of 3 to 1, which was satisfied with a ratio of less than 1 to 1 at December 31, 2009. At December 31, 2009, the Company had $200 million outstanding under the 2007 facility with an interest rate of 0.44% and a maturity date during February 2010. During February 2010, the Company rolled over $100 million in borrowings with an interest rate of 0.43% and a maturity date in May 2010. Lehman Commercial Paper, Inc. has a $140 million participation under the 2007 facility; however, BlackRock does not expect that Lehman Commercial Paper, Inc. will honor its commitment to fund additional amounts. Bank of America, a related party, has a $140 million participation under the 2007 facility. 81 Table of Contents PART II—FINANCIAL INFORMATION (continued) Item 7. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Liquidity and Capital Resources (continued) Short-term Borrowings (continued) Commercial Paper Program On October 14, 2009, BlackRock established a commercial paper program (the “CP Program”) under which the Company may issue unsecured commercial paper notes (the “CP Notes”) on a private placement basis up to a maximum aggregate amount outstanding at any time of $3 billion. The proceeds of the commercial paper issuances were used to finance a portion of the BGI Transaction. Subsidiaries of Bank of America and Barclays, both related parties, as well as other third parties, act as dealers under the CP Program. At year-end the CP Program was supported by the 2007 facility. The Company began to issue CP Notes under the CP Program on November 4, 2009. As of December 31, 2009, BlackRock had approximately $2 billion of outstanding CP Notes with a weighted average interest rate of 0.20% and a weighted average maturity of 23 days. Since December 31, 2009, the Company repaid approximately $1.4 billion of CP Notes with proceeds from the long-term note issuances in December 2009 and operating cash flow. See Note 13, Borrowings, in the consolidated financial statements beginning on page F-1 of this Form 10-K for further discussion. As of March 5, 2010, BlackRock had $596 million of outstanding CP Notes supported by the 2007 facility with a weighted average interest rate of 0.18% and a weighted average maturity of 38 days. The Company expects that the outstanding balance of CP Notes may fluctuate throughout the year. Japan Commitment-line In June 2009, BlackRock Japan Co., Ltd., a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company, renewed its five billion Japanese yen commitment-line agreement (the “Japan Commitment-line”) for a term of one year. The Japan Commitment-line is intended to provide liquidity and flexibility for operating requirements in Japan. At December 31, 2009, the Company had no borrowings outstanding under the Japan Commitment-line. Conversion of Convertible Debentures On February 15, 2009, the convertible debentures became convertible at the option of the holder into cash and shares of the Company’s common stock at any time prior to maturity. During 2009, holders of $7 million of convertible debentures elected to convert their holdings into cash and shares. In addition, during January and February 2010, holders of $148 million of convertible debentures elected to convert their holdings into cash and shares. Other Cash Uses As certain acquired BGI receivables are collected during 2010, it is anticipated that the Company will pay Barclays approximately $190 million to settle certain non-interest bearing notes assumed in the BGI Transaction. In addition, BlackRock Institutional Trust Company, National Association (“BTC”), a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company, expects to purchase approximately $300 million of additional Federal Reserve Bank stock during the first quarter of 2010 pursuant to its regulatory requirements. 82 Table of Contents PART II—FINANCIAL INFORMATION (continued) Item 7. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Liquidity and Capital Resources (continued) Support of Two Enhanced Cash Funds In December 2007, BlackRock entered into capital support agreements with the two enhanced cash funds backed by letters of credit drawn under BlackRock’s existing credit facility. Pursuant to the capital support agreements, BlackRock agreed to make subsequent capital contributions to the funds to cover realized losses, up to $100 million, related to specified securities held by the funds. In December 2008, BlackRock’s maximum potential obligation under the capital support agreements was reduced to $45 million, and in 2009 both capital support agreements were terminated, due to the closure of the related funds. BlackRock provided approximately $4 million of capital contributions to these funds for the year ended December 31, 2009 under the capital support agreements. BlackRock holds debt securities it received in lieu of its remaining investment in one fund and securities it directly purchased from both enhanced cash funds prior to closure of the funds in 2009. At December 31, 2009, the carrying value of the remaining debt securities was $12 million. In applying the provisions of ASC 810-10, Consolidation (“ASC 810-10”), BlackRock concluded that it was the primary beneficiary of the two enhanced cash funds at December 31, 2008, which resulted in consolidation of the funds on its consolidated statements of financial condition. Barclays Support of Certain Securities Lending Related Cash Funds Barclays has provided capital support agreements to support certain securities lending related cash management products acquired by BlackRock in the BGI Transaction. Pursuant to the terms of the capital support agreements, Barclays agreed to cover losses on covered securities within the products in the aggregate of up to $2.2 billion from December 1, 2009 through December 1, 2013. BlackRock and Barclays have procedures in place to determine loss events on covered securities within the products and to ensure support payments from Barclays. As of February 2010, Barclays’ remaining maximum potential obligation in the aggregate under the capital support agreements was $2.2 billion. At December 31, 2009, BlackRock concluded that although these funds were variable interest entities, it was not the primary beneficiary of these funds. Capital Activities On August 2, 2006, BlackRock announced that its Board of Directors had authorized a share repurchase program to purchase an additional 2.1 million shares of BlackRock common stock. Pursuant to this repurchase program, BlackRock may make repurchases from time to time, as market conditions warrant, in the open market or in privately negotiated transactions at the discretion of management. The Company repurchased 1,348,600 shares under the program in open market transactions for approximately $200.9 million through December 31, 2007 and the Company did not repurchase any additional shares under the program during 2008 and 2009. As a result, the Company is currently authorized to repurchase an additional 751,400 shares under its share repurchase program. Net Capital Requirements The Company is required to maintain net capital in certain regulated subsidiaries within a number of jurisdictions, which is met in part by retaining cash and cash equivalents in those jurisdictions. As a result, such subsidiaries of the Company may be restricted in their ability to transfer cash between different jurisdictions and to their parents. Additionally, transfers of cash between international jurisdictions, including repatriation to the United States, may have adverse tax consequences that could discourage such transfers. BTC, a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company, is chartered as a national bank that does not accept client deposits and whose powers are limited to trust activities. BTC provides investment management services, including investment advisory and securities lending agency services to institutional investors and other clients. BTC is subject to various regulatory capital and liquid asset requirements administered by Federal banking agencies. At December 31, 2009, the Company was required to maintain approximately $857 million in net capital at these subsidiaries, including BTC, and is in compliance with all applicable regulatory minimum net capital requirements. 83 Table of Contents Item 7.

Due to the uncertainty of timing and amounts that will ultimately be paid, this amount has been excluded from the table above. 84 Table of Contents Item 7. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Liquidity and Capital Resources (continued) Contractual Obligations, Commitments and Contingencies (continued) Long-term Borrowings At December 31, 2009, long-term borrowings were $3.2 billion. Debt service and repayment requirements are $140 million in each of 2010 and 2011, $640 million in 2012, $129 million in 2013 and $1,129 million in 2014. 2017 Notes In September 2007, the Company issued $700 million in aggregate principal amount of 6.25% senior unsecured notes maturing on September 15, 2017 (the “2017 Notes”). A portion of the net proceeds of the Notes was used to fund the initial cash payment for the acquisition of the fund of funds business of Quellos and the remainder was used for general corporate purposes. Interest is payable semi-annually in arrears on March 15 and September 15 of each year, or approximately $44 million per year. The 2017 Notes may be redeemed prior to maturity at any time in whole or in part at the option of the Company at a “make-whole” redemption price. The 2017 Notes were issued at a discount of $6 million, which is being amortized over the ten-year term. 2012, 2014 and 2019 Notes In December 2009, the Company issued $2.5 billion in aggregate principal amount of unsecured and unsubordinated obligations. These notes were issued as three separate series of senior debt securities including $0.5 billion of 2.25% notes, $1.0 billion of 3.50% notes and $1.0 billion of 5.0% notes maturing in December 2012, 2014 and 2019, respectively. Net proceeds of this offering were used to repay borrowings under our commercial paper program, which was used to finance a portion of the BGI Transaction, and for general corporate purposes. Interest on these notes of approximately $96 million per year is payable semi-annually in arrears on June 10 and December 10 of each year beginning June 10, 2010. These notes may be redeemed prior to maturity at any time in whole or in part at the option of the Company at a “make-whole” redemption price. These notes were issued collectively at a discount of $5 million, which is being amortized over approximately a weighted 6.6 year term. Convertible Debentures In February 2005, the Company issued $250 million aggregate principal amount of convertible debentures due in 2035 and bearing interest at a rate of 2.625% per annum. Interest payments are approximately $6 million per year and are payable semi-annually in arrears on February 15 and August 15 of each year. Beginning in February 2009 the convertible debentures became convertible at the option of the holders at any time. At December 31, 2009, convertible debentures outstanding were $243 million and on, and after, February 20, 2010 became callable by the Company at any time following not more than 60 but not less than 30 days notice. On the contractual obligations table above, the remaining $243 million principal balance of the convertible debentures is assumed, although not determined, to be fully repaid in 2010. Short-term Borrowings 2007 Facility At December 31, 2009, the Company had $200 million outstanding under the 2007 facility with an interest rate of 0.44% and a maturity during February 2010. During February 2010, the Company rolled over $100 million in borrowings with a maturity date in May 2010. Commercial Paper Program At December 31, 2009, BlackRock had approximately $2 billion of outstanding CP Notes with a weighted average interest rate of 0.20% and a weighted average maturity of 23 days. Since December 31, 2009, the Company repaid approximately $1.4 billion of CP Notes with proceeds from the long-term note issuances in December 2009 as well as operating cash flow. As of March 5, 2010, BlackRock had $596 million of outstanding CP Notes with a weighted average interest rate of 0.18% and a weighted average maturity of 38 days. The Company expects to repay the remaining balance with operating cash flow. 85 Table of Contents Item 7. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Liquidity and Capital Resources (continued) Contractual Obligations, Commitments and Contingencies (continued) Operating Leases The Company leases its primary office space under agreements that currently expire through 2023. In connection with certain lease agreements, the Company is responsible for escalation payments. The contractual obligations table above includes only guaranteed minimum lease payments for such leases and does not project potential escalation or other lease-related payments. These leases are classified as operating leases and, as such, are not recorded as liabilities on the consolidated statements of financial condition. In January 2010, the Company entered into an agreement for a lease in London which began in February 2010 and will continue for twenty-five years, with the option to renew for an additional five-year term. The lease provides for total annual base rental payments of approximately $22 million, which is subject to increase on each fifth anniversary of the beginning of the lease. Purchase Obligations In the ordinary course of business, BlackRock enters into contracts or purchase obligations with third parties whereby the third parties provide services to or on behalf of BlackRock. Purchase obligations included in the contractual obligations table above represent executory contracts, which are either non-cancelable or cancelable with a penalty. At December 31, 2009, the Company’s obligations primarily reflect standard service contracts for portfolio, market data and office related services. Purchase obligations are recorded on the Company’s financial statements when services are provided and, as such, obligations for services not received are not included in the Company’s consolidated statement of financial condition at December 31, 2009. Investment/Loan Commitments At December 31, 2009, the Company had $311 million of various capital commitments to fund sponsored investment funds. This amount excludes additional commitments made by consolidated funds of funds to underlying third party funds as third party non-controlling interest holders have the legal obligation to fund the respective commitments of such funds of funds. Generally, the timing of the funding of these commitments is unknown. Therefore, amounts are shown to be paid upon the expiration date of the commitment. Actual payments could be made at any time prior to such expiration date and, if not called by that date, such commitments would expire. These commitments have not been recorded on the Company’s consolidated statements of financial condition at December 31, 2009. The above schedule does not include potential future commitments approved by the Company’s Capital Committee, but which are not yet legally binding commitments. The Company intends to make additional capital commitments from time to time to fund additional investment products for, and with, its clients. At December 31, 2009, the Company was committed to provide financing of up to $60 million, until March 2010, to Anthracite Capital, Inc. (“Anthracite”), a specialty commercial real estate finance company that is managed by a subsidiary of BlackRock. The financing is collateralized by Anthracite pledging its ownership interest in a real estate debt investment fund, which is also managed by BlackRock. At December 31, 2009, $33.5 million of financing was outstanding and remains outstanding as of March 10, 2010, which is past its final maturity date of March 5, 2010. At December 31, 2009, the value of the collateral was estimated to be $12.5 million, which resulted in a $21 million reduction in due from related parties on the Company’s consolidated statement of financial condition and an equal amount recorded in general and administration expense in the year ended December 31, 2009. The Company has no obligation to lend additional amounts to Anthracite under this facility. The Company continues to evaluate the collectability of the outstanding borrowings by reviewing the carrying value of the net assets of the collateral, which fluctuates each period. 86 Table of Contents Item 7. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Liquidity and Capital Resources (continued) Contractual Obligations, Commitments and Contingencies (continued) As a general partner in certain private equity partnerships, the Company receives certain carried interest distributions from the partnerships according to the provisions of the partnership agreements. The Company may, from time to time, be required to return all or a portion of such distributions to the limited partners in the event the limited partners do not achieve a certain return as specified in the various partnership agreements. Contingent Distribution Obligations BlackRock has entered into an amended and restated global distribution agreement with Merrill Lynch, which requires the Company to make payments to Merrill Lynch contingent upon sales of products and level of assets under management maintained in certain BlackRock products. The economic terms of the agreement will remain in effect until January 2014. After such term, the agreement will renew for one automatic three-year extension if certain conditions are satisfied. The above schedule reflects the Company’s estimated payments for 2010, which due to uncertainty of asset levels and future additional sales, has been held constant for 2011 through 2013. Contingent Payments Related to Business Acquisitions SSRM Holdings: In January 2005, the Company closed its acquisition of SSRM Holdings, Inc. from MetLife for adjusted consideration of approximately $265 million in cash and 550,000 restricted shares of BlackRock common stock and certain additional contingent payments. In January 2010, the fifth anniversary of the closing of the SSR Transaction, MetLife was entitled to receive an additional payment of $9 million, which is expected to be paid in March 2010, based on the Company’s retained AUM associated with the MetLife defined benefit and defined contribution plans. Quellos: In connection with the Quellos Transaction, Quellos is entitled to receive two contingent payments, subject to achieving certain investment advisory base and performance fee measures through December 31, 2010, totaling up to an additional $969 million in a combination of cash and stock. During second quarter 2009, the Company determined the amount of the first contingent payment to be $219 million, of which $11 million was previously paid in cash during 2008. Of the remaining $208 million, during second quarter 2009, $156 million was paid in cash and $52 million was paid in common stock, or approximately 330,000 shares based on a price of $157.33 per share. The second contingent payment, of up to $595 million, is payable in cash in 2011. Quellos may also be entitled to a “catch-up” payment in 2011 if certain investment advisory base fee measures are met through 2010 as the value of the first contingent payment was less than $374 million. A portion of the second contingent payment, not to exceed $90 million, may be paid to Quellos based on factors including the continued employment of certain employees with BlackRock. Therefore, this portion, not to exceed $90 million, would be recorded as employee compensation. The contractual obligation table above includes both the maximum potential remaining payment of $155 million related to the catch up payment associated with the first contingent payment and $595 million related to the second contingent payment. 87 Table of Contents Item 7. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Contractual Obligations, Commitments and Contingencies (continued) The following items have not been included in the contractual obligations, commitments and contingencies table: Compensation and Benefit Obligations The Company has various compensation and benefit obligations, including bonuses, commissions and incentive payments payable, defined contribution plan matching contribution obligations, and deferred compensation arrangements, that are excluded from the table above primarily due to uncertainties in their payout periods. These arrangements are discussed in more detail in Notes 15 and 16 to the consolidated financial statements beginning on page F-1 of this Form 10-K. Accrued compensation and benefits at December 31, 2009 totaled $1,482 million and included incentive compensation of $1,132 million, including $481 million related to BGI, deferred compensation of $112 million and other compensation and benefits related obligations of $238 million. Incentive compensation was primarily paid in the first quarter of 2010, while the deferred compensation obligations are payable over periods up to five years. Separate Account Liabilities The Company’s two wholly-owned registered life insurance companies in the United Kingdom maintain separate account assets representing segregated funds held for purposes of funding individual and group pension contracts. The net investment income and net realized and unrealized gains and losses attributable to these separate account assets accrue to the contract owners and, as such, an offsetting separate account liability is recorded. At December 31, 2009, the Company had $119.6 billion of assets and offsetting liabilities on the consolidated statement of financial condition. The payment of these contractual obligations is inherently uncertain and varies by customer. As such, these liabilities have been excluded from the contractual obligations table above. Indemnifications In many of the Company’s contracts, including the BGI, MLIM and Quellos Transaction agreements, BlackRock agrees to indemnify third parties under certain circumstances. The terms of the indemnities vary from contract to contract and the amount of indemnification liability, if any, cannot be determined and has not been included in the table above or recorded in the Company’s consolidated statement of financial condition at December 31, 2009. See further discussion in Note 14 to the consolidated financial statements beginning on page F-1 of this Form 10-K. 88 Table of Contents Item 7. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Critical Accounting Policies The preparation of the consolidated financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods. Actual results could differ significantly from those estimates. Management considers the following critical accounting policies important to understanding the consolidated financial statements. For a summary of these and additional accounting policies as well as recent accounting developments. See Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements beginning on page F-1 of this Form 10-K. Consolidation The accounting method used for the Company’s investments is dependent upon the influence the Company has over its investee. For investments where BlackRock can exert control over the financial and operating policies of the investee, which generally exists if there is a 50% or greater voting interest or if partners or members of certain products do not have substantive rights, the investee is consolidated into BlackRock’s financial statements. Pursuant to ASC 810-10, for certain investments where the risks and rewards of ownership are not directly linked to voting interests (“variable interest entities” or “VIEs”), an investee may be consolidated if BlackRock is considered the primary beneficiary of the VIE. The primary beneficiary of a VIE is the party that absorbs a majority of the entity’s expected losses, receives a majority of the entity’s expected residual returns, or both, as a result of holding variable interests. Significant judgment is required in the determination of whether the Company is the primary beneficiary of a VIE. If the Company, together with its related party relationships, is determined to be the primary beneficiary of a VIE, the entity will be consolidated within BlackRock’s consolidated financial statements. In order to determine whether the Company is the primary beneficiary of a VIE, management must make significant estimates and assumptions of probable future cash flows and assign probabilities to different cash flow scenarios. Assumptions made in such analyses include, but are not limited to, market prices of securities, market interest rates, potential credit defaults on individual securities or default rates on a portfolio of securities, gain realization, liquidity or marketability of certain securities, discount rates and the probability of certain other outcomes. 89 Table of Contents Item 7. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Critical Accounting Policies (continued) Consolidation (continued) As of December 31, 2009, the Company was the primary beneficiary of one VIE, a private equity fund of funds, resulting in the consolidation of the fund on its consolidated financial statements. The Company, as general partner or managing member of its funds, is generally presumed to control funds that are limited partnerships or limited liability companies. Pursuant to ASC 810-20, Control of Partnerships and Similar Entities (“ASC 810-20”), the Company reviews such investment vehicles to determine if such a presumption can be overcome by determining if other non-affiliated partners or members of the limited partnership or limited liability company have the substantive ability to dissolve (liquidate) the investment vehicle, or otherwise to remove BlackRock as the general partner or managing member without cause based on a simple unaffiliated majority vote, or have other substantive participating rights. If the investment vehicle is not a VIE and the presumption of control is not overcome, the investment vehicle will be consolidated into BlackRock’s financial statements. At December 31, 2009 and 2008, as a result of consolidation of various investment products under the consolidation policies described above, the Company had the following balances on its consolidated statements of financial condition: December 31,2009 December 31,2008 Cash and cash equivalents $ 75 $ 61 Investments 463 728 Other net assets (liabilities) (7 ) 12 Non-controlling interests (273 ) (491 ) Total exposure to consolidated investment funds $ 258 $ 310 The Company has retained the specialized accounting of these investment funds pursuant to ASC 810-10. Investments Equity Method Investments For equity investments where BlackRock does not control the investee, and where the Company is not the primary beneficiary of a VIE, but can exert significant influence over the financial and operating policies of the investee, the Company uses the equity method of accounting. The evaluation of whether the Company exerts control or significant influence over the financial and operational policies of its investees requires significant judgment based on the facts and circumstances surrounding each individual investment. Factors considered in these evaluations may include the type of investment, the legal structure of the investee, the terms and structure of the investment agreement including investor voting or other rights, the terms of BlackRock’s advisory agreement or other agreements with the investee, any influence BlackRock may have on the governing board of the investee, the legal rights of other investors in the entity pursuant to the fund’s operating documents and the relationship between BlackRock and other investors in the entity. 90 Table of Contents Item 7. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Critical Accounting Policies (continued) Investments (continued) Equity Method Investments (continued) Substantially all of BlackRock’s equity method investees are investment companies which record their underlying investments at fair value. Therefore, under the equity method of accounting, BlackRock’s share of the investee’s underlying net income predominantly represents fair value adjustments in the investments held by the equity method investees. BlackRock’s share of the investee’s underlying net income or loss is based upon the most currently available information and is recorded as non-operating income (expense) for investments in investment companies, or as other revenue for operating or advisory company investments, which are recorded in other assets, since such operating or advisory companies are considered to be connected to BlackRock’s core business. At December 31, 2009, the Company had $405 million and $36 million of equity method investments, including equity method investments held for deferred compensation, reflected within investments and other assets, respectively, and at December 31, 2008 the Company had $531 million and $14 million of equity method investees reflected in investments and other assets, respectively. Impairment of Investments The Company’s management periodically assesses its equity method, available-for-sale, held-to-maturity and cost investments for impairment. If circumstances indicate that impairment may exist, investments are evaluated using market values, where available, or the expected future cash flows of the investment. If the undiscounted expected future cash flows are lower than the Company’s carrying value of the investment, an impairment charge is recorded to the consolidated statements of income. When the fair value of an available-for-sale security is lower than its cost or amortized cost value, the Company evaluates the security to determine whether the impairment is considered “other-than-temporary”. In making this determination for equity securities, the Company considers, among other factors, the length of time the security has been in a loss position, the extent to which the security’s market value is less than its cost, the financial condition and near-term prospects of the security’s issuer and the Company’s ability and intent to hold the security for a period of time sufficient to allow for recovery of such unrealized losses. If the impairment is considered other-than-temporary, a charge is recorded to the consolidated statements of income. In making this determination for debt securities, the Company considers if it: (1) has the intent to sell the security, (2) is more likely than not that an entity will be required to sell the security before recovery, or (3) does not expect to recover the entire amortized cost basis of the security. If the Company does not intend to sell a security and it is not more likely than not that the entity will be required to sell the security, but the security has suffered a credit loss, the impairment charge will be separated into the credit loss component, which would be recorded in earnings, and the remaining portion would be recorded in other comprehensive income. 91 Table of Contents Item 7. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Critical Accounting Policies (continued) Impairment of Investments (continued) For the years ended December 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007, the Company recorded other-than-temporary impairments of $5 million, including $2 million related to credit loss impairments on debt securities, $8 million and $16 million, respectively, related to debt securities and CDO available-for-sale investments, which were recorded in non-operating income (expense) on the consolidated statements of income. The $2 million credit loss impairment in 2009 was determined by comparing the estimated discounted cash flows versus the amortized cost for each individual security. The other-than-temporary impairments related to debt securities were due to adverse credit conditions for a debt instrument that was purchased from an enhanced cash management fund in which the Company determined that it did not have the ability to hold the securities for a period of time sufficient to allow for recovery of such unrealized losses. Evaluations of securities impairments involves significant assumptions and management judgments, which could differ from actual results, and these differences could have a material impact on the Company’s consolidated statements of income. Fair Value Measurements BlackRock adopted the applicable provisions of ASC 820-10, Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures (“ASC 820-10”), as of January 1, 2008, which require, among other things, enhanced disclosures about assets and liabilities that are measured and reported at fair value. The provisions of ASC 820-10 establish a hierarchy that prioritizes inputs to valuation techniques used to measure fair value and requires companies to disclose the fair value of their financial instruments according to a fair value hierarchy (i.e., Level 1, 2 and 3 inputs, as defined). The fair value hierarchy gives the highest priority to quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities and the lowest priority to unobservable inputs. Additionally, companies are required to provide enhanced disclosure regarding instruments in the Level 3 category (which have inputs to the valuation techniques that are unobservable and require significant management judgment), including a reconciliation of the beginning and ending balances separately for each major category of assets and liabilities. Financial instruments measured and reported at fair value are classified and disclosed in one of the following categories: Level 1 Inputs - Quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities at the reporting date. Level 1 assets include listed mutual funds and equities. Level 2 Inputs - Quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets; quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities that are not active; and inputs other than quoted prices that are observable, such as models or other valuation methodologies. Assets that generally are included in this category may include debt securities, short-term floating rate notes and asset-backed securities, securities held within consolidated hedge funds, certain limited partnership interests in hedge funds in which the valuations for substantially all of the investments within the fund are based upon Level 1 or Level 2 inputs, restricted public securities valued at a discount, as well as over-the-counter derivatives, including interest and inflation rate swaps and foreign exchange currency contracts that have inputs to the valuations that can be generally corroborated by observable market data. Level 3 Inputs - Unobservable inputs for the valuation of the asset or liability, which may include non-binding broker quotes. Level 3 assets include investments for which there is little, if any, market activity. These inputs require significant management judgment or estimation. Assets included in this category generally include general and limited partnership interests in private equity funds, funds of private equity funds, real estate funds, hedge funds, and funds of hedge funds, direct private equity investments held within consolidated funds and certain held for sale real estate disposal assets. 92 Table of Contents Item 7. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Critical Accounting Policies (continued) Fair Value Measurements (continued) Level 3 inputs include BlackRock capital accounts for its partnership interests in various alternative investments. BlackRock’s $687 million of Level 3 investments at December 31, 2009 primarily include co-investments in private equity fund of funds and private equity funds, funds of hedge funds as well as funds that invest in distressed credit and mortgage securities and real estate equity products. Many of these investees are investment companies, which record their underlying investments at fair value based on fair value policies established by management of the underlying fund, which could include BlackRock employees. Fair value policies at the underlying fund generally utilize pricing information from third party sources, however, in some instances current valuation information, for illiquid securities or securities in markets that are not active, may not be available from any third party source or fund management may conclude that the valuations that are available from third party sources are not reliable. In these instances fund management may perform model-based analytical valuations that may be used to value these investments. The Company’s assessment of the significance of a particular input to the fair value measurement in its entirety requires judgment and considers factors specific to the financial instrument. During the year ended December 31, 2009, the Company reclassified approximately $22 million of net investments out of Level 3. The majority of the net reclassification was related to an equity method investment, for which the Company determined that the capital account of the investment fund no longer represented fair value as determined under fair value methodologies. Changes in value on approximately $932 million of investments will impact the Company’s non-operating income (expense), approximately $73 million will impact accumulated other comprehensive income and the $44 million remainder are not held at fair value. As of December 31, 2009, changes in fair value of approximately $463 million of such investments within consolidated sponsored investment funds will also impact BlackRock’s non-controlling interests expense on the consolidated statements of income. BlackRock’s net exposure to changes in fair value of such consolidated sponsored investment funds is $258 million. BlackRock reports its investments on a GAAP basis, which includes investment balances, which are owned by sponsored investment funds that are deemed to be controlled by BlackRock in accordance with GAAP and therefore are consolidated even though BlackRock may not own a majority of such funds. As a result, management reviews its investments on an “economic” basis, which eliminates the portion of investments that do not impact BlackRock’s book value. BlackRock’s management does not advocate that investors consider such non-GAAP measures in isolation from, or as a substitute for, financial information prepared in accordance with GAAP. 93 Table of Contents Item 7. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Critical Accounting Policies (continued) Fair Value Measurements (continued) The following table represents investments measured at fair value on a recurring basis at December 31, 2009: (Dollar amounts in millions) Quoted Pricesin ActiveMarkets forIdentical Assets(Level 1) SignificantOtherObservableInputs(Level 2) SignificantUnobservableInputs(Level 3) OtherInvestmentsNot Held atFair Value (3) Investments atDecember 31,2009 Total investments, GAAP $ 193 $ 84 $ 687 $ 85 $ 1,049 Net assets for which the Company does not bear “economic” exposure (1) (31 ) (11 ) (163 ) — (205 ) Net “economic” investments (2) $ 162 $ 73 $ 524 $ 85 $ 844 (1) Consists of net assets attributable to non-controlling investors of consolidated sponsored investment funds. (2) Includes BlackRock’s portion of cash and cash equivalents, investments, other assets, accounts payable and accrued liabilities, and other liabilities that are consolidated from sponsored investment funds. (3) Comprised of equity method investments, which include investment companies, and other assets, which in accordance with GAAP are not accounted for under a fair value measure. In accordance with GAAP, certain equity method investees do not account for both their financial assets and financial liabilities under fair value measures, therefore the Company’s investment in such equity method investees may not represent fair value. Goodwill and Intangible Assets At December 31, 2009, the carrying amounts of the Company’s goodwill and intangible assets were as follows: (Dollar amounts in millions) December 31,2009 Goodwill $ 12,570 Intangible assets Indefinite–lived Management contracts 15,163 Trade names/trademarks 1,403 Finite–lived, net of accumulated amortization Management contracts 1,077 Other 5 Total goodwill and intangible assets $ 30,218 94 Table of Contents Item 7. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Critical Accounting Policies (continued) Goodwill and Intangible Assets (continued) The value of contracts acquired in a business acquisition to manage assets in proprietary open- and closed-end investment funds as well as common trust funds without a specified termination date is classified as an indefinite-lived intangible asset. The assignment of indefinite lives to such investment fund contracts is based upon the assumption that there is no foreseeable limit on the contract period to manage these funds due to the likelihood of continued renewal at little or no cost. Goodwill represents the cost of a business acquisition in excess of the fair value of the net assets acquired. In accordance with the applicable provisions of ASC 350, Intangibles - Goodwill and Other (“ASC 350”), indefinite-lived intangible assets and goodwill are not amortized. Finite-lived management contracts are amortized over their remaining expected useful lives, which, at December 31, 2009, ranged from 4 years to 15 years with a weighted average remaining estimated useful life of 7.2 years. Goodwill The Company assesses its goodwill for impairment at least annually, considering such factors as the book value and the market capitalization of the Company. At July 31, 2009 the impairment test that was performed indicated no impairment charges were required. The Company continues to monitor its book value per share as compared to closing prices of its common stock for potential indicators of impairment. At December 31, 2009 the Company’s common stock closed at $232.20, which exceeded its book value of approximately $128.86 per share. Indefinite-lived and finite-lived intangibles The Company assesses its indefinite-lived management contracts for impairment at least annually, considering such factors as AUM, product mix, product margins, and projected cash flows to determine whether the values of each asset are impaired and whether the indefinite-life classification is still appropriate. The fair value of indefinite-lived intangible assets is determined based on the discounted value of expected future cash flows. The fair value of finite-lived intangible assets is reviewed at least annually to determine whether circumstances exist, which indicate there may be a potential impairment. In addition, if such circumstances are considered to exist, the Company will perform an impairment test, using an undiscounted cash flow analysis. If the asset is determined to be impaired, the difference between the book value of the asset and its current fair value is recognized as an expense in the period in which the impairment is determined. Expected future cash flows are estimated using many variables, which require significant management judgment, including market interest rates, equity prices, credit default ratings, discount rates, revenue multiples, inflation rates and AUM growth rates. Actual results could differ from these estimates, which could materially impact the impairment conclusion. In 2009, 2008 and 2007 the Company performed impairment tests, which indicated no impairment charges were required. The Company continues to monitor various factors, including AUM, for potential indicators of impairment. In addition, management judgment is required to estimate the period over which intangible assets will contribute to the Company’s cash flows and the pattern in which these assets will be consumed. A change in the remaining useful life of any of these assets, or the reclassification of an indefinite-lived intangible asset to a finite-lived intangible asset, could have a significant impact on the Company’s amortization expense, which was $147 million, $146 million and $130 million for the years ended December 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively. 95 Table of Contents Item 7. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Critical Accounting Policies (continued) Income Taxes The Company accounts for income taxes under the asset and liability method prescribed by ASC 740. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to temporary differences between the financial statement carrying amount of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases using currently enacted tax rates. The effect of a change in tax rates on deferred tax assets and liabilities is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date. BlackRock adopted the applicable provisions of ASC 740 on January 1, 2007 related to uncertainties in income taxes. ASC 740 clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in a company’s financial statements. ASC 740 prescribes a threshold for measurement and recognition in the financial statements of an asset or liability resulting from a tax position taken or expected to be taken in an income tax return. ASC 740 also provides guidance on, among other things, de-recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities and interest and penalties on uncertain tax positions. The application of ASC 740 requires management to make estimates of the ranges of possible outcomes, the probability of favorable or unfavorable tax outcomes and potential interest and penalties related to such unfavorable outcomes, which require significant management judgment. Actual future tax consequences of uncertain tax positions may be materially different than the Company’s current estimates. At December 31, 2009, BlackRock had $285 million of gross unrecognized tax benefits, of which $184 million, if recognized, would affect the effective tax rate. In accordance with ASC 740, management is required to estimate the timing of the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities, make assumptions about the future deductibility of deferred tax assets and assess deferred tax liabilities based on enacted tax rates for the appropriate tax jurisdictions to determine the amount of such deferred tax assets and liabilities. At December 31, 2009, the Company had net deferred tax assets of $23 million and net deferred tax liabilities of approximately $5,526 million on the consolidated statements of financial condition. Changes in the calculated deferred tax assets and liabilities may occur in certain circumstances, including statutory income tax rate changes, statutory tax law changes, changes in the anticipated timing of recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities or changes in the structure or tax status of the Company. ASC 740 requires the Company to assess whether a valuation allowance should be established against its deferred tax assets based on consideration of all available evidence, both positive and negative, using a more likely than not standard. This assessment considers, among other matters, the nature, frequency and severity of recent losses, forecast of future profitability, the duration of statutory carry back and carry forward periods, the Company’s experience with tax attributes expiring unused, and tax planning alternatives. As of December 31, 2009, the Company has recorded a deferred tax asset of $163 million for unrealized investment losses however no valuation allowance has been established because the Company expects to be able to carry back a portion of its unrealized capital losses when realized, hold certain equity method investments which include fixed income securities over a period sufficient for them to recover their unrealized losses, and generate future capital gains sufficient to offset the unrealized capital losses. Based on the weight of available evidence, it is more likely than not that the deferred tax asset will be realized. However, changes in circumstance could cause the Company to revalue its deferred tax balances with the resulting change impacting the income statement in the period of the change. Such changes may be material to the Company’s consolidated financial statements. See Note 21 to the consolidated financial statements beginning on page F-1 of this Form 10-K for further details. Further, the Company records its income taxes based upon its estimated income tax liability or benefit. The Company’s actual tax liability or benefit may differ from the estimated income tax liability or benefit. The Company had current income taxes receivable of approximately $271 million and current income taxes payable of $96 million at December 31, 2009. 96 Table of Contents Item 7. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Critical Accounting Policies (continued) Revenue Recognition Investment advisory and administration fees are recognized as the services are performed. Such fees are based on pre-determined percentages of the market value of AUM or, in the case of certain real estate separate accounts, net operating income generated by the underlying properties, and are affected by changes in AUM, including market appreciation or depreciation and net subscriptions or redemptions. Investment advisory and administration fees for investment funds are shown net of fees waived pursuant to contractual expense limitations of the funds or voluntary waivers. Certain real estate fees are earned upon the acquisition or disposition of properties in accordance with applicable investment management agreements and are recognized at the closing of the respective real estate transactions. The Company contracts with third parties, as well as related parties, for various mutual fund distribution and shareholder servicing to be performed on behalf of certain non-U.S. funds managed by the Company. Such arrangements generally are priced as a portion of the management fee paid by the fund. In certain cases, the fund takes on the primary responsibility for payment for services such that BlackRock bears no credit risk to the third party. The Company accounts for such retrocession arrangements in accordance with ASC 605-45, Revenue Recognition – Principle Agent Considerations (“ASC 605-45”), and records its investment advisory and administration fees net of retrocessions. Retrocessions for the years ended December 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007 were $611 million, $762 million and $780 million, respectively. The Company has additional contracts for similar services with third parties, which due to the terms of the contracts, are recorded as distribution and servicing costs on the consolidated statements of income. The Company earns revenue by lending securities on behalf of clients, primarily to brokerage institutions. Such revenues are accounted for on an accrual basis. The securities loaned are secured by collateral in the form of cash and securities, ranging from 102% to 108% of the value of the loaned securities. The net income earned on the collateral is shared between the Company and the funds or other third-party accounts managed by the Company from which the securities are borrowed. For the years ended December 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007, securities lending revenue totaled $36 million, $25 million and $27 million, respectively, and is recorded in investment advisory, administration fees and securities lending revenue on the consolidated statements of income. Investment advisory, administration fees and securities lending revenue are reported together as the fees for these services are often agreed upon with clients as a bundled fee. The Company may also receive performance fees or incentive allocations from certain actively managed investment funds and certain separately managed accounts which are primarily alternative, equity or multi-asset class products. These performance fees generally are earned upon exceeding specified relative or absolute investment return thresholds. Such fees are recorded upon completion of the measurement periods, which vary by product or account and could be monthly, quarterly, annually or longer. For the years ended December 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007, performance fee revenue totaled $202 million, $177 million and $350 million, respectively. In addition, the Company may receive carried interest in the form of an investment capital allocation or cash from certain alternative investment funds upon exceeding performance thresholds. However, BlackRock may be required to return all, or part, of such carried interest depending upon performance of these investment products in future periods. Therefore, BlackRock records carried interest subject to such claw-back provisions as performance fees on its consolidated statements of income upon the earlier of the termination of the alternative investment fund or when the likelihood of claw-back is mathematically improbable. The Company records a deferred carried interest liability to the extent it receives cash or capital allocations prior to meeting the revenue recognition criteria. At December 31, 2009 and 2008, the Company had $13 million and $21 million, respectively, of deferred carried interest recorded in other liabilities on the consolidated statements of financial condition. The ultimate recognition of revenue, if any, for these products is unknown. 97 Table of Contents Item 7. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Critical Accounting Policies (continued) Revenue Recognition (continued) Fees earned for BlackRock Solutions, which include advisory services, are recorded as services are performed and are determined using some, or all, of the following methods: (i) fixed fees, (ii) percentages of various attributes of advisory assets under management and (iii) performance fees if contractual thresholds are met. Revenue earned on advisory assignments was comprised of one-time advisory and portfolio structuring fees and ongoing fees based on AUM of the respective portfolio assignment. For the years ended December 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007, BlackRock Solutions and advisory revenue totaled $477 million, $393 million and $190 million, respectively. Adjustments to revenue arising from initial estimates historically have been immaterial since the majority of BlackRock’s investment advisory and administration revenue is calculated based on the fair value of AUM and since the Company does not record revenues until performance thresholds have been exceeded and the likelihood of claw-back of carried interest is mathematically improbable. Related Party Transactions See related party transactions discussion in Note 17 to the consolidated financial statements beginning on page F-1 of this Form 10-K. 98 Table of Contents Item 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK AUM Market Price Risk BlackRock’s investment management revenues are comprised of fees based on a percentage of the value of AUM and, in some cases, performance fees expressed as a percentage of the returns realized on AUM. At December 31, 2009, the majority of our investment advisory and administration fees were based on average or period end AUM of the applicable investment funds or separate accounts. Movements in equity market prices, interest rates/credit spreads, foreign exchange rates, or all three could cause the value of AUM to decline, which would result in lower investment advisory and administration fees. Corporate Investments Portfolio Risks As a leading investment management firm, BlackRock devotes significant resources across all of its operations to identifying, measuring, monitoring, managing and analyzing market and operating risks, including the management and oversight of its own investment portfolio. The Board of Directors of the Company has adopted guidelines for the review of investments to be made by the Company, requiring, among other things, that all investments be reviewed by the Company’s Capital Committee, which consists of senior officers of the Company, and that certain investments may be referred to the Audit Committee or the Board of Directors depending on the circumstances for approval. In the normal course of its business, BlackRock is exposed to equity market price risk, interest rate/credit spread risk and foreign exchange rate risk associated with its corporate investments. BlackRock has investments primarily in sponsored investment products that invest in a variety of asset classes including real estate, private equity and hedge funds. Investments generally are made for co-investment purposes, to establish a performance track record, to hedge exposure to certain deferred compensation plans or for regulatory purposes. Currently, the Company has a seed capital hedging program in which it enters into total return swaps to hedge exposure to certain equity investments. At December 31, 2009, the outstanding total return swaps had an aggregate notional value of approximately $36 million. 99 Table of Contents Item 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK (continued) Corporate Investments Portfolio Risks At December 31, 2009, approximately $463 million of BlackRock’s total investments were maintained in sponsored investment funds that are deemed to be controlled by BlackRock in accordance with GAAP and therefore are consolidated even though BlackRock may not own a majority of such funds. Excluding the impact of investments made to hedge exposure to certain deferred compensation plans and certain equity investments that are hedged via the seed capital hedging program, the Company’s net economic exposure to its investment portfolio is as follows: (Dollar amounts in millions) December 31,2009 December 31,2008 Variance Amount % Total investments, GAAP $ 1,049 $ 1,429 $ (380 ) (27 )% Investments held by consolidated sponsored investment funds (463 ) (728 ) 265 36 % Net exposure to consolidated investment funds 258 310 (52 ) (17 )% Total net “economic” investments 844 1,011 (167 ) (17 )% Deferred compensation investments (71 ) (59 ) (12 ) (20 )% Hedged investments (36 ) (49 ) 13 27 % Total net “economic” investment exposure $ 737 $ 903 $ (166 ) (18 )% The net “economic” investment exposure of the portfolio is presented in either the market price or the interest rate/credit spread risk disclosures below: Market Price Risk At December 31, 2009, the Company’s net exposure to market price risk in its investment portfolio was approximately $455 million of the Company’s net economic investment exposure. Investments that are subject to market price risk include public equity and real estate investments as well as certain hedge funds. The Company estimates that a 10% adverse change in market prices would result in a decrease of approximately $45.5 million in the carrying value of such investments. Interest Rate/Credit Spread Risk At December 31, 2009, the Company was exposed to interest-rate risk and credit spread risks as a result of approximately $282 million of investments in debt securities and sponsored investment products that invest primarily in debt securities. Management considered a hypothetical 100 basis point fluctuation in interest rates or credit spreads and estimates that the impact of such a fluctuation on these investments, in the aggregate, would result in a decrease, or increase, of approximately $5 million in the carrying value of such investments. Foreign Exchange Rate Risk As discussed above, the Company invests in sponsored investment products that invest in a variety of asset classes. The carrying value of the net economic investment exposure denominated in foreign currencies, primarily the Euro, British pound sterling, Korean won and Australian dollars, was $89 million. A 10% adverse change in foreign exchange rates would result in approximately a $9 million decline in the carrying value of such investments. 100 Table of Contents",2023-12-30 18:59:00.443625

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Overview BlackRock, Inc. (“BlackRock” or the “Company”) is the largest publicly traded investment management firm. As of December 31, 2010, the Company managed $3.561 trillion of assets under management (“AUM”) on behalf of institutional and individual investors worldwide. The Company provides a wide array of products including passively and actively managed products including equities, fixed income, multi-asset class, alternative investment and cash management products, and offer clients diversified access to global markets through separate accounts, collective investment trusts, open-end and closed-end mutual funds, exchange-traded funds, hedge funds and funds of funds. In addition, BlackRock Solutions® provides market risk management, financial markets advisory and enterprise investment system services to a broad base of clients. Financial markets advisory services include valuation of illiquid securities, dispositions and workout assignments (including long-term portfolio liquidation assignments), risk management and strategic planning and execution. On September 29, 2006, Merrill Lynch & Co., Inc. (“Merrill Lynch”) contributed the entities and assets that constituted its investment management business, Merrill Lynch Investment Managers (“MLIM”), to BlackRock in exchange for common and non-voting preferred stock such that immediately after such closing Merrill Lynch held approximately 45% of BlackRock’s common stock outstanding and approximately 49.3% of the Company’s capital stock on a fully diluted basis (the “MLIM Transaction”). On October 1, 2007, BlackRock acquired certain assets and assumed certain liabilities of the fund of funds business of Quellos Group, LLC (“Quellos”) for a combination of cash and common stock (the “Quellos Transaction”). On January 1, 2009, Bank of America Corporation (“Bank of America”) acquired Merrill Lynch. In connection with this transaction, BlackRock entered into exchange agreements with each of Merrill Lynch and The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. (“PNC”) pursuant to which each agreed to exchange a portion of BlackRock voting common stock they held for non-voting preferred stock. On December 1, 2009, BlackRock acquired from Barclays Bank PLC (“Barclays”) all of the outstanding equity interests of subsidiaries of Barclays conducting the business of Barclays Global Investors (“BGI”) (the “BGI Transaction”) in exchange for 37.6 million capital shares valued at $8.53 billion, or $227.08 per share, the closing price of BlackRock’s common stock on November 30, 2009 and $6.65 billion in cash, for a total of $15.2 billion. The fair value of the BGI Transaction on June 5, 2009, several days prior to the announcement of the transaction, included the capital shares valued at $6.16 billion, or $163.74 per share, and $6.65 billion in cash, for a total of $12.8 billion. The increase in the fair value of BlackRock’s common stock resulted in $2.4 billion, or 19%, of additional purchase price consideration for accounting purposes as compared to a 16% increase in the S&P 500. On November 15, 2010, Bank of America and PNC sold 58,737,122 shares of BlackRock’s common stock, which included 56,407,040 shares of common stock that converted from non-voting preferred stock. In connection with this transaction, BlackRock entered into an exchange agreement with PNC pursuant to which PNC agreed to exchange 11,105,000 shares of BlackRock non-voting preferred stock they held for common stock. As of December 31, 2010, equity ownership of BlackRock was as follows: VotingCommonStock Capital Stock(1) PNC 25.3 % 20.3 % Barclays 2.3 % 19.6 % Bank of America/Merrill Lynch 0.0 % 7.1 % Other 72.4 % 53.0 % 100.0 % 100.0 % (1) Includes outstanding common and non-voting preferred stock only. 43 Table of Contents Item 7.

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Overview (continued) Financial Highlights (continued) BlackRock reports its financial results in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (“GAAP”); however, management believes that evaluating the Company’s ongoing operating results may be enhanced if investors have additional non-GAAP basis financial measures. Management reviews non-GAAP financial measures to assess ongoing operations and, for the reasons described below, considers them to be effective indicators, for both management and investors, of BlackRock’s financial performance over time. BlackRock’s management does not advocate that investors consider such non-GAAP financial measures in isolation from, or as a substitute for, financial information prepared in accordance with GAAP. Certain prior period non-GAAP data has been reclassified to conform to the current presentation. Computations for all periods are derived from the Company’s consolidated statements of income as follows: (a) Operating income, as adjusted, and operating margin, as adjusted: Operating income, as adjusted, equals operating income, GAAP basis, excluding certain items deemed non-recurring by management or transactions that ultimately will not impact BlackRock’s book value, as indicated in the table below. Operating income used for operating margin measurement equals operating income, as adjusted, excluding the impact of closed-end fund launch costs and commissions. Operating margin, as adjusted, equals operating income used for operating margin measurement, divided by revenue used for operating margin measurement, as indicated in the table below. Year ended December 31, (Dollar amounts in millions) 2010 2009 2008 Operating income, GAAP basis $ 2,998 $ 1,278 $ 1,593 Non-GAAP expense adjustments: BGI transaction/integration costs Employee compensation and benefits 25 60 — General and administration 65 123 — Total BGI transaction/integration costs 90 183 — PNC LTIP funding obligation 58 59 59 Merrill Lynch compensation contribution 10 10 10 Restructuring charges — 22 38 Compensation expense related to appreciation/(depreciation) on deferred compensation plans 11 18 (38 ) Operating income, as adjusted 3,167 1,570 1,662 Closed-end fund launch costs 15 2 9 Closed-end fund launch commissions 2 1 — Operating income used for operating margin measurement $ 3,184 $ 1,573 $ 1,671 Revenue, GAAP basis $ 8,612 $ 4,700 $ 5,064 Non-GAAP adjustments: Distribution and servicing costs (408 ) (477 ) (591 ) Amortization of deferred sales commissions (102 ) (100 ) (130 ) Reimbursable property management compensation — — (21 ) Revenue used for operating margin measurement $ 8,102 $ 4,123 $ 4,322 Operating margin, GAAP basis 34.8 % 27.2 % 31.5 % Operating margin, as adjusted 39.3 % 38.2 % 38.7 % 45 Table of Contents Item 7. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Overview (continued) Financial Highlights (continued) (a) (continued) Management believes that operating income, as adjusted, and operating margin, as adjusted, are effective indicators of BlackRock’s financial performance over time. As such, management believes that operating income, as adjusted, and operating margin, as adjusted, provide useful disclosure to investors. Operating income, as adjusted: BGI transaction and integration costs recorded in 2010 and 2009 consist principally of certain advisory payments, compensation expense, legal fees, marketing and promotional, occupancy and consulting expenses incurred in conjunction with the BGI Transaction. Restructuring charges recorded in 2009 and 2008 consist of compensation costs, occupancy costs and professional fees. The expenses associated with restructuring and BGI transaction and integration costs have been deemed non-recurring by management and have been excluded from operating income, as adjusted, to help enhance the comparability of this information to the current reporting periods. As such, management believes that operating margins exclusive of these costs are useful measures in evaluating BlackRock’s operating performance for the respective periods. The portion of compensation expense associated with certain long-term incentive plans (“LTIP”) that will be funded through the distribution to participants of shares of BlackRock stock held by PNC and a Merrill Lynch cash compensation contribution, a portion of which has been received, have been excluded because these charges ultimately do not impact BlackRock’s book value. Compensation expense associated with appreciation/(depreciation) on investments related to certain BlackRock deferred compensation plans has been excluded as returns on investments set aside for these plans, which substantially offset this expense, are reported in non-operating income (expense). Operating margin, as adjusted: Operating income used for measuring operating margin, as adjusted, is equal to operating income, as adjusted, excluding the impact of closed-end fund launch costs and commissions. Management believes that excluding such costs and commissions is useful because these costs can fluctuate considerably and revenues associated with the expenditure of these costs will not fully impact the Company’s results until future periods. Operating margin, as adjusted, allows the Company to compare performance from period-to-period by adjusting for items that may not recur, recur infrequently or may fluctuate based on market movements, such as restructuring charges, transaction and integration costs, closed-end fund launch costs, commissions paid to certain employees as compensation and fluctuations in compensation expense based on mark-to-market movements in investments held to fund certain compensation plans. The Company also uses operating margin, as adjusted, to monitor corporate performance and efficiency and as a benchmark to compare its performance to other companies. Management uses both the GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures in evaluating the financial performance of BlackRock. The non-GAAP measure by itself may pose limitations because it does not include all of the Company’s revenues and expenses. Revenue used for operating margin, as adjusted, excludes distribution and servicing costs paid to related parties and other third parties. Management believes that excluding such costs is useful to BlackRock because it creates consistency in the treatment for certain contracts for similar services, which due to the terms of the contracts, are accounted for under GAAP on a net basis within investment advisory, administration fees and securities lending revenue. Amortization of deferred sales commissions is excluded from revenue used for operating margin measurement, as adjusted, because such costs, over time, offset distribution fee revenue earned by the Company. Reimbursable property management compensation represented compensation and benefits paid to personnel of Metric Property Management, Inc. (“Metric”), a subsidiary of BlackRock Realty Advisors, Inc. (“Realty”). Prior to the transfer in 2008, these employees were retained on Metric’s payroll when certain properties were acquired by Realty’s clients. The related compensation and benefits were fully reimbursed by Realty’s clients and have been excluded from revenue used for operating margin, as adjusted, because they did not bear an economic cost to BlackRock. For each of these items, BlackRock excludes from revenue used for operating margin, as adjusted, the costs related to each of these items as a proxy for such offsetting revenues. 46 Table of Contents Item 7. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Overview (continued) Financial Highlights (continued) (b) Non-operating income (expense), less net income (loss) attributable to non-controlling interests, as adjusted: Non-operating income (expense), less net income (loss) attributable to non-controlling interests (“NCI”), as adjusted, equals non-operating income (expense), GAAP basis, less net income (loss) attributable to NCI, GAAP basis, adjusted for compensation expense associated with depreciation/(appreciation) on investments related to certain BlackRock deferred compensation plans. The compensation expense offset is recorded in operating income. This compensation expense has been included in non-operating income (expense), less net income (loss) attributable to NCI, as adjusted, to offset returns on investments set aside for these plans, which are reported in non-operating income (expense), GAAP basis.

Management believes that non-operating income (expense), less net income (loss) attributable to NCI, as adjusted, provides for comparability of this information to prior periods and is an effective measure for reviewing BlackRock’s non-operating contribution to its results. As compensation expense associated with (appreciation)/depreciation on investments related to certain deferred compensation plans, which is included in operating income, offsets the gain/(loss) on the investments set aside for these plans, management believes that non-operating income (expense), less net income (loss) attributable to NCI, as adjusted, provides a useful measure, for both management and investors, of BlackRock’s non-operating results that impact book value. 47 Table of Contents Item 7. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Overview (continued) Financial Highlights (continued) (c) Net income attributable to BlackRock, Inc., as adjusted: Management believes that net income attributable to BlackRock, Inc., as adjusted, and diluted earnings per common share, as adjusted, are useful measures of BlackRock’s profitability and financial performance. Net income attributable to BlackRock, Inc., as adjusted, equals net income attributable to BlackRock, Inc., GAAP basis, adjusted for significant non-recurring items as well as charges that ultimately will not impact BlackRock’s book value or benefits that do not impact cash flow.

The portion of the compensation expense associated with certain LTIP awards that will be funded through the distribution to participants of shares of BlackRock stock held by PNC and the Merrill Lynch cash compensation contribution, a portion of which has been received, has been excluded from net income attributable to BlackRock, Inc., as adjusted, because these charges ultimately do not impact BlackRock’s book value. During third quarter 2010 and third quarter 2009, the United Kingdom and New York City, respectively, enacted legislation reducing corporate income tax rates, which resulted in a revaluation of certain net deferred tax liabilities primarily related to acquired intangible assets. The resulting decrease in income taxes has been excluded from net income attributable to BlackRock, Inc., as adjusted, as these were non-recurring enacted tax legislation changes that do not have a cash flow impact and to ensure comparability of this information to the reporting periods. 48 Table of Contents Item 7.

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Overview (continued) BlackRock has portfolio managers located around the world, including the United States, the United Kingdom, the Netherlands, Japan, Hong Kong, Australia and Germany. The Company provides a wide array of products including passively and actively managed equities, fixed income, multi-asset class, cash management and alternatives and offers clients diversified access to global markets through separate accounts, collective trusts, open-end and closed-end mutual funds, exchange-traded funds, hedge funds, and funds of funds to its diverse global clientele. BlackRock provides global advisory services for investment funds and other non-U.S. retail products. The Company’s non-U.S. investment funds are based in a number of domiciles and cover a range of asset classes, including cash management, fixed income, equities and alternatives. In the United States, the primary retail offerings include various open-end and closed-end funds, including iShares®, the global product leader in exchange-traded funds for institutional, retail and high net worth investors. There are over 475 iShares globally across equities, fixed income and commodities, which trade like common stocks on 19 exchanges worldwide. The BlackRock Global Funds, the Company’s primary retail fund group offered outside the United States, are authorized for distribution in more than 35 jurisdictions worldwide. Additional fund offerings include structured products, real estate funds, hedge funds, hedge funds of funds, private equity funds and funds of funds, managed futures funds and exchange funds. These products are sold to both U.S. and non-U.S. high net worth, retail and institutional investors in a wide variety of active and passive strategies covering both equity and fixed income assets. BlackRock’s client base consists of financial institutions and other corporate clients, pension plans, charities, official institutions, such as central banks, sovereign wealth funds, supranational authorities and other government entities, high net worth individuals and retail investors around the world. BlackRock maintains a significant sales and marketing presence both inside and outside the United States that is focused on establishing and maintaining retail and institutional investment management relationships by marketing its services to retail and institutional investors directly and through financial professionals, pension consultants and establishing third-party distribution relationships. BlackRock also distributes its products and services through Merrill Lynch under a global distribution agreement, which following Bank of America’s acquisition of Merrill Lynch, runs until January 2014. After such term, the agreement will renew for one automatic three-year extension if certain conditions are met. BlackRock derives a substantial portion of its revenue from investment advisory and administration fees, which are recognized as the services are performed. Such fees are primarily based on pre-determined percentages of the market value of AUM, percentages of committed capital during investment periods of certain alternative products, or, in the case of certain real estate equity clients, net operating income generated by the underlying properties, and are affected by changes in AUM, including market appreciation or depreciation, foreign exchange translation and net subscriptions or redemptions. Net subscriptions or redemptions represent the sum of new client assets, additional fundings from existing clients (including dividend reinvestment), withdrawals of assets from, and termination of, client accounts, purchases and redemptions of investment fund shares and distributions to investors representing return of capital and return on investments to investors. Market appreciation or depreciation includes current income earned on, and changes in the fair value of, securities held in client accounts. Foreign exchange translation reflects the impact of converting non-U.S. dollar denominated AUM into U.S. dollars for reporting purposes. BlackRock also earns revenue by lending securities on behalf of clients, primarily to brokerage institutions. The securities loaned are secured by collateral in the form of cash or securities, with minimums generally ranging from approximately 102% to 112% of the value of the loaned securities. The revenue earned is shared between BlackRock and the funds or other third-party accounts managed by the Company from which the securities are borrowed. Investment advisory agreements for certain separate accounts and BlackRock’s alternative investment products provide for performance fees, based upon relative and/or absolute investment performance, in addition to base fees based on AUM. Investment advisory performance fees generally are earned after a given period of time and when investment performance exceeds a contractual threshold. As such, the timing of recognition of performance fees may increase the volatility of BlackRock’s revenue and earnings. Historically, the magnitude of performance fees in the fourth quarter generally exceeds the first three calendar quarters in a year due to the higher number of products with performance measurement periods that end on December 31. 50 Table of Contents Item 7. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Overview (continued) BlackRock provides a variety of risk management, investment analytic and investment system and advisory services to financial institutions, pension funds, asset managers, foundations, consultants, mutual fund sponsors, real estate investment trusts and government agencies. These services are provided under the brand name BlackRock Solutions and include a wide array of risk management services, valuation services related to illiquid securities, disposition and workout assignments (including long-term portfolio liquidation assignments), strategic planning and execution, and enterprise investment system outsourcing to clients. Over $10 trillion of positions are processed on our Aladdin® operating platform, which serves as the investment system for BlackRock and other institutional investors. Fees earned for BlackRock Solutions and advisory services are determined using some, or all, of the following methods: (i) fixed fees, (ii) percentages of various attributes of advisory assets under management and (iii) performance fees if contractual thresholds are met. BlackRock also builds upon its leadership position to meet the growing need for investment and risk management solutions. Through its scale and diversity of products, it is able to provide its clients with customized solutions including fiduciary outsourcing for liability-driven investments and overlay strategies for pension plan sponsors, balance sheet management and related services for insurance companies and target date and target return funds, as well as asset allocation portfolios, for retail investors. BlackRock is also able to service these clients via its Aladdin platform to provide risk management and other outsourcing services for institutional investors and custom and tailored solutions to address complex risk exposures. The Company also earns fees for transition management services comprised of referral fees or agency commissions from acting as an introducing broker-dealer in buying and selling securities on behalf of its customers. Commissions related to transition management services are recorded on a trade-date basis as securities transactions occur. Operating expenses reflect employee compensation and benefits, distribution and servicing costs, amortization of deferred sales commissions, direct fund expenses, general and administration expenses and amortization of finite-lived intangible assets. • Employee compensation and benefits expense includes salaries, commissions, temporary help, severance, deferred and incentive compensation, employer payroll taxes and related benefit costs. • Distribution and servicing costs include payments made to Merrill Lynch-affiliated entities under a global distribution agreement, to PNC-affiliated entities and Barclays, as well as other third parties, primarily associated with obtaining and retaining client investments in certain BlackRock products. • Direct fund expenses primarily consist of third party non-advisory expenses incurred by BlackRock related to certain funds for the use of index trademarks, reference data for indices, custodial services, fund administration, fund accounting, transfer agent services, shareholder reporting services, legal expenses, audit and tax services as well as other fund related expenses directly attributable to the non-advisory operations of the fund. These expenses may vary over time with fluctuations in AUM, number of shareholder accounts, or other attributes directly related to volume of business. • General and administration expenses includes marketing and promotional, occupancy and office related costs, portfolio services (including clearing expenses related to transition management services), technology, professional services, communications, closed-end fund launch costs and other general and administration expenses. Non-operating income (expense) includes the effect of changes in the valuations on investments (excluding available-for-sale investments) and earnings on equity method investments, as well as interest and dividend income and interest expense. Other comprehensive income includes changes in valuations related to available-for-sale investments. BlackRock primarily holds investments in sponsored investment products that invest in a variety of asset classes, including private equity, distressed credit/mortgage debt securities, hedge funds and real estate. Investments generally are made for co-investment purposes, to establish a performance track record, to hedge exposure to certain deferred compensation plans, or for regulatory purposes, including Federal Reserve Bank stock. BlackRock does not engage in proprietary trading or other investment activities that could conflict with the interests of its clients. In addition, non-operating income (expense) includes the impact of changes in the valuations of consolidated sponsored investment funds and consolidated collateralized loan obligations. The portion of non-operating income (expense) not attributable to BlackRock is allocated to non-controlling interests on the consolidated statements of income. 51 Table of Contents Item 7. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Assets Under Management AUM for reporting purposes is generally based upon how investment advisory and administration fees are calculated for each portfolio. Net asset values, total assets, committed assets or other measures may be used to determine portfolio AUM.

(2) Advisory AUM represents long-term portfolio liquidation assignments. AUM increased approximately $215 billion, or 6%, to $3.561 trillion at December 31, 2010, compared to $3.346 trillion at December 31, 2009. The growth in AUM was primarily attributable to $267 billion in net market appreciation, $131 billion of net subscriptions in long-term mandates and $17 billion increase due to foreign exchange movements, partially offset by $127 billion of BGI merger-related outflows (due to manager concentration considerations and active equity quantitative performance) and acquisition adjustments, $61 billion of net outflows in cash management products and $12 billion of net client distributions in advisory assignments. Net market appreciation of $267 billion included $191 billion of net appreciation in equity products due to an increase in global equity markets, $55 billion in fixed income products due to current income and changes in interest rate spreads, $14 billion in multi-asset class products, and $7 billion in alternatives, primarily due to appreciation in precious metals, including silver and gold. The $17 billion net increase in AUM from converting non-U.S. dollar denominated AUM into U.S. dollars was primarily due to the weakening of the U.S. dollar against the Japanese yen, Canadian dollar and Australian dollar, partially offset by the strengthening of the U.S. dollar against the euro and pound sterling. 53 Table of Contents Item 7.

(6) Exchange-traded products (“ETPs”) (7) Advisory AUM represents long-term portfolio liquidation assignments. Business Outlook The Company began 2011 with a substantially increased AUM base as compared with 2010 average AUM as a result of strong markets in second half of 2010 and 2010 organic growth in long-term products. BlackRock believes we are in an environment of economic growth and believes that equities in the United States could post double digit returns in 2011 for the third straight year. BlackRock will continue to actively monitor global corporate earnings growth, bank lending policies, changes in the labor markets, inflation expectations, and monetary policies. The Company offers a broad range of equity, fixed income and alternative products which are designed to track various indices and products that target returns in excess of specified benchmarks or absolute returns. BlackRock’s broad set of product offerings and risk skills and tools allow us to work with clients to meet their investment objectives. While investing in fixed income and cash continue to be core to many clients portfolios, we are also seeing trends of re-risking into equities, implementation of barbell strategies comprised of beta, alpha and alternatives, and clients seeking investment solutions which we can help to meet by combining multi-asset class solutions with risk management. 55 Table of Contents Item 7. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Business Outlook (continued) The following items could impact the Company’s results in 2011 and beyond: AUM and Flows • As investors shift their preferences between asset classes and between active and passive investment styles, the Company’s broad product profile should enable it to retain and capture revenue as it has a wide array of offerings in multiple asset types and product styles. As equity markets continue to improve and as clients re-risk into beta and alpha equity products, which have higher yielding fee structures, BlackRock’s revenue and margin could benefit. • BlackRock’s unique combination of index and active capabilities positions it well to assist companies in narrowing the gap on underfunded pension plans by implementing barbell strategies using a combination of index, alpha and alternative products. In addition, as retirement money moves away from defined benefit plans into defined contributions plans and ultimately to individuals, BlackRock is well positioned to offer individual investment options with its LifePath® target date portfolios and wide array of ETFs and other mutual fund products. • Exchange-traded funds are playing an increasingly important role in asset allocation and advisory portfolios for institutional and retail investors. The overall size of the global exchange-traded funds market is expected to continue to grow at a significant rate for several years. BlackRock has a leading market share due to its large array of products and assets under management in this market. As additional asset managers enter the marketplace to offer exchange traded funds they may offer similar products at a lower fee structures. We believe that many factors beyond pricing influence investor preferences. As a first mover in several products, many iShares products have achieved a critical mass, providing both liquidity to investors and minimizing additional costs to investors in the form of bid-ask spreads and lower discounts/premiums on the ETFs traded market prices as compared with the underlying unit net asset values. Investors also value an ETF’s ability to closely track its benchmark and the information, tools and education provided by iShares. • The levels of cash management assets may continue to decline from year-end levels as we expect rates to remain low and if clients continue to re-risk their portfolios. The Company’s diversified global product offerings, client service and independent advice may enable it to retain a portion of these assets. • Outflows related to manager concentration considerations as a result of the BGI Transaction, many of which were low basis point assignments, are expected to be largely behind us by the end of first quarter 2011. Outflows as a result of the historical performance of the legacy BGI active quantitative equity strategies are expected to abate as performance improves under the new leadership of the strategy. Regulatory Reform • The regulatory environment is continuing to evolve for financial institutions as well as money market funds with the intent of the reform supported by BlackRock, to protect the industry and our clients. The specific details of regulatory reform may effect the competitive environment and may provide BlackRock with risks as well as opportunities. For example, BlackRock is continuing to explore the creation of an internal trading platform on its enterprise systems to cross trades within its AUM and potentially among other client transactions, which would result in a reduction of transaction costs and ultimately increased performance returns for our clients. 56 Table of Contents Item 7. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Business Outlook (continued) Performance fees and BRS/advisory fees • A continued return to higher market levels may enable the Company’s alternative investment products with absolute return objectives to contribute additional performance fee revenue. While most of the absolute return AUM eligible for performance fees is above “high water marks”, certain products are still dependent upon achieving high water marks to be performance fee eligible. • The on-going aftermath of the global liquidity crunch and the associated market disruption gave rise to greater demand for our risk tools and advisory services, combining our extensive capital markets and structuring expertise with rigorous modeling and analytical capabilities. In 2011, we expect to continue to see strong demand for our Aladdin operating platform and our comprehensive risk reporting from sophisticated institutional investors and governmental agencies investing in longer term risk management solutions as well as strong demand for financial market advisory services. Future opportunities • The Company plans to continue to focus on increasing the recognition of its global brand to position itself for globalization while reinvesting in the business for future growth opportunities where the cost in the current period will precede the expected future revenue. As BlackRock seeks to grow its alternative product offerings, BlackRock may choose to seed or co-invest in additional products to establish track records and to align with clients’ interests. BlackRock acts as an independent asset manager and does not engage in proprietary trading or deposit taking activities. 57 Table of Contents Item 7. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Operating results for the year ended December 31, 2010, as compared with the year ended December 31, 2009 Operating Income and Operating Margin Overview GAAP Year endedDecember 31, Variance (Dollar amounts in millions) 2010 2009 Amount % Change Revenue $ 8,612 $ 4,700 $ 3,912 83 % Expenses 5,614 3,422 2,192 64 % Operating income $ 2,998 $ 1,278 $ 1,720 135 % Operating margin 34.8 % 27.2 % 7.6 % 28 % Operating income Operating income totaled $3.0 billion for the year ended December 31, 2010, an increase of $1.7 billion compared with operating income for the year ended December 31, 2009. Operating income for the year ended December 31, 2010 included the full year effect of revenue and expenses related to the December 1, 2009 acquisition of BGI and $90 million of BGI integration costs as compared to $183 million of BGI transaction/integration costs for the year ended December 31, 2009. The transaction/integration expenses are not part of BlackRock’s on-going business and are principally comprised of compensation expense, legal fees, advisory payments, occupancy costs, marketing and promotional and consulting expenses. The increase in operating income for the year ended December 31, 2010 is attributable to the $3.9 billion increase in revenue primarily related to an increase in base and performance fees associated with the AUM acquired in the BGI Transaction and growth in long-term AUM, which included market appreciation and net new business, partially offset by a $2.2 billion net increase in operating expenses related to increases in employee compensation and benefits, general and administration expenses and direct fund expenses due to the BGI Transaction. Operating margin The Company’s operating margin was 34.8% for the year ended December 31, 2010, compared with 27.2% for the year ended December 31, 2009. The increase in operating margin for year ended December 31, 2010 included the positive effects of synergies related to the BGI Transaction, growth in long-term AUM driven by market appreciation, a $93 million decrease in BGI transaction/integration costs, a decline of $22 million in restructuring charges and a $17 million change in foreign currency remeasurement costs/benefits, which more than offset decreases to margin related to a $131 million increase in stock-based compensation expense related to additional grants to a larger number of employees at the end of January 2010, $20 million in costs for a U.K. regulatory assessment, a $20 million expense related to a contribution to a donor-advised charitable fund, a $16 million increase in occupancy costs due to the commencement of rent for Drapers Gardens, a $14 million increase of closed-end fund launch costs/commissions and a $13 million increase in amortization of intangible assets related to the finite-lived management contracts acquired in the BGI Transaction, as well as increased investments to grow the business. 58 Table of Contents Item 7.

Operating income Operating income, as adjusted, totaled $3.2 billion for the year ended December 31, 2010, which was an increase of $1.6 billion compared to operating income for the year ended December 31, 2009. The increase in operating income, as adjusted, for the year ended December 31, 2010 is attributable to the $3.9 billion increase in revenue primarily related to an increase in base and performance fees associated with the AUM acquired in the BGI Transaction and growth in long-term AUM, which included market appreciation and net new business, partially offset by a $2.3 billion net increase in operating expenses primarily related to increases in employee compensation and benefits, general and administration expenses and direct fund expenses due to the BGI Transaction. Operating margin Operating margin, as adjusted, was 39.3% and 38.2% for the years ended December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively. The increase in operating margin, as adjusted, for year ended December 31, 2010 included the positive effects of synergies related to the BGI Transaction, growth in long-term AUM driven by market appreciation, which more than offset decreases to margin related to a $132 million increase in stock-based compensation expense related to additional grants to a larger number of employees at the end of January 2010, $20 million in costs for a U.K. regulatory assessment, a $20 million expense related to a contribution to a donor-advised charitable fund, a $16 million increase in occupancy costs due to the commencement of rent for Drapers Gardens and a $13 million increase in amortization of intangible assets related to the finite-lived management contracts acquired in the BGI Transaction, as well as increased investments to grow the business. 59 Table of Contents Item 7.

The $3,912 million increase was the result of a $3,464 million increase in total investment advisory, administration fees and securities lending revenue, a $338 million increase in performance fees, a $111 million increase in other revenue and a $16 million increase in distribution fees, partially offset by a $17 million decrease in BlackRock Solutions and advisory revenue. 60 Table of Contents Item 7. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Operating results for the year ended December 31, 2010, as compared with the year ended December 31, 2009 (continued) Revenue (continued) Investment Advisory, Administration Fees and Securities Lending Revenue Investment advisory, administration fees and securities lending revenues increased $3,464 million to $7,290 million for the year ended December 31, 2010, compared to $3,826 million for the year ended December 31, 2009 primarily related to fees earned on products acquired in the BGI acquisition as well as organic growth in long-term AUM due to market appreciation and net new business, which included securities lending revenue of $325 million for the year ended December 31, 2010, compared to $36 million for the year ended December 31, 2009. The $3,464 million net increase in investment advisory, administration fees and securities lending revenues consisted of $1,524 million in equity iShares / Exchange-traded products, $618 million in active equity products and $368 million in institutional index equity products, $244 million in fixed income iShares / exchange-traded products, $182 million in active fixed income products and $150 million in institutional index fixed income products, $261 million in multi-asset class products and $232 million in alternatives investment products, partially offset by a $115 million decrease in cash management products, due to lower average AUM. Performance Fees Investment advisory performance fees increased $338 million, or 167%, to $540 million for the year ended December 31, 2010, as compared to $202 million for the year ended December 31, 2009, primarily due to an increase in performance fees earned upon exceeding absolute investment or relative investment return thresholds on alternative multi-strategy, fixed income and equity hedge funds and separate accounts across regional/country equity strategies, fixed income and multi-asset class products. BlackRock Solutions and Advisory BlackRock Solutions and advisory revenue for the year ended December 31, 2010 decreased $17 million, or 4%, compared with the year ended December 31, 2009. The decrease in BlackRock Solutions and advisory revenue was primarily due to a decline in non-recurring advisory assignments, as well as the effect of a decline in advisory AUM due to distributions in portfolio liquidation assignments, which have AUM based fees, partially offset by additional Aladdin, risk management solutions and investment accounting mandates. Revenue earned on advisory assignments was comprised of advisory and portfolio structuring assignment fees and ongoing fees based on AUM of the respective portfolio assignments. Distribution Fees Distribution fees of $116 million for the year ended December 31, 2010 increased $16 million, as compared to $100 million for the year ended December 31, 2009. The increase primarily is the result of higher AUM in certain share classes of BlackRock Funds. 61 Table of Contents Item 7.

Other revenue of $206 million for the year ended December 31, 2010 increased $111 million, or 117%, compared with $95 million for the year ended December 31, 2009. The increase in other revenue was primarily the result of a $52 million increase in fees, which excludes related portfolio service costs, earned for transition management services due to an increase in transactions to execute transitions of equity and fixed income mandates, a $25 million increase in marketing fees earned from Barclays for services to distribute Barclays iPath products, $12 million increase for custody fees earned on LifePath products (a portion of which is paid to a third party sub-custodian and reflected within direct fund expenses), a $7 million increase in BlackRock’s share of underlying earnings from certain operating advisory company investments and a $7 million increase in commissions revenue as a result of unit trust and open-end mutual fund class A sales commissions. 62 Table of Contents Item 7.

Excluding certain items deemed non-recurring by management or transactions that ultimately will not affect the Company’s book value, total expenses, as adjusted, increased $2,315 million, or 74%. The increase in total expenses, as adjusted, is primarily attributable to the BGI Transaction including increases in employee compensation and benefits, general and administration expenses and direct fund expenses, partially offset by a reduction of distribution and servicing costs. 63 Table of Contents Item 7. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Operating results for the year ended December 31, 2010, as compared with the year ended December 31, 2009 (continued) Expenses (continued) Employee Compensation and Benefits Year endedDecember 31, Variance (Dollar amounts in millions) 2010 2009 Amount % Change Employee compensation and benefits, GAAP $ 3,097 $ 1,802 $ 1,295 72 % Less non-GAAP expense adjustments: BGI transaction/integration costs 25 60 (35 ) (58 %) PNC LTIP funding obligation 58 59 (1 ) (2 %) Merrill Lynch compensation contribution 10 10 — — % Compensation expense related to appreciation/ (depreciation) on deferred compensation plans 11 18 (7 ) (39 %) Total non-GAAP expense adjustments 104 147 (43 ) (29 %) Employee compensation and benefits, as adjusted $ 2,993 $ 1,655 $ 1,338 81 % Employee compensation and benefits expense increased $1,295 million, or 72%, to $3,097 million, for the year ended December 31, 2010, compared to $1,802 million for the year ended December 31, 2009. Employee compensation and benefits, as adjusted, increased by $1,338 million after excluding the decrease of $43 million of non-GAAP adjustments primarily related to a decrease in BGI integration costs. The $1,338 million increase in employee compensation and benefits expense for the year ended December 31, 2010 was attributable to a $721 million increase in incentive compensation and a $617 million increase in salaries, benefits, payroll taxes, temporary help and commissions. The increase in incentive compensation is primarily associated with the increase in operating income after excluding the BGI integration costs, a $132 million increase in stock-based compensation expense related to the effect of additional grants to a larger number of employees at the end of January 2010, offset by an $8 million decrease in other deferred compensation. The $617 million increase in salaries, benefits and payroll taxes reflects an increase in the number of employees primarily resulting from the BGI Transaction as well as growth in number of employees subsequent to the BGI Transaction. Employees at December 31, 2010 totaled approximately 9,100 as compared to approximately 8,600 at December 31, 2009. Distribution and Servicing Costs Distribution and servicing costs decreased $69 million to $408 million for the year ended December 31, 2010, compared to $477 million for the year ended December 31, 2009. These costs include payments to Bank of America/Merrill Lynch under a global distribution agreement, PNC and Barclays, as well as other third parties, primarily associated with the distribution and servicing of client investments in certain BlackRock products. The $69 million decrease primarily related to lower levels of distribution payments due to lower levels of average cash management AUM and a decrease of costs due to an increase in advisory fee waivers for certain cash management funds serviced by Merrill Lynch. Distribution and servicing costs for the year ended December 31, 2010 included $246 million of costs attributable to Bank of America/Merrill Lynch and affiliates, and $10 million of costs attributable to PNC and affiliates as compared to $349 million and $19 million, respectively, in the year ended December 31, 2009. Distribution and servicing costs related to other third parties, including Barclays, increased $43 million to $152 million for the year ended December 31, 2010, as compared to $109 million for the year ended December 31, 2009 due to an expansion of distribution platforms and higher long-term AUM. Amortization of Deferred Sales Commissions Amortization of deferred sales commissions increased $2 million to $102 million for the year ended December 31, 2010, as compared to $100 million for the year ended December 31, 2009. The increase in amortization of deferred sales commissions was primarily the result of higher sales and redemptions in certain share classes of U.S. open-end mutual funds. 64 Table of Contents Item 7.

BGI Transaction and Integration Costs BGI integration costs of $65 million for the year ended December 31, 2010 decreased $58 million as compared with $123 million for the year ended December 31, 2009 primarily due to advisory and legal costs incurred for the year ended December 31, 2009, partially offset by higher re-branding costs in 2010. General and Administration Expenses, as Adjusted Excluding the BGI transaction and integration expenses, general and administration expenses, as adjusted, of $1,289 million, increased $633 million, or 96%, for the year ended December 31, 2010 compared with $656 million for the year ended December 31, 2009. • Marketing and promotional expenses increased $221 million, primarily due to an increase in global and exchange-traded fund marketing expenses, which included travel, promotional and rebranding and advertising expenses. • Occupancy and office related expenses increased $124 million primarily related to the expansion of the Company due to the BGI Transaction, including expenses related to Drapers Gardens and an increase in lease impairments as a result of vacating certain locations in the year ended December 31, 2010. • Portfolio service costs increased $77 million, or 77%, to $177 million, due to an increase in market data and research expenses as well as transition management execution and clearing expenses. • Technology expenses increased $43 million, or 40%, to $150 million, primarily due to an increase in software licensing and maintenance and hardware depreciation expenses. • Professional services increased $32 million, or 45%, to $103 million compared with $71 million for the year ended December 31, 2009 primarily related to consulting, accounting/tax and legal costs. • Communications increased $23 million, primarily related to the expansion of the Company due to the BGI Transaction. • Regulatory, filing and license fees increased $29 million, primarily due to a $20 million U.K. regulatory assessment. • Charitable contribution increased $20 million, which is related to a contribution to a donor advised charitable fund. • Closed-end fund launch costs (excluding compensation costs) increased $13 million as compared to the year ended December 31, 2009 due to the Build America Bond Trust fund, which launched during the year ended December 31, 2010 and generated approximately $1.2 billion in AUM. • Other general and administration expenses increased $51 million, or 57%, to $141 million compared with $90 million for the year ended December 31, 2009, due to an increase of $86 million related to growth of the Company including recruiting, training and insurance costs, as well as costs for potential operating errors/fines, partially offset by a $17 million change in foreign currency remeasurement costs/benefits from $11 million of costs in the year ended December 31, 2009 to a $6 million benefit in the year ended December 31, 2010, a $9 million decline in an expense for a potentially uncollectible receivable recorded in 2009 and $9 million of lower provisions related to an outstanding loan to Anthracite Capital Inc. 66 Table of Contents Item 7.

The $36 million non-operating income, net of non-controlling interests for the year ended December 31, 2010 was comprised of $146 million of net gains on co-investments and seed investments and $11 million of appreciation related to hedges of deferred compensation, partially offset by $121 million of net interest expense. The $146 million net gain on investments, less non-controlling interests, related to the Company’s co-investments and seed investments, included net gains in distressed credit/mortgage funds of $66 million, private equity investments of $31 million, real estate equity/debt products of $17 million, hedge funds/funds of hedge funds of $18 million and other investments of $14 million. Net gain on co-investments and seed investments increased $144 million from the year ended December 31, 2009 primarily due to an increase in real estate valuations as compared with 2009, which included significant valuation declines in real estate equity and debt co-investments. Net interest expense was $121 million, an increase of $73 million primarily due to an increase in interest expense related to the December 2009 issuances of $2.5 billion of long-term notes, partially offset by higher dividend income related to an investment required for regulatory purposes.

Operating income for the year ended December 31, 2009 included $141 million resulting from incremental revenue and expenses related to the operations of BGI and $183 million of BGI transaction and integration costs. The transaction and integration expenses are not part of the on-going business and are principally comprised of advisory fees, compensation expense, legal fees and consulting expenses. Operating income for the year ended December 31, 2009 included the effect of a $431 million decrease in investment advisory, administration fees and securities lending revenue, associated with a market driven reduction in average AUM for all asset classes for the year ended December 31, 2009 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2008, and a $42 million reduction in distribution fees and other revenue, offset by an $84 million increase in BlackRock Solutions and advisory revenue, a $25 million increase in performance fees revenue and a $49 million net decrease in operating expenses primarily due to declines in employee compensation and benefits, distribution and servicing costs, amortization of deferred sales commissions and restructuring expenses, offset by increases in direct fund expenses and general and administration expenses. Operating Margin The Company’s operating margin was 27.2% for the year ended December 31, 2009, compared to 31.5% for the year ended December 31, 2008. The reduction in operating margin in 2009 as compared to 2008 included the effect of $183 million of BGI transaction and integration costs and a change from $50 million of foreign currency remeasurement benefits in 2008 to $11 million of foreign currency remeasurement costs in 2009. 74 Table of Contents Item 7.

Operating income, as adjusted, totaled $1,570 million for the year ended December 31, 2009, which was a decrease of $92 million compared to the year ended December 31, 2008. The decline of operating income, as adjusted, for the year ended December 31, 2009 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2008 is related to the effect of the $364 million decrease in total revenue offset by a $272 million decrease in operating expenses due to decreases in employee compensation and benefits, distribution and servicing costs and general and administration expenses. Operating margin, as adjusted, was 38.2% and 38.7% for the years ended December 31, 2009 and 2008, respectively. The reduction in margin includes the effect of the $61 million increase in expenses related to the change in foreign currency remeasurement offset by a reduction of certain expenses as a result of additional cost controls in 2009. 75 Table of Contents Item 7.

Total revenue for the year ended December 31, 2009 includes $312 million of incremental revenue related to the BGI acquisition. The $364 million decrease was the result of a $431 million decrease in total investment advisory, administration fees and securities lending revenue, a $39 million decrease in distribution fees and a $3 million decrease in other revenue, offset by an $84 million increase in BlackRock Solutions and advisory revenue and a $25 million increase in performance fees. 76 Table of Contents Item 7. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Operating results for the year ended December 31, 2009, as compared with the year ended December 31, 2008 (continued) Revenue (continued) Investment Advisory, Administration Fees and Securities Lending Revenue Investment advisory, administration fees and securities lending revenue for the year ended December 31, 2009 included approximately $278 million of fees related to the BGI acquisition. The decrease in investment advisory, administration fees and securities lending revenues of $431 million for the year ended December 31, 2009, compared with the year ended December 31, 2008 consisted of decreases of $357 million in active equity products, $40 million in multi-asset class products, $141 million in alternative investment products, $7 million in active fixed income products and $83 million in cash management products primarily associated with a market driven reduction in average AUM for equity, multi-asset class and alternative products and net redemptions in cash management products. The decrease was offset by a $136 million increase in equity iShares / Exchange-traded products, a $28 million increase in institutional index equity products, a $19 million increase in fixed income iShares / Exchange-traded products and a $14 million increase in institutional index fixed income products, primarily related to products acquired in the BGI acquisition. Performance Fees Investment advisory performance fees increased $25 million, or 14%, to $202 million for the year ended December 31, 2009, as compared to $177 million for the year ended December 31, 2008, primarily due to an increase in performance fees in alternative equity hedge funds, fixed income and multi-asset class separate accounts, offset by a decrease in international equity separate accounts. The year ended December 31, 2009 included $24 million of performance fees related to products acquired in the BGI acquisition. BlackRock Solutions and Advisory BlackRock Solutions and advisory revenue for the year ended December 31, 2009 increased $84 million, or 21%, compared with the year ended December 31, 2008. The increase in BlackRock Solutions and advisory revenue was primarily the result of additional advisory assignments during the period, as well as additional Aladdin and risk management mandates. Revenue earned on advisory assignments was comprised of advisory and portfolio structuring assignment fees and ongoing fees based on AUM of the respective portfolio assignments. Distribution Fees Distribution fees decreased $39 million to $100 million for the year ended December 31, 2009, as compared to $139 million for the year ended December 31, 2008. The decrease in distribution fees was primarily the result of lower sales, redemptions and AUM in certain share classes of open-end mutual funds. 77 Table of Contents Item 7.

Other revenue for the year ended December 31, 2009 included $10 million of incremental revenue related to the operations of BGI. The decrease in other revenue was primarily the result of a $31 million decline in property management fees primarily related to the outsourcing in the fourth quarter of 2008 of Metric contracts with BlackRock real estate clients, partially offset by a $14 million increase in BlackRock’s share of underlying earnings from certain operating advisory company investments and a $9 million increase in fees earned for transition management services. 78 Table of Contents Item 7.

Excluding certain items deemed non-recurring by management or transactions that ultimately will not affect the Company’s book value, total expenses, as adjusted, decreased $272 million, or 8%. The decrease in total expenses, as adjusted, is primarily attributable to decreases in employee compensation and benefits, distribution and servicing costs and amortization of deferred sales commissions. 79 Table of Contents Item 7.

Employee compensation and benefits expense decreased $13 million, or 1%, to $1,802 million, for the year ended December 31, 2009, compared to $1,815 million for the year ended December 31, 2008. Employee compensation and benefits expense for the year ended December 31, 2009 included $89 million of incremental expense related to an increase in the number of employees related to BGI. The decrease in employee compensation and benefits expense was attributable to a $118 million decrease in salaries, benefits and commissions, a $12 million decrease in incentive compensation associated with lower operating income, partially offset by a $60 million increase related to the BGI integration costs and a $57 million increase in deferred compensation, which is offset primarily by an increase in non-operating income related to appreciation on assets associated with certain deferred compensation plans. The $118 million decrease in salaries, benefits and commissions is due to lower employment levels as a result of the Company’s cost control efforts and outsourcing of Metric services, partially offset by a one month impact of the increase in employees related to the BGI Transaction. Employees at December 31, 2009 totaled approximately 8,600 as compared to approximately 5,300 at December 31, 2008. Distribution and Servicing Costs Distribution and servicing costs decreased $114 million to $477 million for the year ended December 31, 2009, compared to $591 million for the year ended December 31, 2008. These costs include payments to Bank of America/Merrill Lynch under a global distribution agreement, and payments to PNC as well as other third parties, primarily associated with the distribution and servicing of client investments in certain BlackRock products. The $114 million decrease primarily related to lower levels of average AUM serviced by related parties across all asset classes and an increase in waivers within certain cash management funds, resulting in lower distribution payments. Distribution and servicing costs for the year ended December 31, 2009 included $349 million of costs attributable to Bank of America/Merrill Lynch and affiliates and $19 million of costs attributable to PNC and affiliates as compared to $464 million and $30 million, respectively, in the year ended December 31, 2008. Distribution and servicing costs related to other third parties increased $12 million to $109 million for the year ended December 31, 2009, as compared to $97 million for the year ended December 31, 2008 due to an expansion of distribution platforms. Amortization of Deferred Sales Commissions Amortization of deferred sales commissions decreased $30 million to $100 million for the year ended December 31, 2009, as compared to $130 million for the year ended December 31, 2008. The decrease in amortization of deferred sales commissions was primarily the result of lower sales and redemptions in certain share classes of U.S. open-end mutual funds. 80 Table of Contents Item 7.

Management reviews its as adjusted balance sheet, a non-GAAP financial measure, for the reasons described below. BlackRock’s management does not advocate that investors consider such non-GAAP financial measure in isolation from, or as a substitute for, financial information prepared in accordance with GAAP. The Company presents the as adjusted balance sheet to enable investors to eliminate gross presentation of certain assets that have equal and offsetting liabilities and ultimately do not have an impact on stockholders’ equity (excluding appropriated retained earnings related to consolidated CLOs) or cash flows. The recognition of the as adjusted assets and liabilities generally result in net income (loss) attributable to BlackRock, Inc. 87 Table of Contents Item 7. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Balance Sheet Overview (continued) The following table presents selected significant components of BlackRock’s GAAP consolidated statements of financial condition at December 31, 2010 and 2009: (Dollar amounts in millions) December 31,2010 December 31,2009 Variance Amount % Change Cash and cash equivalents $ 3,367 $ 4,708 ($ 1,341 ) (28 %) Accounts receivable 2,095 1,718 377 22 % Investments 1,540 1,049 491 47 % Goodwill and Intangible assets, net 30,317 30,346 (29 ) — % Other assets(1) 960 1,339 (379 ) (28 %) Accrued compensation and benefits 1,520 1,482 38 3 % Accounts payable and accrued liabilities 1,068 840 228 27 % Borrowings(2) 3,359 5,668 (2,309 ) (41 %) Deferred income tax liabilities 5,477 5,571 (94 ) (2 %) Other liabilities(3) 641 997 (356 ) (36 %) Stockholders’ equity 26,094 24,329 1,765 7 % (1) Includes due from related parties, deferred sales commissions, property and equipment and other assets. (2) Includes short-term borrowings, convertible debentures and long-term borrowings. (3) Includes due to related parties and other liabilities. The following discussion summarizes the significant changes in assets and liabilities. These changes do not include assets and liabilities that are equal and offsetting and have no impact on BlackRock’s stockholders’ equity. 88 Table of Contents Item 7. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Balance Sheet Overview (continued) Cash and Cash Equivalents Cash and cash equivalents at December 31, 2010 and 2009 included $65 million and $75 million of cash held by consolidated sponsored investment funds, respectively. See Liquidity and Capital Resources for further details on the change in cash and cash equivalents during 2010. Accounts Receivable Accounts receivable at December 31, 2010 increased $377 million from December 31, 2009, resulting from increase in base fees related to AUM growth and higher performance fees. Investments The Company presents total net “economic” investments to enable investors to understand the portion of its investments that are owned by the Company, net of non-controlling interests, as a gauge to measure the impact of changes in net non-operating gain (loss) on investments to net income (loss) attributable to BlackRock, Inc.

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Balance Sheet Overview (continued) Investments (continued) The Company further presents the total net “economic” investment exposure, net of deferred compensation investments and hedged investments, to reflect another gauge for investors as the economic impact of investments held pursuant to deferred compensation arrangements is substantially offset by a change in compensation expense and the impact of hedged investments is substantially mitigated by total return swap hedges. Carried interest is excluded as generally there is no impact to BlackRock’s stockholders equity as the balance fluctuates. Finally, the Company’s regulatory investment in Federal Reserve Bank stock which is not subject to market or interest rate risk is excluded from the Company’s net economic investment exposure. The following table represents the carrying value of investments, by asset type, at December 31, 2010 and 2009: Year ended December 31, Variance (Dollar amounts in millions) 2010 2009 Amount % Change Private equity $ 277 $ 232 $ 45 19 % Real estate 54 44 10 23 % Distressed credit/mortgage funds 267 197 70 36 % Hedge funds/funds of hedge funds 97 108 (11 ) (10 %) Other investments(1) 269 142 127 89 % Total net “economic” investment exposure 964 723 241 33 % Federal Reserve Bank stock 325 10 315 * Carried interest 13 4 9 225 % Deferred compensation investments 76 71 5 7 % Hedged investments 25 36 (11 ) (31 %) Total net “economic” investments $ 1,403 $ 844 $ 559 66 % * – Not applicable or the percentage is in excess of +/- 1,000%. (1) Other investments primarily include seed investments in fixed income and equity funds/strategies as well as U.K. government securities held for regulatory purposes. Total net “economic” investments at December 31, 2010 increased $559 million from December 31, 2009, resulting from changes in the investment portfolio due to purchases (including $315 million of Federal Reserve Bank stock), sales, maturities and distributions as well as market valuations and earnings from equity method investments. BlackRock reports its investments on a GAAP basis, which includes investments that are owned by sponsored investment funds that are deemed to be controlled by BlackRock in accordance with GAAP and therefore consolidated even though BlackRock may not own the majority of any such funds. As a result, management reviews its investments on an “economic” basis, which eliminates the portion of investments that do not impact BlackRock’s book value. BlackRock’s management does not advocate that investors consider such non-GAAP financial measures in isolation from, or as a substitute for, financial information prepared in accordance with GAAP. 90 Table of Contents Item 7. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Balance Sheet Overview (continued) The following table represents investments measured at fair value on a recurring basis at December 31, 2010: (Dollar amounts in millions) QuotedPrices inActiveMarkets forIdenticalAssets(Level 1) SignificantOtherObservableInputs(Level 2) SignificantUnobservableInputs(Level 3) OtherInvestments NotHeld at FairValue(1) Investments atDecember 31,2010 Total investments, GAAP $ 249 $ 133 $ 650 $ 508 $ 1,540 Net assets for which the Company does not bear “economic” exposure(2) (8 ) (7 ) (122 ) — (137 ) Net “economic” investments(3) $ 241 $ 126 $ 528 $ 508 $ 1,403 (1) Comprised of investments held at cost, amortized cost, carried interest and equity method investments, which include investment companies, and other assets which in accordance with GAAP are not accounted for under a fair value measure. In accordance with GAAP, certain equity method investees do not account for both their financial assets and financial liabilities under fair value measures, therefore, the Company’s investment in such equity method investees may not represent fair value. (2) Consists of net assets attributable to non-controlling investors of consolidated non-VIE sponsored investment funds. (3) Includes BlackRock’s portion of cash and cash equivalents, other assets, accounts payable and accrued liabilities, and other liabilities that are consolidated from non-VIE sponsored investment funds. Goodwill and Intangible Assets Goodwill and intangible assets at December 31, 2010 decreased $29 million from December 31, 2009, resulting from $160 million amortization expense related to finite-lived intangibles and a decline in goodwill related to tax benefits realized from tax-deductible goodwill in excess of book goodwill from the Quellos Transaction, partially offset by $136 million related to the release of common shares held in escrow in connection with the Quellos Transaction, and increases in intangibles and goodwill from the purchases of Primasia Investment Trust Co., LTD. and Helix Financial Group LLC. Other Assets Other assets at December 31, 2010 decreased $379 million from December 31, 2009, resulting from decreases in current taxes receivable, sales of held for sale assets, deferred sales commissions due to redemptions in certain share classes of U.S. open-end mutual funds and receivables from related parties. Accrued Compensation and Benefits Accrued compensation and benefits at December 31, 2010 increased $38 million from December 31, 2009, primarily related to an increase in 2010 incentive compensation offset by the effect of cash payments related to 2009 year end incentive compensation and other compensation accruals assumed in the BGI Transaction. Accounts Payable and Accrued Liabilities Accounts payable and accrued liabilities at December 31, 2010 increased $228 million from December 31, 2009, resulting from increases in unit trust payable, retrocessions, current taxes payable and other accruals payable to Merrill Lynch. Borrowings Borrowings at December 31, 2010 decreased $2,309 million from December 31, 2009, resulting from repayments of short-term borrowings and convertible debt of $2,134 million and $176 million, respectively. 91 Table of Contents Item 7. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Balance Sheet Overview (continued) Deferred Income Tax Liabilities Deferred tax liabilities at December 31, 2010 decreased $94 million from December 31, 2009, primarily related to intangible assets. The decrease included revaluation of certain deferred income tax liabilities due to the 2010 tax legislation enacted in the United Kingdom. Other Liabilities Other liabilities at December 31, 2010 decreased $356 million from December 31, 2009, primarily resulting from a decrease related to repayments to Barclays of approximately $320 million to settle certain non-interest bearing notes assumed in the BGI Transaction and settlement of liabilities related to the sales of held for sale assets, partially offset by increases in various other liabilities. Stockholders’ Equity Total stockholders’ equity at December 31, 2010 increased $1,765 from December 31, 2009, principally resulting from $2,063 million of net income attributable to BlackRock, $445 million of stock-based compensation expense, $136 million related to the release of common shares held in escrow in connection with the Quellos Transaction, $44 million excess tax benefits from vested stock-based compensation and a $10 million Merrill Lynch cash capital contribution in 2010, partially offset by $776 million of payments for cash dividends, $109 million of net issuances of common shares related to employee stock transactions and $140 million of stock repurchases under the repurchase plan approved in July 2010. Liquidity and Capital Resources BlackRock Cash Flows Excluding the Impact of Consolidated Sponsored Investment Funds and VIEs In accordance with GAAP, certain BlackRock sponsored investment funds and collateralized loan obligations (“CLOs”) are consolidated into the financial statements of BlackRock, notwithstanding the fact that BlackRock may only have a minority interest, if any, in these funds or CLOs. As a result, BlackRock’s consolidated statements of cash flows include the cash flows of consolidated sponsored investment funds and CLOs. The Company uses an adjusted cash flow statement, which excludes the impact of consolidated sponsored investment funds and CLOs, as a supplemental non-GAAP measure to assess liquidity and capital requirements. The Company believes that its cash flows, excluding the impact of the consolidated sponsored investment funds and CLOs, provide investors with useful information on the cash flows of BlackRock relating to its ability to fund additional operating, investing and financing activities. BlackRock’s management does not advocate that investors consider such non-GAAP measures in isolation from, or as a substitute for its cash flow presented in accordance with GAAP. 92 Table of Contents Item 7. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Liquidity and Capital Resources (continued) BlackRock Cash Flows Excluding the Impact of Consolidated Sponsored Investment Funds and VIEs (continued) The following table presents a reconciliation of the Company’s consolidated statements of cash flows presented on a GAAP basis to the Company’s consolidated statements of cash flows, excluding the impact of the cash flows of consolidated sponsored investment funds and consolidated VIEs: Year ended Year ended December 31, December 31, 2010 2009 Variance (Dollar amounts in millions) GAAPBasis Impact onCash FlowsofConsolidatedSponsoredInvestmentFunds Impact onCash FlowsofConsolidatedVIEs Cash FlowsExcludingImpact ofConsolidatedSponsoredInvestmentFunds and VIEs Cash FlowsExcludingImpact ofConsolidatedSponsoredInvestmentFunds and VIEs Amount % Cash flows from: Operating $ 2,488 ($ 76 ) ($ 1 ) $ 2,565 $ 1,231 $ 1,334 108 % Investing (627 ) (52 ) — (575 ) (5,550 ) 4,975 * Financing (3,170 ) 118 (8 ) (3,280 ) 6,934 (10,214 ) * Effect of exchange rate changes (32 ) — — (32 ) 47 (79 ) * Net change in cash and cash equivalents (1,341 ) (10 ) (9 ) (1,322 ) 2,662 (3,984 ) * Cash and cash equivalents, beginning of year 4,708 75 9 4,624 1,971 2,653 135 % Cash and cash equivalents, end of year $ 3,367 $ 65 $ — $ 3,302 $ 4,633 ($ 1,331 ) (29 %) * – Not applicable or the percentage is in excess of +/- 1,000%. Cash and cash equivalents, excluding cash held by consolidated sponsored investment funds and VIEs at December 31, 2010 decreased $1,322 million from December 31, 2009, resulting from $2,565 million of cash inflows from operating activities, $3,280 million of cash outflows from financing activities, $575 million of cash outflows from investing activities and a $32 million decrease due to the effect of foreign exchange rate changes on cash and cash equivalents. 93 Table of Contents Item 7. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Liquidity and Capital Resources (continued) BlackRock Cash Flows Excluding the Impact of Consolidated Sponsored Investment Funds and VIEs (continued) Operating Activities Sources of BlackRock’s operating cash primarily include investment advisory, administration fees and securities lending revenue, performance fees, revenues from BlackRock Solutions and advisory products and services, other revenue and distribution fees. BlackRock uses its cash to pay compensation and benefits, distribution and servicing costs, direct fund expenses, general and administration expenses, interest and principal on the Company’s borrowings, income taxes, dividends on BlackRock’s capital stock, capital expenditures and to purchase co-investments and seed investments. Net cash inflows from operating activities, excluding the impact of consolidated sponsored investment funds and VIEs, for the year ended December 31, 2010 primarily include the receipt of investment advisory and administration fees, securities lending revenue and other revenue offset by the payment of operating expenses incurred in the normal course of business. Net cash inflows for the year ended December 31, 2010 included the effect of cash payments related to 2009 incentive compensation, including the payments for BGI employee compensation accruals assumed in the BGI Transaction and repayments to Barclays of approximately $320 million to settle certain non-interest bearing notes assumed in the BGI Transaction. Investing Activities Cash outflows from investing activities, excluding the impact of consolidated sponsored investment funds and VIEs, for the year ended December 31, 2010 were $575 million and primarily included $656 million of purchases of investments, including $315 million of Federal Reserve Bank stock, $131 million of purchases of property and equipment, and $23 million of acquisition related payments, partially offset by $181 million of net proceeds from sales and maturities of investments and $53 million of return of capital from equity method investees. Financing Activities Cash outflows from financing activities, excluding the impact of consolidated sponsored investment funds and VIEs, for the year ended December 31, 2010 were $3,280 million primarily included repayments of short-term borrowings and convertible debt of $2,134 million and $176 million, respectively, $776 million of payments for cash dividends and $264 million related to repurchases of common stock, including $140 million of stock repurchases under the repurchase plan approved in July 2010 and $124 million to satisfy tax withholding obligations of employees related to vesting of certain restricted stock awards. Cash outflows from financing activities were partially offset by cash inflows related to $44 million of excess tax benefits from vested stock-based compensation and a $10 million Merrill Lynch cash capital contribution. 94 Table of Contents Item 7. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Liquidity and Capital Resources (continued) Capital Resources The Company manages its financial condition and funding to maintain appropriate liquidity for the business. Capital resources at December 31, 2010 and 2009 were as follows: December 31, Variance (Dollar amounts in millions) 2010 2009 Amount % Change Cash and cash equivalents $ 3,367 $ 4,708 ($ 1,341 ) (28 %) Cash and cash equivalents held by consolidated sponsored investment funds(1) (65 ) (75 ) 10 13 % Subtotal 3,302 4,633 (1,331 ) (29 %) 2007 credit facility – undrawn(2) 2,266 2,171 95 4 % Commercial paper(3) — (2,034 ) 2,034 100 % Total liquidity $ 5,568 $ 4,770 $ 798 17 % Required regulatory capital(4) $ 897 $ 857 $ 40 5 % (1) The Company may not be able to access such cash to use in its operating activities. (2) Excludes $134 million and $129 million of undrawn amounts at December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively related to Lehman Commercial Paper, Inc. (3) The outstanding commercial paper notes that are supported by the 2007 credit facility reduce the availability of the facility. (4) A portion of the required regulatory capital is partially met with cash and cash equivalents. The $798 million increase in total liquidity during the year ended December 31, 2010 included the effects on liquidity of the following: positive operating cash flows which were partially offset by (i) cash payments of 2009 year end incentive awards, including the payments for BGI employee compensation accrual assumed in the BGI Transaction, (ii) the purchase of $315 million of Federal Reserve Bank stock, (iii) the settlement of approximately $320 million of certain non-interest bearing notes assumed in the BGI Transaction and (iv) $176 million of repayments related to convertible debt. A significant portion of the Company’s $1,403 million of net economic investments are illiquid in nature and, as such, may not be readily convertible to cash. Short-term Borrowings: The following describes the Company’s short-term borrowing arrangements, which the Company has access to utilize. 2007 Credit Facility In August 2007, the Company entered into a five-year, $2.5 billion unsecured revolving credit facility (the “2007 facility”) to provide back-up liquidity, fund ongoing working capital for general corporate purposes and to fund investment opportunities. The 2007 facility requires the Company not to exceed a maximum leverage ratio (ratio of net debt to earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, where net debt equals total debt less domestic unrestricted cash) of 3 to 1, which was satisfied with a ratio of less than 1 to 1 at December 31, 2010. At December 31, 2010, the Company had $100 million outstanding under the 2007 facility with an interest rate of 0.47% and a maturity date of February 28, 2011. The Company had a daily average of $100 million outstanding during the fourth quarter 2010 and a daily average of $115 million outstanding for the full year 2010. Lehman Commercial Paper, Inc. has a $140 million participation under the 2007 facility; however, BlackRock does not expect that Lehman Commercial Paper, Inc. will honor its commitment to fund additional amounts. Bank of America, a related party prior to November 2010, has a $140 million participation under the 2007 facility. 95 Table of Contents Item 7. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Liquidity and Capital Resources (continued) Short-term Borrowings (continued) Commercial Paper Program On October 14, 2009, BlackRock established a commercial paper program (the “CP Program”) under which the Company may issue unsecured commercial paper notes (the “CP Notes”) on a private placement basis up to a maximum aggregate amount outstanding at any time of $3 billion. The initial proceeds of the commercial paper issuances were used to finance a portion of the BGI Transaction. Subsidiaries of Bank of America and Barclays, as well as other third parties, act as dealers under the CP Program. At December 31, 2010 the CP Program was supported by the 2007 facility. The Company began to issue CP Notes under the CP Program on November 4, 2009. As of December 31, 2010, BlackRock did not have any outstanding CP Notes. The Company did not have any CP Notes outstanding subsequent to September 2010 and had a daily average of $404 million CP Notes outstanding for the full year 2010. Japan Commitment-line In September 2010, BlackRock Japan Co., Ltd., a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company, renewed its five billion Japanese yen commitment-line agreement (the “Japan Commitment-line”) for a term of one year. The Japan Commitment-line is intended to provide liquidity and flexibility for operating requirements in Japan. At December 31, 2010, the Company had no borrowings outstanding under the Japan Commitment-line. Other Significant 2010 Cash Uses Settlement of Acquisition Related Liabilities with Barclays In general, as certain acquired BGI receivables are collected, the Company is required to pay Barclays approximately $342 million, which was recorded as of December 31, 2009 in due to related parties on the consolidated statement of financial condition, to settle certain non-interest bearing notes assumed in the BGI Transaction. As of December 31, 2010, the Company had repaid approximately $320 million. Federal Reserve Bank stock BlackRock Institutional Trust Company, N.A. (“BTC”), a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company, purchased $315 million of additional Federal Reserve Bank stock during the year ended December 31, 2010 pursuant to its regulatory requirements. Additional purchases of Federal Reserve Bank stock, pursuant to BTC’s regulatory requirements, may be required; however, such amounts currently are not expected to be material. Approval to Repurchase up to 5,100,000 shares In July 2010, BlackRock announced that its Board of Directors approved the repurchase of up to 5,100,000 shares to neutralize the dilutive effects of restricted stock units and options that have been granted to employees and which will become dilutive over the next several years. The shares are to be repurchased with management discretion on the timing of the repurchases. BlackRock’s pre-existing repurchase program established in 2006 was terminated effective with the new authorization. As of December 31, 2010, the Company had repurchased 896,102 shares in open market transactions for approximately $140 million. 96 Table of Contents Item 7. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Liquidity and Capital Resources (continued) Barclays Support of Certain Cash Funds Barclays has provided capital support agreements to support certain cash management products acquired by BlackRock in the BGI Transaction. Pursuant to the terms of the capital support agreements, Barclays agreed to cover losses on covered securities within the products in the aggregate of up to $2.2 billion from December 1, 2009 through December 1, 2013 or until certain criteria are met. BlackRock and Barclays have procedures in place to determine loss events on covered securities within the products and to ensure support payments from Barclays. At December 31, 2010, Barclays’ remaining maximum potential obligation in the aggregate under the capital support agreements was $1.7 billion. At December 31, 2010, BlackRock concluded that although these funds were variable interest entities, it was not the primary beneficiary of these funds. Net Capital Requirements The Company is required to maintain net capital in certain regulated subsidiaries within a number of jurisdictions, which is partially maintained by retaining cash and cash equivalents in those jurisdictions. As a result, such subsidiaries of the Company may be restricted in their ability to transfer cash between different jurisdictions and to their parents. Additionally, transfers of cash between international jurisdictions, including repatriation to the United States, may have adverse tax consequences that could discourage such transfers. BTC is chartered as a national bank that does not accept client deposits and whose powers are limited to trust activities. BTC provides investment management services, including investment advisory and securities lending agency services to institutional investors and other clients. BTC is subject to various regulatory capital and liquid asset requirements administered by Federal banking agencies. At December 31, 2010, the Company was required to maintain approximately $897 million in net capital in certain regulated subsidiaries, including BTC and entities regulated by the FSA in the United Kingdom, and were in compliance with all applicable regulatory minimum net capital requirements. During 2011, the Company’s net capital requirements increased approximately $157 million due to increases related to certain of its European regulated legal entities. 97 Table of Contents Item 7. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Liquidity and Capital Resources (continued) Contractual Obligations, Commitments and Contingencies The following table sets forth contractual obligations, commitments and contingencies by year of payment at December 31, 2010: (Dollar amounts in millions) 2011 2012 2013 2014 2015 Thereafter Total Contractual obligations and commitments: Short-term borrowings: Principal $ 100 $ — $ — $ — $ — $ — $ 100 Convertible debentures: Principal 67 — — — — — 67 Interest 2 — — — — — 2 Long-term borrowings: Principal — 500 — 1,000 — 1,700 3,200 Interest 140 140 129 129 94 288 920 Operating leases 131 117 130 115 106 903 1,502 Purchase obligations 121 30 16 5 2 — 174 Investment commitments 183 — — — — — 183 Total contractual obligations and commitments 744 787 275 1,249 202 2,891 6,148 Contingent obligations: Contingent distribution obligations 226 226 226 — — — 678 Total contractual obligations, commitments and contingent obligations(1) $ 970 $ 1,013 $ 501 $ 1,249 $ 202 $ 2,891 $ 6,826 (1) As of December 31, 2010, the Company had $246 million of net unrecognized tax benefits. Due to the uncertainty of timing and amounts that will ultimately be paid, this amount has been excluded from the table above. 98 Table of Contents Item 7. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Liquidity and Capital Resources (continued) Contractual Obligations, Commitments and Contingencies (continued) Short-term Borrowings At December 31, 2010, the Company had $100 million outstanding under the 2007 facility with an interest rate of 0.47% and a maturity date of February 28, 2011. Convertible Debentures In February 2005, the Company issued $250 million aggregate principal amount of convertible debentures due in 2035 and bearing interest at a rate of 2.625% per annum. Beginning in February 2009, the convertible debentures became convertible at the option of the holders at any time and on and after, February 20, 2010 the convertible debentures became callable by the Company at any time following not more than 60, but not less than, 30 days notice. On the contractual obligations table above, the remaining $67 million principal balance of the convertible debentures is assumed, although not determined, to be fully repaid in 2011. Long-term Borrowings At December 31, 2010, the principal amount of long-term borrowings was $3.2 billion. Debt service and repayment requirements are $140 million in 2011, $640 million in 2012, $129 million in 2013, $1,129 million in 2014 and $94 million in 2015. 2017 Notes In September 2007, the Company issued $700 million in aggregate principal amount of 6.25% senior unsecured notes maturing on September 15, 2017 (the “2017 Notes”). A portion of the net proceeds of the 2017 Notes was used to fund the initial cash payment for the acquisition of the fund of funds business of Quellos and the remainder was used for general corporate purposes. Interest is payable semi-annually in arrears on March 15 and September 15 of each year, or approximately $44 million per year. The 2017 Notes may be redeemed prior to maturity at any time in whole or in part at the option of the Company at a “make-whole” redemption price. The 2017 Notes were issued at a discount of $6 million, which is being amortized over their ten-year term. 2012, 2014 and 2019 Notes In December 2009, the Company issued $2.5 billion in aggregate principal amount of unsecured and unsubordinated obligations. These notes were issued as three separate series of senior debt securities including $0.5 billion of 2.25% notes, $1.0 billion of 3.50% notes and $1.0 billion of 5.0% notes maturing in December 2012, 2014 and 2019, respectively. Net proceeds of this offering were used to repay borrowings under our CP program, which was used to finance a portion of the BGI Transaction, and for general corporate purposes. Interest on these notes of approximately $96 million per year is payable semi-annually in arrears on June 10 and December 10 of each year. These notes may be redeemed prior to maturity at any time in whole or in part at the option of the Company at a “make-whole” redemption price. These notes were issued collectively at a discount of $5 million, which is being amortized over approximately a weighted 6.6 year term. 99 Table of Contents Item 7. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Liquidity and Capital Resources (continued) Contractual Obligations, Commitments and Contingencies (continued) Operating Leases The Company leases its primary office space under agreements that currently expire through 2035. In connection with certain lease agreements, the Company is responsible for escalation payments. The contractual obligations table above includes only guaranteed minimum lease payments for such leases and does not project potential escalation or other lease-related payments. These leases are classified as operating leases and, as such, are not recorded as liabilities on the consolidated statements of financial condition. In January 2010, the Company entered into an agreement with Mourant & Co Trustees Limited and Mourant Property Trustees Limited as Trustees of the Drapers Gardens Unit Trust, for the lease of approximately 292,418 square feet of office and ancillary (including retail) space located at Drapers Gardens, 12 Throgmorton Avenue, London, EC2, United Kingdom. The lease began on February 17, 2010 (the “Effective Date”) and will continue for 25 years, with the option to renew for an additional five-year term. The lease provides for total annual base rental payments of approximately $22 million, which is subject to increase on each fifth anniversary of the beginning of the lease. The lease included an initial rent free period for 36 months and 22 days following the Effective Date. Purchase Obligations In the ordinary course of business, BlackRock enters into contracts or purchase obligations with third parties whereby the third parties provide services to or on behalf of BlackRock. Purchase obligations included in the contractual obligations table above represent executory contracts, which are either non-cancelable or cancelable with a penalty. At December 31, 2010, the Company’s obligations primarily reflect standard service contracts for portfolio, market data, office related services and third party marketing and promotional services. Purchase obligations are recorded on the Company’s financial statements when services are provided and, as such, obligations for services not received are not included in the Company’s consolidated statement of financial condition at December 31, 2010. In connection with the Drapers Gardens lease described above, the Company entered into a purchase obligation for construction services of approximately $67 million. The Company incurred $4 million of construction services during the year ended December 31, 2010. Substantially all of the remaining obligation of $63 million is expected to be incurred during 2011. 100 Table of Contents Item 7. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Liquidity and Capital Resources (continued) Contractual Obligations, Commitments and Contingencies (continued) Investment/Loan Commitments At December 31, 2010, the Company had $183 million of various capital commitments to fund sponsored investment funds, including funds of private equity funds, real estate funds and distressed credit funds. This amount excludes additional commitments made by consolidated funds of funds to underlying third party funds as third party non-controlling interest holders have the legal obligation to fund the respective commitments of such funds of funds. Generally, the timing of the funding of these commitments is unknown and the commitments are callable on demand at any time prior to the expiration of the commitment and are therefore presented in 2011. These unfunded commitments are not recorded on the Company’s consolidated statements of financial condition. The above schedule does not include potential future commitments approved by the Company’s Capital Committee, but which are not yet legally binding. The Company intends to make additional capital commitments from time to time to fund additional investment products for, and with, its clients. Prior to March 31, 2010, the Company was committed to provide financing of up to $60 million to Anthracite Capital, Inc. (“Anthracite”), a specialty commercial real estate finance company that was managed by a subsidiary of BlackRock. The financing is collateralized by a pledge by Anthracite of its ownership interest in a real estate debt investment fund, which is managed by a subsidiary of BlackRock. At December 31, 2010, $33.5 million of financing was outstanding and remains outstanding as of February 2011, which is past its final maturity date of March 5, 2010. At December 31, 2010, the carrying value of the collateral was estimated to be zero, which resulted in an additional $12.5 million reduction in amounts due from related parties on the Company’s consolidated statement of financial condition and an equal amount recorded in general and administrative expenses on the Company’s consolidated statements of income for the year ended December 31, 2010. The Company has no obligation to loan additional amounts to Anthracite under this facility. Anthracite filed a voluntary petition for relief under Chapter 7 of Title 11 of the U.S. Code in the U.S. Bankruptcy Court for the Southern District of New York on March 15, 2010. Recovery of any amount of the financing provided by the Company in excess of the value of the collateral is not anticipated. The Company continues to evaluate the collectability of the outstanding borrowings. Carried Interest Claw-back As a general partner in certain investment funds, including private equity partnerships and certain hedge funds, the Company may receive certain carried interest cash distributions from the partnerships in accordance with distribution provisions of the partnership agreements. The Company may, from time to time, be required to return all or a portion of such distributions to the limited partners in the event the limited partners do not achieve a certain return as specified in the various partnership agreements. At December 31, 2010, the Company has received less than $10 million in cash that was not recorded as revenue and is subject to claw-back. Contingent Distribution Obligations In November 2010, BlackRock entered into a second amended and restated global distribution agreement with Merrill Lynch, which requires the Company to make payments to Merrill Lynch contingent upon sales of products and level of assets under management maintained in certain BlackRock products. The economic terms of the agreement will remain in effect until January 2014. After such term, the agreement will renew for one automatic three-year extension if certain conditions are satisfied. The above schedule reflects the Company’s estimated payments for 2011, which due to uncertainty of asset levels and future additional sales, has been held constant for 2011 through 2013. 101 Table of Contents Item 7. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Liquidity and Capital Resources (continued) Contractual Obligations, Commitments and Contingencies (continued) Contingent Payments Related to Business Acquisitions In connection with the Quellos Transaction, Quellos was entitled to receive two contingent payments, subject to achieving certain investment advisory base and performance fee measures through December 31, 2010, totaling up to an additional $969 million in a combination of cash and stock. During second quarter 2009, the Company determined the amount of the first contingent payment to be $219 million, of which $11 million was previously paid in cash during 2008. Of the remaining $208 million, during second quarter 2009, $156 million was paid in cash and $52 million was paid in common stock, or approximately 330,000 shares based on a price of $157.33 per share. The second contingent payment, of up to $595 million, would have been payable in cash in 2011. Quellos also was entitled to a “catch-up” payment in 2011 if certain investment advisory base fee measures were met through 2010 as the value of the first contingent payment was less than $374 million. A portion of the second contingent payment, not to exceed $90 million, would have been paid to Quellos based on factors including the continued employment of certain employees with BlackRock. The base and performance fee measures through December 31, 2010 were not achieved, therefore, the remaining contingent payments will not occur. 102 Table of Contents Item 7. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Liquidity and Capital Resources (continued) Contractual Obligations, Commitments and Contingencies (continued) The following items have not been included in the contractual obligations, commitments and contingencies table: Compensation and Benefit Obligations The Company has various compensation and benefit obligations, including bonuses, commissions and incentive payments payable, defined contribution plan matching contribution obligations, and deferred compensation arrangements, that are excluded from the table above primarily due to uncertainties in their payout periods. These arrangements are discussed in more detail in Notes 15, Stock-Based Compensation, and 16, Employee Benefit Plans, to the consolidated financial statements beginning on page F-1 of this Form 10-K. Accrued compensation and benefits at December 31, 2010 totaled $1,520 million and included incentive compensation of $1,220 million, deferred compensation of $89 million and other compensation and benefits related obligations of $211 million. Substantially all of the incentive compensation liability was paid in the first quarter of 2011, while the deferred compensation obligations are payable over periods up to five years. Separate Account Liabilities The Company’s two wholly-owned registered life insurance companies in the United Kingdom maintain separate account assets representing segregated funds held for purposes of funding individual and group pension contracts. The net investment income and net realized and unrealized gains and losses attributable to these separate account assets accrue to the contract owners and, as such, an offsetting separate account liability is recorded. At December 31, 2010, the Company had $121.1 billion of assets and offsetting liabilities on the consolidated statement of financial condition. The payment of these contractual obligations is inherently uncertain and varies by customer. As such, these liabilities have been excluded from the contractual obligations table above. Indemnifications In many of the Company’s contracts, including the BGI, MLIM and Quellos Transaction agreements, BlackRock agrees to indemnify third parties under certain circumstances. The terms of the indemnities vary from contract to contract and the amount of indemnification liability, if any, cannot be determined and has not been included in the table above or recorded in the Company’s consolidated statement of financial condition at December 31, 2010. See further discussion in Note 14, Commitments and Contingencies, to the consolidated financial statements beginning on page F-1 of this Form 10-K. 103 Table of Contents Item 7. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Critical Accounting Policies The preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods. Actual results could differ significantly from those estimates. Management considers the following critical accounting policies important to understanding the consolidated financial statements. For a summary of these and additional accounting policies as well as recent accounting developments see Note 2, Significant Accounting Policies, to the consolidated financial statements beginning on page F-1 of this Form 10-K. Consolidation of Sponsored Investment Funds and Securitization Products Consolidation of sponsored investment funds and securitization products (collectively “investment products”) is determined pursuant to ASC 810, Consolidation. The accounting method used by the Company is dependent upon the influence the Company has over its investee, the investment product. To the extent that BlackRock can exert control over the financial and operating policies of the investment product, which generally exists if there is a 50% or greater voting interest or if partners or members of certain products do not have substantive rights, the investment product is consolidated into BlackRock’s financial statements. For investment products in which BlackRock’s voting interest is less than 50%, an analysis is performed to determine if the investment product is a variable interest entity (“VIE”) or a voting rights entity. Upon the determination that the investment product is a VIE further analysis, as discussed below, is performed to determine if BlackRock is the primary beneficiary (“PB”) of the investment product, which would result in consolidation. Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities Pursuant to ASC 810-10, certain investment products for which the risks and rewards of ownership are not directly linked to voting interests may be deemed VIEs. BlackRock reviews factors, including the rights of the equity holders and obligations of equity holders to absorb losses or receive expected residual returns to determine if the investment product is a VIE. BlackRock is required to consolidate a VIE when it is deemed to be the PB, which is evaluated continuously as facts and circumstances change. In June 2009, the FASB issued ASU 2009-17, Improvements to Financial Reporting by Enterprises Involved with Variable Interest Entities (“ASU 2009-17”), which became effective for BlackRock on January 1, 2010. In February 2010 the FASB issued ASU 2010-10, Amendments to Statement 167 for Certain Investment Funds (“ASU 2010-10”). This ASU deferred the application of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (“SFAS”) No. 167, Amendments to FASB Interpretation No. 46(R), to a reporting enterprise’s interest in VIEs if certain conditions are met. The PB of a VIE that is an investment fund meeting the conditions of ASU 2010-10 is the enterprise that absorbs the majority of the entity’s expected losses, receives a majority of the entity’s expected residual returns, or both, as a result of holding variable interests (including those of related parties). Effective January 1, 2010, the PB of a VIE that does not meet the conditions for deferral in ASU 2010-10 is the enterprise that has the power to direct activities of the entity that most significantly impact the entity’s economic performance and has the obligation to absorb losses or the right to receive benefits that potentially could be significant to the VIE. 104 Table of Contents Item 7. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Critical Accounting Policies (continued) Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities (continued) Significant judgment is required in the determination of whether the Company is the PB of a VIE. If the Company, together with its related parties, is determined to be the PB of a VIE, the entity will be consolidated within BlackRock’s consolidated financial statements. In order to determine whether the Company is the PB of a VIE for entities that do meet the conditions of ASU 2010-10, management must make significant estimates and assumptions of probable future cash flows and assign probabilities to different cash flow scenarios. Assumptions made in such analyses include, but are not limited to, market prices of securities, market interest rates, potential credit defaults on individual securities or default rates on a portfolio of securities, gain realization, liquidity or marketability of certain securities, discount rates and the probability of certain other outcomes. In the normal course of business, the Company is the manager of various types of sponsored investment vehicles, including collateralized debt/loan obligations (“CDOs” or “CLOs”) that do not meet the conditions of ASU 2010-10 and sponsored investment funds, which may be considered VIEs. At December 31, 2010, the Company consolidated four VIEs, including three CLOs and one sponsored private equity fund. At December 31, 2010, the following balances related to these four VIEs were consolidated on the Company’s consolidated statement of financial condition: (Dollar amounts in millions) CLOs SponsoredPrivateEquity Fund TotalConsolidatedVIEs Assets of consolidated VIEs: Cash and cash equivalents $ 82 $ 11 $ 93 Bank loans, bonds and other investments 1,278 34 1,312 Liabilities of consolidated VIEs: Borrowings (1,278 ) — (1,278 ) Other liabilities (7 ) — (7 ) Appropriated retained earnings (75 ) — (75 ) Non-controlling interests of consolidated VIEs — (45 ) (45 ) Total net interests in consolidated VIEs $ — $ — $ — As of December 31, 2010, BlackRock was the manager of over 20 CLOs/CDOs and other securitization entities, including the three aforementioned CLOs in which BlackRock, in accordance with ASU 2009-17, was determined to be the PB, which resulted in consolidation of these VIEs in the Company’s consolidated financial statements. BlackRock was deemed to be the PB because it has the power to direct the activities of the CLO that most significantly impact the entity’s economic performance and has the right to receive benefits that potentially could be significant to the VIE. At December 31, 2010, the Company had $1,360 million and $1,285 million in assets and liabilities, respectively, on its consolidated statement of financial condition related to these consolidated CLOs. In addition, the Company recorded appropriated retained earnings for the difference, as the CLO noteholders, not BlackRock, ultimately will receive the benefits or absorb the losses associated with the CLO’s assets and liabilities. Therefore, the changes in the assets and liabilities of these CLOs have no impact on net income attributable to BlackRock, Inc. or its cash flows. 105 Table of Contents Item 7. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Critical Accounting Policies (continued) Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities (continued) At of December 31, 2010, BlackRock was determined to be the PB of one sponsored private equity investment fund of funds in which it had a non-substantive investment and was deemed to absorb the majority of the variability due to its de-facto third party relationships with other partners in the fund, which limits the ability of the partners to transfer or sell their interests without BlackRock’s consent as the general partner of the fund. At December 31, 2010, the Company had recorded $11 million, $34 million and $45 million in cash and cash equivalents, private equity investments and nonredeemable non-controlling interests of consolidated VIEs, respectively, on its consolidated statement of financial condition related to this VIE. The Company has no risk of loss with its involvement with this VIE. Therefore, the changes in the assets and liabilities of this VIE have no impact on net income attributable to BlackRock, Inc. Consolidation of Voting Rights Entities To the extent that BlackRock maintains 50% or greater voting interest of an investment product, BlackRock is deemed to have control of the product, which results in consolidation of the product into BlackRock’s financial statements. The Company, as general partner or managing member of certain sponsored investment funds, generally is presumed to control funds that are limited partnerships or limited liability companies. Pursuant to ASC 810-20, Control of Partnerships and Similar Entities (“ASC 810-20”), the Company reviews such investment vehicles to determine if such a presumption can be overcome by determining if other non-affiliated partners or members of the limited partnership or limited liability company have the substantive ability to dissolve (liquidate) the investment vehicle, or otherwise to remove BlackRock as the general partner or managing member without cause based on a simple unaffiliated majority vote, or have other substantive participating rights. If the investment vehicle is not a VIE and the presumption of control is not overcome, the investment vehicle will be consolidated into BlackRock’s financial statements. 106 Table of Contents Item 7. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Critical Accounting Policies (continued) Consolidation of Voting Rights Entities (continued) At December 31, 2010 and 2009, as a result of consolidation of various investment products deemed to be voting rights entities, including products where BlackRock owns 50% of greater of the voting rights of the product, under the consolidation policies described above, the Company had the following balances on its consolidated statements of financial condition: (Dollar amounts in millions) December 31,2010 December 31,2009 Cash and cash equivalents $ 65 $ 75 Investments: Trading investments 60 103 Other investments 337 360 Other assets 3 2 Other liabilities (10 ) (9 ) Non-controlling interests (195 ) (273 ) BlackRock’s net interests in consolidated investment funds $ 260 $ 258 The Company has retained the specialized accounting of these investment funds pursuant to ASC 810-10. At December 31, 2009, the above balances included a consolidated sponsored investment fund that also was deemed a VIE at December 31, 2010 and is currently reported within assets and liabilities of consolidated VIEs on the consolidated statement of financial condition. This VIE, as well as three CLOs which are also VIEs, was excluded from the December 31, 2010 balances above as commencing in 2010 these balances are reported separately on the consolidated statement of financial condition. Investments Equity Method Investments For equity investments where BlackRock does not control the investee, and where the Company is not the PB of a VIE, but can exert significant influence over the financial and operating policies of the investee, the Company uses the equity method of accounting. The evaluation of whether the Company exerts control or significant influence over the financial and operational policies of its investees requires significant judgment based on the facts and circumstances surrounding each individual investment. Factors considered in these evaluations may include the type of investment, the legal structure of the investee, the terms and structure of the investment agreement including investor voting or other rights, the terms of BlackRock’s advisory agreement or other agreements with the investee, any influence BlackRock may have on the governing board of the investee, the legal rights of other investors in the entity pursuant to the fund’s operating documents and the relationship between BlackRock and other investors in the entity. 107 Table of Contents Item 7. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Critical Accounting Policies (continued) Investments (continued) Equity Method Investments (continued) Substantially all of BlackRock’s equity method investees are investment companies which record their underlying investments at fair value. Therefore, under the equity method of accounting, BlackRock’s share of the investee’s underlying net income predominantly represents fair value adjustments in the investments held by the equity method investees. BlackRock’s share of the investee’s underlying net income or loss is based upon the most currently available information and is recorded as non-operating income (expense) for investments in investment companies, or as other revenue for operating or advisory company investments, which are recorded in other assets, since such operating or advisory companies are considered to be connected to BlackRock’s core business. At December 31, 2010, the Company had $583 million and $58 million of equity method investments, including equity method investments held for deferred compensation, reflected within investments and other assets, respectively, and at December 31, 2009 the Company had $401 million and $36 million of equity method investees reflected in investments and other assets, respectively. Impairment of Investments The Company’s management periodically assesses its equity method, available-for-sale, held-to-maturity and cost investments for impairment. If circumstances indicate that impairment may exist, investments are evaluated using market values, where available, or the expected future cash flows of the investment. If the undiscounted expected future cash flows are lower than the Company’s carrying value of the investment, an impairment charge is recorded to the consolidated statement of income. When the fair value of an available-for-sale security is lower than its cost or amortized cost value, the Company evaluates the security to determine whether the impairment is considered “other-than-temporary”. In making this determination for equity securities, the Company considers, among other factors, the length of time the security has been in a loss position, the extent to which the security’s market value is less than its cost, the financial condition and near-term prospects of the security’s issuer and the Company’s ability and intent to hold the security for a period of time sufficient to allow for recovery of such unrealized losses. If the impairment is considered other-than-temporary, a charge is recorded to the consolidated statement of income. In making this determination for debt securities, the Company considers whether: (1) the Company has the intent to sell the security, (2) it is more likely than not that the Company will be required to sell the security before recovery, or (3) the Company does not expect to recover the entire amortized cost basis of the security. If the Company does not intend to sell a security and it is not more likely than not that the entity will be required to sell the security, but the security has suffered a credit loss, the credit loss will be bifurcated from the total impairment and recorded in earnings with the remaining portion recorded in other comprehensive income. 108 Table of Contents Item 7. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Critical Accounting Policies (continued) Impairment of Investments (continued) For the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008, the Company recorded other-than-temporary impairments of less than $1 million, $5 million, and $8 million, respectively, related to debt securities and CDO available-for-sale investments, which were recorded in non-operating income (expense) on the consolidated statements of income. The $5 million of impairments in 2009 included $2 million related to credit loss impairments on debt securities. The $2 million credit loss impairment in 2009 was determined by comparing the estimated discounted cash flows versus the amortized cost for each individual security. The other-than-temporary impairments related to debt securities were due to adverse credit conditions for a debt instrument that was purchased from an enhanced cash management fund in which the Company determined that it did not have the ability to hold the securities for a period of time sufficient to allow for recovery of such unrealized losses. Evaluation of securities impairments involves significant assumptions and management judgments, which could differ from actual results, and these differences could have a material impact on the Company’s consolidated statements of income. Fair Value Measurements BlackRock adopted the applicable provisions of ASC 820-10, Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures (“ASC 820-10”), as of January 1, 2008, which require, among other things, enhanced disclosures about assets and liabilities that are measured and reported at fair value. Hierarchy of Fair Value Inputs The provisions of ASC 820-10 establish a hierarchy that prioritizes inputs to valuation techniques used to measure fair value and requires companies to disclose the fair value of their financial instruments according to the fair value hierarchy (i.e., Level 1, 2 and 3 inputs, as defined). The fair value hierarchy gives the highest priority to quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities and the lowest priority to unobservable inputs. Additionally, companies are required to provide enhanced disclosure regarding instruments in the Level 3 category (which have inputs to the valuation techniques that are unobservable and require significant management judgment), including a reconciliation of the beginning and ending balances separately for each major category of assets and liabilities. Assets and liabilities measured and reported at fair value are classified and disclosed in one of the following categories: Level 1 Inputs: Quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities at the reporting date. • Level 1 assets may include listed mutual funds (including those accounted for under the equity method of accounting as these mutual funds are investment companies, that have publicly available NAVs which in accordance with GAAP are calculated under fair value measures and are equal to the earnings of such funds), ETFs, and listed equities and certain derivatives. 109 Table of Contents Item 7. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Critical Accounting Policies (continued) Fair Value Measurements (continued) Level 2 Inputs: Quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets; quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities that are not active; quotes from pricing services or brokers, for which the Company can determine that orderly transactions took place at the quoted price or that the inputs used to arrive at the price were observable; and inputs other than quoted prices that are observable, such as models or other valuation methodologies. • Level 2 assets in this category may include debt securities, bank loans, short-term floating rate notes and asset-backed securities, securities held within consolidated hedge funds, certain equity method limited partnership interests in hedge funds and mutual funds valued based on net asset values where the Company has the ability to redeem at the measurement date or in the near term without redemption restrictions, restricted public securities valued at a discount, as well as over–the-counter derivatives, including interest and inflation rate swaps and foreign exchange currency contracts that have inputs to the valuations that can be generally corroborated by observable market data. Level 3 Inputs: Unobservable inputs for the valuation of the asset or liability, which may include non-binding broker quotes. Level 3 assets include investments for which there is little, if any, market activity. These inputs require significant management judgment or estimation. Certain investments that are valued using net asset values and that are subject to current redemption restrictions that will not be lifted in the near term are included in Level 3. • Level 3 assets in this category generally include general and limited partnership interests in private equity funds, funds of private equity funds, real estate funds, hedge funds, funds of hedge funds, direct private equity investments held within consolidated funds and certain held for sale real estate disposal assets. • Level 3 liabilities included in this category include borrowings of consolidated collateralized loan obligations valued based upon non-binding broker quotes. Level 3 inputs include BlackRock capital accounts for its partnership interests in various alternative investments. BlackRock’s $650 million of Level 3 investments at December 31, 2010 primarily include co-investments in private equity fund of funds and private equity funds, funds of hedge funds as well as funds that invest in distressed credit and mortgage securities and real estate equity products. Many of these investees are investment companies, which record their underlying investments at fair value based on fair value policies established by management of the underlying fund, which could include BlackRock employees. Fair value policies at the underlying fund generally utilize pricing/valuation information, including independent appraisals from third party sources; however, in some instances current valuation information for illiquid securities or securities in markets that are not active may not be available from any third party source or fund management may conclude that the valuations that are available from third party sources are not reliable. In these instances fund management may perform model-based analytical valuations that may be used to value these investments. 110 Table of Contents Item 7. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Critical Accounting Policies (continued) Fair Value Measurements (continued) Significance of Inputs The Company’s assessment of the significance of a particular input to the fair value measurement in its entirety requires judgment and considers factors specific to the financial instrument. Pricing Services and Broker Quotes A significant amount of inputs used to value equity and debt securities are sourced from well-recognized third party pricing vendors. Generally, prices obtained from pricing vendors are categorized as Level 1 inputs for securities that are traded in active markets and as Level 2 for other securities if the vendor uses observable inputs in determining the price. Annually, BlackRock reviews both the valuation methodology, including the general assumptions and methods used to value various asset classes, and operational process with these vendors. In addition, on a quarterly basis meetings are held with the vendors to identify any significant changes to the vendors’ process. In addition, quotes obtained from brokers generally are non-binding and categorized as Level 3 inputs. However, if the Company is able to determine that market participants have transacted for the asset in an orderly manner near the quoted price or if the Company can determine that the inputs used by the broker are observable, the quote is classified as a Level 2 input. Significant Transfers Into and Out of Levels 1, 2, and 3 During the year ended December 31, 2010, the Company reclassified approximately $47 million of net investments out of Level 3 predominantly to Level 2. The majority of the net reclassifications were related to investments that Company values using a NAV (or a capital account) and it currently has the ability to redeem in the near term. Changes in Valuation Changes in value on $1,051 million of investments will impact the Company’s non-operating income (expense), $45 million will impact accumulated other comprehensive income, $431 million are held at cost or amortized cost and the remaining $13 million related to carried interest has no impact on non-operating income (expense). As of December 31, 2010, changes in fair value of approximately $397 million of such investments within consolidated sponsored investment funds will impact BlackRock’s net income (loss) attributable to non-controlling interests expense on the consolidated statements of income. BlackRock’s net exposure to changes in fair value of such consolidated sponsored investment funds is $260 million. 111 Table of Contents Item 7. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Critical Accounting Policies (continued) Goodwill and Intangible Assets At December 31, 2010, the carrying amounts of the Company’s goodwill and intangible assets were as follows: (Dollar amounts in millions) December 31,2010 Goodwill $ 12,805 Intangible assets Indefinite–lived Management contracts Mutual funds/Exchange-traded products 10,661 Other collective investment funds 3,610 Alternative investment funds 917 Trade names/trademarks 1,403 License 6 Finite–lived, net of accumulated amortization Management contracts Institutional/Retail separate accounts 807 Alternative investment accounts and funds 104 Other 4 Total goodwill and intangible assets $ 30,317 112 Table of Contents Item 7. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Critical Accounting Policies (continued) Goodwill and Intangible Assets (continued) The value of contracts acquired in a business acquisition to manage assets in proprietary open- and closed-end investment funds as well as collective trust funds without a specified termination date is classified as an indefinite-lived intangible asset. The assignment of indefinite lives to such investment fund contracts is based upon the assumption that there is no foreseeable limit on the contract period to manage these funds due to the likelihood of continued renewal at little or no cost. Goodwill represents the cost of a business acquisition in excess of the fair value of the net assets acquired. In accordance with the applicable provisions of ASC 350, Intangibles – Goodwill and Other (“ASC 350”), indefinite-lived intangible assets and goodwill are not amortized. Finite-lived management contracts are amortized over their remaining expected useful lives, which, at December 31, 2010, ranged from 3 years to 14 years with a weighted average remaining estimated useful life of 6.3 years. Goodwill The Company assesses its goodwill for impairment at least annually, considering such factors as the book value and the market capitalization of the Company. The impairment test performed as of July 31, 2010 indicated no impairment charge was required. The Company continues to monitor its book value per share as compared to closing prices of its common stock for potential indicators of impairment. At December 31, 2010 the Company’s common stock closed at $190.58, which exceeded its book value per share of approximately $136.09 after excluding appropriated retained earnings. Indefinite-lived and finite-lived intangibles The Company assesses its indefinite-lived management contracts, trade names and licenses for impairment at least annually, considering various factors, including AUM growth rates, product mix, product margins, tax rates, discount rates and projected cash flows to determine whether the values of each intangible asset are impaired and whether the indefinite-life classification is still appropriate. The fair value of indefinite-lived intangible assets is determined based on the discounted value of expected future cash flows. The fair value of finite-lived intangible assets is reviewed at least annually to determine whether circumstances exist which indicate there may be a potential impairment. In addition, if such circumstances are considered to exist, the Company will perform an impairment test, using an undiscounted cash flow analysis. If the asset is determined to be impaired, the difference between the book value of the asset and its current fair value is recognized as an expense in the period in which the impairment occurs. Actual results could differ from these estimates, which could materially impact the impairment conclusion. In 2010, 2009 and 2008, the Company performed impairment tests that indicated no impairment charges were required, the classification of indefinite-lived versus finite-lived intangibles was still appropriate and no changes to the expected lives of the finite-lived intangibles were required. The Company continuously monitors various factors, including AUM, for potential indicators of impairment. 113 Table of Contents Item 7. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Critical Accounting Policies (continued) Goodwill and Intangible Assets (continued) Indefinite-lived and finite-lived intangibles (continued) In addition, management judgment is required to estimate the period over which finite-lived intangible assets will contribute to the Company’s cash flows and the pattern in which these assets will be consumed. A change in the remaining useful life of any of these assets, or the reclassification of an indefinite-lived intangible asset to a finite-lived intangible asset, could have a significant impact on the Company’s amortization expense, which was $160 million, $147 million and $146 million for the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively. Income Taxes The Company accounts for income taxes under the asset and liability method prescribed by ASC 740, Income Taxes. Deferred income tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to temporary differences between the financial statement carrying amount of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases using currently enacted tax rates. The effect of a change in tax rates on deferred tax assets and liabilities is recognized in income in the period of the enactment date. BlackRock adopted the applicable provisions of ASC 740 on January 1, 2007 related to uncertainties in income taxes which clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in a company’s financial statements. ASC 740 prescribes a threshold for measurement and recognition in the financial statements of an asset or liability resulting from a tax position taken or expected to be taken in an income tax return. ASC 740 also provides guidance on, among other things, de-recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities and interest and penalties on uncertain tax positions. The application of ASC 740 requires management to make estimates of the ranges of possible outcomes, the probability of favorable or unfavorable tax outcomes and potential interest and penalties related to such unfavorable outcomes, which require significant management judgment. Actual future tax consequences relating to uncertain tax positions may be materially different than the Company’s current estimates. At December 31, 2010, BlackRock had $307 million of gross unrecognized tax benefits, of which $194 million, if recognized, would affect the effective tax rate. 114 Table of Contents Item 7. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Critical Accounting Policies (continued) Income Taxes (continued) In accordance with ASC 740, management is required to estimate the timing of the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities, make assumptions about the future deductibility of deferred income tax assets and assess deferred income tax liabilities based on enacted tax rates for the appropriate tax jurisdictions to determine the amount of such deferred income tax assets and liabilities. At December 31, 2010, the Company had net deferred tax assets of $10 million and net deferred tax liabilities of approximately $5,477 million on the consolidated statement of financial condition. Changes in the calculated deferred tax assets and liabilities may occur in certain circumstances, including statutory income tax rate changes, statutory tax law changes, changes in the anticipated timing of recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities or changes in the structure or tax status of the Company. ASC 740 requires the Company to assess whether a valuation allowance should be established against its deferred income tax assets based on consideration of all available evidence, both positive and negative, using a more likely than not standard. This assessment considers, among other matters, the nature, frequency and severity of recent losses, forecast of future profitability, the duration of statutory carry back and carry forward periods, the Company’s experience with tax attributes expiring unused, and tax planning alternatives. At December 31, 2010, the Company has recorded a deferred tax asset of $108 million for unrealized investment losses however no valuation allowance has been established because the Company expects to be able to carry back a portion of its unrealized capital losses when realized, hold certain equity method investments which include fixed income securities over a period sufficient for them to recover their unrealized losses, and generate future capital gains sufficient to offset the unrealized capital losses. Based on the weight of available evidence, it is more likely than not that the deferred tax asset will be realized. However, changes in circumstance could cause the Company to revalue its deferred tax balances with the resulting change impacting the income statement in the period of the change. Such changes may be material to the Company’s consolidated financial statements. See Note 21, Income Taxes, to the consolidated financial statements beginning on page F-1 of this Form 10-K for further details. The Company records income taxes based upon its estimated income tax liability or benefit. The Company’s actual tax liability or benefit may differ from the estimated income tax liability or benefit. The Company had current income taxes receivable of approximately $57 million and current income taxes payable of $157 million at December 31, 2010. 115 Table of Contents Item 7. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Critical Accounting Policies (continued) Revenue Recognition Investment advisory and administration fees are recognized as the services are performed. Such fees are based on pre-determined percentages of the market value of AUM or, in the case of certain real estate separate accounts, net operating income generated by the underlying properties, and are affected by changes in AUM, including market appreciation or depreciation and net subscriptions or redemptions. Investment advisory and administration fees for investment funds are shown net of fees waived pursuant to contractual expense limitations of the funds or voluntary waivers. Certain real estate fees are earned upon the acquisition or disposition of properties in accordance with applicable investment management agreements and are recognized at the closing of the respective real estate transactions. The Company contracts with third parties, including related parties, for various fund distribution and shareholder servicing to be performed on behalf of certain non-U.S. funds managed by the Company. Such arrangements generally are priced as a portion of the management fee paid by the fund. In certain cases, the fund takes on the primary responsibility for payment for services such that BlackRock bears no credit risk to the third party. The Company accounts for such retrocession arrangements in accordance with ASC 605-45, Revenue Recognition – Principle Agent Considerations (“ASC 605-45”), and records its investment advisory and administration fees net of retrocessions. Retrocessions for the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008 were $831 million, $611 million and $762 million, respectively. The Company has additional contracts for similar services with third parties, which due to the terms of the contracts, are recorded as distribution and servicing costs and thus not netted on the consolidated statements of income. The Company earns revenue by lending securities on behalf of clients, primarily to brokerage institutions. Such revenues are accounted for on an accrual basis. The securities loaned are secured by collateral in the form of cash and securities, generally ranging from 102% to 112% of the value of the loaned securities. The revenue earned is shared between the Company and the funds or other third-party accounts managed by the Company from which the securities are borrowed. For the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008, securities lending revenue totaled $325 million, $36 million and $25 million, respectively, and is recorded in investment advisory, administration fees and securities lending revenue on the consolidated statements of income. Investment advisory, administration fees and securities lending revenue are reported together as the fees for these services often are agreed upon with clients as a bundled fee. The Company also may receive performance fees or incentive allocations from certain actively managed investment funds and certain separately managed accounts which are primarily alternative, equity or multi-asset class products. These performance fees generally are earned upon exceeding specified relative or absolute investment return thresholds. Such fees are recorded upon completion of the measurement periods, which vary by product or account and could be monthly, quarterly, annually or longer. For the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008, performance fee revenue totaled $540 million, $202 million and $177 million, respectively. 116 Table of Contents Item 7. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Critical Accounting Policies (continued) Revenue Recognition (continued) In addition, the Company may receive carried interest in the form of an investment capital allocation or cash from certain alternative investment funds upon exceeding performance thresholds. However, BlackRock may be required to return all, or part, of such carried interest depending upon performance of these investment products in future periods. Therefore, BlackRock records carried interest subject to such claw-back provisions in investments or cash to the extent that it is distributed, on its consolidated statements of financial condition. Carried interest is realized upon the earlier of the termination of the alternative investment fund or when the likelihood of claw-back is mathematically improbable. The Company records realized carried interest as performance fees on its consolidated statements of income. The Company records a deferred carried interest liability to the extent it receives cash or capital allocations prior to meeting the revenue recognition criteria. At December 31, 2010 and 2009, the Company had $23 million and $13 million, respectively, of deferred carried interest recorded in other liabilities on the consolidated statements of financial condition. The ultimate recognition of revenue, if any, for these products is unknown. Fees earned for BlackRock Solutions, which include advisory services, are recorded as services are performed and are determined using some, or all, of the following methods: (i) fixed fees, (ii) percentages of various attributes of advisory assets under management and (iii) performance fees if contractual thresholds are met. Revenue earned on advisory assignments was comprised of one-time advisory and portfolio structuring fees and ongoing fees based on AUM of the respective portfolio assignment. For the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008, BlackRock Solutions and advisory revenue totaled $460 million, $477 million and $393 million, respectively. Adjustments to revenue arising from initial estimates historically have been immaterial since the majority of BlackRock’s investment advisory and administration revenue is calculated based on the fair value of AUM and since the Company does not record performance revenues until performance thresholds have been exceeded and the likelihood of claw-back is mathematically improbable. 117 Table of Contents Item 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK AUM Market Price Risk BlackRock’s investment advisory and administration fees are primarily comprised of fees based on a percentage of the value of AUM and, in some cases, performance fees expressed as a percentage of the returns realized on AUM. At December 31, 2010, the majority of our investment advisory and administration fees were based on average or period end AUM of the applicable investment funds or separate accounts. Movements in equity market prices, interest rates/credit spreads, foreign exchange rates, or all three could cause the value of AUM to decline, which would result in lower investment advisory and administration fees. Corporate Investments Portfolio Risks As a leading investment management firm, BlackRock devotes significant resources across all of its operations to identifying, measuring, monitoring, managing and analyzing market and operating risks, including the management and oversight of its own investment portfolio. The Board of Directors of the Company has adopted guidelines for the review of investments to be made by the Company, requiring, among other things, that all investments be reviewed by the Company’s Capital Committee, which consists of senior officers of the Company, and that certain investments may be referred to the Audit Committee or the Board of Directors, depending on the circumstances, for approval. In the normal course of its business, BlackRock is exposed to equity market price risk, interest rate/credit spread risk and foreign exchange rate risk associated with its corporate investments. BlackRock has investments primarily in sponsored investment products that invest in a variety of asset classes including real estate, private equity and hedge funds. Investments generally are made for co-investment purposes, to establish a performance track record, to hedge exposure to certain deferred compensation plans or for regulatory purposes. Currently, the Company has a seed capital hedging program in which it enters into total return swaps to hedge exposure to certain equity investments. At December 31, 2010, the outstanding total return swaps had an aggregate notional value of approximately $25 million. 118 Table of Contents Item 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK (continued) Corporate Investments Portfolio Risks At December 31, 2010, approximately $397 million of BlackRock’s total investments were maintained in sponsored investment funds that are deemed to be controlled by BlackRock in accordance with GAAP and therefore are consolidated even though BlackRock may not own a majority of such funds. Excluding the impact of the Federal Reserve Bank stock, carried interest, investments made to hedge exposure to certain deferred compensation plans and certain equity investments that are hedged via the seed capital hedging program, the Company’s net economic exposure to its investment portfolio is as follows: (Dollar amounts in millions) December 31,2010 December 31,2009 Variance Amount % Change Total investments, GAAP $ 1,540 $ 1,049 $ 491 47 % Investments held by consolidated sponsored investment funds (397 ) (463 ) 66 14 % Net exposure to consolidated investment funds 260 258 2 1 % Total net “economic” investments 1,403 844 559 66 % Federal Reserve Bank stock (325 ) (10 ) (315 ) * Carried interest (13 ) (4 ) (9 ) 225 % Deferred compensation investments (76 ) (71 ) (5 ) 7 % Hedged investments (25 ) (36 ) 11 (31 %) Total net “economic” investment exposure $ 964 $ 723 $ 241 33 % * – Not applicable or the percentage is in excess of +/- 1,000%. The net “economic” investment exposure of the portfolio is presented in either the equity market price or the interest rate/credit spread risk disclosures below: Equity Market Price Risk At December 31, 2010, the Company’s net exposure to market price risk in its investment portfolio was approximately $544 million of the Company’s net economic investment exposure. Investments that are subject to market price risk include private equity and real estate investments, hedge funds and fund of funds, as well as mutual funds. The Company estimates that a 10% adverse change in market prices would result in a decrease of approximately $54.4 million in the carrying value of such investments. Interest Rate/Credit Spread Risk At December 31, 2010, the Company was exposed to interest-rate risk and credit spread risk as a result of approximately $420 million of investments in debt securities and sponsored investment products that invest primarily in debt securities. Management considered a hypothetical 100 basis point fluctuation in interest rates or credit spreads and estimates that the impact of such a fluctuation on these investments, in the aggregate, would result in a decrease, or increase, of approximately $7 million in the carrying value of such investments. Foreign Exchange Rate Risk As discussed above, the Company invests in sponsored investment products that invest in a variety of asset classes. The carrying value of the net economic investment exposure denominated in foreign currencies, primarily the pound sterling, euro, South Korean won and Taiwan dollars, was $118 million. A 10% adverse change in foreign exchange rates would result in approximately an $11.8 million decline in the carrying value of such investments. 119 Table of Contents",2023-12-30 18:59:08.783239

Management reviews non-GAAP financial measures to assess ongoing operations and, for the reasons described below, considers them to be effective indicators, for both management and investors, of BlackRock’s financial performance over time. BlackRock’s management does not advocate that investors consider such non-GAAP financial measures in isolation from, or as a substitute for, financial information prepared in accordance with GAAP. Computations for all periods are derived from the Company’s consolidated statements of income as follows: (a) Operating income, as adjusted, and operating margin, as adjusted: Operating income, as adjusted, equals operating income, GAAP basis, excluding certain items management deems non-recurring, or transactions that ultimately will not impact BlackRock’s book value, as indicated in the table below. Operating income used for operating margin measurement equals operating income, as adjusted, excluding the impact of closed-end fund launch costs and commissions. Operating margin, as adjusted, equals operating income used for operating margin measurement, divided by revenue used for operating margin measurement, as indicated in the table below. Year ended December 31, (Dollar amounts in millions) 2011 2010 2009 Operating income, GAAP basis $ 3,249 $ 2,998 $ 1,278 Non-GAAP expense adjustments: BGI transaction/integration costs Employee compensation and benefits — 25 60 General and administration — 65 123 Total BGI transaction/integration costs — 90 183 UK lease exit costs 63 — — Restructuring charges 32 — 22 PNC LTIP funding obligation 44 58 59 Merrill Lynch compensation contribution 7 10 10 Compensation expense related to appreciation (depreciation) on deferred compensation plans (3 ) 11 18 Operating income, as adjusted 3,392 3,167 1,570 Closed-end fund launch costs 26 15 2 Closed-end fund launch commissions 3 2 1 Operating income used for operating margin measurement $ 3,421 $ 3,184 $ 1,573 Revenue, GAAP basis $ 9,081 $ 8,612 $ 4,700 Non-GAAP adjustments: Distribution and servicing costs (386 ) (408 ) (477 ) Amortization of deferred sales commissions (81 ) (102 ) (100 ) Revenue used for operating margin measurement $ 8,614 $ 8,102 $ 4,123 Operating margin, GAAP basis 35.8 % 34.8 % 27.2 % Operating margin, as adjusted 39.7 % 39.3 % 38.2 % Management believes operating income, as adjusted, and operating margin, as adjusted, are effective indicators of BlackRock’s financial performance over time and, therefore, provide useful disclosure to investors. 41 Table of Contents Overview (continued) Financial Highlights (continued) Operating income, as adjusted: BGI transaction and integration costs consisted principally of compensation expense, legal fees, marketing and promotional, occupancy and consulting expenses incurred in conjunction with the BGI acquisition from Barclays. Restructuring charges recorded in 2011 and 2009 consisted of compensation costs and professional fees. Restructuring charges in 2009 also included occupancy costs. UK lease exit costs represent costs to exit two locations in London in the third quarter 2011. The portion of compensation expense associated with certain long-term incentive plans (“LTIP”) that has been or will be funded through distributions to participants of shares of BlackRock stock held by PNC and a Merrill Lynch cash compensation contribution, a portion of which has been received, has been excluded because these charges ultimately do not impact BlackRock’s book value. The expense related to the Merrill Lynch cash compensation contribution ceased at the end of the third quarter 2011. Compensation expense associated with appreciation (depreciation) on investments related to certain BlackRock deferred compensation plans has been excluded as returns on investments set aside for these plans, which substantially offset this expense, are reported in non-operating income (expense). Management believes operating income exclusive of these costs is a useful measure in evaluating BlackRock’s operating performance and helps enhance the comparability of this information for the reporting periods presented. Operating margin, as adjusted: Operating income used for measuring operating margin, as adjusted, is equal to operating income, as adjusted, excluding the impact of closed-end fund launch costs and commissions. Management believes the exclusion of such costs and commissions is useful because these costs can fluctuate considerably and revenues associated with the expenditure of these costs will not fully impact the Company’s results until future periods. Operating margin, as adjusted, allows the Company to compare performance from period-to-period by adjusting for items that may not recur, recur infrequently or may have an economic offset in non-operating income., Examples of such adjustments include restructuring charges, BGI transaction and integration costs, UK lease exit costs, closed-end fund launch costs, commissions paid to certain employees as compensation and fluctuations in compensation expense based on mark-to-market movements in investments held to fund certain compensation plans. The Company also uses operating margin, as adjusted, to monitor corporate performance and efficiency and as a benchmark to compare its performance with other companies. Management uses both the GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures in evaluating the financial performance of BlackRock. The non-GAAP measure by itself may pose limitations because it does not include all of the Company’s revenues and expenses. Revenue used for operating margin, as adjusted, excludes distribution and servicing costs paid to related parties and other third parties. Management believes the exclusion of such costs is useful because it creates consistency in the treatment for certain contracts for similar services, which due to the terms of the contracts, are accounted for under GAAP on a net basis within investment advisory, administration fees and securities lending revenue. Amortization of deferred sales commissions is excluded from revenue used for operating margin measurement, as adjusted, because such costs, over time, offset distribution fee revenue earned by the Company. BlackRock excludes from revenue used for operating margin, as adjusted, the costs related to each of these items as a proxy for such offsetting revenues. 42 Table of Contents Overview (continued) Financial Highlights (continued) (b) Non-operating income (expense), less net income (loss) attributable to non-controlling interests, as adjusted: Non-operating income (expense), less net income (loss) attributable to non-controlling interests (“NCI”), as adjusted, equals non-operating income (expense), GAAP basis, less net income (loss) attributable to NCI, GAAP basis, adjusted for compensation expense associated with (appreciation) depreciation on investments related to certain BlackRock deferred compensation plans. The compensation expense offset is recorded in operating income. This compensation expense has been included in non-operating income (expense), less net income (loss) attributable to NCI, as adjusted, to offset returns on investments set aside for these plans, which are reported in non-operating income (expense), GAAP basis. Year endedDecember 31, (Dollar amounts in millions) 2011 2010 2009 Non-operating income (expense), GAAP basis $ (114 ) $ 23 $ (6 ) Less: Net income (loss) attributable to NCI 2 (13 ) 22 Non-operating income (expense) (1) (116 ) 36 (28 ) Compensation expense related to (appreciation) depreciation on deferred compensation plans 3 (11 ) (18 ) Non-operating income (expense), less net income (loss) attributable to NCI, as adjusted $ (113 ) $ 25 $ (46 ) (1) Net of net income (loss) attributable to non-controlling interests. Management believes non-operating income (expense), less net income (loss) attributable to NCI, as adjusted, provides comparability of this information among reporting periods and is an effective measure for reviewing BlackRock’s non-operating contribution to its results. As compensation expense associated with (appreciation) depreciation on investments related to certain deferred compensation plans, which is included in operating income, substantially offsets the gain (loss) on the investments set aside for these plans, management believes non-operating income (expense), less net income (loss) attributable to NCI, as adjusted, provides a useful measure, for both management and investors, of BlackRock’s non-operating results that impact book value. 43 Table of Contents Overview (continued) Financial Highlights (continued) (c) Net income attributable to BlackRock, Inc., as adjusted: Management believes net income attributable to BlackRock, Inc., as adjusted, and diluted earnings per common share, as adjusted, are useful measures of BlackRock’s profitability and financial performance. Net income attributable to BlackRock, Inc., as adjusted, equals net income attributable to BlackRock, Inc., GAAP basis, adjusted for significant non-recurring items, charges that ultimately will not impact BlackRock’s book value or certain tax items that do not impact cash flow.

During the years ended December 31, 2011, 2010 and 2009, adjustments primarily related to a state tax election and certain enacted UK, Japan, US state and local tax legislation, which resulted in the re-measurement of certain deferred income tax liabilities primarily related to acquired indefinite-lived intangible assets. The resulting increase or decrease in income taxes has been excluded from net income attributable to BlackRock, Inc., as adjusted, as these items will not have a cash flow impact and to ensure comparability for periods presented. (d) For the years ended December 31, 2011, 2010 and 2009 non-GAAP adjustments were tax effected at 31.8%, 33% and 30%, respectively, which reflects the blended rate applicable to the adjustments. (e) Non-voting participating preferred shares are considered to be common stock equivalents for purposes of determining basic and diluted earnings per share calculations. Certain unvested restricted stock units are not included in this number as they are deemed participating securities in accordance with required provisions of Accounting Standards Codification 260-10, Earnings per Share. For the years ended December 31, 2011, 2010 and 2009 average outstanding participating securities were 1.8 million, 2.8 million and 3.8 million, respectively. 44 Table of Contents Overview (continued) Financial Highlights (continued) BlackRock has portfolio managers located around the world, including the United States, the United Kingdom, the Netherlands, Japan, Hong Kong, Singapore, Australia and Germany. The Company provides a wide array of products, including passively and actively managed equities, fixed income, multi-asset class, cash management and alternatives. BlackRock offers clients diversified access to global markets through separate accounts, collective investment trusts, open-end and closed-end mutual funds, exchange-traded products, hedge funds, and funds of funds. BlackRock provides global advisory services for private investment funds and retail products. The Company’s non-U.S. investment funds are based in a number of domiciles and cover a range of asset classes, including equities, fixed income, cash management and alternatives. In the United States retail offerings include various open-end and closed-end funds, including iShares, the global product leader in exchange-traded products for institutional, retail and high net worth investors. There are 504 iShares products globally across equities, fixed income and commodities, which trade like common stocks on 20 exchanges worldwide. iShares AUM totaled $593.4 billion at December 31, 2011. The BlackRock Global Funds, the Company’s primary retail fund group offered outside the United States, are authorized for distribution in 35 jurisdictions worldwide. Additional fund offerings include structured products, real estate funds, hedge funds, hedge funds of funds, private equity funds and funds of funds, managed futures funds and exchange funds. These products are sold to both U.S. and non-U.S. high net worth, retail and institutional investors in a wide variety of active and passive strategies covering both equity and fixed income assets. BlackRock’s client base consists of financial institutions and other corporate clients, pension plans, charities, official institutions, such as central banks, sovereign wealth funds, supranational authorities and other government entities, high net worth individuals and retail investors around the world. BlackRock maintains a significant sales and marketing presence both inside and outside the United States that is focused on establishing and maintaining retail and institutional investment management relationships by marketing its services to investors directly and through financial professionals, pension consultants and establishing third-party distribution relationships. BlackRock also distributes its products and services through Merrill Lynch under a global distribution agreement in effect until January 2014. After such term, the agreement will renew for one automatic three-year extension if certain conditions are met. BlackRock derives a substantial portion of its revenue from investment advisory and administration fees, which are recognized as the services are performed. Such fees are primarily based on pre-determined percentages of the market value of AUM or percentages of committed capital during investment periods of certain alternative products and are affected by changes in AUM, including market appreciation or depreciation, foreign exchange translation and net subscriptions or redemptions. Net subscriptions or redemptions represent the sum of new client assets, additional fundings from existing clients (including dividend reinvestment), withdrawals of assets from, and termination of, client accounts and distributions to investors representing return of capital and return on investments to investors. Market appreciation or depreciation includes current income earned on, and changes in the fair value of, securities held in client accounts. Foreign exchange translation reflects the impact of converting non-U.S. dollar denominated AUM into U.S. dollars for reporting purposes. BlackRock also earns revenue by lending securities on behalf of clients, primarily to brokerage institutions. The securities loaned are secured by collateral in the form of cash or securities, with minimums generally ranging from approximately 102% to 112% of the value of the loaned securities. The revenue earned is shared between BlackRock and the funds or other third-party accounts managed by the Company from which the securities are borrowed. Investment advisory agreements for certain separate accounts and investment funds provide for performance fees, based upon relative and/or absolute investment performance, in addition to base fees based on AUM. Investment advisory performance fees generally are earned after a given period of time and when investment performance exceeds a contractual threshold. As such, the timing of recognition of performance fees may increase the volatility of BlackRock’s revenue and earnings. Historically, the magnitude of performance fees in the third and fourth quarters generally exceeds the first two calendar quarters in a year due to the greater number of products with performance measurement periods that end on either September 30 or December 31. 45 Table of Contents Overview (continued) Financial Highlights (continued) BlackRock provides a variety of risk management, investment analytic and investment system and advisory services to financial institutions, pension funds, asset managers, foundations, consultants, mutual fund sponsors, real estate investment trusts and government agencies. These services are provided under the brand name BlackRock Solutions and include a wide array of risk management services, valuation services related to illiquid securities, disposition and workout assignments (including long-term portfolio liquidation assignments), strategic planning and execution, and enterprise investment system outsourcing to clients. Approximately $10 trillion of positions are processed on the Company’s Aladdin operating platform, which serves as the investment/ risk solutions system for BlackRock and other institutional investors. Fees earned for BlackRock Solutions and advisory services are determined using some, or all, of the following methods: (i) fixed fees, (ii) percentages of various attributes of advisory AUM or value of positions on the Aladdin platform and (iii) performance fees if contractual thresholds are met. BlackRock builds upon its leadership position to meet the growing need for investment and risk management solutions. Through its scale and diversity of products, it is able to provide its clients with customized solutions including fiduciary outsourcing for liability-driven investments and overlay strategies for pension plan sponsors, balance sheet management and related services for insurance companies and target date and target return funds, as well as asset allocation portfolios, for retail investors. BlackRock is also able to service these clients via its Aladdin platform to provide risk management and other outsourcing services for institutional investors and custom and tailored solutions to address complex risk exposures. The Company earns fees for transition management services comprised of commissions from acting as an introducing broker-dealer in buying and selling securities on behalf of its customers. Commissions related to transition management services are recorded on a trade-date basis as securities transactions occur. Operating expenses reflect employee compensation and benefits, distribution and servicing costs, amortization of deferred sales commissions, direct fund expenses, general and administration expenses and amortization of finite-lived intangible assets. • Employee compensation and benefits expense includes salaries, commissions, temporary help, deferred and incentive compensation, employer payroll taxes and related benefit costs. • Distribution and servicing costs, which are primarily AUM driven, include payments made to Merrill Lynch-affiliated entities under a global distribution agreement, to PNC and Barclays, as well as other third parties, primarily associated with obtaining and retaining client investments in certain BlackRock products. • Direct fund expenses primarily consist of third party non-advisory expenses incurred by BlackRock related to certain funds for the use of index trademarks, reference data for indices, custodial services, fund administration, fund accounting, transfer agent services, shareholder reporting services, legal expenses, audit and tax services as well as other fund related expenses directly attributable to the non-advisory operations of the fund. These expenses may vary over time with fluctuations in AUM, number of shareholder accounts, or other attributes directly related to volume of business. • General and administration expenses include marketing and promotional, occupancy and office-related costs, portfolio services (including clearing expenses related to transition management services), technology, professional services, communications, closed-end fund launch costs and other general and administration expenses, including foreign currency remeasurement costs. Non-operating income (expense) includes the effect of changes in the valuations on investments (excluding available-for-sale investments) and earnings on equity method investments, as well as interest and dividend income and interest expense. Other comprehensive income includes changes in valuations related to available-for-sale investments. BlackRock primarily holds seed and co-investments in sponsored investment products that invest in a variety of asset classes, including private equity, distressed credit/mortgage debt securities, hedge funds and real estate. Investments generally are made for co-investment purposes, to establish a performance track record, to hedge exposure to certain deferred compensation plans, or for regulatory purposes, including Federal Reserve Bank stock. BlackRock does not engage in proprietary trading or other investment activities that could conflict with the interests of its clients. In addition, non-operating income (expense) includes the impact of changes in the valuations of consolidated sponsored investment funds and consolidated collateralized loan obligations.

(4) Foreign exchange reflects the impact of converting non-U.S. dollar denominated AUM into U.S. dollars for reporting purposes. (5) Advisory AUM represents long-term portfolio liquidation assignments. AUM decreased approximately $48.3 billion, or 1%, to $3.513 trillion at December 31, 2011 from $3.561 trillion at December 31, 2010. The decline in AUM was primarily attributable to $34.6 billion in net market and foreign exchange valuation declines, $29.9 billion of advisory distributions and $22.9 billion of cash management net outflows, partially offset by $67.3 billion of long-term net new business, before giving effect to the final BGI merger-related outflows of $28.3 billion recorded in the first half of 2011. Net market depreciation of $27.5 billion included $128.1 billion of depreciation in equity products resulting from the decline in global equity, partially offset by appreciation in fixed income products of $100.7 billion. The $7.1 billion net decrease in AUM from converting non-U.S. dollar denominated AUM into U.S. dollars was primarily due to the strengthening of the U.S. dollar against the euro, pound sterling and Canadian dollar, partially offset by weakening of the U.S. dollar against the Japanese yen. Business Outlook The diversity of the Company’s business model, which offers a significant breadth of asset classes along with alpha and beta management styles, and its global reach, allows BlackRock to capture asset flows as investor sentiment shifts. BlackRock finished 2011 with strong index flows as clients continued to rebalance their portfolios from active products due to volatile market conditions. BlackRock expects such conditions to continue into 2012 due to the European sovereign debt crisis, global political elections in 2012, and continued unrest in the Middle East. 49 Table of Contents Business Outlook (continued) In early 2012, BlackRock continues to see signs of economic strength in the U.S. as the pace of expansion accelerates and the unemployment rate declines. During 2012, BlackRock expects emerging economies to outperform, while the U.S. and Japan grow at lower rates and Europe faces a slow economic recovery. BlackRock will actively monitor global monetary policies (including quantitative easing and the direction of interest rates), bank lending policies, the Euro crisis, global political elections, and the U.S. debt ceiling and housing market along with the effects on global corporate earnings growth. The Company offers a broad range of equity, fixed income, multi-asset and alternative products designed to track various indices, target returns in excess of specified benchmarks or focus on absolute returns. BlackRock’s broad set of product offerings, risk skills and tools allow the Company to work with clients in meeting their investment objectives over both short- and long-term horizons. While investing for stable income continues to be a core objective of many clients, BlackRock expects clients to trend towards indexing, retirement and income, alternatives and multi-asset class solutions along with risk management tools and advisory services. The following items could impact the Company’s results in 2012 and beyond: AUM and Flows • As investors shift preferences between asset classes, and active and passive investment styles, the Company’s broad product profile, including a wide array of offerings in asset types and management styles, should enable it to retain and capture revenue. As equity markets improve and with no sign of rising interest rates from their historic lows in the near term, BlackRock expects clients who in the latter half of 2011 were delaying investment decisions, to re-risk into beta and alpha equity and alternative products. • BlackRock’s unique combination of index and active capabilities positions it well to assist companies in narrowing the gap on underfunded pension plans by implementing barbell strategies using a combination of index, alpha and alternative products. In addition, as retirement money moves away from defined benefit plans into defined contributions plans and ultimately to individuals, BlackRock is well positioned to offer individual investment options with its LifePath® target date portfolios and wide array of ETFs and other mutual fund products. • BlackRock has a leading global market share in exchange-traded products (“ETP”) due to its large array of products and AUM in this market. The global growth of the ETP market reflects both continued adoption and new product introduction with investor product preferences driven to varying degrees by performance (as measured by tracking error, which is the difference between net returns on the ETP and the corresponding targeted index), liquidity (bid-ask spread), tax-efficiency, transparency and client service. Industry asset growth has historically been linked to positive markets, with investors looking to capitalize on strong market returns. In the continued environment of ultra-low interest rates, industry flows shifted toward fixed income oriented products and, within equities, to developed markets and away from broad and single-country emerging market funds. Additional asset managers may enter the marketplace and offer similar exchange-traded products at lower fee structures; however, the Company believes that many factors beyond pricing influence investor preferences. • BlackRock believes alternative products will become more important for both institutional and retail clients to invest in alpha-generating products to generate higher returns. The Company significantly invested in its alternatives platform during 2011 for products expected to be introduced in 2012, which will invest in private equity, renewable power, real estate as well as other opportunistic asset classes. • Cash management assets may continue to decline from year-end levels if clients begin to re-risk their portfolios in search of yield or equity return opportunities as rates remain low, including those in the U.S. as the Federal Reserve currently expects U.S. rates to remain low until 2014. The Company’s diversified global product offerings, client service and independent advice may enable it to retain a portion of these assets. Regulatory Reform • The regulatory environment in 2011 continued to evolve for financial institutions as well as money market funds with the intent of the reform supported by BlackRock, to protect the industry and our clients. Regulatory reform continues to evolve and may affect the competitive environment, including liquidity and trading costs, and may provide BlackRock and its clients with risks as well as opportunities. 50 Table of Contents Business Outlook (continued) Performance fees and BRS/advisory fees • While most of BlackRock’s absolute return AUM products eligible for performance fees are marginally below “high water marks”, a return to higher market levels may enable the Company’s alternative investment products to contribute additional performance fee revenue. • The sovereign uncertainty in 2011 across Europe and an increasing focus on risk management led to unique opportunities for BlackRock’s risk tools and advisory services, combining the Company’s extensive capital markets and structuring expertise with rigorous modeling and analytical capabilities across an increasingly global client base. In 2012, the Company expects continuing strong global demand for its Aladdin operating platform and its comprehensive risk reporting from sophisticated institutional investors and governmental agencies investing in longer term risk management solutions as well as strong demand for financial market advisory services. Future opportunities • The Company plans to continue to invest in its people, its platform and its global BlackRock brand. In addition, it will build out key products and geographic locations as well as an internal trading platform on its enterprise systems to cross trades within its platform and potentially among other client transactions, which is expected to result in lower portfolio transaction costs and ultimately increased performance returns for clients. 51 Table of Contents Operating results for the year ended December 31, 2011 compared with the year ended December 31, 2010 Operating Income and Operating Margin Overview GAAP Year endedDecember 31, Variance (Dollar amounts in millions) 2011 2010 Amount % Change Revenue $ 9,081 $ 8,612 $ 469 5 % Expenses 5,832 5,614 218 4 % Operating income $ 3,249 $ 2,998 $ 251 8 % Operating margin 35.8 % 34.8 % 1.0 % 3 % The increase in operating income and operating margin for the year ended December 31, 2011 was attributable to the $469 million increase in revenue primarily due to higher base fees associated with growth in long-term average AUM, which included the benefit of higher average markets and the benefit of net new business, and higher BlackRock Solutions and advisory revenue, partially offset by lower performance fees. The increase in revenue was partially offset by a $218 million net increase in operating expenses related to business growth, including an increase in the number of employees, professional fees and average long-dated AUM growth, which affects certain expenses, including direct fund expenses. In addition, operating income and operating margin for the year ended December 31, 2011 included $63 million of UK lease exit costs related to the Company’s exit from two London locations and $32 million of restructuring charges. Operating income and operating margin for the year ended December 31, 2010 included $90 million of BGI integration costs. Each of these items are excluded from the as adjusted results below.

The increase was partially offset by a $169 million decrease in performance fees primarily reflecting lower fees from hedge funds and a $16 million decrease in distribution fees. 53 Table of Contents Operating results for the year ended December 31, 2011 compared with the year ended December 31, 2010 (continued) Revenue (continued) Investment Advisory, Administration Fees and Securities Lending Revenue. Investment advisory, administration fees and securities lending revenues increased $606 million to $7,896 million for the year ended December 31, 2011 from $7,290 million for the year ended December 31, 2010. This growth primarily reflected growth in average long-term AUM, which included the benefit of net new business, partially offset by a decline in fees from cash management products due to lower average AUM and higher fee waivers. Securities lending fees were $397 million for the year ended December 31, 2011 compared with $325 million for year ended December 31, 2010, reflecting an increase in average balances of securities on loan and higher lending rates.

The decrease was partially offset by higher performance fees due to strong relative performance from regional/country and global equity strategies. BlackRock Solutions and Advisory. BlackRock Solutions and advisory revenue for the year ended December 31, 2011 increased $50 million, or 11%, from the year ended December 31, 2010, primarily due to on-going and additional Aladdin mandates and advisory assignments. Distribution Fees. Distribution fees of $100 million for the year ended December 31, 2011 decreased $16 million from $116 million for the year ended December 31, 2010, primarily due to lower AUM in certain share classes of BlackRock Funds. 55 Table of Contents Operating results for the year ended December 31, 2011 compared with the year ended December 31, 2010 (continued) Expenses Year endedDecember 31, Variance (Dollar amounts in millions) 2011 2010 Amount % Change Expenses: Employee compensation and benefits $ 3,199 $ 3,097 $ 102 3 % Distribution and servicing costs 386 408 (22 ) (5 %) Amortization of deferred sales commissions 81 102 (21 ) (21 %) Direct fund expenses 563 493 70 14 % General and administration 1,415 1,354 61 5 % Restructuring charges 32 — 32 * Amortization of intangible assets 156 160 (4 ) (3 %) Total expenses, GAAP $ 5,832 $ 5,614 $ 218 4 % Total expenses, GAAP $ 5,832 $ 5,614 $ 218 4 % Less non-GAAP expense adjustments: BGI integration costs Employee compensation and benefits — 25 (25 ) (100 %) General and administration — 65 (65 ) (100 %) Total BGI integration costs — 90 (90 ) (100 %) UK lease exit costs 63 — 63 * Restructuring charges 32 — 32 * PNC LTIP funding obligation 44 58 (14 ) (24 %) Merrill Lynch compensation contribution 7 10 (3 ) (30 %) Compensation expense related to appreciation (depreciation) on deferred compensation plans (3 ) 11 (14 ) * Total non-GAAP expense adjustments 143 169 (26 ) (15 %) Total expenses, as adjusted $ 5,689 $ 5,445 $ 244 4 % * – Not applicable.

Excluding certain items deemed non-recurring by management or transactions that ultimately will not affect the Company’s book value, total expenses, as adjusted, increased $244 million, or 4%. The increase in total expenses, as adjusted, is primarily attributable to increases in employee compensation and benefits, direct fund expenses and general and administration expenses, partially offset by a reduction in distribution and servicing costs and amortization of deferred sales commissions. 56 Table of Contents Operating results for the year ended December 31, 2011 compared with the year ended December 31, 2010 (continued) Expenses (continued) Employee Compensation and Benefits Year endedDecember 31, Variance (Dollar amounts in millions) 2011 2010 Amount % Change Employee compensation and benefits, GAAP $ 3,199 $ 3,097 $ 102 3 % Less non-GAAP expense adjustments: BGI integration costs — 25 (25 ) (100 %) PNC LTIP funding obligation 44 58 (14 ) (24 %) Merrill Lynch compensation contribution 7 10 (3 ) (30 %) Compensation expense related to appreciation (depreciation) on deferred compensation plans (3 ) 11 (14 ) * Total non-GAAP expense adjustments 48 104 (56 ) (54 %) Employee compensation and benefits, as adjusted $ 3,151 $ 2,993 $ 158 5 % * – Not applicable. Employee compensation and benefits expense increased $102 million, or 3%, to $3,199 million, for the year ended December 31, 2011 from $3,097 million for the year ended December 31, 2010. Employees at December 31, 2011 totaled approximately 10,100 as compared to approximately 9,100 at December 31, 2010. Employee compensation and benefits, as adjusted, increased by $158 million, reflecting a $164 million increase in base salaries due to an increase in the number of employees and salary levels, and a $41 million increase in other compensation, including payroll taxes, benefits, and commissions. These increases were partially offset by a $47 million decrease in incentive compensation. Distribution and Servicing Costs. Distribution and servicing costs decreased $22 million to $386 million for the year ended December 31, 2011 from $408 million for the year ended December 31, 2010. These costs include payments to Bank of America/Merrill Lynch under a global distribution agreement, PNC and Barclays, as well as other third parties, primarily associated with the distribution and servicing of client investments in certain BlackRock products. The $22 million decrease related to lower cash management-related costs of $45 million, reflecting lower average AUM and higher yield-support waivers resulting in lower levels of distribution costs, partially offset by higher costs due to increases in average AUM for open-end and closed-end funds, separate accounts and variable annuities. Distribution and servicing costs for the year ended December 31, 2011 included $207 million of costs attributable to Bank of America/Merrill Lynch and affiliates, and $3 million of costs attributable to PNC and affiliates as compared to $246 million and $10 million, respectively, in the year ended December 31, 2010. Distribution and servicing costs related to other third parties, including Barclays, increased $24 million to $176 million for the year ended December 31, 2011 from $152 million for the year ended December 31, 2010 due to an expansion of distribution platforms and higher long-term AUM. Amortization of Deferred Sales Commissions. Amortization of deferred sales commissions decreased $21 million to $81 million for the year ended December 31, 2011 from $102 million for the year ended December 31, 2010. Lower sales in certain share classes of U.S. open-end mutual funds contributed to the decline. Direct Fund Expenses. Direct fund expenses increased $70 million reflecting growth in average AUM for the funds (predominately iShares) where BlackRock pays certain non-advisory expenses of the funds. 57 Table of Contents Operating results for the year ended December 31, 2011 compared with the year ended December 31, 2010 (continued) Expenses (continued) General and Administration Expenses Year endedDecember 31, Variance (Dollar amounts in millions) 2011 2010 Amount % Change General and administration expenses, GAAP: Marketing and promotional $ 315 $ 328 $ (13 ) (4 %) Occupancy and office related 373 317 56 18 % Portfolio services 189 177 12 7 % Technology 146 152 (6 ) (4 %) Professional services 139 115 24 21 % Communications 40 49 (9 ) (18 %) Regulatory, filing and license fees 16 34 (18 ) (53 %) Charitable contributions 7 26 (19 ) (73 %) Closed-end fund launch costs 26 15 11 73 % Other general and administration 164 141 23 16 % Total general and administration expenses, GAAP $ 1,415 $ 1,354 $ 61 5 % Less non-GAAP adjustments: Marketing and promotional $ — $ 33 $ (33 ) (100 %) Occupancy and office related 63 12 51 425 % Technology — 2 (2 ) (100 %) Professional services — 12 (12 ) (100 %) Other general and administration — 6 (6 ) (100 %) Total non-GAAP adjustments $ 63 $ 65 $ (2 ) (3 %) General and administration expenses, as adjusted: Marketing and promotional $ 315 $ 295 $ 20 7 % Occupancy and office related 310 305 5 2 % Portfolio services 189 177 12 7 % Technology 146 150 (4 ) (3 %) Professional services 139 103 36 35 % Communications 40 49 (9 ) (18 %) Regulatory, filing and license fees 16 34 (18 ) (53 %) Charitable contributions 7 26 (19 ) (73 %) Closed-end fund launch costs 26 15 11 73 % Other general and administration 164 135 29 21 % Total general and administration expenses, as adjusted $ 1,352 $ 1,289 $ 63 5 % (1) Data reflects certain reclassifications of prior period data to conform to the current period presentation. General and Administration Expenses, GAAP. General and administration expenses increased $61 million, or 5%, to $1,415 million for the year ended December 31, 2011 from $1,354 million for year ended December 31, 2010. Higher occupancy and office-related expenses (including $63 million of UK lease exit costs), higher professional services costs and other general and administration expenses contributed to the overall net increase in general and administration expenses. The $23 million increase in other general and administration expenses reflected higher VAT expense and recruiting costs in 2011 offset by the non-recurrence of other general and administration provisions recorded in 2010 related to an outstanding loan to Anthracite Capital Inc. The increase in general and administration expenses, GAAP was partially offset by decreases in charitable contributions and regulatory, filing and licenses fees, primarily due to a $20 million 2010 U.K. industry regulatory assessment. Non-GAAP Adjustments. The year ended December 31, 2011 general and administration expenses included $63 million of UK lease exit costs related to the Company’s exit from two London locations. The year ended December 31, 2010 general and administration expenses included $65 million of BGI integration costs primarily consisting of marketing and promotional costs, professional services and occupancy costs. 58 Table of Contents Operating results for the year ended December 31, 2011 compared with the year ended December 31, 2010 (continued) Expenses (continued) General and Administration Expenses, as Adjusted. Excluding the UK lease exit costs and BGI integration expenses, general and administration expenses, as adjusted, of $1,352 million increased $63 million, or 5%, for the year ended December 31, 2011 from $1,289 million for the year ended December 31, 2010. See general and administration expenses, GAAP, above for discussion on the increase in general and administration expenses and for items offsetting the overall increase in general and administration expenses, as adjusted. In addition, general and administration expenses, as adjusted, reflected higher marketing and promotional costs in 2011. Restructuring Charges. For the year ended December 31, 2011, BlackRock recorded pre-tax restructuring charges of $32 million, primarily related to severance, accelerated amortization of certain previously granted stock awards, and legal and outplacement costs, associated with a reduction in work force and reengineering efforts. 59 Table of Contents Non-operating results for the year ended December 31, 2011 compared with the year ended December 31, 2010 Non-Operating Income (Expense), Less Net Income (Loss) Attributable to Non-Controlling Interests Non-operating income (expense), less net income (loss) attributable to non-controlling interests for the years ended December 31, 2011 and 2010 was as follows: Year endedDecember 31, (Dollar amounts in millions) 2011 2010 $ Change Non-operating income (expense), GAAP basis $ (114 ) $ 23 $ (137 ) Less: Net income (loss) attributable to NCI(1) 2 (13 ) 15 Non-operating income (expense)(2) (116 ) 36 (152 ) Compensation expense related to (appreciation) depreciation on deferred compensation plans 3 (11 ) 14 Non-operating income (expense), as adjusted(2) $ (113 ) $ 25 $ (138 ) (1) Amount includes an $18 million loss and a $35 million loss attributable to consolidated variable interest entities for the year ended December 31, 2011 and 2010, respectively.

Non-operating expense, less net income (loss) attributable to non-controlling interests, decreased $152 million to $116 million for the year ended December 31, 2011 compared with $36 million of net non-operating income for the year ended December 31, 2010. The year ended December 31, 2011 included $142 million of net interest expense, partially offset by $26 million of net positive marks primarily on private equity and real estate fund co-investments, partially offset by net negative marks in distressed credit/mortgage fund co-investments. Net gains on co-investments and seed investments decreased $117 million during the year ended December 31, 2011, primarily due a reduction in values on distressed credit/mortgage funds and hedge funds/funds of hedge funds compared with an increase in values in the prior year. Net interest expense was $142 million, an increase of $21 million from the prior year. The increase reflected the May 2011 issuance of $1.5 billion of long-term debt in connection with the repurchase of Bank of America’s remaining ownership interest in BlackRock, partially offset by higher interest and dividend income. 60 Table of Contents Non-operating results for the year ended December 31, 2011 compared with the year ended December 31, 2010 (continued) Income Tax Expense GAAPYear endedDecember 31, As adjustedYear endedDecember 31, (Dollar amounts in millions) 2011 2010 %Change 2011 2010 %Change Income before income taxes(1) $ 3,133 $ 3,034 3 % $ 3,279 $ 3,192 3 % Income tax expense $ 796 $ 971 (18 %) $ 1,040 $ 1,053 (1 %) Effective tax rate 25.4 % 32.0 % 31.7 % 33.0 % (1) Net of net income (loss) attributable to non-controlling interests.

The as adjusted effective tax rate of 31.7% for the year ended December 31, 2011 included the $24 million benefit mentioned above and excluded the $198 million of net non-cash tax benefits due to a state tax election and enacted U.K., Japan, U.S. state and local tax legislation. The GAAP effective tax rate for the year ended December 31, 2010 included a $30 million non-cash tax benefit related to the revaluation of certain net deferred income tax liabilities primarily related to acquired intangible assets due to enacted U.K. tax legislation. In addition, the year ended December 31, 2010 included the effect of favorable tax rulings and the resolution of certain outstanding tax positions. The as adjusted effective tax rate of 33.0% for the year ended December 31, 2010 excluded the $30 million non-cash tax benefit mentioned above. The Company’s tax rate is affected by tax rates in foreign jurisdictions and the relative amount of income earned in those jurisdictions, which the Company expects to be fairly consistent in the near term. The significant foreign jurisdictions, which have lower statutory tax rates than the U.S. federal statutory rate of 35%, include the United Kingdom, Luxembourg, Canada and the Netherlands. U.S. income taxes were not provided for certain undistributed foreign earnings intended to be indefinitely reinvested outside the United States. 61 Table of Contents Operating results for the year ended December 31, 2011 compared with the year ended December 31, 2010 (continued) Net Income Attributable to BlackRock, Inc.

(5) Foreign exchange reflects the impact of converting non-U.S. dollar denominated AUM into U.S. dollars for reporting purposes. (6) Advisory AUM represents long-term portfolio liquidation assignments. AUM increased approximately $214.7 billion, or 6%, to $3.561 trillion at December 31, 2010 from $3.346 trillion at December 31, 2009. The growth in AUM was primarily attributable to $267.0 billion in net market appreciation, $131.2 billion of net subscriptions in long-term mandates and a $17.1 billion increase due to foreign exchange movements, partially offset by $127 billion of BGI merger-related outflows (due to manager concentration considerations and active equity quantitative performance) and acquisition adjustments, $61.4 billion of net outflows in cash management products and $12.0 billion of net client distributions in advisory assignments. Net market appreciation of $267.0 billion included $190.7 billion of net appreciation in equity products due to an increase in global equity markets, $55.4 billion in fixed income products due to current income and changes in interest rate spreads, $13.9 billion in multi-asset class products, and $7.2 billion in alternatives, primarily due to appreciation in precious metals, including silver and gold. The $17.1 billion net increase in AUM from converting non-U.S. dollar denominated AUM into U.S. dollars was primarily due to the weakening of the U.S. dollar against the Japanese yen, Canadian dollar and Australian dollar, partially offset by the strengthening of the U.S. dollar against the euro and pound sterling. 64 Table of Contents Operating results for the year ended December 31, 2010 compared with the year ended December 31, 2009 (continued) Operating Income and Operating Margin Overview GAAP Year endedDecember 31, Variance (Dollar amounts in millions) 2010 2009 Amount % Change Revenue $ 8,612 $ 4,700 $ 3,912 83 % Expenses 5,614 3,422 2,192 64 % Operating income $ 2,998 $ 1,278 $ 1,720 135 % Operating margin 34.8 % 27.2 % 7.6 % 28 % Operating income and operating margin for the year ended December 31, 2010 included the full year effect of revenue and expenses related to the December 1, 2009 acquisition of BGI and $90 million of BGI integration costs compared with $183 million of BGI transaction/integration costs for the year ended December 31, 2009. The transaction/integration expenses were not part of BlackRock’s on-going business and are principally comprised of compensation expense, legal fees, advisory payments, occupancy costs, marketing and promotional and consulting expenses. The increase in the operating income for the year ended December 31, 2010 is attributable to the $3.9 billion increase in revenue primarily related to an increase in base and performance fees associated with the AUM acquired in the BGI Transaction and growth in long-term AUM, which included market appreciation and net new business, partially offset by a $2.2 billion net increase in operating expenses related to increases in employee compensation and benefits, general and administrative expenses and direct fund expenses due to the BGI Transaction. The increase in the operating margin for year ended December 31, 2010 included the positive effects of synergies related to the BGI Transaction, growth in long-term AUM driven by market appreciation, a $93 million decrease in BGI transaction/integration costs, a decline of $22 million in restructuring charges and a $17 million change in foreign currency remeasurement costs/benefits. Higher employee compensation and benefits expense, general and administrative expenses and direct fund expenses as well as increased investments to grow the business partially offset the increase in operating margin.

The increase in the operating margin, as adjusted, for the year ended December 31, 2010 included the benefit of synergies related to the BGI Transaction and growth in long-term AUM driven by market appreciation.

Investment Advisory, Administration Fees and Securities Lending Revenue. Investment advisory, administration fees and securities lending revenues increased $3,464 million to $7,290 million for the year ended December 31, 2010 from $3,826 million for the year ended December 31, 2009. The increase primarily related to fees earned on products acquired in the BGI acquisition as well as organic growth in long-term AUM due to market appreciation and net new business, which included securities lending revenue of $325 million for the year ended December 31, 2010 compared with $36 million for the year ended December 31, 2009. Performance Fees. Investment advisory performance fees increased $338 million, or 167%, to $540 million for the year ended December 31, 2010 from $202 million for the year ended December 31, 2009, primarily due to an increase in performance fees earned upon exceeding absolute investment or relative investment return thresholds on alternative multi-strategy, fixed income and equity hedge funds and separate accounts across regional/country equity strategies, fixed income and multi-asset class products. 66 Table of Contents Operating results for the year ended December 31, 2010 compared with the year ended December 31, 2009 (continued) Revenue (continued) BlackRock Solutions and Advisory. BlackRock Solutions and advisory revenue for the year ended December 31, 2010 decreased $17 million, or 4%, from the year ended December 31, 2009. The decrease was primarily due to a decline in non-recurring advisory assignments, as well as the effect of a decline in advisory AUM due to distributions in portfolio liquidation assignments, which have AUM-based fees, partially offset by additional Aladdin, risk management solutions and investment accounting mandates. Revenue earned on advisory assignments was comprised of advisory and portfolio structuring assignment fees and ongoing fees based on AUM of the respective portfolio assignments. Distribution Fees. Distribution fees of $116 million for the year ended December 31, 2010 increased $16 million from $100 million for the year ended December 31, 2009. The increase primarily reflected higher AUM in certain share classes of BlackRock Funds. Other Revenue. Other revenue of $206 million for the year ended December 31, 2010 increased $111 million from $95 million for the year ended December 31, 2009. The increase in other revenue primarily resulted from a $52 million increase in fees, which excludes related portfolio service costs, earned for transition management services due to an increase in transactions to execute transitions of equity and fixed income mandates, a $25 million increase in marketing fees earned from Barclays for services to distribute Barclays iPath® products and $12 million increase for custody fees earned on LifePath products (a portion of which is paid to a third party sub-custodian and reflected within direct fund expenses). 67 Table of Contents Operating results for the year ended December 31, 2010 compared with the year ended December 31, 2009 (continued) Expenses Year endedDecember 31, Variance (Dollar amounts in millions) 2010 2009 Amount % Change Expenses: Employee compensation and benefits $ 3,097 $ 1,802 $ 1,295 72 % Distribution and servicing costs 408 477 (69 ) (14 %) Amortization of deferred sales commissions 102 100 2 2 % Direct fund expenses 493 95 398 419 % General and administration 1,354 779 575 74 % Restructuring charges — 22 (22 ) (100 %) Amortization of intangible assets 160 147 13 9 % Total expenses, GAAP $ 5,614 $ 3,422 $ 2,192 64 % Total expenses, GAAP $ 5,614 $ 3,422 $ 2,192 64 % Less non-GAAP expense adjustments: BGI transaction/integration costs Employee compensation and benefits 25 60 (35 ) (58 %) General and administration 65 123 (58 ) (47 %) Total BGI transaction/integration costs 90 183 (93 ) (51 %) PNC LTIP funding obligation 58 59 (1 ) (2 %) Merrill Lynch compensation contribution 10 10 — — % Restructuring charges — 22 (22 ) (100 %) Compensation expense related to appreciation (depreciation) on deferred compensation plans 11 18 (7 ) (39 %) Total non-GAAP expense adjustments 169 292 (123 ) (42 %) Total expenses, as adjusted $ 5,445 $ 3,130 $ 2,315 74 % Total GAAP expenses increased $2,192 million, or 64%, to $5,614 million for the year ended December 31, 2010 from $3,422 million for the year ended December 31, 2009.

The increase in total expenses, as adjusted, was primarily attributable to the BGI Transaction including increases in employee compensation and benefits, general and administration expenses and direct fund expenses, partially offset by a reduction of distribution and servicing costs. 68 Table of Contents Operating results for the year ended December 31, 2010 compared with the year ended December 31, 2009 (continued) Expenses (continued) Employee Compensation and Benefits Year endedDecember 31, Variance (Dollar amounts in millions) 2010 2009 Amount % Change Employee compensation and benefits, GAAP $ 3,097 $ 1,802 $ 1,295 72 % Less non-GAAP expense adjustments: BGI transaction/integration costs 25 60 (35 ) (58 %) PNC LTIP funding obligation 58 59 (1 ) (2 %) Merrill Lynch compensation contribution 10 10 — — % Compensation expense related to appreciation (depreciation) on deferred compensation plans 11 18 (7 ) (39 %) Total non-GAAP expense adjustments 104 147 (43 ) (29 %) Employee compensation and benefits, as adjusted $ 2,993 $ 1,655 $ 1,338 81 % Employees at December 31, 2010 totaled approximately 9,100 as compared to approximately 8,600 at December 31, 2009. Employee compensation and benefits, as adjusted, increased by $1,338 million excluding the $43 million decrease in non-GAAP adjustments primarily related to lower BGI integration costs. The $1,338 million increase in employee compensation and benefits expense for the year ended December 31, 2010 was attributable to a $721 million increase in incentive compensation and a $617 million increase in salaries, benefits, payroll taxes, temporary help and commissions. The increase in incentive compensation is primarily associated with the increase in operating income after excluding the BGI integration costs, a $132 million increase in stock-based compensation expense related to the effect of additional grants to a larger number of employees at the end of January 2010. The $617 million increase in salaries, benefits and payroll taxes reflected an increase in the number of employees primarily resulting from the BGI Transaction as well as growth in number of employees subsequent to the BGI Transaction. Distribution and Servicing Costs. Distribution and servicing costs decreased $69 million to $408 million for the year ended December 31, 2010 from $477 million for the year ended December 31, 2009. These costs include payments to Bank of America/Merrill Lynch under a global distribution agreement, PNC and Barclays, as well as other third parties, primarily associated with the distribution and servicing of client investments in certain BlackRock products. The $69 million decrease primarily related to lower levels of distribution payments due to lower levels of average cash management AUM and a decrease of costs due to an increase in advisory fee waivers for certain cash management funds serviced by Merrill Lynch. Distribution and servicing costs for the year ended December 31, 2010 included $246 million of costs attributable to Bank of America/Merrill Lynch and affiliates, and $10 million of costs attributable to PNC and affiliates compared with $349 million and $19 million of costs, respectively, in the year ended December 31, 2009. Distribution and servicing costs related to other third parties, including Barclays, increased $43 million to $152 million for the year ended December 31, 2010 from $109 million for the year ended December 31, 2009 due to an expansion of distribution platforms and higher long-term AUM. Amortization of Deferred Sales Commissions. Amortization of deferred sales commissions increased $2 million to $102 million for the year ended December 31, 2010 from $100 million for the year ended December 31, 2009. Direct Fund Expenses. Direct fund expenses increased $398 million primarily related to the addition of legacy BGI funds subject to arrangements under which BlackRock pays certain fund expenses. 69 Table of Contents Operating results for the year ended December 31, 2010 compared with the year ended December 31, 2009 (continued) Expenses (continued) General and Administration Expenses Year endedDecember 31, Variance (Dollar amounts in millions) 2010 2009 Amount % Change General and administration expenses(1), GAAP: Marketing and promotional $ 328 $ 85 $ 243 286 % Occupancy and office related 317 182 135 74 % Portfolio services 177 100 77 77 % Technology 152 114 38 33 % Professional services 115 162 (47 ) (29 %) Communications 49 26 23 88 % Regulatory, filing and license fees 34 5 29 580 % Charitable contributions 26 2 24 * Closed-end fund launch costs 15 2 13 650 % Other general and administration 141 101 40 40 % Total general and administration expenses, GAAP $ 1,354 $ 779 $ 575 74 % Less BGI transaction and integration costs: Marketing and promotional $ 33 $ 11 $ 22 200 % Occupancy and office related 12 1 11 * Technology 2 7 (5 ) (71 %) Professional services 12 91 (79 ) (87 %) Other general and administration 6 13 (7 ) (54 %) Total BGI transaction and integration costs $ 65 $ 123 $ (58 ) (47 %) General and administration expenses, as adjusted: Marketing and promotional $ 295 $ 74 $ 221 299 % Occupancy and office related 305 181 124 69 % Portfolio services 177 100 77 77 % Technology 150 107 43 40 % Professional services 103 71 32 45 % Communications 49 26 23 88 % Regulatory, filing and license fees 34 5 29 580 % Charitable contributions 26 2 24 * Closed-end fund launch costs 15 2 13 650 % Other general and administration 135 88 47 53 % Total general and administration expenses, as adjusted $ 1,289 $ 656 $ 633 96 % * – Not applicable.

General and administration expenses increased $575 million, or 74%, for the year ended December 31, 2010 from the year ended December 31, 2009, primarily due to the BGI Transaction. BGI Transaction and Integration Costs. BGI integration costs of $65 million for the year ended December 31, 2010 decreased $58 million from the year ended December 31, 2009 primarily due to advisory and legal costs incurred for the year ended December 31, 2009, partially offset by higher re-branding costs in 2010. 70 Table of Contents Operating results for the year ended December 31, 2010 compared with the year ended December 31, 2009 (continued) Expenses (continued) General and Administration Expenses (continued) General and Administration Expenses, as Adjusted • Marketing and promotional expenses increased $221 million, primarily due to an increase in global and exchange-traded fund marketing expenses, which included travel, promotional and rebranding and advertising expenses. • Occupancy and office-related expenses increased $124 million primarily related to the expansion of the Company due to the BGI Transaction, including expenses related to Drapers Gardens and an increase in lease impairments as a result of vacating certain locations in the year ended December 31, 2010. • Portfolio service costs increased $77 million, due to an increase in market data and research expenses as well as transition management execution and clearing expenses. • Technology expenses increased $43 million primarily due to an increase in software licensing and maintenance and hardware depreciation expenses. • Professional services increased $32 million primarily related to consulting, accounting/tax and legal costs. • Communications increased $23 million primarily related to the expansion of the Company due to the BGI Transaction. • Regulatory, filing and license fees increased $29 million primarily due to a $20 million U.K. regulatory assessment. • Charitable contributions increased $24 million, which is primarily related to a contribution to a donor advised charitable fund. • Closed-end fund launch costs (excluding compensation costs) increased $13 million due to the Build America Bond Trust fund, which launched during the year ended December 31, 2010 and generated approximately $1.2 billion in AUM. • Other general and administration expenses increased $47 million due to an increase of $86 million related to growth of the Company including recruiting, training and insurance costs, as well as costs for potential operating errors/fines, partially offset by a $17 million change in foreign currency remeasurement costs/benefits from $11 million of costs in the year ended December 31, 2009 to a $6 million benefit in the year ended December 31, 2010, a $9 million decline in an expense for a potentially uncollectible receivable recorded in 2009 and $9 million of lower provisions related to an outstanding loan to Anthracite Capital Inc. Restructuring Charges. For the year ended December 31, 2009, BlackRock recorded pre-tax restructuring charges of $22 million primarily related to severance, outplacement costs, occupancy costs and accelerated amortization of certain previously granted stock awards associated with a reduction in work force and reengineering efforts. Amortization of Intangible Assets. Amortization of intangible assets increased $13 million to $160 million for the year ended December 31, 2010 from $147 million for the year ended December 31, 2009. The increase in amortization of intangible assets reflects amortization of finite-lived management contracts acquired in the BGI Transaction. 71 Table of Contents Non-operating results for the year ended December 31, 2010 compared with the year ended December 31, 2009 Non-Operating Income (Expense), Less Net Income (Loss) Attributable to Non-Controlling Interests Non-operating income (expense), less net income (loss) attributable to non-controlling interests, for the years ended December 31, 2010 and 2009 was as follows: Year endedDecember 31, (Dollar amounts in millions) 2010 2009 $ Change Non-operating income (expense), GAAP basis $ 23 $ (6 ) $ 29 Less: Net income (loss) attributable to NCI(1) (13 ) 22 (35 ) Non-operating income (expense)(2) 36 (28 ) 64 Compensation expense related to (appreciation) depreciation on deferred compensation plans (11 ) (18 ) 7 Non-operating income (expense), as adjusted(2) $ 25 $ (46 ) $ 71 (1) Amount includes a $35 million loss attributable to consolidated variable interest entities for the year ended December 31, 2010.

The $36 million non-operating income, net of non-controlling interests for the year ended December 31, 2010 was comprised of $146 million of net gains on co-investments and seed investments and $11 million of appreciation related to hedges of deferred compensation, partially offset by $121 million of net interest expense. Net gain on co-investments and seed investments increased $144 million from the year ended December 31, 2009 primarily due to the non-recurrence of 2009 valuation declines in real estate equity and debt co-investments. Net interest expense was $121 million, an increase of $73 million primarily due to an increase in interest expense related to the December 2009 issuances of $2.5 billion of long-term notes, partially offset by higher dividend income related to an investment required for regulatory purposes. 72 Table of Contents Non-operating results for the year ended December 31, 2010 compared with the year ended December 31, 2009 (continued) Income Tax Expense Year endedDecember 31, %Change Year endedDecember 31, %Change 2010 2009 2010 2009 (Dollar amounts in millions) GAAP GAAP As adjusted As adjusted Income before income taxes(1) $ 3,034 $ 1,250 143 % $ 3,192 $ 1,524 109 % Income tax expense $ 971 $ 375 159 % $ 1,053 $ 503 109 % Effective tax rate 32.0 % 30.0 % 33.0 % 33.0 % (1) Net of net income (loss) attributable to non-controlling interests.

As adjusted effective tax rate of 33.0% for the year ended December 31, 2009 excluded $45 million of non-cash benefits due to legislation enacted primarily with respect to New York City corporate income taxes. The Company succeeded to a $580 million California net operating loss carryforward for fiscal year 2007, 2008 and 2009 in connection with the BGI Transaction, for which it has not recorded a deferred income tax asset because of certain technical matters related to the predecessor’s unitary tax returns. The Company will continue to assess these matters, which may result in future tax benefits which, based on current factors, could approximate $40 million, if they are resolved favorably. 73 Table of Contents Operating results for the year ended December 31, 2010 compared with the year ended December 31, 2009 (continued) Net Income Attributable to BlackRock, Inc.

(continued) As Adjusted. Exclusive of the items discussed above, net income attributable to BlackRock, Inc. as adjusted, totaled $2,139 million or 10.94 per diluted common share, as adjusted, for the year ended December 31, 2010, which was an increase of $1,118 million or $3.81 per diluted earnings per common share from the year ended December 31, 2009. Net income and diluted earnings per common share, as adjusted, are described in more detail in the Overview to Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. Balance Sheet Overview As Adjusted Balance Sheet The following table presents a reconciliation of the Company’s consolidated statement of financial condition presented on a GAAP basis to the Company’s consolidated statement of financial condition, excluding the impact of separate account assets and collateral held under securities lending agreements (directly related to lending securities held by separate account assets) and separate account liabilities and collateral liabilities under securities lending agreements, consolidated variable interest entities (“VIEs”) and consolidated sponsored investment funds. The Company presents the as adjusted balance sheet as additional information to enable investors to eliminate gross presentation of certain assets that have equal and offsetting liabilities or non-controlling interests and ultimately do not have an impact on stockholders’ equity (excluding appropriated retained earnings related to consolidated collateralized loan obligations (“CLOs”)) or cash flows. Management reviews its as-adjusted balance sheet, a non-GAAP financial measure, as an economic presentation of its total assets and liabilities; however, it does not advocate that investors consider such non-GAAP financial measure in isolation from, or as a substitute for, financial information prepared in accordance with GAAP. Separate Account Assets and Liabilities and Collateral Held under Securities Lending Agreements The separate account assets are maintained by a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company, which is a registered life insurance company in the United Kingdom, and represent segregated assets held for purposes of funding individual and group pension contracts. In accordance with GAAP, the Company records equal and offsetting separate account liabilities. The separate account assets are not available to creditors of the Company and the holders of the pension contracts have no recourse to the Company. The net investment income attributable to separate account assets accrues directly to the contract owners and is not reported on the Company’s consolidated statements of income. While BlackRock has no economic interest in these assets or liabilities, BlackRock earns an investment advisory fee for the service of managing these assets on behalf of the clients. In addition, the Company records on its consolidated statements of financial condition the collateral received under securities lending agreements (directly related to lending securities held by separate account assets) as its own asset in addition to an equal and offsetting collateral liability for the obligation to return the collateral. Consolidated VIEs As of December 31, 2011, BlackRock consolidated five VIEs. The assets of these VIEs are not available to creditors of the Company and the Company has no obligation to settle the liabilities of the VIEs. While BlackRock has no economic interest in these assets or liabilities, BlackRock earns an investment advisory fee for the service of managing these assets on behalf of the clients. 75 Table of Contents Balance Sheet Overview (continued) December 31, 2011 Segregated client assetsgenerating advisory fees inwhich BlackRock has noeconomic interest orliability (Dollar amounts in millions) GAAPBasis SeparateAccountAssets/Collateral ConsolidatedVIEs ConsolidatedSponsoredInvestmentFunds AsAdjusted Assets Cash and cash equivalents $ 3,506 $ — $ — $ 196 $ 3,310 Accounts receivable 1,960 — — — 1,960 Investments 1,631 — — 112 1,519 Assets of consolidated variable interest entities 1,693 — 1,693 — — Separate account assets and collateral held under securities lending agreements 139,789 139,789 — — — Other assets(1) 1,169 — — 5 1,164 Sub-total 149,748 139,789 1,693 313 7,953 Goodwill and intangible assets, net 30,148 — — — 30,148 Total assets $ 179,896 $ 139,789 $ 1,693 $ 313 $ 38,101 Liabilities Accrued compensation and benefits $ 1,383 $ — $ — $ — $ 1,383 Accounts payable and accrued liabilities 923 — — — 923 Borrowings(2) 4,790 — — — 4,790 Liabilities of consolidated variable interest entities 1,583 — 1,583 — — Separate account liabilities and collateral liabilities under securities lending agreements 139,789 139,789 — — — Deferred income tax liabilities 5,323 — — — 5,323 Other liabilities(3) 743 — — 37 706 Total liabilities 154,534 139,789 1,583 37 13,125 Equity Total stockholders’ equity 25,048 — 72 — 24,976 Non-controlling interests 314 — 38 276 — Total equity 25,362 — 110 276 24,976 Total liabilities and equity $ 179,896 $ 139,789 $ 1,693 $ 313 $ 38,101 (1) Amount includes due from related parties, deferred sales commissions, property and equipment and other assets.

(2) Includes short-term borrowings, convertible debentures at December 31, 2010 and long-term borrowings. (3) Includes due to related parties and other liabilities. The following discussion summarizes the significant changes in assets and liabilities. These changes do not include assets and liabilities that are equal and offsetting and have no impact on BlackRock’s stockholders’ equity. Cash and Cash Equivalents. Cash and cash equivalents at December 31, 2011 and 2010 included $196 million and $65 million of cash held by consolidated sponsored investment funds, respectively. See Liquidity and Capital Resources for details on the change in cash and cash equivalents during 2011. Accounts Receivable. Accounts receivable at December 31, 2011 decreased $135 million from December 31, 2010, primarily reflecting lower performance fees receivables at December 31, 2011 partially offset by higher receivables related to securities lending revenue. 77 Table of Contents Balance Sheet Overview (continued) Investments. BlackRock reports its investments on a GAAP basis, which includes investments that are owned by sponsored investment funds deemed to be controlled by BlackRock in accordance with GAAP and, therefore, consolidated even though BlackRock may not own the majority of any such funds. As a result, management reviews its investments on an “economic” basis, which eliminates the portion of investments that do not impact BlackRock’s book value. BlackRock’s management does not advocate that investors consider such non-GAAP financial measures in isolation from, or as a substitute for, financial information prepared in accordance with GAAP. The Company presents total investments, as adjusted, to enable investors to understand the portion of its investments that are owned by the Company, net of non-controlling interests, as a gauge to measure the impact of changes in net non-operating gain (loss) on investments to net income (loss) attributable to BlackRock, Inc. The Company further presents total net “economic” investment exposure, net of deferred compensation investments and hedged investments, to reflect another gauge for investors as the economic impact of investments held pursuant to deferred compensation arrangements is substantially offset by a change in compensation expense and the impact of hedged investments is substantially mitigated by total return swap hedges. Carried interest capital allocations are excluded as generally there is no impact to BlackRock’s stockholders’ equity as the balance fluctuates. Finally, the Company’s regulatory investment in Federal Reserve Bank stock, which is not subject to market or interest rate risk, is excluded from the Company’s net economic investment exposure.

Total investments, as adjusted, at December 31, 2011 increased $116 million from December 31, 2010, resulting from $457 million of purchases/capital contributions, $9 million of positive market valuations and earnings from equity method investments, and $8 million of net additional carried interest capital allocations, partially offset by $280 million of sales/maturities and $78 million of distributions representing return of capital and return on investments.

In accordance with GAAP, certain equity method investees do not account for both their financial assets and financial liabilities under fair value measures, therefore, the Company’s investment in such equity method investees may not represent fair value. (2) Amounts include BlackRock’s portion of cash and cash equivalents, other assets and liabilities that are consolidated from non-VIE sponsored investment funds. See Note 5, Fair Value Disclosures, for total GAAP investments. Goodwill and Intangible Assets. Goodwill and intangible assets at December 31, 2011 decreased $169 million from December 31, 2010, primarily due to $156 million of amortization expense related to finite-lived intangibles. Other Assets. Other assets at December 31, 2011 increased $209 million from December 31, 2010 primarily resulting from a $109 million increase in property and equipment due to additional leasehold improvements and equipment, including capital expenditures related to the lease of U.K. office space located at Drapers Gardens, and a $51 million increase in tax receivables. Accrued Compensation and Benefits. Accrued compensation and benefits at December 31, 2011 decreased $137 million from December 31, 2010 primarily related to lower 2011 incentive compensation accruals. Accounts Payable and Accrued Liabilities. Accounts payable and accrued liabilities at December 31, 2011 decreased $145 million from December 31, 2010, resulting from decreases in current income taxes payable and unit trust payables. Borrowings. Borrowings at December 31, 2011 increased $1,431 million from December 31, 2010 primarily resulting from net proceeds from new issuances of long-term borrowings of $1,496 million, partially offset by conversions of the final $67 million of convertible debt. Deferred Income Tax Liabilities. Deferred income tax liabilities at December 31, 2011 decreased $154 million primarily as a result of revaluation of certain deferred income tax liabilities primarily due to a state tax election, enacted U.K., Japan, U.S. state and local legislation. In addition, the decrease included the effects of temporary differences associated with deferred stock compensation and investment income. Other Liabilities. Other liabilities at December 31, 2011 increased $102 million from December 31, 2010 primarily resulting from an accrual for U.K. lease exit costs, increases in deferred carried interest and liabilities of consolidated funds, partially offset by repayments to Barclays to settle certain non-interest bearing notes assumed in the BGI Transaction and a payment related to a U.K. regulatory assessment. Stockholders’ Equity. Total stockholders’ equity at December 31, 2011 decreased $1.0 billion from December 31, 2010, principally resulting from $2.8 billion of stock repurchases, including $2.5 billion to repurchase Bank of America’s remaining ownership interest in BlackRock and $239 million of employee tax withholdings related to employee stock transactions, $1.0 billion of cash dividend payments, partially offset by $2.3 billion of net income attributable to BlackRock and $497 million of stock-based compensation expense. 79 Table of Contents Liquidity and Capital Resources BlackRock Cash Flows Excluding the Impact of Consolidated Sponsored Investment Funds and VIEs In accordance with GAAP, BlackRock consolidates certain BlackRock sponsored investment funds and CLOs, notwithstanding the fact BlackRock may only have a minority interest, if any, in these funds or CLOs. As a result, BlackRock’s consolidated statements of cash flows include the cash flows of consolidated sponsored investment funds and CLOs. The Company uses an adjusted cash flow statement, which excludes the impact of consolidated sponsored investment funds and CLOs, as a supplemental non-GAAP measure to assess liquidity and capital requirements. The Company believes its cash flows, excluding the impact of the consolidated sponsored investment funds and CLOs, provide investors with useful information on the cash flows of BlackRock relating to its ability to fund additional operating, investing and financing activities. BlackRock’s management does not advocate that investors consider such non-GAAP measures in isolation from, or as a substitute for its cash flow presented in accordance with GAAP. The following tables present a reconciliation of the Company’s consolidated statements of cash flows presented on a GAAP basis to the Company’s consolidated statements of cash flows, excluding the impact of the cash flows of consolidated sponsored investment funds and consolidated VIEs: Year ended December 31, 2011 (Dollar amounts in millions) GAAPBasis Impact onCash Flowsof ConsolidatedSponsoredInvestmentFunds Impact onCash FlowsofConsolidatedVIEs Cash FlowsExcludingImpact ofConsolidatedSponsoredInvestmentFunds and VIEs Cash and cash equivalents, beginning of year $ 3,367 $ 65 $ — $ 3,302 Cash flows from operating activities 2,826 42 136 2,648 Cash flows from investing activities (204 ) 24 — (228 ) Cash flows from financing activities (2,485 ) 65 (136 ) (2,414 ) Effect of exchange rate changes on cash and cash equivalents 2 — — 2 Net change in cash and cash equivalents 139 131 — 8 Cash and cash equivalents, end of year $ 3,506 $ 196 $ — $ 3,310 Year ended December 31, 2010 (Dollar amounts in millions) GAAPBasis Impact onCash Flows ofConsolidatedSponsoredInvestmentFunds Impact onCash FlowsofConsolidatedVIEs Cash FlowsExcludingImpact ofConsolidatedSponsoredInvestmentFunds and VIEs Cash and cash equivalents, beginning of year $ 4,708 $ 75 $ 9 $ 4,624 Cash flows from operating activities 2,488 (76 ) (1 ) 2,565 Cash flows from investing activities (627 ) (52 ) — (575 ) Cash flows from financing activities (3,170 ) 118 (8 ) (3,280 ) Effect of exchange rate changes on cash and cash equivalents (32 ) — — (32 ) Net change in cash and cash equivalents (1,341 ) (10 ) (9 ) (1,322 ) Cash and cash equivalents, end of year $ 3,367 $ 65 $ — $ 3,302 80 Table of Contents Liquidity and Capital Resources (continued) Operating Activities. Sources of BlackRock’s operating cash primarily include investment advisory, administration fees and securities lending revenue, performance fees, revenues from BlackRock Solutions and advisory products and services, other revenue and distribution fees. BlackRock uses its cash to pay compensation and benefits, distribution and servicing costs, direct fund expenses, general and administration expenses, interest and principal on the Company’s borrowings, income taxes, dividends on BlackRock’s capital stock, capital expenditures and to purchase co-investments and seed investments. Cash inflows from operating activities, excluding the impact of consolidated sponsored investment funds and VIEs, primarily include the receipt of investment advisory and administration fees, securities lending revenue and other revenue offset by the payment of operating expenses incurred in the normal course of business. Investing Activities. Cash outflows from investing activities, excluding the impact of consolidated sponsored investment funds and VIEs, for the year ended December 31, 2011 were $228 million and primarily included $247 million of purchases of property and equipment and $262 million of purchases of investments, partially offset by $247 million of net proceeds from sales and maturities of investments and $34 million of return of capital from equity method investees. Financing Activities. Cash outflows from financing activities, excluding the impact of consolidated sponsored investment funds and VIEs, for the year ended December 31, 2011 were $2,414 million, which included $2.8 billion of stock repurchases, including $2.5 billion related to the repurchase of Bank of America’s remaining ownership interest in BlackRock and $239 million for employee tax withholdings related to employee stock transactions, $1.0 billion of cash dividend payments and $67 million for convertible debt repayments. Cash outflows from financing activities were partially offset by cash inflows related to $1,496 million of net proceeds from long-term borrowings and $56 million of other inflows including excess tax benefits from stock-based compensation and proceeds from stock option exercises. Capital Resources The Company manages its financial condition and funding to maintain appropriate liquidity for the business. Capital resources at December 31, 2011 and 2010 were as follows: (Dollar amounts in millions) December 31,2011 December 31,2010 Variance Amount % Change Cash and cash equivalents $ 3,506 $ 3,367 $ 139 4 % Cash and cash equivalents held by consolidated sponsored investment funds(1) (196 ) (65 ) (131 ) (202 %) Subtotal 3,310 3,302 8 — % 2011 credit facility – undrawn 3,400 — 3,400 * 2007 credit facility – undrawn(2) — 2,266 (2,266 ) (100 %) Total liquidity $ 6,710 $ 5,568 $ 1,142 21 % Required regulatory capital(3) $ 1,196 $ 897 $ 299 33 % * – Not applicable. (1) The Company may not be able to access such cash to use in its operating activities. (2) Amount excludes $134 million of undrawn amounts at December 31, 2010 related to Lehman Commercial Paper, Inc. The 2007 credit facility was terminated in March 2011. (3) A portion of the required regulatory capital is partially met with cash and cash equivalents. Total liquidity improved by $1,142 million during the year ended December 31, 2011 primarily reflecting the additional borrowing capacity under the 2011 credit facility compared with the 2007 credit facility. During the year ended December 31, 2011, the Company’s net capital requirements increased $299 million due to increases related to certain European and Asia-Pacific regulated legal entities. A significant portion of the Company’s $1,519 million of total investments, as adjusted, is illiquid in nature and, as such, may not be readily convertible to cash. 81 Table of Contents Liquidity and Capital Resources (continued) Short-term borrowings The following describes the Company’s short-term borrowing arrangements, which the Company has access to utilize. 2011 Revolving Credit Facility. In March 2011, the Company entered into a five-year $3.5 billion unsecured revolving credit facility (the “2011 credit facility”), which replaced the 2007 facility. The 2011 credit facility permits the Company to request an additional $1.0 billion of borrowing capacity, subject to lender credit approval, increasing the overall size of the 2011 credit facility to an aggregate principal amount not to exceed $4.5 billion. Interest on borrowings outstanding accrues at a rate based on the applicable London Interbank Offered Rate (“LIBOR”) plus a spread. The 2011 credit facility requires the Company not to exceed a maximum leverage ratio (ratio of net debt to earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, where net debt equals total debt less unrestricted cash) of 3 to 1, which was satisfied with a ratio of approximately 1 to 1 at December 31, 2011. The 2011 credit facility provides back-up liquidity, funds ongoing working capital for general corporate purposes and funds various investment opportunities. At December 31, 2011, the Company had $100 million outstanding under this facility with an interest rate of 1.27% and a maturity during January 2012. During January 2012, the Company rolled over the $100 million in borrowings at an interest rate of 1.30% and a maturity during February 2012. During February 2012, the Company rolled over the $100 million in borrowings at an interest rate of 1.26% and a maturity during March 2012. Barclays has a $255 million participation under the 2011 credit facility. Commercial Paper Program. On October 14, 2009, BlackRock established a commercial paper program (the “CP Program”) under which the Company could issue unsecured commercial paper notes (the “CP Notes”) on a private placement basis up to a maximum aggregate amount outstanding at any time of $3 billion. The proceeds of the commercial paper issuances during 2011 were used to fund a portion of the repurchase of BlackRock’s Series B Preferred Stock from affiliates of Merrill Lynch. On May 13, 2011, BlackRock increased the maximum aggregate amount that may be borrowed under the CP Program from $3.0 billion to $3.5 billion. The CP Program is currently supported by the 2011 credit facility. As of December 31, 2011 and 2010, BlackRock had no CP Notes outstanding. Share Repurchase Approvals. In July 2010, BlackRock announced that its Board of Directors (the “Board”) approved the repurchase of up to 5,100,000 shares to neutralize the dilutive effects of restricted stock units and options that have been granted to employees that will become dilutive over the next several years. The shares are to be repurchased with management discretion on the timing of the repurchases. The Company repurchased 618,000 shares in open market transactions for approximately $100 million in 2011. As of December 31, 2011, the Company had repurchased approximately 1,514,000 shares and there were 3,586,000 shares still authorized to be repurchased. In February 2012, the Board approved an increase in the availability under the Company’s existing share repurchase program to allow for the repurchase of up to 5.0 million shares of BlackRock common stock. Barclays Support of Certain Cash Funds. Barclays has provided capital support agreements to support certain cash management products acquired by BlackRock in the BGI Transaction. Pursuant to the terms of the capital support agreements, Barclays agreed to cover losses on covered securities within the products in the aggregate of up to $2.2 billion from December 1, 2009 through December 1, 2013 or until certain criteria are met. BlackRock and Barclays have procedures in place to determine loss events on covered securities within the products and to ensure support payments from Barclays. At December 31, 2011, Barclays’ remaining maximum potential obligation in the aggregate under the capital support agreements was $1.6 billion. At December 31, 2011, BlackRock concluded that although these funds were variable interest entities, it was not the primary beneficiary of these funds. 82 Table of Contents Liquidity and Capital Resources (continued) Net Capital Requirements. The Company is required to maintain net capital in certain regulated subsidiaries within a number of jurisdictions, which is partially maintained by retaining cash and cash equivalents in those jurisdictions. As a result, such subsidiaries of the Company may be restricted in their ability to transfer cash between different jurisdictions and to their parents. Additionally, transfers of cash between international jurisdictions, including repatriation to the United States, may have adverse tax consequences that could discourage such transfers. BTC is chartered as a national bank that does not accept client deposits and whose powers are limited to trust activities. BTC provides investment management services, including investment advisory and securities lending agency services to institutional investors and other clients. BTC is subject to various regulatory capital and liquid asset requirements administered by Federal banking agencies. At December 31, 2011, the Company was required to maintain approximately $1,196 million in net capital in certain regulated subsidiaries, including BTC and entities regulated by the FSA in the United Kingdom, and was in compliance with all applicable regulatory minimum net capital requirements. Undistributed Earnings of Foreign Subsidiaries. As of December 31, 2011, the Company has not provided for U.S. federal and state income taxes on approximately $1,516 million of undistributed earnings of its foreign subsidiaries. Such earnings are considered indefinitely reinvested outside the United States. The Company’s current plans do not demonstrate a need to repatriate these funds. Contractual Obligations, Commitments and Contingencies The following table sets forth contractual obligations, commitments and contingencies by year of payment at December 31, 2011: (Dollar amounts in millions) 2012 2013 2014 2015 2016 Thereafter Total Contractual obligations and commitments: Short-term borrowings: Principal $ 100 $ — $ — $ — $ — $ — $ 100 Long-term borrowings: Principal 500 750 1,000 — — 2,450 4,700 Interest 180 169 161 126 126 353 1,115 Operating leases 120 131 121 110 99 814 1,395 Purchase obligations 101 80 65 22 11 — 279 Investment commitments 112 — — — — — 112 Total contractual obligations and commitments 1,113 1,130 1,347 258 236 3,617 7,701 Contingent obligations: Contingent distribution obligations 194 194 — — — — 388 Total contractual obligations, commitments and contingent obligations(1) $ 1,307 $ 1,324 $ 1,347 $ 258 $ 236 $ 3,617 $ 8,089 (1) As of December 31, 2011, the Company had $281 million of net unrecognized tax benefits. Due to the uncertainty of timing and amounts that will ultimately be paid, this amount has been excluded from the table above. 83 Table of Contents Contractual Obligations, Commitments and Contingencies (continued) Short-term Borrowings. At December 31, 2011, the Company had $100 million outstanding under the 2011 credit facility with an interest rate of 1.27% and a maturity during January 2012. During January 2012, the Company rolled over the $100 million in borrowings at an interest rate of 1.30% and a maturity during February 2012. During February 2012, the Company rolled over the $100 million in borrowings at an interest rate of 1.26% and a maturity during March 2012. Long-term Borrowings. At December 31, 2011, the principal amount of long-term borrowings was $4.7 billion. Debt service and repayment requirements are $680 million in 2012, $919 million in 2013, $1,161 million in 2014, $126 million in 2015 and 2016. 2017 Notes. In September 2007, the Company issued $700 million in aggregate principal amount of 6.25% senior unsecured notes maturing on September 15, 2017 (the “2017 Notes”). A portion of the net proceeds of the 2017 Notes was used to fund the initial cash payment for the acquisition of the fund of funds business of Quellos and the remainder was used for general corporate purposes. Interest is payable semi-annually in arrears on March 15 and September 15 of each year, or approximately $44 million per year. The 2017 Notes may be redeemed prior to maturity at any time in whole or in part at the option of the Company at a “make-whole” redemption price. 2012, 2014 and 2019 Notes. In December 2009, the Company issued $2.5 billion in aggregate principal amount of unsecured and unsubordinated obligations. These notes were issued as three separate series of senior debt securities including $0.5 billion of 2.25% notes, $1.0 billion of 3.50% notes and $1.0 billion of 5.0% notes maturing in December 2012, 2014 and 2019, respectively. Net proceeds of this offering were used to repay borrowings under our CP program, which was used to finance a portion of the BGI Transaction, and for general corporate purposes. Interest on these notes of approximately $96 million per year is payable semi-annually in arrears on June 10 and December 10 of each year. These notes may be redeemed prior to maturity at any time in whole or in part at the option of the Company at a “make-whole” redemption price. 2013 and 2021 Notes. In May 2011, the Company issued $1.5 billion in aggregate principal amount of unsecured unsubordinated obligations. These notes were issued as two separate series of senior debt securities including $750 million of 4.25% notes and $750 million of floating rate notes maturing in May 2021 and 2013, respectively. Net proceeds of this offering were used to fund the repurchase of BlackRock’s Series B Preferred Stock from affiliates of Merrill Lynch. Interest on the 4.25% notes due in 2021 (“2021 Notes”) is payable semi-annually on May 24 and November 24 of each year commencing November 24, 2011 and is approximately $32 million per year. Interest on the floating rate notes due in 2013 (“2013 Floating Rate Notes”) is payable quarterly on February 24, May 24, August 24 and November 24 of each year. The 2021 Notes may be redeemed prior to maturity at any time in whole or in part at the option of the Company at a “make-whole” redemption price. The 2013 Floating Rate Notes may not be redeemed at the Company’s option before maturity. In May 2011, in conjunction with the issuance of the 2013 Floating Rate Notes, the Company entered into a $750 million notional interest rate swap maturing in 2013 to hedge the future cash flows of the obligation at a fixed rate of 1.03% payable semi-annually on May 24 and November 24 of each year commencing November 24, 2011. The interest rate swap effectively converts the 2013 Floating Rate Notes to a fixed rate obligation. Operating Leases. The Company leases its primary office locations under agreements that currently expire through 2035. In connection with certain lease agreements, the Company is responsible for escalation payments. The contractual obligations table above includes only guaranteed minimum lease payments for such leases and does not project potential escalation or other lease-related payments. These leases are classified as operating leases and, as such, are not recorded as liabilities on the consolidated statements of financial condition. Purchase Obligations. In the ordinary course of business, BlackRock enters into contracts or purchase obligations with third parties whereby the third parties provide services to or on behalf of BlackRock. Purchase obligations included in the contractual obligations table above represent executory contracts, which are either non-cancelable or cancelable with a penalty. At December 31, 2011, the Company’s obligations primarily reflected standard service contracts for portfolio, market data, office-related services and third-party marketing and promotional services. Purchase obligations are recorded on the Company’s financial statements when services are provided and, as such, obligations for services not received are not included in the Company’s consolidated statement of financial condition at December 31, 2011. 84 Table of Contents Contractual Obligations, Commitments and Contingencies (continued) Investment Commitments. At December 31, 2011, the Company had $112 million of various capital commitments to fund sponsored investment funds, including funds of private equity funds, real estate funds and distressed credit funds. This amount excludes additional commitments made by consolidated funds of funds to underlying third-party funds as third-party non-controlling interest holders have the legal obligation to fund the respective commitments of such funds of funds. Generally, the timing of the funding of these commitments is unknown and the commitments are callable on demand at any time prior to the expiration of the commitment and are, therefore, presented in 2012. These unfunded commitments are not recorded on the Company’s consolidated statements of financial condition. The above schedule does not include potential future commitments approved by the Company’s Capital Committee, but which are not yet legally binding. The Company intends to make additional capital commitments from time to time to fund additional investment products for, and with, its clients. Carried Interest Claw-back. As a general partner in certain investment funds, including private equity partnerships and certain hedge funds, the Company may receive certain carried interest cash distributions from the partnerships in accordance with distribution provisions of the partnership agreements. The Company may, from time to time, be required to return all or a portion of such distributions to the limited partners in the event the limited partners do not achieve a certain return as specified in the various partnership agreements. Contingent Distribution Obligations. In November 2010, BlackRock entered into a second amended and restated global distribution agreement with Merrill Lynch, which requires the Company to make payments to Merrill Lynch contingent upon sales of products and level of AUM maintained in certain BlackRock products. The economic terms of the agreement will remain in effect until January 2014. After such term, the agreement will renew for one automatic three-year extension if certain conditions are satisfied. The above schedule reflects the Company’s estimated payments for 2012, which due to uncertainty of asset levels and future additional sales, has been held constant for 2013. The following items have not been included in the contractual obligations, commitments and contingencies table: Compensation and Benefit Obligations. The Company has various compensation and benefit obligations, including bonuses, commissions and incentive payments payable, defined contribution plan matching contribution obligations, and deferred compensation arrangements, that are excluded from the table above primarily due to uncertainties in their payout periods. These arrangements are discussed in more detail in Notes 13, Stock-Based Compensation, and 14, Employee Benefit Plans, to the consolidated financial statements beginning on page F-1 of this Form 10-K. Accrued compensation and benefits at December 31, 2011 totaled $1,383 million and included incentive compensation of $1,079 million, deferred compensation of $91 million and other compensation and benefits related obligations of $213 million. Substantially all of the incentive compensation liability was paid in the first quarter of 2012, while the deferred compensation obligations are payable over periods up to five years. Separate Account Liabilities. The separate account assets are maintained by a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company, which is a registered life insurance company in the United Kingdom, and represent segregated assets held for purposes of funding individual and group pension contracts. In accordance with GAAP, the Company records equal and offsetting separate account liabilities. The separate account assets are not available to creditors of the Company and the holders of the pension contracts have no recourse to the Company. The net investment income attributable to separate account assets accrues directly to the contract owners and is not reported on the Company’s consolidated statements of income. While BlackRock has no economic interest in these assets or liabilities, BlackRock earns an investment advisory fee for the service of managing these assets on behalf of the clients. At December 31, 2011, the Company had $118.9 billion of assets and offsetting liabilities on the consolidated statement of financial condition. The payment of these contractual obligations is inherently uncertain and varies by customer. As such, these liabilities have been excluded from the contractual obligations table above. Indemnifications. In many of the Company’s contracts, including the BGI, MLIM and Quellos Transaction agreements, BlackRock agrees to indemnify third parties under certain circumstances. The terms of the indemnities vary from contract to contract and the amount of indemnification liability, if any, cannot be determined and has not been included in the table above or recorded in the Company’s consolidated statement of financial condition at December 31, 2011. See further discussion in Note 12, Commitments and Contingencies, to the consolidated financial statements beginning on page F-1 of this Form 10-K. Acquisitions. In January 2012, BlackRock announced that it has agreed to acquire Toronto-based Claymore Investments, Inc. (“Claymore”), subject to customary closing conditions. Claymore is a wholly owned independent Canadian subsidiary of Guggenheim Funds Services Group, a subsidiary of Guggenheim Partners, LLC. The total consideration estimated to be paid at closing will be approximately $210 million. 85 Table of Contents Critical Accounting Policies The preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods. Actual results could differ significantly from those estimates. Management considers the following critical accounting policies important to understanding the consolidated financial statements. For a summary of these and additional accounting policies see Note 2, Significant Accounting Policies, to the consolidated financial statements beginning on page F-1 of this Form 10-K. Consolidation of Sponsored Investment Funds and Securitization Products. Consolidation of sponsored investment funds and securitization products (collectively “investment products”) is determined pursuant to ASC 810, Consolidation. The accounting method used by the Company depends upon the influence the Company has over its investee, the investment product. To the extent that BlackRock can exert control over the financial and operating policies of the investment product, which generally exists if there is a 50% or greater voting interest or if partners or members of certain products do not have substantive rights, BlackRock consolidates the investment product. For investment products in which BlackRock’s voting interest is less than 50%, an analysis is performed to determine if the investment product is a variable interest entity (“VIE”) or a voting rights entity. Upon the determination that the investment product is a VIE, further analysis, as discussed below, is performed to determine if BlackRock is the primary beneficiary (“PB”) of the investment product, which would require consolidation. Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities. Pursuant to ASC 810-10, certain investment products for which the risks and rewards of ownership are not directly linked to voting interests may be deemed VIEs. BlackRock reviews factors, including the rights of the equity holders and obligations of equity holders to absorb losses or receive expected residual returns to determine if the investment product is a VIE. BlackRock is required to consolidate a VIE when it is deemed to be the PB, which is evaluated continuously as facts and circumstances change. ASU 2010-10, Amendments to Statement 167 for Certain Investment Funds (“ASU 2010-10”) defers the application of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (“SFAS”) No. 167, Amendments to FASB Interpretation No. 46(R), for certain investment funds, including money market funds. The PB of a VIE that meets the conditions of ASU 2010-10 is the enterprise that has a variable interest (or combination of variable interests, including those of related parties) that absorbs the majority of the entity’s expected losses, receives a majority of the entity’s expected residual returns, or both. Effective January 1, 2010, the PB of a VIE that does not meet the conditions for deferral in ASU 2010-10 is the enterprise that has the power to direct activities of the entity that most significantly impact the entity’s economic performance and has the obligation to absorb losses or the right to receive benefits that potentially could be significant to the VIE. Significant judgment is required in the determination of whether the Company is the PB of a VIE. If the Company, together with its related parties, is determined to be the PB of a VIE, BlackRock will consolidate the entity. In order to determine whether the Company is the PB of a VIE for entities that meet the conditions of ASU 2010-10, management must make significant estimates and assumptions of probable future cash flows and assign probabilities to different cash flow scenarios. Assumptions made in such analyses include, but are not limited to, market prices of securities, market interest rates, potential credit defaults on individual securities or default rates on a portfolio of securities, gain realization, liquidity or marketability of certain securities, discount rates and the probability of certain other outcomes. In the normal course of business, the Company is the manager of various types of sponsored investment vehicles, including collateralized debt obligations (“CDOs”) or CLOs that do not meet the conditions of ASU 2010-10 and sponsored investment funds, which may be considered VIEs. At December 31, 2011, the Company consolidated five VIEs, including four CLOs and one sponsored private equity fund. 86 Table of Contents Critical Accounting Policies (continued) Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities (continued) At December 31, 2011, the following balances related to the five VIEs consolidated on the Company’s consolidated statement of financial condition: (Dollar amounts in millions) CLOs SponsoredPrivateEquity Fund TotalConsolidatedVIEs Assets of consolidated VIEs: Cash and cash equivalents $ 47 $ 7 $ 54 Bank loans, bonds and other investments 1,608 31 1,639 Liabilities of consolidated VIEs: Borrowings (1,574 ) — (1,574 ) Other liabilities (9 ) — (9 ) Appropriated retained earnings (72 ) — (72 ) Non-controlling interests of consolidated VIEs — (38 ) (38 ) Total BlackRock net interests in consolidated VIEs $ — $ — $ — As of December 31, 2011, BlackRock was the manager of over 20 CLOs/CDOs and other securitization entities, including the four aforementioned CLOs in which BlackRock, in accordance with ASU 2009-17, was determined to be the PB, which required BlackRock to consolidate these VIEs. BlackRock was deemed to be the PB because it has the power to direct the activities of the CLO that most significantly impact the entity’s economic performance and has the right to receive benefits that potentially could be significant to the VIE. At December 31, 2011, the Company had $1,655 million and $1,583 million in assets and liabilities, respectively, on its consolidated statement of financial condition related to these consolidated CLOs. In addition, the Company recorded appropriated retained earnings for the difference between the assets and liabilities, as the CLO noteholders, not BlackRock, ultimately will receive the benefits or absorb the losses associated with the CLO’s assets and liabilities. The changes in the assets and liabilities of these CLOs have no impact on net income attributable to BlackRock or its cash flows. Excluding outstanding management fee receivables, the Company has no risk of loss with its involvement with these VIEs. At December 31, 2011, BlackRock was determined to be the PB of one sponsored private equity investment fund of funds in which it had a non-substantive investment and was deemed to absorb the majority of the variability due to its de-facto third-party relationships with other partners in the fund, which limits the ability of the partners to transfer or sell their interests without BlackRock’s consent as the general partner of the fund. At December 31, 2011, the Company had recorded $7 million, $31 million and $38 million in cash and cash equivalents, private equity investments and nonredeemable non-controlling interests of consolidated VIEs, respectively, on its consolidated statement of financial condition related to this VIE. The changes in the assets and liabilities of this VIE have no impact on net income attributable to BlackRock. Excluding outstanding management fee receivables, the Company has no risk of loss with its involvement with this VIE. 87 Table of Contents Critical Accounting Policies (continued) Consolidation of Voting Rights Entities. To the extent that BlackRock can exert control over the financial and operating policies of the investee, which generally exists if there is a 50% or greater voting interest or if partners or members of certain products do not have substantive rights, BlackRock consolidates the investee. The Company, as general partner or managing member of certain sponsored investment funds, generally is presumed to control funds that are limited partnerships or limited liability companies. Pursuant to ASC 810-20, Control of Partnerships and Similar Entities (“ASC 810-20”), the Company reviews such investment vehicles to determine if such a presumption can be overcome by determining if other non-affiliated partners or members of the limited partnership or limited liability company have the substantive ability to dissolve (liquidate) the investment vehicle, or otherwise to remove BlackRock as the general partner or managing member without cause based on a simple unaffiliated majority vote, or have other substantive participating rights. If the investment vehicle is not a VIE and the presumption of control is not overcome, BlackRock will consolidate the investment vehicle. At December 31, 2011 and 2010, as a result of consolidation of various investment products deemed to be voting rights entities, including products where BlackRock owns 50% of greater of the voting rights of the product, under the consolidation policies described above, the Company had the following balances on its consolidated statements of financial condition: (Dollar amounts in millions) December 31,2011 December 31,2010 Cash and cash equivalents $ 196 $ 65 Investments: Trading investments 214 60 Other investments 373 337 Other assets 5 3 Other liabilities (37 ) (10 ) Non-controlling interests (276 ) (195 ) BlackRock’s net interests in consolidated investment funds $ 475 $ 260 The Company retained the specialized accounting of these investment funds pursuant to ASC 810-10. VIEs, including a consolidated sponsored investment fund and CLOs, were excluded from the balances above as these balances are reported separately on the consolidated statements of financial condition. Investments Equity Method Investments. For equity investments where BlackRock does not control the investee, and where the Company is not the PB of a VIE, but can exert significant influence over the financial and operating policies of the investee, the Company uses the equity method of accounting. The evaluation of whether the Company exerts control or significant influence over the financial and operational policies of its investees requires significant judgment based on the facts and circumstances surrounding each individual investment. Factors considered in these evaluations may include the type of investment, the legal structure of the investee, the terms and structure of the investment agreement, including investor voting or other rights, the terms of BlackRock’s advisory agreement or other agreements with the investee, any influence BlackRock may have on the governing board of the investee, the legal rights of other investors in the entity pursuant to the fund’s operating documents and the relationship between BlackRock and other investors in the entity. 88 Table of Contents Critical Accounting Policies (continued) Investments (continued) Equity Method Investments (continued) Substantially all of BlackRock’s equity method investees are investment companies that record their underlying investments at fair value. Therefore, under the equity method of accounting, BlackRock’s share of the investee’s underlying net income predominantly represents fair value adjustments in the investments held by the equity method investees. BlackRock’s share of the investee’s underlying net income or loss is based upon the most currently available information and is recorded as non-operating income (expense) for investments in investment companies, or as other revenue for operating advisory company investments, which are recorded in other assets, since such investees are considered to be an extension of BlackRock’s core business. At December 31, 2011, the Company had $476 million and $80 million of equity method investments, including equity method investments held for deferred compensation, reflected within investments and other assets, respectively, and at December 31, 2010, the Company had $583 million and $58 million of equity method investees reflected in investments and other assets, respectively. Impairment of Investments. The Company’s management periodically assesses its equity method, available-for-sale, held-to-maturity and cost investments for impairment. If circumstances indicate that impairment may exist, investments are evaluated using market values, where available, or the expected future cash flows of the investment. If the undiscounted expected future cash flows are lower than the Company’s carrying value of the investment, an impairment charge is recorded in the consolidated statement of income. When the fair value of an available-for-sale security is lower than cost, the Company evaluates the security to determine whether the impairment is considered to be “other-than-temporary”. In making this determination for equity securities, the Company considers, among other factors, the length of time the security has been in a loss position, the extent to which the security’s market value is less than cost, the financial condition and near-term prospects of the security’s issuer and the Company’s ability and intent to hold the security for a length of time sufficient to allow for recovery of such unrealized losses. If the impairment is considered other-than-temporary, a charge is recorded in the consolidated statement of income. In making this determination for debt securities, the Company considers whether: (1) the Company has the intent to sell the security, (2) it is more likely than not that the Company will be required to sell the security before recovery or (3) the Company does not expect to recover the entire amortized cost basis of the security. If the Company does not intend to sell a security and it is not more likely than not that it will be required to sell the security, but the security has suffered a credit loss, the credit loss will be bifurcated from the total impairment and recorded in earnings with the remaining portion recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income. 89 Table of Contents Critical Accounting Policies (continued) Investments (continued) Impairment of Investments (continued) Evaluation of securities impairments involves significant assumptions and management judgments, which could differ from actual results, and these differences could have a material impact on the Company’s consolidated statements of income. Fair Value Measurements Hierarchy of Fair Value Inputs. The provisions of ASC 820-10 establish a hierarchy that prioritizes inputs to valuation techniques used to measure fair value and requires companies to disclose the fair value of their financial instruments according to the fair value hierarchy (i.e., Level 1, 2 and 3 inputs, as defined). The fair value hierarchy gives the highest priority to quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities and the lowest priority to unobservable inputs. Assets and liabilities measured and reported at fair value are classified and disclosed in one of the following categories: Level 1 Inputs: Quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities at the reporting date. • Level 1 assets may include listed mutual funds (including those accounted for under the equity method of accounting as these mutual funds are investment companies that have publicly available net asset values (“NAVs”), which in accordance with GAAP are calculated under fair value measures and the changes are equal to the earnings of such funds), ETFs, and public equities and certain exchange-traded derivatives. Level 2 Inputs: Quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets; quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities that are not active; quotes from pricing services or brokers, for which the Company can determine that orderly transactions took place at the quoted price or that the inputs used to arrive at the price were observable; and inputs other than quoted prices that are observable, such as models or other valuation methodologies. As a practical expedient, the Company relies on the NAV (or its equivalent) of certain investments as their fair value. • Level 2 assets in this category may include debt securities, bank loans, short-term floating rate notes and asset-backed securities, securities held within consolidated hedge funds, certain equity method limited partnership interests in hedge funds valued based on NAVs where the Company has the ability to redeem at the measurement date or within the near term without redemption restrictions, restricted public securities valued at a discount, as well as over–the-counter derivatives, including interest and inflation rate swaps and foreign exchange currency contracts that have inputs to the valuations that generally can be corroborated by observable market data. Level 3 Inputs: Unobservable inputs for the valuation of the asset or liability, which may include non-binding broker quotes. Level 3 assets include investments for which there is little, if any, market activity. These inputs require significant management judgment or estimation. Certain investments that are valued using NAVs and are subject to current redemption restrictions that will not be lifted in the near term are included in Level 3. • Level 3 assets in this category generally include general and limited partnership interests in private equity funds, funds of private equity funds, real estate funds, hedge funds, funds of hedge funds, direct private equity investments held within consolidated funds, bonds and bank loans. 90 Table of Contents Critical Accounting Policies (continued) Fair Value Measurements (continued) Hierarchy of Fair Value Inputs (continued) • Level 3 inputs include the most currently available information, including capital accounts for its partnership interests in various alternative investments, which may be adjusted by using the returns of certain market indices. BlackRock’s $702 million of Level 3 investments or 43% of total GAAP investments at December 31, 2011 primarily included the above mentioned co-investments. Many of these investees are investment companies, which record their underlying investments at fair value based on fair value policies established by management of the underlying fund, which could include BlackRock employees. Fair value policies at the underlying fund generally utilize pricing/valuation information, including independent appraisals from third-party sources; however, in some instances current valuation information for illiquid securities or securities in markets that are not active may not be available from any third-party source or fund management may conclude that the valuations that are available from third-party sources are not reliable. In these instances fund management may perform model-based analytical valuations that may be used to value these investments. • Level 3 liabilities in this category include borrowings of CLOs valued based upon non-binding single broker quotes. Significance of Inputs. The Company’s assessment of the significance of a particular input to the fair value measurement in its entirety requires judgment and considers factors specific to the financial instrument. Pricing Services and Broker Quotes. A significant amount of inputs used to value equity and debt securities are sourced from well-recognized third-party pricing vendors. Generally, prices obtained from pricing vendors are categorized as Level 1 inputs for identical securities traded in active markets and as Level 2 for other similar securities if the vendor uses observable inputs in determining the price. Annually, BlackRock reviews both the valuation methodology, including the general assumptions and methods used to value various asset classes, and operational process with these vendors. In addition, on a quarterly basis meetings are held with the vendors to identify any significant changes to the vendors’ processes. In addition, quotes obtained from brokers generally are non-binding and categorized as Level 3 inputs. However, if the Company is able to determine that market participants have transacted for the asset in an orderly manner near the quoted price or if the Company can determine that the inputs used by the broker are observable, the quote is classified as a Level 2 input. Significant Transfers Into and Out of Levels 1, 2, and 3. During the year ended December 31, 2010, the Company reclassified approximately $47 million of net investments out of Level 3 predominantly to Level 2. The majority of the net reclassifications were related to investments that the Company values using a NAV (or a capital account) and it currently has the ability to redeem in the near term. Changes in Valuation. Changes in value on $1,116 million of investments will impact the Company’s non-operating income (expense), $52 million will impact accumulated other comprehensive income, $442 million are held at cost or amortized cost and the remaining $21 million related to carried interest has no impact on non-operating income (expense). As of December 31, 2011, changes in fair value of approximately $587 million of such investments within consolidated sponsored investment funds will impact BlackRock’s net income (loss) attributable to non-controlling interests expense on the consolidated statements of income. BlackRock’s net exposure to changes in fair value of such consolidated sponsored investment funds was $475 million. 91 Table of Contents Critical Accounting Policies (continued) Goodwill and Intangible Assets At December 31, 2011 and 2010, the carrying amounts of the Company’s goodwill and intangible assets were as follows: (Dollar amounts in millions) December 31,2011 December 31,2010 Goodwill $ 12,792 $ 12,805 Intangible assets Indefinite–lived Management contracts 15,188 15,188 Trade names/trademarks 1,403 1,403 License 6 6 Finite–lived, net of accumulated amortization Management contracts 755 911 Other 4 4 Total goodwill and intangible assets $ 30,148 $ 30,317 The value of advisory contracts acquired in business acquisitions to manage AUM in proprietary open- and closed-end investment funds as well as collective trust funds and certain other commingled products without a specified termination date is generally classified as indefinite-lived intangible assets. The assignment of indefinite lives to such investment fund contracts is based upon the assumption that there is no foreseeable limit on the contract period to manage these funds due to the likelihood of continued renewal at little or no cost. In addition, trade names/trademarks are considered indefinite-lived intangibles as they are expected to generate cash flows indefinitely. Goodwill represents the cost of a business acquisition in excess of the fair value of the net assets acquired. In accordance with the applicable provisions of ASC 350, Intangibles – Goodwill and Other (“ASC 350”), indefinite-lived intangible assets and goodwill are not amortized. Finite-lived management contracts, which relate to acquired separate accounts and funds with a specified termination date, are amortized over their remaining expected useful lives, which, at December 31, 2011, ranged from 2 years to 13 years with a weighted-average remaining estimated useful life of 5.4 years. Goodwill. The Company assesses its goodwill for impairment at least annually, considering such factors as the book value and the market capitalization of the Company. The impairment test performed as of July 31, 2011 indicated no impairment charge was required. The Company continues to monitor its book value per share as compared to closing prices of its common stock for potential indicators of impairment. At December 31, 2011 the Company’s common stock closed at $178.24, which exceeded its book value per share of approximately $140.07 after excluding appropriated retained earnings. Indefinite-lived and finite-lived intangibles. The Company considers if triggering events have occurred that may indicate fair values have declined below their respective carrying amounts on a quarterly basis. Triggering events may include significant adverse changes in the Company’s business, financial results, legal or regulatory environment, the loss of key personnel, or other events. If a triggering event has occurred, the Company performs assessments, which include a review of all significant assumptions, that would be used to value the asset, to determine if any intangible assets are potentially impaired. The Company performs such assessments of its intangible assets at least annually. In its assessment of management contracts and trade names/trademarks, the Company considers various factors, including AUM, revenue basis points, projected AUM growth rates, operating margins, tax rates and discount rates to determine whether the carrying values of each intangible asset unit of account are potentially impaired and whether the indefinite-life classification is still appropriate. 92 Table of Contents Critical Accounting Policies (continued) Goodwill and Intangible Assets (continued) Indefinite-lived and finite-lived intangibles (continued) If potential impairment circumstances are considered to exist, the Company will perform an impairment test, using an undiscounted cash flow analysis. If the asset is determined to be impaired, the difference between the book value of the asset and its current fair value is recognized as an expense in the period in which the impairment occurs. Actual results could differ from these cash flow estimates, which could materially impact the impairment conclusion. In addition, management judgment is required to estimate the period over which finite-lived intangible assets will contribute to the Company’s cash flows and the pattern in which these assets will be consumed. A change in the remaining useful life of any of these assets, or the reclassification of an indefinite-lived intangible asset to a finite-lived intangible asset, could have a significant impact on the Company’s amortization expense, which was $156 million, $160 million and $147 million for the years ended December 31, 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively. In 2011, 2010 and 2009, the Company performed impairment tests that indicated no impairment charges were required, the classification of indefinite-lived versus finite-lived intangibles was still appropriate and no changes to the expected lives of the finite-lived intangibles were required. The Company continuously monitors various factors, including AUM, for potential indicators of impairment. Income Taxes. The Company accounts for income taxes under the asset and liability method prescribed by ASC 740, Income Taxes. Deferred income tax assets and liabilities are recognized for future tax consequences attributable to temporary differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases using currently enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to reverse. The effect of a change in tax rates on deferred tax assets and liabilities is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date. The application of ASC 740 requires management to make estimates of the ranges of possible outcomes, the probability of favorable or unfavorable tax outcomes and potential interest and penalties related to such unfavorable outcomes, that require significant management judgment. Actual future tax consequences relating to uncertain tax positions may be materially different than the Company’s current estimates. At December 31, 2011, BlackRock had $349 million of gross unrecognized tax benefits, of which $226 million, if recognized, would affect the effective tax rate. In accordance with ASC 740, management is required to estimate the timing of the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities, make assumptions about the future deductibility of deferred income tax assets and assess deferred income tax liabilities based on enacted tax rates for the appropriate tax jurisdictions to determine the amount of such deferred income tax assets and liabilities. At December 31, 2011, the Company had deferred tax assets of $6 million and deferred tax liabilities of approximately $5,323 million on the consolidated statement of financial condition. Changes in the calculated deferred tax assets and liabilities may occur in certain circumstances, including statutory income tax rate changes, statutory tax law changes, changes in the anticipated timing of recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities or changes in the structure or tax status of the Company. ASC 740 requires the Company to assess whether a valuation allowance should be established against its deferred income tax assets based on consideration of all available evidence, both positive and negative, using a more likely than not standard. This assessment considers, among other matters, the nature, frequency and severity of recent losses, forecast of future profitability, the duration of statutory carry back and carry forward periods, the Company’s experience with tax attributes expiring unused, and tax planning alternatives. 93 Table of Contents Critical Accounting Policies (continued) Income Taxes (continued) At December 31, 2011, the Company had recorded a deferred tax asset of $110 million for unrealized investment losses; however, no valuation allowance has been established because the Company expects to be able to carry back a portion of its unrealized capital losses when realized, hold certain equity method investments which invest in fixed income securities over a period sufficient for them to recover their unrealized losses, and generate future capital gains sufficient to offset the unrealized capital losses. Based on the weight of available evidence, it is more likely than not that the deferred tax asset will be realized. However, changes in circumstance could cause the Company to revalue its deferred tax balances with the resulting change impacting the consolidated statements of income in the period of the change. Such changes may be material to the Company’s consolidated financial statements. See Note 19, Income Taxes, to the consolidated financial statements beginning on page F-1 of this Form 10-K for further details. The Company records income taxes based upon its estimated income tax liability or benefit. The Company’s actual tax liability or benefit may differ from the estimated income tax liability or benefit. The Company had current income taxes receivable of approximately $108 million and current income taxes payable of $102 million at December 31, 2011. Revenue Recognition. Investment advisory and administration fees are recognized as the services are performed. Such fees are primarily based on pre-determined percentages of the market value of AUM or, in the case of certain real estate clients, net operating income generated by the underlying properties. Investment advisory and administration fees are affected by changes in AUM, including market appreciation or depreciation, foreign exchange translation and net subscriptions or redemptions. Investment advisory and administration fees for investment funds are shown net of fees waived pursuant to contractual expense limitations of the funds or voluntary waivers. The Company contracts with third parties and related parties for various fund distribution and shareholder servicing to be performed on behalf of certain funds managed by the Company. Such arrangements generally are priced as a portion of the management fee paid by the fund. In certain cases, the fund takes on the primary responsibility for payment for services such that BlackRock bears no credit risk to the third party. The Company accounts for such retrocession arrangements in accordance with ASC 605-45, Revenue Recognition – Principle Agent Considerations (“ASC 605-45”), and records its management fees net of retrocessions. Retrocessions for the years ended December 31, 2011, 2010 and 2009 were $928 million, $831 million and $611 million, respectively. The Company has additional contracts for similar services with third parties, which due to the terms of the contracts, are recorded as distribution and servicing costs and thus not netted on the consolidated statements of income. The Company earns revenue by lending securities on behalf of clients, primarily to brokerage institutions. Such revenues are accounted for on an accrual basis. The securities loaned are secured by collateral in the form of cash and securities, generally ranging from 102% to 112% of the value of the loaned securities. The revenue earned is shared between the Company and the funds or other third-party accounts managed by the Company from which the securities are borrowed. For the years ended December 31, 2011, 2010 and 2009, securities lending revenue totaled $397 million, $325 million and $36 million, respectively, and is recorded in investment advisory, administration fees and securities lending revenue on the consolidated statements of income. Investment advisory, administration fees and securities lending revenue are reported together as the fees for these services often are agreed upon with clients as a bundled fee. 94 Table of Contents Critical Accounting Policies (continued) Revenue Recognition (continued) The Company receives performance fees or incentive allocations from alternative investment products and certain separately managed accounts. These performance fees are earned upon exceeding specified relative and/or absolute investment return thresholds. Such fees are recorded upon completion of the measurement period, which varies by product or account, and could be monthly, quarterly, annually or longer. For the years ended December 31, 2011, 2010 and 2009, performance fee revenue totaled $371 million, $540 million and $202 million, respectively. In addition, the Company receives carried interest from certain alternative products upon exceeding performance thresholds. BlackRock may be required to return all, or part, of such carried interest depending upon performance of these funds. Therefore, BlackRock records carried interest subject to such claw-back provisions in investments or cash to the extent that it is distributed, on its consolidated statements of financial condition. Carried interest is realized and recorded as performance fees upon the earlier of the termination of the investment fund or when the likelihood of claw-back is mathematically improbable. The Company records realized carried interest as performance fees on its consolidated statements of income. The Company records a deferred carried interest liability to the extent it receives cash or capital allocations related to carried interest prior to meeting the revenue recognition criteria. At December 31, 2011 and 2010, the Company had $33 million and $23 million, respectively, of deferred carried interest recorded in other liabilities on the consolidated statements of financial condition. The ultimate recognition of revenue, if any, for these products is unknown. Fees earned for BlackRock Solutions, which include advisory services, are recorded as services are performed and are determined using some, or all, of the following methods: (i) fixed fees, (ii) percentages of various attributes of advisory AUM or value of positions on the Aladdin platform and (iii) performance fees if contractual thresholds are met. Revenue earned on advisory assignments was comprised of one-time advisory and portfolio structuring fees and ongoing fees based on AUM of the respective portfolio assignment. For the years ended December 31, 2011, 2010 and 2009, BlackRock Solutions and advisory revenue totaled $510 million, $460 million and $477 million, respectively. Adjustments to revenue arising from initial estimates historically have been immaterial since the majority of BlackRock’s investment advisory and administration revenue is calculated based on the fair value of AUM and since the Company does not record performance revenues until performance thresholds have been exceeded and the likelihood of claw-back is mathematically improbable. 95 Table of Contents Recent Accounting Pronouncements Not Yet Adopted Amendments to Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures. In May 2011, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) issued ASU 2011-04, Fair Value Measurement: Amendments to Achieve Common Fair Value Measurement and Disclosure Requirements in U.S. GAAP and IFRSs (“ASU 2011-04”), which amends the existing fair value guidance within ASC 820. The amendments include: (1) application of the concepts of highest and best use and valuation premise only to measuring the fair value of nonfinancial assets (that is, it does not apply to financial assets or any liabilities), (2) an exception to fair value measurement principles for financial assets and financial liabilities (and derivatives) with offsetting positions in market risks or counterparty credit risk, which allows an entity to measure the fair value of the net risk position, when several criteria are met, (3) extension of the prohibition of a blockage factor application to all fair value measurements, (4) a model for the fair value measurement of instruments classified within an entity’s shareholders’ equity which is consistent with the guidance of measuring the fair value for liabilities, (5) additional disclosures for fair value measurements categorized in Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy including: (i) quantitative information about unobservable inputs used, (ii) a description of the valuation processes used by the entity and (iii) a qualitative discussion about the sensitivity of the measurements, (6) disclosure of the level in the fair value hierarchy of assets and liabilities not recorded at fair value but where fair value is disclosed and (7) disclosure of any transfers between Levels 1 and 2 of the fair value hierarchy, not just significant transfers. The provisions of ASU 2011-04 are effective for the Company for the interim period beginning after December 15, 2011. The adoption of ASU 2011-04 is not expected to materially impact BlackRock’s consolidated financial statements. Amendments to Goodwill Impairment Testing. In September 2011, the FASB issued ASU 2011-08, Testing Goodwill for Impairment (“ASU 2011-08”), which amends the guidance in ASC 350 on testing goodwill for impairment. Under the revised guidance, entities testing goodwill for impairment have the option of performing a qualitative assessment before calculating the fair value of the reporting unit (i.e., step 1 of the goodwill impairment test). If entities determine, on the basis of qualitative factors, that the fair value of the reporting unit is more likely than not to be less than the carrying amount, the two-step impairment test would be required. The amendments are effective for the Company for annual and interim goodwill impairment tests performed beginning after December 15, 2011. The provisions of SU 2011-08, if elected to be adopted, are not expected to materially impact BlackRock’s consolidated financial statements. 96 Table of Contents Item 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK AUM Market Price Risk. BlackRock’s investment advisory and administration fees are primarily comprised of fees based on a percentage of the value of AUM and, in some cases, performance fees expressed as a percentage of the returns realized on AUM. At December 31, 2011, the majority of the Company’s investment advisory and administration fees was based on average or period end AUM of the applicable investment funds or separate accounts. Movements in equity market prices, interest rates/credit spreads, foreign exchange rates or all three could cause the value of AUM to decline, which would result in lower investment advisory and administration fees. Corporate Investments Portfolio Risks. As a leading investment management firm, BlackRock devotes significant resources across all of its operations to identifying, measuring, monitoring, managing and analyzing market and operating risks, including the management and oversight of its own investment portfolio. The Board of Directors of the Company has adopted guidelines for the review of investments to be made by the Company, requiring, among other things, investments be reviewed by the Company’s Capital Committee, which consists of senior officers of the Company, and that certain investments may be referred to the Audit Committee or the Board of Directors, depending on the circumstances, for approval. In the normal course of its business, BlackRock is exposed to equity market price risk, interest rate/credit spread risk and foreign exchange rate risk associated with its corporate investments. BlackRock has investments primarily in sponsored investment products that invest in a variety of asset classes including real estate, private equity and hedge funds. Investments generally are made for co-investment purposes, to establish a performance track record, to hedge exposure to certain deferred compensation plans or for regulatory purposes. Currently, the Company has a seed capital hedging program in which it enters into total return swaps to hedge exposure to certain investments. At December 31, 2011, the outstanding total return swaps had an aggregate notional value of approximately $43 million. 97 Table of Contents Corporate Investments Portfolio Risks (continued) At December 31, 2011, approximately $587 million of BlackRock’s total investments were maintained in sponsored investment funds deemed to be controlled by BlackRock in accordance with GAAP and therefore are consolidated even though BlackRock may not own a majority of such funds. Excluding the impact of the Federal Reserve Bank stock, carried interest, investments made to hedge exposure to certain deferred compensation plans and certain equity investments that are hedged via the seed capital hedging program, the Company’s economic exposure to its investment portfolio is as follows: (Dollar amounts in millions) December 31,2011 December 31,2010 Variance Amount % Change Total investments, GAAP $ 1,631 $ 1,540 $ 91 6 % Investments held by consolidated sponsored investment funds (587 ) (397 ) (190 ) (48 %) Net exposure to consolidated investment funds 475 260 215 83 % Total investments, as adjusted 1,519 1,403 116 8 % Federal Reserve Bank stock (328 ) (325 ) (3 ) (1 %) Carried interest (21 ) (13 ) (8 ) (62 %) Deferred compensation investments (65 ) (76 ) 11 14 % Hedged investments (43 ) (25 ) (18 ) (72 %) Total “economic” investment exposure $ 1,062 $ 964 $ 98 10 % The “economic” investment exposure of the portfolio is presented in either the equity market price or the interest rate/credit spread risk disclosures below: Equity Market Price Risk. At December 31, 2011, the Company’s net exposure to market price risk in its investment portfolio was approximately $596 million of the Company’s total economic investment exposure. Investments subject to market price risk include private equity and real estate investments, hedge funds and fund of funds as well as mutual funds. The Company estimates that a 10% adverse change in market prices would result in a decrease of approximately $59.6 million in the carrying value of such investments. Interest Rate/Credit Spread Risk. At December 31, 2011, the Company was exposed to interest-rate risk and credit spread risk as a result of approximately $466 million of investments in debt securities and sponsored investment products that invest primarily in debt securities. Management considered a hypothetical 100 basis point fluctuation in interest rates or credit spreads and estimates that the impact of such a fluctuation on these investments, in the aggregate, would result in a decrease, or increase, of approximately $3 million in the carrying value of such investments. Foreign Exchange Rate Risk. As discussed above, the Company invests in sponsored investment products that invest in a variety of asset classes. The carrying value of the total economic investment exposure denominated in foreign currencies, primarily the pound sterling and euro was $152 million. A 10% adverse change in the applicable foreign exchange rates would result in approximately a $15.2 million decline in the carrying value of such investments. 98 Table of Contents",2023-12-30 18:59:08.780038

GAAP. Operating income of $3,524 million and operating margin of 37.7% increased $275 million and 190 bps, respectively, from 2011 reflecting growth in base fees and higher performance fees. Operating income in 2012 included a $30 million charge related to a contribution to certain of the Company’s bank-managed short-term investment funds (“STIFs”). Non-operating income (expense), less net income (loss) attributable to non-controlling interests) increased $80 million due to higher net positive marks on investments in 2012 compared with 2011, partially offset by higher interest expense resulting from long-term debt issuances in May 2012 and May 2011. In 2012, income tax expense included a $21 million benefit related to the resolution of certain outstanding tax positions and a $50 million net non-cash benefit related to the revaluation of certain deferred income tax liabilities including tax legislation enacted in the United Kingdom and the state and local income tax effect resulting from changes in the Company’s organizational structure. In 2011, income tax expenses included a $24 million benefit related to the resolution of certain outstanding tax positions and $198 million of net non-cash tax benefits due to a state tax election and enacted U.K., Japan, U.S. state and local tax legislation. Earnings per diluted common share rose $1.42 from 2011 due to higher net income and the benefit of share repurchases. During 2012, the Company repurchased 9.1 million shares. As Adjusted. Operating income of $3,574 million and operating margin of 40.4% increased $182 million and 70 bps, respectively, from 2011 reflecting higher revenues. Operating income on an as adjusted basis excluded non-GAAP expense adjustments totaling $50 million in 2012 and $143 million in 2011. Non-operating income (expense), less net income (loss) attributable to non-controlling interests) increased $71 million. Income tax expense on an as adjusted basis excluded the $50 million and $198 million non-cash benefits for 2012 and 2011, respectively, described above. Earnings per diluted common share rose $1.83 from 2011 reflecting the improvement in net income and the benefit of share repurchases. See Non-GAAP Financial Measures for further information on as adjusted items. 2011 Compared with 2010. GAAP. Operating income of $3,249 million and operating margin of 35.8% increased $251 million and 100 bps, respectively, from 2010 reflecting higher base fees and higher BlackRock Solutions and advisory revenue, partially offset by lower performance fees and higher operating expenses related to business growth. Operating income and operating margin in 2011 also reflected $63 million of U.K. lease exit costs related to the Company’s exit from two London locations and $32 million of restructuring charges. Results for 2010 included $90 million of Barclays Global Investors (“BGI”) integration costs. Non-operating income (expense), less net income (loss) attributable to non-controlling interests) decreased $152 million due to lower net positive marks on investments compared with 2010 and higher interest expense resulting from long-term debt issuances in May 2011. Income tax expense in 2011 included the previously mentioned $24 million benefit and $198 million of net non-cash tax benefits.

For further discussion of BlackRock’s revenue, expenses, non-operating results and income tax expense, see Discussion of Financial Results herein. Business Outlook BlackRock offers clients a broad range of equity, fixed income, multi-asset and alternative investment products designed to track various indices (beta), achieve returns in excess of specified benchmarks (alpha) or deliver absolute returns. The diversity of BlackRock’s investment platform, across asset classes, investment styles and geographies – combined with world-class risk management, analytics and advisory expertise – positions the Company well to meet the needs of clients in 2013 and beyond and to continue to attract asset flows as investor needs and sentiment evolve. BlackRock ended 2012 with record assets under management (“AUM”) of $3.792 trillion as clients sought efficient tools and innovative solutions to meet their investment objectives over both the short and long term. The Company experienced strong client demand for exchange traded funds and products (“ETFs” and “ETPs”, respectively), alternative and emerging market investment products, high-yielding income strategies, outcome-oriented solutions and retirement-related products, and the Company expects this demand to continue into 2013. 37 Table of Contents In early 2013, BlackRock continues to see signs of an improving global economy. While this offers the potential for greater financial market stability, political and regulatory dynamics, persistent low interest rates and protracted periods of heightened volatility will continue to pose challenges in the investment landscape. BlackRock will continue to monitor these factors actively in 2013, along with global credit and monetary policies (including quantitative easing and the direction of interest rates) and their effects on corporate earnings growth. While investing for stable income remains a core objective for many of its clients, BlackRock expects clients – particularly in its institutional business – to trend towards barbelling their risk profile through the combination of active and index strategies and the use of alternative and multi-asset investment solutions, complemented with access to BlackRock’s risk management tools and advisory services. AUM and Flows • BlackRock’s unique combination of index and active capabilities positions the Company well to help underfunded corporate and public pension plans narrow the gap between their assets and liabilities with barbell strategies that use a combination of index, alpha, multi-asset and alternative products. As responsibility for retirement funding continues to move away from defined benefit plans into defined contributions plans and ultimately to individuals, BlackRock is also well positioned to offer individual investment options through its LifePath® target date portfolios and a wide array of ETFs and other mutual fund products. • BlackRock has a leading global market share in ETPs through iShares, which leads the industry in AUM and the number of products offered in various markets. The industry’s global growth reflects both continued adoption of ETFs by institutional and retail investors and the introduction of new products. ETP asset growth has historically been linked to positive markets, with investors looking to capitalize on strong market returns. In the continued environment of ultra-low interest rates, industry flows shifted in 2012 toward fixed income products and, within equities, to developed markets. BlackRock believes there is opportunity in emerging markets and is well positioned to grow its active franchise in these markets, including China. While more asset managers may enter the marketplace and offer similar products at lower fees, BlackRock believes that many factors beyond price influence investor preferences. These preferences are driven to varying degrees by performance (as measured by tracking error, or the difference between net returns on the ETP and the corresponding targeted index), liquidity (the bid-ask spread), tax-efficiency, transparency and client service. • BlackRock believes alternative investments will continue to become more important for both institutional and retail clients seeking higher returns through alpha-generating products. Several of BlackRock’s single strategy hedge funds are top performers in the industry and are well positioned to grow in 2013. • Cash management assets may decline from year-end levels if clients begin to re-risk their portfolios in the search for yield or equity return opportunities amid continued low interest rates, including in the United States where the Federal Reserve expects rates to remain low until 2014. BlackRock’s diversified global product offerings, record of client service and independent advisory capabilities may enable it to retain a portion of these assets. Regulatory Reform • BlackRock will continue to monitor the evolving regulatory landscape and to assess its influence on the competitive environment, including on liquidity and trading costs, which may present risks as well as opportunities for BlackRock and its clients. Performance fees and BRS/advisory fees • BlackRock improved investment performance in key areas such as fixed income and scientific active equity in 2012 and strong investment performance will again be a priority in 2013. Higher market levels and investment performance may continue to enable the Company’s alternative investment products to contribute additional performance fee revenue. • BlackRock expects continuing strong global demand for its Aladdin operating platform and its comprehensive risk reporting capabilities from sophisticated institutional investors and governmental agencies investing in longer-term risk management solutions. The Company also expects to see continuing strong demand for its BlackRock Solutions financial markets advisory services. Future opportunities • BlackRock intends to continue to invest in its people, its platform and its global brand. The Company will continue to build out its product offering and geographic presence, including in emerging markets, and to grow its iShares franchise, both through organic growth and targeted acquisitions. 38 Table of Contents Non-GAAP Financial Measures BlackRock reports its financial results in accordance with GAAP; however, management believes evaluating the Company’s ongoing operating results may be enhanced if investors have additional non-GAAP basis financial measures. Management reviews non-GAAP financial measures to assess ongoing operations and, for the reasons described below, considers them to be effective indicators, for both management and investors, of BlackRock’s financial performance over time. BlackRock’s management does not advocate that investors consider such non-GAAP financial measures in isolation from, or as a substitute for, financial information prepared in accordance with GAAP. Computations for all periods are derived from the consolidated statements of income as follows: (a) Operating income, as adjusted, and operating margin, as adjusted: Operating income, as adjusted, equals operating income, GAAP basis, excluding certain items management deems non-recurring, or transactions that ultimately will not impact BlackRock’s book value, as indicated in the table below. Operating income used for operating margin measurement equals operating income, as adjusted, excluding the impact of closed-end fund launch costs and commissions. Operating margin, as adjusted, equals operating income used for operating margin measurement, divided by revenue (net of distribution and servicing costs and amortization of deferred sales commissions) used for operating margin measurement, as indicated in the table below. (Dollar amounts in millions) 2012 2011 2010 Operating income, GAAP basis $ 3,524 $ 3,249 $ 2,998 Non-GAAP expense adjustments: BGI transaction/integration costs Employee compensation and benefits — — 25 General and administration — — 65 Total BGI transaction/integration costs — — 90 U.K. lease exit costs (8 ) 63 — Contribution to STIFs 30 — — Restructuring charges — 32 — PNC LTIP funding obligation 22 44 58 Merrill Lynch compensation contribution — 7 10 Compensation expense related to appreciation (depreciation) on deferred compensation plans 6 (3 ) 11 Operating income, as adjusted 3,574 3,392 3,167 Closed-end fund launch costs 22 26 15 Closed-end fund launch commissions 3 3 2 Operating income used for operating margin measurement $ 3,599 $ 3,421 $ 3,184 Revenue, GAAP basis $ 9,337 $ 9,081 $ 8,612 Non-GAAP adjustments: Distribution and servicing costs (364 ) (386 ) (408 ) Amortization of deferred sales commissions (55 ) (81 ) (102 ) Revenue used for operating margin measurement $ 8,918 $ 8,614 $ 8,102 Operating margin, GAAP basis 37.7 % 35.8 % 34.8 % Operating margin, as adjusted 40.4 % 39.7 % 39.3 % Management believes operating income, as adjusted, and operating margin, as adjusted, are effective indicators of BlackRock’s financial performance over time and, therefore, provide useful disclosure to investors. Operating income, as adjusted: Operating income, as adjusted reflects non-GAAP expense adjustments. BGI transaction and integration costs consisted principally of compensation expense, legal fees, marketing and promotional, occupancy and consulting expenses incurred in conjunction with the BGI acquisition from Barclays. U.K. lease exit costs represent costs to exit two locations in London in the third quarter 2011. The amount in 2012 represents an adjustment related to the estimated costs initially recorded in third quarter 2011. The contribution to STIFs represents a one-time contribution to certain of the Company’s bank-managed STIFs (see Liquidity and Capital Resources for more information). Restructuring charges consist of compensation costs and professional fees. 39 Table of Contents The portion of compensation expense associated with certain long-term incentive plans (“LTIP”) funded or to be funded through share distributions to participants of BlackRock stock held by PNC and a Merrill Lynch & Co., Inc. (“Merrill Lynch”) cash compensation contribution, has been excluded because it ultimately does not impact BlackRock’s book value. The expense related to the Merrill Lynch cash compensation contribution ceased at the end of third quarter 2011. As of first quarter 2012, all of the Merrill Lynch contributions had been received. Compensation expense associated with appreciation (depreciation) on investments related to certain BlackRock deferred compensation plans has been excluded as returns on investments set aside for these plans, which substantially offset this expense, are reported in non-operating income (expense). Management believes operating income exclusive of these items is a useful measure in evaluating BlackRock’s operating performance and helps enhance the comparability of this information for the reporting periods presented. Operating margin, as adjusted: Operating income used for measuring operating margin, as adjusted, is equal to operating income, as adjusted, excluding the impact of closed-end fund launch costs and commissions. Management believes the exclusion of such costs and commissions is useful because these costs can fluctuate considerably and revenues associated with the expenditure of these costs will not fully impact the Company’s results until future periods. Operating margin, as adjusted, allows the Company to compare performance from period-to-period by adjusting for items that may not recur, recur infrequently or may have an economic offset in non-operating income (expense). Examples of such adjustments include BGI transaction and integration costs, U.K. lease exit costs, contribution to STIFs, restructuring charges, closed-end fund launch costs, commissions paid to certain employees as compensation and fluctuations in compensation expense based on mark-to-market movements in investments held to fund certain compensation plans. The Company also uses operating margin, as adjusted, to monitor corporate performance and efficiency and as a benchmark to compare its performance with other companies. Management uses both the GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures in evaluating the financial performance of BlackRock. The non-GAAP measure by itself may pose limitations because it does not include all of the Company’s revenues and expenses. Revenue used for operating margin, as adjusted, excludes distribution and servicing costs paid to related parties and other third parties. Management believes the exclusion of such costs is useful because it creates consistency in the treatment for certain contracts for similar services, which due to the terms of the contracts, are accounted for under GAAP on a net basis within investment advisory, administration fees and securities lending revenue. Amortization of deferred sales commissions is excluded from revenue used for operating margin measurement, as adjusted, because such costs, over time, substantially offset distribution fee revenue earned by the Company. For each of these items, BlackRock excludes from revenue used for operating margin, as adjusted, the costs related to each of these items as a proxy for such offsetting revenues. (b) Non-operating income (expense), less net income (loss) attributable to non-controlling interests, as adjusted: Non-operating income (expense), less net income (loss) attributable to NCI, as adjusted, is presented below. The compensation expense offset is recorded in operating income. This compensation expense has been included in non-operating income (expense), less net income (loss) attributable to NCI, as adjusted, to offset returns on investments set aside for these plans, which are reported in non-operating income (expense), GAAP basis. (Dollar amounts in millions) 2012 2011 2010 Non-operating income (expense), GAAP basis $ (54 ) $ (114 ) $ 23 Less: Net income (loss) attributable to NCI (18 ) 2 (13 ) Non-operating income (expense)(1) (36 ) (116 ) 36 Compensation expense related to (appreciation) depreciation on deferred compensation plans (6 ) 3 (11 ) Non-operating income (expense), less net income (loss) attributable to NCI, as adjusted $ (42 ) $ (113 ) $ 25 (1) Net of net income (loss) attributable to NCI. Management believes non-operating income (expense), less net income (loss) attributable to NCI, as adjusted, provides comparability of this information among reporting periods and is an effective measure for reviewing BlackRock’s non-operating contribution to its results. As compensation expense associated with (appreciation) depreciation on investments related to certain deferred compensation plans, which is included in operating income, substantially offsets the gain (loss) on the investments set aside for these plans, management 40 Table of Contents believes non-operating income (expense), less net income (loss) attributable to NCI, as adjusted, provides a useful measure, for both management and investors, of BlackRock’s non-operating results that impact book value. (c) Net income attributable to BlackRock, as adjusted: Management believes net income attributable to BlackRock, as adjusted, and diluted earnings per common share, as adjusted, are useful measures of BlackRock’s profitability and financial performance. Net income attributable to BlackRock, as adjusted, equals net income attributable to BlackRock, GAAP basis, adjusted for significant non-recurring items, charges that ultimately will not impact BlackRock’s book value or certain tax items that do not impact cash flow.

During 2012, income tax changes included adjustments related to the revaluation of certain deferred income tax liabilities due to tax legislation enacted in the United Kingdom and the state and local income tax effect resulting from changes in the Company’s organizational structure. During 2011 and 2010, income tax changes included adjustments related to the revaluation of certain deferred income tax liabilities due to a state tax election and enacted U.K., Japan, U.S. state and local tax legislation. The resulting decrease in income taxes has been excluded from net income attributable to BlackRock, Inc., as adjusted, as these items do not have a cash flow impact and to ensure comparability among periods presented. (d) In 2012, 2011 and 2010 non-GAAP adjustments were tax effected at 31.4%, 31.8% and 33%, respectively, reflecting a blended rate applicable to the adjustments. (e) Amounts exclude net income attributable to participating securities (see below). (f) Non-voting participating preferred shares are considered to be common stock equivalents for purposes of determining basic and diluted earnings per share calculations. Certain unvested RSUs are not included in diluted weighted-average common shares outstanding as they are deemed participating securities in accordance with required provisions of Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”) 260-10, Earnings per Share. In 2012, 2011 and 2010, average outstanding participating securities were 0.2 million, 1.8 million and 2.8 million, respectively. 41 Table of Contents Assets Under Management AUM for reporting purposes generally is based upon how investment advisory and administration fees are calculated for each portfolio.

(3) Advisory AUM represents long-term portfolio liquidation assignments. (4) Amounts include outflows due to manager concentration considerations prior to third quarter 2011 and outflows from scientific active equity performance prior to second quarter 2011. As a result of client investment manager concentration limits and the scientific active equity performance, outflows were expected to occur for a period of time subsequent to the close of the transaction. (5) Amounts include AUM acquired from Swiss Re Private Equity Partners (the “SRPEP Transaction”) in September 2012 of $6.2 billion, the Claymore Investments, Inc. acquisition (the “Claymore Transaction”) in March 2012 of $7.6 billion and BGI acquisition adjustments in 2010 of $6.2 billion. (6) Foreign exchange reflects the impact of converting non-U.S. dollar denominated AUM into U.S. dollars for reporting purposes. BlackRock has historically grown aggregate AUM through organic growth and acquisitions. Management believes that the Company will be able to continue to grow AUM by focusing on strong investment performance, the efficient delivery of beta for index products, client service, by developing new products and new distribution capabilities and by continuing appropriate acquisitions.

(3) Foreign exchange reflects the impact of converting non-U.S. dollar denominated AUM into U.S. dollars for reporting purposes. (4) Amounts include commodity iShares. (5) Advisory AUM represents long-term portfolio liquidation assignments. AUM increased $278.9 billion, or 8%, to $3.792 trillion at December 31, 2012 from $3.513 trillion at December 31, 2011. The increase in AUM was driven largely by market gains and positive net new business, excluding the effect of two single client low-fee, institutional index fixed income outflows of $36.0 billion and $74.2 billion in first quarter 2012 and third quarter 2012, respectively. Total flows included $74.5 billion of planned advisory distributions and acquired AUM related to the SRPEP and the Claymore Transactions of $13.7 billion. Net market appreciation of $321.4 billion reflected growth in U.S. and global equity markets and $67.8 billion appreciation in fixed income products across the majority of strategies. The $15.7 billion net increase in AUM from converting non-U.S. dollar denominated AUM into U.S. dollars was primarily due to the weakening of the U.S. dollar against the pound sterling and the euro, partially offset by the strengthening of the U.S. dollar against the Japanese yen.

(3) Foreign exchange reflects the impact of converting non-U.S. dollar denominated AUM into U.S. dollars for reporting purposes. (4) Amounts include commodity iShares. (5) Advisory AUM represents long-term portfolio liquidation assignments. 44 Table of Contents AUM decreased approximately $48.3 billion, or 1%, to $3.513 trillion at December 31, 2011 from $3.561 trillion at December 31, 2010. The decline in AUM was primarily attributable to $34.6 billion in net market and foreign exchange valuation declines, $29.9 billion of advisory distributions and $22.9 billion of cash management net outflows, partially offset by $67.3 billion of long-term net new business, before giving effect to the final BGI merger-related outflows of $28.3 billion recorded in the first half of 2011. Net market depreciation of $27.5 billion included $128.1 billion of depreciation in equity products resulting from the decline in global equity, partially offset by appreciation in fixed income products of $100.7 billion. The $7.1 billion net decrease in AUM from converting non-U.S. dollar denominated AUM into U.S. dollars was primarily due to the strengthening of the U.S. dollar against the euro, pound sterling and Canadian dollar, partially offset by weakening of the U.S. dollar against the Japanese yen. Discussion of Financial Results Introduction BlackRock derives a substantial portion of its revenue from investment advisory and administration fees, which are recognized as the services are performed. Such fees are primarily based on pre-determined percentages of the market value of AUM or percentages of committed capital during investment periods of certain alternative products and are affected by changes in AUM, including market appreciation or depreciation, foreign exchange translation and net subscriptions or redemptions. Net subscriptions or redemptions represent the sum of new client assets, additional fundings from existing clients (including dividend reinvestment), withdrawals of assets from, and termination of, client accounts and distributions to investors representing return of capital and return on investments to investors. Market appreciation or depreciation includes current income earned on, and changes in the fair value of, securities held in client accounts. Foreign exchange translation reflects the impact of converting non-U.S. dollar denominated AUM into U.S. dollars for reporting purposes. BlackRock also earns revenue by lending securities on behalf of clients, primarily to brokerage institutions. The securities loaned are secured by collateral in the form of cash or securities, with minimum collateral generally ranging from approximately 102% to 112% of the value of the loaned securities. The revenue earned is shared between BlackRock and the funds or other third-party accounts managed by the Company from which the securities are borrowed. Historically, securities lending revenue in the second quarter exceeds the other quarters during the year. Investment advisory agreements for certain separate accounts and investment funds provide for performance fees, based upon relative and/or absolute investment performance, in addition to base fees based on AUM. Investment advisory performance fees generally are earned after a given period of time and when investment performance exceeds a contractual threshold. As such, the timing of recognition of performance fees may increase the volatility of BlackRock’s revenue and earnings. Historically, the magnitude of performance fees in the third and fourth quarters generally exceeds the first two calendar quarters in a year due to the greater number of products with performance measurement periods that end on either September 30 or December 31. BlackRock provides a variety of risk management, investment analytic and investment system and advisory services to financial institutions, pension funds, asset managers, foundations, consultants, mutual fund sponsors, real estate investment trusts and government agencies. These services are provided under the brand name BlackRock Solutions and include a wide array of risk management services, valuation services related to illiquid securities, disposition and workout assignments (including long-term portfolio liquidation assignments), strategic planning and execution, and enterprise investment system outsourcing to clients. Approximately $14 trillion of positions are processed on the Company’s Aladdin® operating platform, which serves as the investment/risk solutions system for BlackRock and other institutional investors. Fees earned for BlackRock Solutions and advisory services are determined using some, or all, of the following methods: (i) percentages of various attributes of advisory AUM or value of positions on the Aladdin platform, (ii) fixed fees and (iii) performance fees if contractual thresholds are met. BlackRock builds upon its leadership position to meet the growing need for investment and risk management solutions. Through its scale and diversity of products, it is able to provide its clients with customized solutions including fiduciary outsourcing for liability-driven investments and overlay strategies for pension plan sponsors, balance sheet management and related services for insurance companies and target date and target return funds, as well as asset allocation portfolios, for retail investors. BlackRock is also able to service these clients via its Aladdin platform to provide risk management and other outsourcing services for institutional investors and custom and tailored solutions to address complex risk exposures. 45 Table of Contents The Company earns fees for transition management services comprised of commissions from acting as an introducing broker-dealer in buying and selling securities on behalf of its customers. Commissions related to transition management services are recorded on a trade-date basis as securities transactions occur. The Company also earns revenue related to operating advisory company investments accounted for as equity method investments. Operating expenses reflect employee compensation and benefits, distribution and servicing costs, amortization of deferred sales commissions, direct fund expenses, general and administration expenses and amortization of finite-lived intangible assets. • Employee compensation and benefits expense includes salaries, commissions, temporary help, deferred and incentive compensation, employer payroll taxes, severance and related benefit costs. • Distribution and servicing costs, which are primarily AUM driven, include payments made to Merrill Lynch-affiliated entities under a global distribution agreement, to PNC and Barclays, as well as other third parties, primarily associated with obtaining and retaining client investments in certain BlackRock products. • Direct fund expenses primarily consist of third-party non-advisory expenses incurred by BlackRock related to certain funds for the use of index trademarks, reference data for indices, custodial services, fund administration, fund accounting, transfer agent services, shareholder reporting services, legal expenses, audit and tax services as well as other fund-related expenses directly attributable to the non-advisory operations of the fund. These expenses may vary over time with fluctuations in AUM, number of shareholder accounts, or other attributes directly related to volume of business. • General and administration expenses include marketing and promotional, occupancy and office-related costs, portfolio services (including clearing expenses related to transition management services), technology, professional services, communications, closed-end fund launch costs and other general and administration expenses, including the impact of foreign currency remeasurement. Non-operating income (expense) includes the effect of changes in the valuations on investments (excluding available-for-sale investments) and earnings on equity method investments, as well as interest and dividend income and interest expense. Other comprehensive income includes changes in valuations related to available-for-sale investments. BlackRock primarily holds seed and co-investments in sponsored investment products that invest in a variety of asset classes, including private equity, distressed credit/mortgage debt securities, hedge funds and real estate. Investments generally are made for co-investment purposes, to establish a performance track record, to hedge exposure to certain deferred compensation plans or for regulatory purposes, including Federal Reserve Bank stock. BlackRock does not engage in proprietary trading activities that could conflict with the interests of its clients. In addition, non-operating income (expense) includes the impact of changes in the valuations of consolidated sponsored investment funds and consolidated collateralized loan obligations (“CLOs”). The portion of non-operating income (expense) not attributable to BlackRock is allocated to NCI on the consolidated statements of income. 46 Table of Contents Revenue Variance (Dollar amounts in millions) 2012 2011 2010 2012 vs.2011 2011 vs.2010 Investment advisory, administration fees and securities lending revenue: Equity: Active $ 1,753 $ 1,967 $ 1,848 $ (214 ) $ 119 iShares 1,941 1,847 1,660 94 187 Fixed income: Active 1,182 1,104 1,047 78 57 iShares 441 317 263 124 54 Multi-asset class 957 894 740 63 154 Alternatives: Core 525 557 522 (32 ) 35 Currency and commodities 131 136 110 (5 ) 26 Sub-total 6,930 6,822 6,190 108 632 Non-ETF Index: Equity 552 488 424 64 64 Fixed income 229 203 166 26 37 Sub-total Non-ETF Index 781 691 590 90 101 Long-term 7,711 7,513 6,780 198 733 Cash management 361 383 510 (22 ) (127 ) Total base fees 8,072 7,896 7,290 176 606 Investment advisory performance fees: Equity 88 145 123 (57 ) 22 Fixed income 48 35 55 13 (20 ) Multi-asset class 15 20 33 (5 ) (13 ) Alternatives 312 171 329 141 (158 ) Total 463 371 540 92 (169 ) BlackRock Solutions and advisory 518 510 460 8 50 Distribution fees 71 100 116 (29 ) (16 ) Other revenue 213 204 206 9 (2 ) Total revenue $ 9,337 $ 9,081 $ 8,612 $ 256 $ 469 The table below lists the asset type mix of investment advisory, administration fees and securities lending revenue (collectively “base fees”) and mix of average AUM by asset class: Mix of Base Fees Mix of Average AUM by Asset Class(1) 2012 2011 2010 2012 2011 2010 Equity: Active 22 % 25 % 25 % 8 % 9 % 10 % iShares 23 % 23 % 23 % 13 % 13 % 12 % Fixed income: Active 15 % 14 % 14 % 18 % 18 % 19 % iShares 5 % 4 % 4 % 5 % 4 % 4 % Multi-asset class 12 % 11 % 10 % 7 % 6 % 5 % Alternatives: Core 7 % 7 % 7 % 2 % 2 % 2 % Currency and commodities 2 % 2 % 2 % 1 % 1 % 1 % Sub-total 86 % 86 % 85 % 54 % 53 % 53 % Non-ETF Index: Equity 7 % 6 % 6 % 27 % 26 % 26 % Fixed income 3 % 3 % 2 % 12 % 13 % 12 % Sub-total Non-ETF Index: 10 % 9 % 8 % 39 % 39 % 38 % Long-term 96 % 95 % 93 % 93 % 92 % 91 % Cash management 4 % 5 % 7 % 7 % 8 % 9 % Total excluding Advisory AUM 100 % 100 % 100 % 100 % 100 % 100 % (1) Average AUM represents a five point average of quarter-end spot AUM. 47 Table of Contents In 2012, non-ETF Index equity and fixed income were 10% of total base fees; however, AUM associated with these base fees represented 39% of total average AUM. In 2011, non-ETF Index equity and fixed income were 9% of total base fees; however, AUM associated with these base fees represented 39% of total average AUM. 2012 Compared with 2011. Revenues increased $256 million, or 3%, in 2012 reflecting market growth, positive flows, improvements in securities lending revenue and strength in performance fees. Investment Advisory, Administration Fees and Securities Lending Revenue. Investment advisory, administration fees and securities lending revenue totaled $8,072 million in 2012 compared with $7,896 million in 2011. The current year reflected an improvement in securities lending revenue and higher advisory fees reflecting higher long-term average AUM. Securities lending fees were $510 million in 2012 compared with $397 million in 2011, reflecting higher lending rates and an increase in average balances of securities on loan. Performance Fees. Investment advisory performance fees were $463 million in 2012 compared with $371 million in 2011, primarily reflecting higher performance fees from alternative products, including fees from a disposition-related opportunistic fund, which were partially offset by lower fees from equity products. BlackRock Solutions and Advisory. BlackRock Solutions and advisory revenue in 2012 increased $8 million, or 2%, from 2011, primarily due to higher revenue from Aladdin mandates partially offset by the run off of revenues associated with a lower level of advisory assets and lower one-term revenue from advisory assignments. Distribution Fees. Distribution fees of $71 million in 2012 decreased $29 million, or 29%, from $100 million in 2011, primarily due to lower AUM in certain share classes of BlackRock Funds. Other Revenue. Other revenue increased $9 million, largely reflecting higher earnings from certain operating advisory company investments, partially offset by lower sales commissions and marketing fees earned for services to distribute iPath® products. 2011 Compared with 2010. Revenues increased $469 million, or 5%, in 2011 largely reflecting a $606 million increase in total investment advisory, administration fees and securities lending revenue, partially offset by lower performance fees of $169 million. Investment Advisory, Administration Fees and Securities Lending Revenue. Investment advisory, administration fees and securities lending revenue totaled $7,896 million in 2011 compared with $7,290 million in 2010. 2011 reflected an improvement in base fees primarily due to growth in long-term average AUM, which included the benefit of net new business, partially offset by a decline in fees from cash management products due to lower average AUM and higher fee waivers. Securities lending fees were $397 million in 2011 compared with $325 million in 2010, reflecting an increase in average balances of securities on loan and higher lending rates. Performance Fees. Investment advisory performance fees were $371 million in 2011 compared with $540 million in 2010, primarily reflecting lower performance fees from alternative strategies, including multi-strategy and single-strategy equity and fixed income hedge funds and opportunistic funds. The decrease was partially offset by higher performance fees due to strong relative performance from regional/country and global equity strategies. BlackRock Solutions and Advisory. BlackRock Solutions and advisory revenue in 2011 increased $50 million, or 11%, from 2010, largely driven by on-going and additional Aladdin mandates and advisory assignments. Distribution Fees. Distribution fees of $100 million in 2011 decreased $16 million, or 14%, from $116 million in 2010, primarily due to lower AUM in certain share classes of BlackRock Funds. 48 Table of Contents Expenses Variance (Dollar amounts in millions) 2012 2011 2010 2012 Vs.2011 2011 Vs.2010 Expenses, GAAP: Employee compensation and benefits $ 3,287 $ 3,199 $ 3,097 $ 88 $ 102 Distribution and servicing costs 364 386 408 (22 ) (22 ) Amortization of deferred sales commissions 55 81 102 (26 ) (21 ) Direct fund expenses 591 563 493 28 70 General and administration: Marketing and promotional 384 315 328 69 (13 ) Occupancy and office related 248 373 317 (125 ) 56 Portfolio services 196 189 177 7 12 Technology 150 146 152 4 (6 ) Professional services 114 139 115 (25 ) 24 Communications 39 40 49 (1 ) (9 ) Regulatory, filing and license fees 17 16 34 1 (18 ) Charitable contributions 6 7 26 (1 ) (19 ) Closed-end fund launch costs 22 26 15 (4 ) 11 Other general and administration 183 164 141 19 23 Total general and administration expenses 1,359 1,415 1,354 (56 ) 61 Restructuring charges — 32 — (32 ) 32 Amortization of intangible assets 157 156 160 1 (4 ) Total expenses, GAAP $ 5,813 $ 5,832 $ 5,614 $ (19 ) $ 218 Less non-GAAP expense adjustments: Employee compensation and benefits: BGI integration costs — — 25 — (25 ) PNC LTIP funding obligation 22 44 58 (22 ) (14 ) Merrill Lynch compensation contribution — 7 10 (7 ) (3 ) Compensation expense related to appreciation (depreciation) on deferred compensation plans 6 (3 ) 11 9 (14 ) Sub-total 28 48 104 (20 ) (56 ) General and administration: BGI integration costs — — 65 — (65 ) U.K. lease exit costs (8 ) 63 — (71 ) 63 Contribution to STIFs 30 — — 30 — Sub-total 22 63 65 (41 ) (2 ) Restructuring charges — 32 — (32 ) 32 Total non-GAAP expense adjustments 50 143 169 (93 ) (26 ) Expenses, as adjusted: Employee compensation and benefits 3,259 3,151 2,993 108 158 Distribution and servicing costs 364 386 408 (22 ) (22 ) Amortization of deferred sales commissions 55 81 102 (26 ) (21 ) Direct fund expenses 591 563 493 28 70 General and administration 1,337 1,352 1,289 (15 ) 63 Amortization of intangible assets 157 156 160 1 (4 ) Total expenses, as adjusted $ 5,763 $ 5,689 $ 5,445 $ 74 $ 244 49 Table of Contents 2012 Compared with 2011. Total GAAP expenses decreased $19 million to $5,813 million in 2012 from $5,832 million in 2011. Excluding certain items deemed non-recurring by management or transactions that ultimately will not affect the Company’s book value, total expenses, as adjusted, increased $74 million. The increase in total expenses, as adjusted, is primarily attributable to increases in employee compensation and benefits and direct fund expenses, partially offset by a reduction in amortization of deferred sales commissions, distribution and servicing costs and general and administration expenses. Employee Compensation and Benefits. GAAP. Employee compensation and benefits expense increased $88 million, or 3%, to $3,287 million in 2012 from $3,199 million in 2011. Employees at December 31, 2012 totaled approximately 10,500 compared with approximately 10,100 at December 31, 2011. As Adjusted. Employee compensation and benefits, as adjusted, increased by $108 million, reflecting a $104 million increase in incentive compensation driven by higher operating income, including higher performance fees. Distribution and Servicing Costs. Distribution and servicing costs decreased $22 million, or 6%, to $364 million in 2012 from $386 million in 2011. The $22 million decrease related to lower service fees from variable annuities and lower cash management-related distribution costs. These costs included payments to Bank of America/Merrill Lynch under the global distribution agreement, PNC and Barclays, as well as other third parties, primarily associated with the distribution and servicing of client investments in certain BlackRock products. Distribution and servicing costs for 2012 and 2011 included $195 million and $207 million, respectively, of costs attributable to Bank of America and affiliates. Amortization of Deferred Sales Commissions. Amortization of deferred sales commissions decreased $26 million, or 32%, to $55 million in 2012 from $81 million in 2011, primarily related to lower sales in certain share classes of U.S. open-end mutual funds. Direct Fund Expenses. In 2012, direct fund expenses increased $28 million from 2011 million, primarily reflecting growth in average AUM for the funds (predominantly iShares) where BlackRock pays certain non-advisory expenses of the funds. General and Administration Expenses. GAAP. General and administration expenses decreased $56 million, or 4%, to $1,359 million in 2012 from $1,415 million in 2011. Lower occupancy and office-related expenses, primarily due to $63 million of U.K. lease exit costs incurred in the third quarter 2011, and lower professional services costs contributed to the overall net decrease in general and administration expenses. The decrease in general and administration expenses was partially offset by higher marketing and promotional expenses in connection with the brand campaign and a one-time contribution to STIFs (see Liquidity and Capital Resources for more information). Non-GAAP Adjustments. In 2012, general and administration expenses included the previously mentioned contribution to STIFs. In 2011, general and administration expenses included $63 million of U.K. lease exit costs related to the Company’s exit from two London locations. The adjustment for U.K. lease exit costs in 2012 represents an adjustment to the estimated costs initially recorded in 2011. These amounts were excluded from as adjusted general and administrative expenses. As Adjusted. General and administration expenses, as adjusted, of $1,337 million decreased $15 million in 2012 from $1,352 million in 2011. Lower occupancy and office-related expenses, professional fees and consulting expenses contributed to the overall decrease in as adjusted general and administration expenses. The decrease in as adjusted general and administration expenses was partially offset by higher marketing and promotional expenses in connection with the brand campaign. 2011 Compared with 2010. Total GAAP expenses increased $218 million, or 4%, to $5,832 million in 2011 from $5,614 million in 2010. Excluding certain items deemed non-recurring by management or transactions that ultimately will not affect the Company’s book value, total expenses, as adjusted, increased $244 million, or 4%. The increase in total expenses, as adjusted, is primarily attributable to increases in employee compensation and benefits, direct fund expenses and general and administration expenses, partially offset by a reduction in distribution and servicing costs and amortization of deferred sales commissions. Employee Compensation and Benefits. GAAP. Employee compensation and benefits expense increased $102 million, or 3%, to $3,199 million in 2011 from $3,097 million in 2010. Employees at December 31, 2011 totaled approximately 10,100 compared with approximately 9,100 at December 31, 2010. 50 Table of Contents As Adjusted. Employee compensation and benefits, as adjusted, increased by $158 million, reflecting a $164 million increase in base salaries due to an increase in the number of employees and salary levels, and a $41 million increase in other compensation, including payroll taxes, benefits, and commissions. These increases were partially offset by a $47 million decrease in incentive compensation. Distribution and Servicing Costs. Distribution and servicing costs decreased $22 million, or 5%, to $386 million in 2011 from $408 million in 2010. The $22 million decrease related to lower cash management-related costs of $45 million, reflecting lower average AUM and higher yield-support waivers resulting in lower levels of distribution costs, partially offset by higher costs due to increases in average AUM for open-end and closed-end funds, separate accounts and variable annuities. Distribution and servicing costs in 2011 included $207 million of costs attributable to Bank of America/Merrill Lynch and affiliates, and $3 million of costs attributable to PNC and affiliates compared with $246 million and $10 million, respectively, in 2010. Distribution and servicing costs related to other third parties, including Barclays, increased $24 million to $176 million in 2011 from $152 million in 2010 due to an expansion of distribution platforms and higher long-term AUM. Amortization of Deferred Sales Commissions. Amortization of deferred sales commissions decreased $21 million, or 21%, to $81 million in 2011 from $102 million in 2010. Lower sales in certain share classes of U.S. open-end mutual funds contributed to the decline. Direct Fund Expenses. Direct fund expenses increased $70 million reflecting growth in average AUM for the funds (predominantly iShares) where BlackRock pays certain non-advisory expenses of the funds. General and Administration Expenses. GAAP. General and administration expenses increased $61 million, or 5%, to $1,415 million in 2011 from $1,354 million in 2010. Higher occupancy and office-related expenses (including $63 million of U.K. lease exit costs), higher professional services costs and other general and administration expenses contributed to the overall net increase in general and administration expenses. The $23 million increase in other general and administration expenses reflected higher VAT expense and recruiting costs in 2011 offset by the non-recurrence of other general and administration provisions recorded in 2010 related to an outstanding loan to Anthracite Capital Inc. The increase in general and administration expenses was partially offset by a decrease in charitable contributions as well as a decrease in regulatory, filing and licenses fees, primarily due to a $20 million 2010 U.K. industry regulatory assessment. Non-GAAP Adjustments. In 2011 general and administration expenses included the previously mentioned $63 million of U.K. lease exit costs. In 2010, general and administration expenses included $65 million of BGI integration costs primarily consisting of $33 million of marketing and promotional costs, $12 million of professional services and $12 million of occupancy costs. These amounts were excluded from as adjusted general and administrative expenses. As Adjusted. General and administration expenses, as adjusted, of $1,352 million increased $63 million, or 5%, in 2011 from $1,289 million in 2010. The increase was primarily due to higher VAT expense, an increase in professional services costs, and higher marketing and promotional costs, partially offset by the non-recurrence of costs recorded in 2010 related to an outstanding loan to Anthracite Capital, Inc. In addition, general and administration expenses, as adjusted, reflected higher marketing and promotional costs in 2011. Restructuring Charges. In 2011, BlackRock recorded pre-tax restructuring charges of $32 million, primarily related to severance, accelerated amortization of certain previously granted stock awards, and legal and outplacement costs, associated with a reduction in work force and reengineering efforts. 51 Table of Contents Non-operating Results Non-operating income (expense), less net income (loss) attributable to NCI for 2012, 2011 and 2010 was as follows: Variance (Dollar amounts in millions) 2012 2011 2010 2012 vs.2011 2011 vs.2010 Non-operating income (expense), GAAP basis $ (54 ) $ (114 ) $ 23 $ 60 $ (137 ) Less: Net income (loss) attributable to NCI(1) (18 ) 2 (13 ) (20 ) 15 Non-operating income (expense)(2) (36 ) (116 ) 36 80 (152 ) Compensation expense related to (appreciation) depreciation on deferred compensation plans (6 ) 3 (11 ) (9 ) 14 Non-operating income (expense), as adjusted(2) $ (42 ) $ (113 ) $ 25 $ 71 $ (138 ) (1) Amounts included losses of $38 million, $18 million and $35 million attributable to consolidated variable interest entities for 2012, 2011 and 2010, respectively.

(2) Amount included net gains (losses) related to equity and fixed income investments and BlackRock’s seed capital hedging program. 2012 Compared with 2011. Net gains on investments increased $117 million from 2011 due to higher net positive marks in 2012 compared with 2011. Net interest expense increased from 2011, primarily due to long-term debt issuances in May 2011 and May 2012. For further information on the Company’s long-term debt, see Liquidity and Capital Resources herein. 2011 Compared with 2010. Net gains on investments decreased $131 million during 2011 due to lower net positive marks in 2011 compared with 2010. Net interest expense increased $21 million, or 17%, from 2010 primarily due to long-term debt issuances in May 2011, partially offset by higher interest and dividend income. 52 Table of Contents Income Tax Expense GAAP As adjusted (Dollar amounts in millions) 2012 2011 2010 2012 2011 2010 Income before income taxes(1) $ 3,488 $ 3,133 $ 3,034 $ 3,532 $ 3,279 $ 3,192 Income tax expense $ 1,030 $ 796 $ 971 $ 1,094 $ 1,040 $ 1,053 Effective tax rate 29.5 % 25.4 % 32.0 % 31.0 % 31.7 % 33.0 % (1) Net of net income (loss) attributable to NCI. The Company’s tax rate is affected by tax rates in foreign jurisdictions and the relative amount of income earned in those jurisdictions, which the Company expects to be fairly consistent in the near term. The significant foreign jurisdictions, which have lower statutory tax rates than the U.S. federal statutory rate of 35%, include the United Kingdom, Luxembourg, Canada and the Netherlands. U.S. income taxes were not provided for certain undistributed foreign earnings intended to be indefinitely reinvested outside the United States. 2012. The GAAP effective tax rate of 29.5% for 2012 included a $21 million benefit related to the resolution of certain outstanding tax positions and a $50 million net non-cash benefit related to the revaluation of certain deferred income tax liabilities including tax legislation enacted in the United Kingdom and the state and local income tax effect resulting from changes in the Company’s organizational structure. The as adjusted effective tax rate of 31.0% for 2012 excluded the $50 million net non-cash tax benefit mentioned above. 2011. The GAAP effective tax rate of 25.4% for 2011 included a $24 million benefit related to the resolution of certain outstanding tax positions and $198 million of net non-cash tax benefits due to a state tax election and enacted U.K., Japan, U.S. state and local tax legislation. The 2011 as adjusted effective tax rate of 31.7% included the $24 million benefit related to the revaluation of certain deferred income tax liabilities and excluded the $198 million net non-cash benefit. 2010. The GAAP effective tax rate of 32.0% for 2010 included a $30 million non-cash tax benefit related to the revaluation of certain net deferred income tax liabilities primarily related to acquired intangible assets due to enacted U.K. tax legislation. In addition, 2010 included the effect of favorable tax rulings and the resolution of certain outstanding tax positions. The as adjusted effective tax rate of 33.0% for 2010 excluded the $30 million non-cash tax benefit mentioned above. Balance Sheet Overview As Adjusted Balance Sheet The following table presents a reconciliation of the Company’s consolidated statement of financial condition presented on a GAAP basis to the Company’s consolidated statement of financial condition excluding the impact of separate account assets and collateral held under securities lending agreements (directly related to lending securities held by separate account assets) and separate account liabilities and collateral liabilities under securities lending agreements, consolidated variable interest entities (“VIEs”) and consolidated sponsored investment funds. The Company presents the as adjusted balance sheet as additional information to enable investors to eliminate gross presentation of certain assets that have equal and offsetting liabilities or non-controlling interests and ultimately do not have an impact on stockholders’ equity (excluding appropriated retained earnings related to consolidated collateralized loan obligations) or cash flows. Management reviews the Company’s as adjusted balance sheet, a non-GAAP financial measure, as an economic presentation of its total assets and liabilities; however, it does not advocate that investors consider such non-GAAP financial measures in isolation from, or as a substitute for, financial information prepared in accordance with GAAP. Separate Account Assets and Liabilities and Collateral Held under Securities Lending Agreements The separate account assets are maintained by a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company, which is a registered life insurance company in the United Kingdom, and represent segregated assets held for purposes of funding individual and group pension contracts. In accordance with GAAP, the Company records equal and offsetting separate account liabilities. The separate account assets are not available to creditors of the Company and the holders of the pension contracts have no recourse to the Company’s assets. The net investment income attributable to separate account assets accrues directly to the contract owners and is not reported on the Company’s consolidated statements of income. While 53 Table of Contents BlackRock has no economic interest in these assets or liabilities, BlackRock earns an investment advisory fee for the service of managing these assets on behalf of the clients. In addition, the Company records on its consolidated statements of financial condition the collateral received under securities lending arrangements as its own asset in addition to an equal and offsetting collateral liability for the obligation to return the collateral. Consolidated VIEs At December 31, 2012, BlackRock’s consolidated VIEs included CLOs and one investment fund. The assets of these VIEs are not available to creditors of the Company and the Company has no obligation to settle the liabilities of the VIEs. While BlackRock has no material economic interest in these assets or liabilities, BlackRock earns an investment advisory fee, as well as a potential performance fee, for the service of managing these assets on behalf of clients.

The following discussion summarizes the significant changes in assets and liabilities. The discussion does not include changes related to assets and liabilities that are equal and offsetting and have no impact on BlackRock’s stockholders’ equity. Cash and Cash Equivalents. Cash and cash equivalents at December 31, 2012 and December 31, 2011 included $133 million and $196 million of cash held by consolidated sponsored investment funds, respectively. See Liquidity and Capital Resources for details on the change in cash and cash equivalents during 2012. Accounts Receivable. Accounts receivable at December 31, 2012 increased $290 million from December 31, 2011, primarily reflecting higher receivables resulting from an increase in base fees related to AUM growth and higher performance fees, and an increase in unit trust receivables, substantially offset by an increase in unit trust payables recorded within accounts payable and accrued liabilities. Investments. BlackRock reports its investments on a GAAP basis, which includes investments that are held by sponsored investment funds deemed to be controlled by BlackRock in accordance with GAAP. As a result, management reviews BlackRock’s investments on an “economic” basis, which eliminates the portion of investments that do not impact BlackRock’s book value. BlackRock’s management does not advocate that investors consider such non-GAAP financial measures in isolation from, or as a substitute for, financial information prepared in accordance with GAAP. The Company presents total investments, as adjusted, to enable investors to understand the portion of its investments that are owned by the Company, net of NCI, as a gauge to measure the impact of changes in net non-operating gain (loss) on investments to net income (loss) attributable to BlackRock. 55 Table of Contents The Company further presents total net “economic” investment exposure, net of deferred compensation investments and hedged investments, to reflect another gauge for investors as the economic impact of investments held pursuant to deferred compensation arrangements is substantially offset by a change in compensation expense and the impact of hedged investments is substantially mitigated by total return swap hedges. Carried interest capital allocations are excluded as there is no impact to BlackRock’s stockholders’ equity until such amounts are realized as performance fees. Finally, the Company’s regulatory investment in Federal Reserve Bank stock, which is not subject to market or interest rate risk, is excluded from the Company’s net economic investment exposure.

(2) The decrease of $239 million related to a lower holding requirement of Federal Reserve Bank stock held by BlackRock Institutional Trust Company, N.A. (“BTC”). Total investments, as adjusted, at December 31, 2012 increased $137 million from December 31, 2011, resulting from $765 million of purchases/capital contributions, $185 million from positive market valuations and earnings from equity method investments, and $64 million from net additional carried interest capital allocations, partially offset by $742 million of sales/maturities and $135 million of distributions representing return of capital and return on investments. 56 Table of Contents The following table represents the carrying value of investments, by asset type, at December 31, 2012 and December 31, 2011: (Dollar amounts in millions) December 31,2012 December 31,2011 Variance Amount % Change Private equity $ 298 $ 306 $ (8 ) (3 %) Real estate 122 108 14 13 % Distressed credit/mortgage funds 214 217 (3 ) (1 %) Hedge funds/funds of hedge funds 159 167 (8 ) (5 %) Other investments(1) 418 264 154 58 % Total “economic” investment exposure $ 1,211 $ 1,062 $ 149 14 % (1) Other investments primarily include seed investments in fixed income, commodities and equity funds/strategies as well as U.K. government securities held for regulatory purposes.

Goodwill and intangible assets at December 31, 2012 increased $164 million from December 31, 2011, primarily due to the SRPEP and Claymore Transactions, partially offset by $157 million of amortization expense. Other Assets. Other assets at December 31, 2012 increased $14 million from December 31, 2011, primarily related to higher earnings from certain operating advisory company investments and an increase in property and equipment, partially offset by a decline in receivables from related parties and lower current income taxes receivable. Accrued Compensation and Benefits. Accrued compensation and benefits at December 31, 2012 increased $164 million from December 31, 2011, primarily related to higher 2012 incentive compensation accruals. Accounts Payable and Accrued Liabilities. Accounts payable and accrued liabilities at December 31, 2012 increased $132 million from December 31, 2011, due to higher unit trust payables (substantially offset by an increase in unit trust receivables recorded within accounts receivable), increased accruals, including direct fund expenses and marketing and higher current income taxes payable. Borrowings. Borrowings at December 31, 2012 increased $997 million from December 31, 2011 primarily resulting from $1.5 billion of net proceeds from new issuances of long-term borrowings, partially offset by repayments of $500 million. Deferred Income Tax Liabilities. Net deferred income tax liabilities at December 31, 2012 decreased $30 million, primarily as a result of the effects of temporary differences associated with deferred stock compensation and investment income offset by the Claymore Transaction. In addition, the decrease related to the revaluation of certain deferred income tax liabilities due to tax legislation enacted in the United Kingdom and the state and local income tax effect resulting from changes in the Company’s organizational structure. Other Liabilities. Other liabilities at December 31, 2012 increased $115 million from December 31, 2011, primarily resulting from an increase in deferred carried interest, liabilities of consolidated funds and other operating liabilities. 57 Table of Contents Stockholders’ Equity. Total stockholders’ equity at December 31, 2012 increased $355 million from December 31, 2011, resulting from $2.5 billion of net income attributable to BlackRock, $451 million of stock-based compensation expense, $64 million excess tax benefits from vested stock-based compensation, $53 million of foreign currency translation adjustments and $56 million of issuances of common shares related to employee stock transactions. The increase in stockholders’ equity was partially offset by $1.7 billion of share repurchases and $1.1 billion of cash dividend payments. Liquidity and Capital Resources BlackRock Cash Flows Excluding the Impact of Consolidated Sponsored Investment Funds and VIEs In accordance with GAAP, BlackRock consolidates certain BlackRock sponsored investment funds and CLOs, notwithstanding the fact BlackRock may only have a minority interest, if any, in these funds or CLOs. As a result, BlackRock’s consolidated statements of cash flows include the cash flows of consolidated sponsored investment funds and CLOs. The Company uses an adjusted cash flow statement, which excludes the impact of consolidated sponsored investment funds and CLOs, as a supplemental non-GAAP measure to assess liquidity and capital requirements. The Company believes that its cash flows, excluding the impact of the consolidated sponsored investment funds and CLOs, provide investors with useful information on the cash flows of BlackRock relating to its ability to fund additional operating, investing and financing activities. BlackRock’s management does not advocate that investors consider such non-GAAP measures in isolation from, or as a substitute for, its cash flows presented in accordance with GAAP. The following table presents a reconciliation of the consolidated statements of cash flows presented on a GAAP basis to the consolidated statements of cash flows, excluding the impact of the cash flows of consolidated sponsored investment funds and consolidated VIEs: (Dollar amounts in millions) GAAPBasis Impact onCash Flowsof ConsolidatedSponsoredInvestmentFunds Impact onCash FlowsofConsolidatedVIEs Cash FlowsExcludingImpact ofConsolidatedSponsoredInvestmentFunds and VIEs Cash and cash equivalents, December 31, 2010 $ 3,367 $ 65 $ — $ 3,302 Cash flows from operating activities 2,826 42 136 2,648 Cash flows from investing activities (204 ) 24 — (228 ) Cash flows from financing activities (2,485 ) 65 (136 ) (2,414 ) Effect of exchange rate changes on cash and cash equivalents 2 — — 2 Net change in cash and cash equivalents 139 131 — 8 Cash and cash equivalents, December 31, 2011 $ 3,506 $ 196 $ — $ 3,310 Cash flows from operating activities 2,240 (256 ) (227 ) 2,723 Cash flows from investing activities (266 ) (211 ) — (55 ) Cash flows from financing activities (944 ) 404 227 (1,575 ) Effect of exchange rate changes on cash and cash equivalents 70 — — 70 Net change in cash and cash equivalents 1,100 (63 ) — 1,163 Cash and cash equivalents, December 31, 2012 $ 4,606 $ 133 $ — $ 4,473 Sources of BlackRock’s operating cash primarily include investment advisory, administration fees and securities lending revenue, performance fees, revenue from BlackRock Solutions and advisory products and services, other revenue and distribution fees. BlackRock uses its cash to pay compensation and benefits, distribution and servicing costs, direct fund expenses, general and administration expenses, interest and principal on the Company’s borrowings, income taxes, dividends on BlackRock’s capital stock, repurchases of the Company’s stock, capital expenditures and purchases of co-investments and seed investments. 58 Table of Contents Cash flows from operating activities, excluding the impact of consolidated sponsored investment funds and VIEs, primarily include the receipt of investment advisory and administration fees, securities lending revenue and other revenue offset by the payment of operating expenses incurred in the normal course of business, including the effect of cash payments related to year-end incentive compensation. Cash outflows from investing activities, excluding the impact of consolidated sponsored investment funds and VIEs, for the year ended December 31, 2012 were $55 million and primarily included $435 million of purchases of investments, $267 million related to the Claymore and SRPEP Transactions and $150 million of purchases of property and equipment, partially offset by $724 million of net proceeds from sales and maturities of investments and $73 million of return of capital from equity method investees. Cash outflows from financing activities, excluding the impact of consolidated sponsored investment funds and VIEs, for the year ended December 31, 2012 were $1.6 billion, including $1.7 billion of share repurchases, including $1.0 billion from Barclays, $500 million in open market transactions, and $0.2 billion of employee tax withholdings related to employee stock transactions, $1.1 billion of payments for cash dividends and a $0.5 billion repayment of long-term debt. Cash outflows from financing activities were partially offset by cash inflows related to $1.5 billion of net proceeds from long-term borrowings, $74 million of excess tax benefits from stock-based compensation and $47 million of proceeds from stock options exercised. Capital Resources The Company manages its financial condition and funding to maintain appropriate liquidity for the business. Capital resources at December 31, 2012 and 2011 were as follows: (Dollar amounts in millions) December 31,2012 December 31,2011 Variance Amount % Change Cash and cash equivalents $ 4,606 $ 3,506 $ 1,100 31 % Cash and cash equivalents held by consolidated sponsored investment funds(1) (133 ) (196 ) 63 32 % Subtotal 4,473 3,310 1,163 35 % Credit facility – undrawn 3,685 3,400 285 8 % Total liquidity $ 8,158 $ 6,710 $ 1,448 22 % (1) The Company may not be able to access such cash to use in its operating activities. Total liquidity increased $1.4 billion during 2012, primarily reflecting positive operating cash flows, proceeds from long-term debt issuances in May 2012 and the increased aggregate commitment of the 2012 credit facility from $3.5 billion to $3.785 billion, partially offset by share repurchases, including $1.0 billion from Barclays and $500 million in open market transactions, and the long-term debt repayments of $500 million. A portion of liquidity may be utilized to pay down the current portion of long-term debt maturing in 2013. Share Repurchase Approvals. In January 2013, the Board of Directors (the “Board”) approved an increase in the availability under the Company’s existing share repurchase program to allow for the repurchase of up to 10.2 million shares of BlackRock common stock. In February 2012, the Board approved an increase in the availability under the Company’s then existing share repurchase program to allow for the repurchase of up to 5.0 million shares. The Company repurchased 2,726,600 shares in open market transactions for approximately $500 million during 2012. As of December 31, 2012, there were 2,725,400 shares still authorized to be repurchased, which are included in the total January 2013 Board authorization of 10.2 million shares. Net Capital Requirements. The Company is required to maintain net capital in certain regulated subsidiaries within a number of jurisdictions, which is partially maintained by retaining cash and cash equivalents in those jurisdictions. As a result, such subsidiaries of the Company may be restricted in their ability to transfer cash between different jurisdictions and to their parents. Additionally, transfers of cash between international jurisdictions, including repatriation to the United States, may have adverse tax consequences that could discourage such transfers. 59 Table of Contents BTC is chartered as a national bank that does not accept client deposits and whose powers are limited to trust activities. BTC provides investment management services, including investment advisory and securities lending agency services to institutional investors and other clients. BTC is subject to various regulatory capital and liquid asset requirements administered by Federal banking agencies. At December 31, 2012, the Company was required to maintain approximately $1,209 million, compared with $1,196 million at December 31, 2011, in net capital in certain regulated subsidiaries, including BTC, entities regulated by the Financial Services Authority in the United Kingdom and the Company’s broker-dealers, and was in compliance with all applicable regulatory minimum net capital requirements. Undistributed Earnings of Foreign Subsidiaries. As of December 31, 2012, the Company has not provided for U.S. federal and state income taxes on approximately $2,125 million of undistributed earnings of its foreign subsidiaries. Such earnings are considered indefinitely reinvested outside the United States. The Company’s current plans do not demonstrate a need to repatriate these funds. Contractual Obligations, Commitments and Contingencies The following table sets forth contractual obligations, commitments and contingencies by year of payment at December 31, 2012: (Dollar amounts in millions) 2013 2014 2015 2016 2017 Thereafter Total Contractual obligations and commitments: Short-term borrowings: Principal $ 100 $ — $ — $ — $ — $ — $ 100 Long-term borrowings(1): Principal 750 1,000 750 — 700 2,500 5,700 Interest(2) 200 196 156 151 151 342 1,196 Operating leases 134 122 113 104 105 784 1,362 Purchase obligations 78 70 34 23 8 — 213 Investment commitments 235 — — — — — 235 Total contractual obligations and commitments 1,497 1,388 1,053 278 964 3,626 8,806 Contingent obligations: Contingent distribution obligations 179 — — — — — 179 Total contractual obligations, commitments and contingent obligations(3) $ 1,676 $ 1,388 $ 1,053 $ 278 $ 964 $ 3,626 $ 8,985 (1) Long-term borrowings exclude the borrowings of consolidated CLOs. The Company has no obligation to settle the liabilities of these CLOs. (2) Interest payable on the 2013 floating rate notes was calculated using a fixed rate of 1.03% as a result of the interest rate swap entered into in conjunction with the obligation. (3) As of December 31, 2012, the Company had $313 million of net unrecognized tax benefits. Due to the uncertainty of timing and amounts that will ultimately be paid, this amount has been excluded from the table above. Short-term Borrowings. The following describes the Company’s short-term borrowing arrangements that the Company has access to utilize. 2012 Revolving Credit Facility. In March 2012, the 2011 credit facility was amended to extend the maturity date by one year to March 2017 and in April 2012 the amount of the aggregate commitment was increased to $3.785 billion (the “2012 credit facility”). The 2012 credit facility permits the Company to request an additional $1.0 billion of borrowing capacity, subject to lender credit approval, increasing the overall size of the 2012 credit facility to an aggregate principal amount not to exceed $4.785 billion. Interest on borrowings outstanding accrues at a rate based on the applicable London Interbank Offered Rate plus a spread. The 2012 credit facility requires the Company not to exceed a maximum leverage ratio (ratio of net debt to earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, where net debt equals total debt less unrestricted cash) of 3 to 1, which was satisfied with a ratio of less than 1 to 1 at December 31, 2012. The 2012 credit facility provides back-up liquidity, funds ongoing working capital for general corporate purposes and funds various investment opportunities. At December 31, 2012, the Company had $100 million 60 Table of Contents outstanding under this facility with an interest rate of 1.085% and a maturity during January 2013. During January 2013, the Company rolled over the $100 million in borrowings at an interest rate of 1.085% and a maturity during February 2013. During February 2013, the Company rolled over the $100 million in borrowings at an interest rate of 1.075% and a maturity during March 2013. Commercial Paper Program. On October 14, 2009, BlackRock established a commercial paper program (the “CP Program”) under which the Company could issue unsecured commercial paper notes (the “CP Notes”) on a private placement basis up to a maximum aggregate amount outstanding at any time of $3.0 billion. On May 13, 2011, BlackRock increased the maximum aggregate amount that may be borrowed under the CP Program to $3.5 billion. On May 17, 2012, BlackRock increased the maximum aggregate amount to $3.785 billion. The CP Program is currently supported by the 2012 credit facility. As of December 31, 2012 and December 31, 2011, BlackRock had no CP Notes outstanding. Long-term Borrowings. At December 31, 2012, the principal amount of long-term borrowings, including current portion, was $5.7 billion. 2017 Notes. In September 2007, the Company issued $700 million in aggregate principal amount of 6.25% senior unsecured and unsubordinated notes maturing on September 15, 2017 (the “2017 Notes”). A portion of the net proceeds of the 2017 Notes was used to fund the initial cash payment for the acquisition of the fund of funds business of Quellos and the remainder was used for general corporate purposes. Interest is payable semi-annually in arrears on March 15 and September 15 of each year, or approximately $44 million per year. The 2017 Notes may be redeemed prior to maturity at any time in whole or in part at the option of the Company at a “make-whole” redemption price. 2012, 2014 and 2019 Notes. In December 2009, the Company issued $2.5 billion in aggregate principal amount of unsecured and unsubordinated obligations. These notes were issued as three separate series of senior debt securities including $0.5 billion of 2.25% notes, which were repaid in December 2012, and $1.0 billion of 3.50% notes and $1.0 billion of 5.0% notes maturing in December 2014 and 2019, respectively. Net proceeds of this offering were used to repay borrowings under the CP program, which was used to finance a portion of the BGI Transaction, and for general corporate purposes. These notes may be redeemed prior to maturity at any time in whole or in part at the option of the Company at a “make-whole” redemption price. Interest on the 2014 Notes and 2019 Notes of approximately $35 million and $50 million per year, respectively, is payable semi-annually in arrears on June 10 and December 10 of each year. In 2012, approximately $96 million of interest was paid related to the 2012, 2014 and 2019 Notes. 2013 and 2021 Notes. In May 2011, the Company issued $1.5 billion in aggregate principal amount of unsecured unsubordinated obligations. These notes were issued as two separate series of senior debt securities including $750 million of 4.25% notes and $750 million of floating rate notes maturing in May 2021 and 2013, respectively. Net proceeds of this offering were used to fund the repurchase of BlackRock’s Series B Preferred from affiliates of Merrill Lynch. Interest on the 4.25% notes due in 2021 (“2021 Notes”) is payable semi-annually on May 24 and November 24 of each year, which commenced November 24, 2011, and is approximately $32 million per year. Interest on the floating rate notes due in 2013 (“2013 Floating Rate Notes”) is payable quarterly on February 24, May 24, August 24 and November 24 of each year. The 2021 Notes may be redeemed prior to maturity at any time in whole or in part at the option of the Company at a “make-whole” redemption price. The 2013 Floating Rate Notes may not be redeemed at the Company’s option before maturity. In May 2011, in conjunction with the issuance of the 2013 Floating Rate Notes, the Company entered into a $750 million notional interest rate swap maturing in 2013 to hedge the future cash flows of its obligation at a fixed rate of 1.03% payable semi-annually on May 24 and November 24 of each year, which commenced November 24, 2011. The interest rate swap effectively converts the 2013 Floating Rate Notes to a fixed rate obligation. 2015 and 2022 Notes. In May 2012, the Company issued $1.5 billion in aggregate principal amount of unsecured unsubordinated obligations. These notes were issued as two separate series of senior debt securities, including $750 million of 1.375% notes maturing in June 2015 (the “2015 Notes”) and $750 million of 3.375% notes maturing in June 2022 (the “2022 Notes”). Net proceeds were used to fund the repurchase of BlackRock’s common stock and Series B Preferred from Barclays and affiliates and for general corporate purposes. Interest on the 2015 Notes and 2022 Notes of approximately $10 million and $25 million per year, respectively, is payable semi-annually on June 1 and December 1 of each year, which commenced December 1, 2012. The 2015 Notes and 2022 Notes may be redeemed prior to maturity at any time in whole or in part at the option of the Company at a “make-whole” redemption price. The “make-whole” redemption price represents a price, subject to the specific terms of the 2015 and 2022 Notes and related indenture, that is the greater of (a) par value and (b) the present value of future 61 Table of Contents payments that will not be paid because of an early redemption, which is discounted at a fixed spread over a comparable Treasury security. Operating Leases. The Company leases its primary office locations under agreements that expire on varying dates through 2035. In connection with certain lease agreements, the Company is responsible for escalation payments. The contractual obligations table above includes only guaranteed minimum lease payments for such leases and does not project potential escalation or other lease-related payments. These leases are classified as operating leases and, as such, are not recorded as liabilities on the consolidated statements of financial condition. Purchase Obligations. In the ordinary course of business, BlackRock enters into contracts or purchase obligations with third parties whereby the third parties provide services to or on behalf of BlackRock. Purchase obligations included in the contractual obligations table above represent executory contracts, which are either non-cancelable or cancelable with a penalty. At December 31, 2012, the Company’s obligations primarily reflected standard service contracts for portfolio, market data, office-related services and third-party marketing and promotional services. Purchase obligations are recorded on the Company’s financial statements when services are provided and, as such, obligations for services not received are not included in the consolidated statement of financial condition at December 31, 2012. Investment Commitments. At December 31, 2012, the Company had $235 million of various capital commitments to fund sponsored investment funds, including funds of private equity funds, real estate funds and distressed credit funds. This amount excludes additional commitments made by consolidated funds of funds to underlying third-party funds as third-party non-controlling interest holders have the legal obligation to fund the respective commitments of such funds of funds. Generally, the timing of the funding of these commitments is unknown and the commitments are callable on demand at any time prior to the expiration of the commitment. These unfunded commitments are not recorded on the consolidated statements of financial condition. These commitments do not include potential future commitments approved by the Company, but which are not yet legally binding. The Company intends to make additional capital commitments from time to time to fund additional investment products for, and with, its clients. Carried Interest Claw-back. As a general partner in certain investment funds, including private equity partnerships and certain hedge funds, the Company may receive carried interest cash distributions from the partnerships in accordance with distribution provisions of the partnership agreements. The Company may, from time to time, be required to return all or a portion of such distributions to the limited partners in the event the limited partners do not achieve a return as specified in the various partnership agreements. Therefore, BlackRock records carried interest subject to such claw-back provisions in investments, or cash to the extent that it is distributed, as a deferred carried interest liability on its consolidated statements of financial condition. Carried interest is realized and recorded as performance fees on its consolidated statements of income upon the earlier of the termination of the investment fund or when the likelihood of claw-back is mathematically improbable. Indemnifications. In many of the Company’s contracts, including the BGI, MLIM and Quellos Transaction agreements, BlackRock agrees to indemnify third parties under certain circumstances. The terms of the indemnities vary from contract to contract and the amount of indemnification liability, if any, cannot be determined and has not been included in the table above or recorded in the consolidated statement of financial condition at December 31, 2012. See further discussion in Note 12, Commitments and Contingencies, to the consolidated financial statements beginning on page F-1 of this Form 10-K. On behalf of certain clients the Company lends securities to highly rated banks and broker-dealers. In these securities lending transactions, the borrower is required to provide and maintain collateral at or above regulatory minimums. Securities on loan are marked to market daily to determine if the borrower is required to pledge additional collateral. BlackRock has issued certain indemnifications to certain securities lending clients against potential losses resulting from a borrower’s failure to fulfill its obligations should the value of the collateral pledged by the borrower at the time of default be insufficient to cover the borrower’s obligations under the securities lending agreement. The amount of securities on loan as of December 31, 2012 and subject to indemnification was $99.5 billion. The Company held, as agent, cash and securities totaling $104.8 billion as collateral for indemnified securities on loan at December 31, 2012. As part of the Barclays Global Investors (“BGI”) acquisition, Barclays was contractually obligated to continue providing counterparty default indemnification to certain BlackRock securities lending clients through December 1, 2012. BlackRock assumed these indemnification obligations prior to or upon the expiration of Barclays’ indemnification obligation. The amount of client balances indemnified increased in the fourth quarter 2012 due to the Company’s assumption of Barclays’ indemnification obligations on December 1, 2012. The fair value of these indemnifications was not 62 Table of Contents material at December 31, 2012. The Company currently expects indemnified balances to continue to increase over time. While the collateral pledged by a borrower is intended to be sufficient to offset the borrower’s obligations to return securities borrowed and any other amounts owing to the lender under the relevant securities lending agreement, in the event of a borrower default, the Company can give no assurance that the collateral pledged by the borrower will be sufficient to fulfill such obligations. If the amount of such pledged collateral is not sufficient to fulfill such obligations to a client for whom the Company has provided indemnification, BlackRock would be responsible for the amount of the shortfall. These indemnifications cover only the collateral shortfall described above, and do not in any way, guarantee, assume or otherwise insure the investment performance or return of any cash collateral vehicle into which securities lending cash collateral is invested. Contingent Distribution Obligations. In November 2010, BlackRock entered into a second amended and restated global distribution agreement with Merrill Lynch, which requires the Company to make payments to Merrill Lynch contingent upon sales of products and level of AUM maintained in certain BlackRock products. The economic terms of the agreement will remain in effect until January 2014. After such term, the agreement will renew for one automatic three-year extension if certain conditions are satisfied. The obligation for 2014, 2015 and 2016 is not included in the table above as the amounts are not currently determinable. The following items have not been included in the contractual obligations, commitments and contingencies table: Compensation and Benefit Obligations. The Company has various compensation and benefit obligations, including bonuses, commissions and incentive payments payable, defined contribution plan matching contribution obligations, and deferred compensation arrangements, that are excluded from the table contractual obligations and commitments above. These arrangements are discussed in more detail in Notes 13, Stock-Based Compensation, and 14, Employee Benefit Plans, to the consolidated financial statements beginning on page F-1 of this Form 10-K. Accrued compensation and benefits at December 31, 2012 totaled $1,547 million and included incentive compensation of $1,168 million, deferred compensation of $137 million and other compensation and benefits related obligations of $242 million. Substantially all of the incentive compensation liability was paid in the first quarter of 2013, while the deferred compensation obligations are generally payable over periods up to five years. Separate Account Liabilities. At December 31, 2012, the Company had $134.8 billion of separate account assets and offsetting liabilities on the consolidated statement of financial condition. The payment of these contractual obligations is inherently uncertain and varies by customer. As such, these liabilities have been excluded from the contractual obligations table above. Short-Term Investment Funds. Barclays has provided capital support agreements to support certain cash management funds acquired by BlackRock in the BGI Transaction. Pursuant to the terms of the capital support agreements, Barclays agreed to cover losses on covered securities within the products in the aggregate of up to $2.2 billion from December 1, 2009 through December 1, 2013 or until certain criteria were met. BlackRock and Barclays have procedures in place to determine loss events on covered securities within the products and to ensure support payments from Barclays. On October 9, 2012, BlackRock, on behalf of two of these funds, negotiated amendments to these capital support agreements to release Barclays from coverage provided for defaults on 51 covered securities (with an estimated value of approximately $750 million) held in the funds in exchange for a payment by Barclays to the funds of $70 million. The payment was in an amount in excess of the payments that were expected under the Barclays capital support agreements. The Barclays capital support agreements continued in effect for the remaining covered securities in these two funds, and after this transaction, at October 10, 2012, Barclays’ remaining potential obligation in the aggregate under the capital support agreements was $1.6 billion. The support agreements for these two funds had a termination date of December 1, 2013 subject to an early termination option in the event that the applicable fund’s market value remained above a certain net asset value per unit for 120 consecutive days. Barclays exercised its termination option for these two funds on December 7, 2012 and January 3, 2013. After these terminations, at January 31, 2013, Barclays’ remaining maximum potential obligation in the aggregate under the capital support agreements was not material. As previously mentioned, the fourth quarter 2012 results included a one-time $30 million charge related to a contribution to certain of these STIFs. This contribution resulted from actions taken to ensure compliance with new regulations from the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (“OCC”) taking effect in July 2013 that further limit a STIF’s weighted-average portfolio life maturity. BlackRock chose to sell certain securities held within STIFs and to make a one-time contribution to the STIFs to maintain the value of the funds while ensuring compliance with the new OCC rules. The securities sold were held in funds managed by BGI prior to BlackRock’s 63 Table of Contents acquisition of BGI. Until adoption of the new STIF regulations, BlackRock had been pursuing a strategy to hold these securities as market values improved over time. As a result of the fourth quarter security sales, these STIFs are currently in compliance with the new OCC rules. At December 31, 2012, BlackRock concluded that although these funds were VIEs, it was not the primary beneficiary (“PB”) of these funds. Critical Accounting Policies The preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods. Actual results could differ significantly from those estimates. Management considers the following critical accounting policies important to understanding the consolidated financial statements. For a summary of these and additional accounting policies see Note 2, Significant Accounting Policies, to the consolidated financial statements beginning on page F-1 of this Form 10-K. Consolidation of Sponsored Investment Funds and Securitization Products. Consolidation of sponsored investment funds and securitization products (collectively “investment products”) is determined pursuant to ASC 810, Consolidation. The accounting method used by the Company depends upon the influence the Company has over its investee, the investment product. To the extent that BlackRock can exert control over the financial and operating policies of the investment product, which generally exists if there is a 50% or greater voting interest or if partners or members of certain products do not have substantive rights, BlackRock consolidates the investment product. For investment products in which BlackRock’s voting interest is less than 50%, an analysis is performed to determine if the investment product is a VIE or a voting rights entity. Upon the determination that the investment product is a VIE, further analysis, as discussed below, is performed to determine if BlackRock is the PB of the investment product, which would require consolidation. Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities. Certain investment products for which the risks and rewards of ownership are not directly linked to voting interests may be deemed VIEs. BlackRock reviews factors, including the rights of the equity holders and obligations of equity holders to absorb losses or receive expected residual returns, to determine if the investment product is a VIE. BlackRock is required to consolidate a VIE when it is deemed to be the PB, which is evaluated continuously as facts and circumstances change. Accounting Standards Update (“ASU”) 2010-10, Amendments to Statement 167 for Certain Investment Funds (“ASU 2010-10”) defers the application of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (“SFAS”) No. 167, Amendments to FASB Interpretation No. 46(R), for certain investment funds, including money market funds. The PB of a VIE that meets the conditions of ASU 2010-10 is the enterprise that has a variable interest (or combination of variable interests, including those of related parties) that absorbs the majority of the entity’s expected losses, receives a majority of the entity’s expected residual returns, or both. Effective January 1, 2010, the PB of a VIE that does not meet the conditions for deferral in ASU 2010-10 is the enterprise that has the power to direct activities of the entity that most significantly impact the entity’s economic performance and has the obligation to absorb losses or the right to receive benefits that potentially could be significant to the VIE. Significant judgment is required in the determination of whether the Company is the PB of a VIE. If the Company is determined to be the PB of a VIE, BlackRock will consolidate the entity. In order to determine whether the Company is the PB of a VIE for entities that meet the conditions of ASU 2010-10, management must make significant estimates and assumptions of projected future cash flows and assign probabilities to different cash flow scenarios. Assumptions made in such analyses include, but are not limited to, market prices of securities, market interest rates, potential credit defaults on individual securities or default rates on a portfolio of securities, gain realization, liquidity or marketability of certain securities, discount rates and the probability of certain other outcomes. In the normal course of business, the Company is the manager of various types of sponsored investment vehicles, including collateralized debt obligations (“CDOs”) or CLOs that do not meet the conditions of ASU 2010-10 and sponsored investment funds, which may be considered VIEs. 64 Table of Contents At December 31, 2012, the following balances related to consolidated VIEs including CLOs and an investment fund on the consolidated statements of financial condition: (Dollar amounts in millions) CLOs SponsoredPrivateEquity Fund TotalConsolidatedVIEs Assets of consolidated VIEs: Cash and cash equivalents $ 294 $ 3 $ 297 Bank loans, bonds and other investments 2,240 24 2,264 Liabilities of consolidated VIEs: Borrowings (2,402 ) — (2,402 ) Other liabilities (103 ) — (103 ) Appropriated retained earnings (29 ) — (29 ) Non-controlling interests of consolidated VIEs — (27 ) (27 ) Total BlackRock net interests in consolidated VIEs $ — $ — $ — At December 31, 2012, BlackRock was the manager of over 20 CLOs/CDOs and other securitization entities. In accordance with consolidation accounting guidance for VIEs, BlackRock was determined to be the PB for certain of these CLOs, which required BlackRock to consolidate these VIEs. BlackRock was deemed to be the PB because it has the power to direct the activities of the CLO that most significantly impact the entity’s economic performance and has the right to receive benefits that potentially could be significant to the VIE. At December 31, 2012, the Company had $2,534 million and $2,505 million in assets and liabilities, respectively, on its consolidated statement of financial condition related to these consolidated CLOs. In addition, the Company recorded appropriated retained earnings for the difference between the assets and liabilities, as the CLO noteholders, not BlackRock, ultimately will receive the benefits or absorb the losses associated with the CLO’s assets and liabilities. The changes in the fair value of the assets and liabilities of these CLOs have no impact on net income attributable to BlackRock or its cash flows. Excluding outstanding management fee receivables, the Company has no risk of loss with its involvement with these VIEs. At December 31, 2012, BlackRock was determined to be the PB of one sponsored private equity investment fund of funds in which it had a non-substantive investment and was deemed to absorb the majority of the variability due to its de-facto third-party relationships with other partners in the fund, which limits the ability of the partners to transfer or sell their interests without BlackRock’s consent as the general partner of the fund. At December 31, 2012, the Company had recorded $3 million, $24 million and $27 million in cash and cash equivalents, private equity investments and nonredeemable non-controlling interests of consolidated VIEs, respectively, on the consolidated statement of financial condition related to this VIE. The changes in the fair value of the assets and liabilities of this VIE have no impact on net income attributable to BlackRock. Excluding outstanding management fee receivables, the Company has no risk of loss with its involvement with this VIE. Consolidation of Voting Rights Entities. To the extent that BlackRock can exert control over the financial and operating policies of the investee, which generally exists if there is a 50% or greater voting interest or if partners or members of certain products do not have substantive rights, BlackRock consolidates the investee. The Company, as general partner or managing member of certain sponsored investment funds, generally is presumed to control funds that are limited partnerships or limited liability companies. Pursuant to ASC 810-20, Control of Partnerships and Similar Entities (“ASC 810-20”), the Company reviews such investment vehicles to determine if such a presumption can be overcome by determining whether other non-affiliated partners or members of the limited partnership or limited liability company have the substantive ability to dissolve (liquidate) the investment vehicle, or otherwise to remove BlackRock as the general partner or managing member without cause based on a simple unaffiliated majority vote, or have other substantive participating rights. If the investment vehicle is not a VIE and the presumption of control is not overcome, BlackRock will consolidate the investment vehicle. 65 Table of Contents At December 31, 2012 and 2011, as a result of consolidation of various investment products deemed to be voting rights entities, including products where BlackRock owns 50% of greater of the voting rights of the product, under the consolidation policies described above, the Company had the following balances on its consolidated statements of financial condition: (Dollar amounts in millions) December 31,2012 December 31,2011 Cash and cash equivalents $ 133 $ 196 Investments: Trading investments 123 214 Other investments 401 373 Other assets 25 5 Other liabilities (65 ) (37 ) Non-controlling interests (187 ) (276 ) BlackRock’s net interests in consolidated investment funds $ 430 $ 475 The Company retained the specialized accounting of these investment funds pursuant to ASC 810-10. VIEs, including a consolidated sponsored investment fund and CLOs, were excluded from the balances above as these balances are reported separately on the consolidated statements of financial condition. Investments Equity Method Investments. For equity investments where BlackRock does not control the investee, and where it is not the PB of a VIE, but can exert significant influence over the financial and operating policies of the investee, the Company follows the equity method of accounting. The evaluation of whether the Company exerts control or significant influence over the financial and operational policies of its investees requires significant judgment based on the facts and circumstances surrounding each individual investment. Factors considered in these evaluations may include the type of investment, the legal structure of the investee, the terms and structure of the investment agreement, including investor voting or other rights, the terms of BlackRock’s advisory agreement or other agreements with the investee, any influence BlackRock may have on the governing board of the investee, the legal rights of other investors in the entity pursuant to the fund’s operating documents and the relationship between BlackRock and other investors in the entity. Substantially all of BlackRock’s equity method investees are investment companies that record their underlying investments at fair value. Therefore, under the equity method of accounting, BlackRock’s share of the investee’s underlying net income predominantly represents fair value adjustments in the investments held by the equity method investees. BlackRock’s share of the investee’s underlying net income or loss is based upon the most currently available information and is recorded as non-operating income (expense) for investments in investment companies, or as other revenue for operating advisory company investments, which are recorded in other assets, since such investees are considered to be an extension of BlackRock’s core business. At December 31, 2012, the Company had $604 million and $124 million of equity method investments, including equity method investments held for deferred compensation, reflected within investments and other assets, respectively, and at December 31, 2011, the Company had $476 million and $80 million of equity method investees reflected in investments and other assets, respectively. Impairment of Investments. The Company’s management periodically assesses its equity method, available-for-sale, held-to-maturity and cost investments for impairment. If circumstances indicate that impairment may exist, investments are evaluated using market values, where available, or the expected future cash flows of the investment. If the undiscounted expected future cash flows are lower than the Company’s carrying value of the investment, an impairment charge is recorded in the consolidated statement of income. When the fair value of available-for-sale securities is lower than cost, the Company evaluates the security to determine whether the impairment is considered to be “other-than-temporary”. In making this determination for equity securities, the Company considers, among other factors, the length of time the security has been in a loss position, the extent to which the security’s market value is less than cost, the financial condition and near-term prospects of the security’s issuer and the Company’s ability and intent to hold the security for a length of time sufficient to allow for recovery of such unrealized losses. If the impairment is considered other-than-temporary, an impairment charge is recorded in non-operating income (expense) on the consolidated statement of income. In making this determination for debt securities, the Company considers whether: (1) it has the intent to sell the security, (2) it is more likely than not that it will be required to sell the security before recovery or (3) it expects to recover the entire amortized cost basis of the security. If the Company does not intend to sell a security and it is not more likely than not that it will be required to sell the security, but the security has suffered a credit loss, the credit loss will be bifurcated from the total 66 Table of Contents impairment and recorded in earnings with the remaining portion recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income. Evaluation of securities impairments involves significant assumptions and management judgments, which could differ from actual results, and these differences could have a material impact on the consolidated statements of income. Fair Value Measurements Hierarchy of Fair Value Inputs. The provisions of ASC 820-10 establish a hierarchy that prioritizes inputs to valuation techniques used to measure fair value and require companies to disclose the fair value of their financial instruments according to the fair value hierarchy (i.e., Level 1, 2 and 3 inputs, as defined). The fair value hierarchy gives the highest priority to quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities and the lowest priority to unobservable inputs. Assets and liabilities measured and reported at fair value are classified and disclosed in one of the following categories: Level 1 Inputs: Quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities at the reporting date. • Level 1 assets may include listed mutual funds (including those accounted for under the equity method of accounting as these mutual funds are investment companies that have publicly available net asset values (“NAVs”), which in accordance with GAAP, are calculated under fair value measures and the changes are equal to the earnings of such funds), ETFs, listed equities and certain exchange-traded derivatives. Level 2 Inputs: Quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets; quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities that are not active; quotes from pricing services or brokers for which the Company can determine that orderly transactions took place at the quoted price or that the inputs used to arrive at the price were observable; and inputs other than quoted prices that are observable, such as models or other valuation methodologies. As a practical expedient, the Company relies on the NAV (or its equivalent) of certain investments as their fair value. • Level 2 assets may include debt securities, bank loans, short-term floating rate notes and asset-backed securities, securities held within consolidated hedge funds, certain equity method limited partnership interests in hedge funds valued based on NAV (or its equivalent) where the Company has the ability to redeem at the measurement date or within the near term without redemption restrictions, restricted public securities valued at a discount, as well as over–the-counter derivatives, including interest and inflation rate swaps and foreign exchange currency contracts that have inputs to the valuations that generally can be corroborated by observable market data. Level 3 Inputs: Unobservable inputs for the valuation of the asset or liability, which may include non-binding broker quotes. Level 3 assets include investments for which there is little, if any, market activity. These inputs require significant management judgment or estimation. Certain investments that are valued using NAV (or its equivalent) and are subject to current redemption restrictions that will not be lifted in the near term are included in Level 3. • Level 3 assets may include general and limited partnership interests in private equity funds, funds of private equity funds, real estate funds, hedge funds, funds of hedge funds, direct private equity investments held within consolidated funds, bonds and bank loans. • Level 3 liabilities include borrowings of consolidated CLOs valued based upon non-binding single-broker quotes. • Level 3 inputs include BlackRock capital accounts for its partnership interests in various alternative investments, including distressed credit hedge funds, real estate and private equity funds, which may be adjusted by using the returns of certain market indices. BlackRock’s $679 million of Level 3 investments or 39% of total GAAP investments at December 31, 2012 primarily included the above mentioned co-investments. Significance of Inputs. The Company’s assessment of the significance of a particular input to the fair value measurement in its entirety requires judgment and considers factors specific to the financial instrument. Valuation Techniques. The fair values of certain Level 3 assets and liabilities were determined using various methodologies as appropriate, including NAVs of underlying investments, third-party pricing vendors, broker quotes and market and income approaches. Such quotes and modeled prices are evaluated for reasonableness through various procedures, including due diligence reviews of third-party pricing vendors, variance analyses, consideration of current market environment and other analytical procedures. 67 Table of Contents As a practical expedient, the Company relies on NAV as the fair value for certain investments. The inputs to value these investments may include BlackRock capital accounts for its partnership interests in various alternative investments, including distressed credit hedge funds, real estate and private equity funds, which may be adjusted by using the returns of certain market indices. The various partnerships are investment companies, which record their underlying investments at fair value based on fair value policies established by management of the underlying fund. Fair value policies at the underlying fund generally require the fund to utilize pricing/valuation information, including independent appraisals, from third-party sources. However, in some instances, current valuation information for illiquid securities or securities in markets that are not active may not be available from any third-party source or fund management may conclude that the valuations that are available from third-party sources are not reliable. In these instances, fund management may perform model-based analytical valuations that may be used as an input to value these investments. A significant amount of inputs used to value equity, debt securities and bank loans is sourced from well-recognized third-party pricing vendors. Generally, prices obtained from pricing vendors are categorized as Level 1 inputs for identical securities traded in active markets and as Level 2 for other similar securities if the vendor uses observable inputs in determining the price. Annually, BlackRock’s internal valuation committee or other designated groups review both the valuation methodology, including the general assumptions and methods used to value various asset classes, and operational process with these vendors. In addition, on a quarterly basis, meetings are held with the vendors to identify any significant changes to the vendors’ processes. In addition, quotes obtained from brokers generally are non-binding and categorized as Level 3 inputs. However, if the Company is able to determine that market participants have transacted for the asset in an orderly manner near the quoted price or if the Company can determine that the inputs used by the broker are observable, the quote is classified as a Level 2 input. Changes in Valuation. Changes in value on $1,275 million of investments will impact the Company’s non-operating income (expense), $158 million will impact accumulated other comprehensive income, $232 million are held at cost or amortized cost and the remaining $85 million relates to carried interest which will not impact non-operating income (expense). As of December 31, 2012, changes in fair value of approximately $524 million of such investments within consolidated sponsored investment funds will impact BlackRock’s net income (loss) attributable to non-controlling interests expense on the consolidated statements of income. BlackRock’s net exposure to changes in fair value of such consolidated sponsored investment funds was $430 million. Goodwill and Intangible Assets The value of advisory contracts acquired in business acquisitions to manage AUM in proprietary open- and closed-end investment funds as well as collective trust funds without a specified termination date are classified as indefinite-lived intangible assets. The assignment of indefinite lives to such investment fund contracts is based upon the assumption that there is no foreseeable limit on the contract period to manage these funds due to the likelihood of continued renewal at little or no cost. In addition, trade names/trademarks are considered indefinite-lived intangibles as they are expected to generate cash flows indefinitely. Goodwill represents the cost of a business acquisition in excess of the fair value of the net assets acquired. In accordance with the applicable provisions of ASC 350, Intangibles – Goodwill and Other (“ASC 350”), indefinite-lived intangible assets and goodwill are not amortized. Finite-lived management contracts, which relate to acquired separate accounts and funds with a specified termination date, are amortized over their remaining expected useful lives, which, at December 31, 2012, ranged from 1 to 12 years with a weighted-average remaining estimated useful life of 4.9 years. Goodwill. The Company assesses its goodwill for impairment at least annually, considering such factors as the book value and the market capitalization of the Company. The impairment test performed as of July 31, 2012 indicated that no impairment charge was required. The Company continuously monitors its book value per share as compared with closing prices of its common stock for potential indicators of impairment. At December 31, 2012, the Company’s common stock closed at $206.71, which exceeded its book value per share of approximately $148.20 after excluding appropriated retained earnings. Indefinite-lived and finite-lived intangibles. The Company performs assessments to determine if any intangible assets are potentially impaired and whether the indefinite-life and finite-life classifications are still appropriate. In evaluating whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of indefinite-lived intangibles is less than its carrying value, BlackRock assesses various significant factors including AUM, revenue basis points, projected AUM growth rates, operating margins, tax rates and discount rates. In addition, the Company considers other factors including: (i) macroeconomic conditions such as a deterioration in general economic conditions, limitations on accessing capital, fluctuations in foreign 68 Table of Contents exchange rates, or other developments in equity and credit markets; (ii) industry and market considerations such as a deterioration in the environment in which an entity operates, an increased competitive environment, a decline in market-dependent multiples or metrics, a change in the market for an entity’s services, or regulatory, legal or political developments; and (iii) entity-specific events, such as a change in management or key personnel, overall financial performance and litigation that could affect significant inputs. If potential impairment circumstances are considered to exist, the Company will perform an impairment test, using an undiscounted cash flow analysis. Actual results could differ from these cash flow estimates, which could materially impact the impairment conclusion. If the asset is determined to be impaired, the difference between the book value of the asset and its current fair value would be recognized as an expense in the period in which the impairment occurs. In addition, management judgment is required to estimate the period over which finite-lived intangible assets will contribute to the Company’s cash flows and the pattern in which these assets will be consumed. A change in the remaining useful life of any of these assets, or the reclassification of an indefinite-lived intangible asset to a finite-lived intangible asset, could have a significant impact on the Company’s amortization expense, which was $157 million, $156 million and $160 million for 2012, 2011 and 2010, respectively. In 2012, 2011 and 2010, the Company performed impairment tests that indicated no impairment charges were required, the classification of indefinite-lived versus finite-lived intangibles was still appropriate and no changes to the expected lives of the finite-lived intangibles were required. The Company continuously monitors various factors, including AUM, for potential indicators of impairment. Income Taxes. The Company accounts for income taxes under the asset and liability method prescribed by ASC 740, Income Taxes (“ASC 740”). Deferred income tax assets and liabilities are recognized for future tax consequences attributable to temporary differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases using currently enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to reverse. The effect of a change in tax rates on deferred tax assets and liabilities is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date. Significant management judgment is required in estimating the ranges of possible outcomes and determining the probability of favorable or unfavorable tax outcomes and potential interest and penalties related to such unfavorable outcomes, that require significant management judgment. Actual future tax consequences relating to uncertain tax positions may be materially different than the Company’s current estimates. At December 31, 2012, BlackRock had $404 million of gross unrecognized tax benefits, of which $250 million, if recognized, would affect the effective tax rate. In accordance with ASC 740, management is required to estimate the timing of the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities, make assumptions about the future deductibility of deferred income tax assets and assess deferred income tax liabilities based on enacted tax rates for the appropriate tax jurisdictions to determine the amount of such deferred income tax assets and liabilities. At December 31, 2012, the Company had deferred tax assets of $4 million and deferred tax liabilities of approximately $5,293 million on the consolidated statement of financial condition. Changes in the calculated deferred tax assets and liabilities may occur in certain circumstances, including statutory income tax rate changes, statutory tax law changes, changes in the anticipated timing of recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities or changes in the structure or tax status of the Company. ASC 740 requires the Company to assess whether a valuation allowance should be established against its deferred income tax assets based on consideration of all available evidence, both positive and negative, using a more likely than not standard. This assessment considers, among other matters, the nature, frequency and severity of recent losses, forecast of future profitability, the duration of statutory carry back and carry forward periods, the Company’s experience with tax attributes expiring unused, and tax planning alternatives. At December 31, 2012, the Company had recorded a deferred tax asset of $71 million for unrealized investment losses; however, no valuation allowance has been established because the Company expects to hold certain equity method investments which invest in fixed income securities over a period sufficient for them to recover their unrealized losses, and generate future capital gains sufficient to offset the unrealized capital losses. Based on the weight of available evidence, it is more likely than not that the deferred tax asset will be realized. However, changes in circumstance could cause the Company to revalue its deferred tax balances with the resulting change impacting the consolidated statements of income in the period of the change. Such changes may be material to the Company’s consolidated financial statements. See Note 19, Income Taxes, to the consolidated financial statements beginning on page F-1 of this Form 10-K for further details. 69 Table of Contents The Company records income taxes based upon its estimated income tax liability or benefit. The Company’s actual tax liability or benefit may differ from the estimated income tax liability or benefit. The Company had current income taxes receivables of approximately $102 million and current income taxes payables of $121 million at December 31, 2012. Revenue Recognition. Investment advisory and administration fees are recognized as the services are performed. Such fees are primarily based on pre-determined percentages of the market value of AUM or, in the case of certain real estate clients, net operating income generated by the underlying properties. Investment advisory and administration fees are affected by changes in AUM, including market appreciation or depreciation, foreign exchange translation and net subscriptions or redemptions. Investment advisory and administration fees for investment funds are shown net of fees waived pursuant to contractual expense limitations of the funds or voluntary waivers. The Company contracts with third parties and related parties for various fund distribution and shareholder servicing to be performed on behalf of certain funds the Company manages. Such arrangements generally are priced as a portion of the management fee paid by the fund. In certain cases, the fund takes on the primary responsibility for payment for services such that the Company bears no credit risk to the third party. The Company accounts for such retrocession arrangements in accordance with ASC 605-45, Revenue Recognition – Principle Agent Considerations (“ASC 605-45”), and records its management fees net of retrocessions. Retrocessions for 2012, 2011 and 2010 were $793 million, $928 million and $831 million, respectively. The Company has additional contracts for similar services with third parties, which due to the terms of the contracts, are recorded as distribution and servicing costs and thus not netted on the consolidated statements of income. The Company earns revenue by lending securities on behalf of clients, primarily to brokerage institutions. Such revenues are accounted for on an accrual basis. The securities loaned are secured by collateral, generally ranging from 102% to 112% of the value of the loaned securities. The revenue earned is shared between the Company and the funds or other third-party accounts managed by the Company from which the securities are borrowed. For 2012, 2011 and 2010, securities lending revenue totaled $510 million, $397 million and $325 million, respectively, and is recorded in investment advisory, administration fees and securities lending revenue on the consolidated statements of income. Investment advisory, administration fees and securities lending revenue are reported together as the fees for these services often are agreed upon with clients as a bundled fee. The Company receives investment advisory performance fees or incentive allocation from certain actively managed investment funds and certain separately managed accounts. These performance fees are earned upon exceeding specified relative and/or absolute investment return thresholds. Such fees are recorded upon completion of the measurement period, which varies by product or account, and could be monthly, quarterly, annually or longer. For the years ended December 31, 2012, 2011 and 2010, performance fee revenue totaled $463 million, $371 million and $540 million, respectively. In addition, the Company receives carried interest from certain alternative investments upon exceeding performance thresholds. BlackRock may be required to return all, or part, of such carried interest depending upon future performance of these funds. Therefore, BlackRock records carried interest subject to such claw-back provisions in investments or cash to the extent that it is distributed, on its consolidated statements of financial condition. Carried interest is realized and recorded as performance fee revenue upon the earlier of the termination of the investment fund or when the likelihood of claw-back is mathematically improbable. The Company records realized carried interest as performance fees on its consolidated statements of income. The Company records a deferred carried interest liability to the extent it receives cash or capital allocations related to carried interest prior to meeting the revenue recognition criteria. At December 31, 2012 and 2011, the Company had $97 million and $33 million, respectively, of deferred carried interest recorded in other liabilities on the consolidated statements of financial condition. The ultimate recognition of performance fee revenue, if any, for these products is unknown. Fees earned for BlackRock Solutions, which include advisory services, are recorded as services are performed and are determined using some, or all, of the following methods: (i) percentages of various attributes of advisory AUM or value of positions on the Aladdin platform, (ii) fixed fees and (iii) performance fees if contractual thresholds are met. Revenue earned on advisory assignments was comprised of one-time advisory and portfolio structuring fees and ongoing fees based on AUM of the respective portfolio assignment. For 2012, 2011 and 2010, BlackRock Solutions and advisory revenue totaled $518 million, $510 million and $460 million, respectively. Adjustments to revenue arising from initial estimates historically have been immaterial since the majority of BlackRock’s investment advisory and administration revenue is calculated based on the fair value of AUM and since the Company does not record performance revenues until performance thresholds have been exceeded and the likelihood of claw-back is mathematically improbable. 70 Table of Contents Accounting Developments For accounting pronouncements the Company adopted during 2012 and for recent accounting pronouncements not yet adopted, see Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements. Recent Developments BlackRock holds an approximately one-third equity interest in Private National Mortgage Acceptance Company, LLC (“PennyMac”), accounted for as an equity method investment. PennyMac Financial Services, Inc., which is proposed to become a holding company of PennyMac, recently filed a Form S-1 with the SEC to effectively take PennyMac public. A successful offering by PennyMac may require BlackRock to adjust its investment in PennyMac at the time of the offering. Given the uncertain nature of the registration and offering process for PennyMac, the amount and timing of any such potential gains or changes in carrying values is uncertain. Item 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK AUM Market Price Risk. BlackRock’s investment advisory and administration fees are primarily comprised of fees based on a percentage of the value of AUM and, in some cases, performance fees expressed as a percentage of the returns realized on AUM. At December 31, 2012, the majority of the Company’s investment advisory and administration fees were based on average or period end AUM of the applicable investment funds or separate accounts. Movements in equity market prices, interest rates/credit spreads, foreign exchange rates or all three could cause the value of AUM to decline, which would result in lower investment advisory and administration fees. Corporate Investments Portfolio Risks. As a leading investment management firm, BlackRock devotes significant resources across all of its operations to identifying, measuring, monitoring, managing and analyzing market and operating risks, including the management and oversight of its own investment portfolio. The Board of Directors of the Company has adopted guidelines for the review of investments to be made by the Company, requiring, among other things, that investments be reviewed by certain senior officers of the Company, and that certain investments may be referred to the Audit Committee or the Board of Directors, depending on the circumstances, for approval. In the normal course of its business, BlackRock is exposed to equity market price risk, interest rate/credit spread risk and foreign exchange rate risk associated with its corporate investments. BlackRock has investments primarily in sponsored investment products that invest in a variety of asset classes, including real estate, private equity and hedge funds. Investments generally are made for co-investment purposes, to establish a performance track record, to hedge exposure to certain deferred compensation plans or for regulatory purposes. Currently, the Company has a seed capital hedging program in which it enters into total return swaps to hedge market exposure to certain investments. At December 31, 2012, the outstanding total return swaps had an aggregate notional value of approximately $206 million. At December 31, 2012, approximately $524 million of BlackRock’s total investments were maintained in sponsored investment funds deemed to be controlled by BlackRock in accordance with GAAP and, therefore, are consolidated even though BlackRock may not own a majority of such funds. Excluding the impact of the Federal Reserve Bank stock, carried interest, investments made to hedge exposure to certain deferred compensation plans and certain investments that are hedged via the seed capital hedging program, the Company’s economic exposure to its investment portfolio is as follows: December 31,2012 December 31,2011 Variance (Dollar amounts in millions) Amount % Change Total investments, GAAP $ 1,750 $ 1,631 $ 119 7 % Investments held by consolidated sponsored investment funds (524 ) (587 ) 63 11 % Net exposure to consolidated investment funds 430 475 (45 ) (10 %) Total investments, as adjusted 1,656 1,519 137 9 % Federal Reserve Bank stock (89 ) (328 ) 239 73 % Carried interest (85 ) (21 ) (64 ) (305 %) Deferred compensation investments (62 ) (65 ) 3 5 % Hedged investments (209 ) (43 ) (166 ) (386 %) Total “economic” investment exposure $ 1,211 $ 1,062 $ 149 14 % 71 Table of Contents The “economic” investment exposure of the portfolio is presented in either the equity market price or the interest rate/credit spread risk disclosures below: Equity Market Price Risk. At December 31, 2012, the Company’s net exposure to market price risk in its investment portfolio was approximately $609 million of the Company’s total economic investment exposure. Investments subject to market price risk include private equity and real estate investments, hedge funds and funds of funds as well as mutual funds. The Company estimates that a hypothetical 10% adverse change in market prices would result in a decrease of approximately $60.9 million in the carrying value of such investments. Interest Rate/Credit Spread Risk. At December 31, 2012, the Company was exposed to interest-rate risk and credit spread risk as a result of approximately $602 million of investments in debt securities and sponsored investment products that invest primarily in debt securities. Management considered a hypothetical 100 basis point fluctuation in interest rates or credit spreads and estimates that the impact of such a fluctuation on these investments, in the aggregate, would result in a decrease, or increase, of approximately $8.0 million in the carrying value of such investments. Foreign Exchange Rate Risk. As discussed above, the Company invests in sponsored investment products that invest in a variety of asset classes. The carrying value of the total economic investment exposure denominated in foreign currencies, primarily the pound sterling and euro was $156 million at December 31, 2012. A 10% adverse change in the applicable foreign exchange rates would result in approximately a $15.6 million decline in the carrying value of such investments. Other Market Risks. By using derivative financial instruments, the Company exposes itself to market risk. Market risk from forward foreign currency exchange contracts is the effect on the value of a financial instrument that results from a change in currency exchange rates.

(2) As adjusted items are described in more detail in Non-GAAP Financial Measures. (3) Nonvoting participating preferred stock is considered to be a common stock equivalent for purposes of determining basic and diluted earnings per share calculations. In addition, unvested restricted stock units (“RSUs”) that contain nonforfeitable rights to dividends are not included for 2012 and 2011 as they were deemed to be participating securities in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (“GAAP”). Upon vesting of the participating RSUs, the shares were added to the weighted-average shares outstanding that resulted in an increase to the percentage of net income attributable to common shares. The Company’s remaining participating securities vested in January 2013. (4) Total BlackRock stockholders’ equity, excluding appropriated retained earnings, divided by total common and preferred shares outstanding at December 31 of the respective year-end. 2013 COMPARED WITH 2012 GAAP. Operating income of $3,857 million increased $333 million from 2012. In the second quarter of 2013, as a result of an initial public offering of PennyMac Financial Services, Inc. (the “PennyMac IPO”), the Company recorded a noncash, nonoperating pre-tax gain of $39 million related to the carrying value of its equity method investment. Subsequent to the PennyMac IPO, the Company made a charitable contribution of 6.1 million units of its equity method investment with a fair value of $124 million to a new donor advised fund (the “Charitable Contribution”). In connection with the Charitable Contribution, the Company also recorded a noncash, nonoperating pre-tax gain of $80 million related to the contributed investment. For further information, see Note 11, Other Assets, to the consolidated financial statements. 30 Table of Contents Operating income reflects growth in base fees and strong performance fees and higher BlackRock Solutions and advisory revenue, partially offset by higher expenses, primarily due to the $124 million expense related to the Charitable Contribution and higher revenue-related expenses. The results for 2013 also included $43 million of organizational alignment costs, reflecting compensation and severance costs associated with the alignment of staffing with the Company’s strategic priorities and growth opportunities. Operating income in 2012 included a $30 million charge related to a contribution to certain of the Company’s bank-managed short-term investment funds (“STIFs”). Nonoperating income (expense), less net income (loss) attributable to NCI increased $133 million due to the $39 million pre-tax gain related to the PennyMac IPO and the $80 million gain related to the Charitable Contribution and higher net positive marks on investments during 2013 compared with 2012. Income tax expense included a $69 million net noncash benefit for 2013 and a $30 million net noncash benefit for 2012. The net noncash benefits for both periods primarily related to the revaluation of certain deferred income tax liabilities, including the effect of legislation enacted in the United Kingdom and domestic state and local income tax changes. In addition, 2013 income tax expense included an approximately $48 million tax benefit recognized in connection with the Charitable Contribution, a tax benefit of approximately $29 million, primarily due to the realization of tax loss carryforwards and benefits from certain nonrecurring items. Earnings per diluted common share rose $3.08, or 22%, compared with 2012 due to higher net income and the benefit of share repurchases. As Adjusted. Operating income of $4,024 million and operating margin of 41.4% increased $450 million and 100 basis points, respectively, from 2012. The current year results included the previously mentioned organizational alignment costs of $43 million and the $39 million pre-tax gain related to the PennyMac IPO. Income tax expense on an as adjusted basis included a tax benefit of approximately $29 million, primarily due to the realization of tax loss carryforwards, and benefits from certain nonrecurring items and excluded the $69 million net noncash benefit in 2013 and the $30 million net noncash benefit in 2012 described above. Earnings per diluted common share rose $2.90, or 21%, from 2012. The financial impact related to the Charitable Contribution has been excluded from as adjusted results for 2013. 2012 COMPARED WITH 2011 GAAP. Operating income of $3,524 million and operating margin of 37.7% increased $275 million and 190 basis points, respectively, from 2011 reflecting growth in base fees and higher performance fees. Operating income in 2012 included a $30 million charge related to the contribution to the Company’s STIFs. Nonoperating income (expense), less net income (loss) attributable to noncontrolling interests, increased $80 million due to higher net positive marks on investments in 2012 compared with 2011, partially offset by higher interest expense resulting from long-term debt issuances in May 2012 and May 2011. In 2012, income tax expense included a $21 million benefit related to the resolution of certain outstanding tax positions and a $50 million net noncash benefit related to the revaluation of certain deferred income tax liabilities, including the effect of tax legislation enacted in the United Kingdom and the state and local income tax effect resulting from changes in the Company’s organizational structure. In 2011, income tax expenses included a $24 million benefit related to the resolution of certain outstanding tax positions and $198 million of net noncash tax benefits due to a state tax election and enacted U.K., Japan, U.S. state and local tax legislation. Earnings per diluted common share rose $1.42 from 2011 due to higher net income and the benefit of share repurchases. During 2012, the Company repurchased 9.1 million shares. As Adjusted. Operating income of $3,574 million and operating margin of 40.4% increased $182 million and 70 basis points, respectively, from 2011 reflecting higher revenues. Operating income on an as adjusted basis excluded non-GAAP expense adjustments totaling $50 million in 2012 and $143 million in 2011. Nonoperating income (expense), less net income (loss) attributable to noncontrolling interests, increased $71 million. Income tax expense on an as adjusted basis excluded the $50 million and $198 million noncash benefits for 2012 and 2011, respectively, described above. Earnings per diluted common share rose $1.83 from 2011 reflecting the improvement in net income and the benefit of share repurchases.

For further discussion of BlackRock’s revenue, expenses, nonoperating results and income tax expense, see Discussion of Financial Results herein. BUSINESS OUTLOOK BlackRock’s highly diversified multi-product platform was created to meet the needs of its clients in all market environments. BlackRock is positioned to provide active and passive investment solutions across asset classes and geographies and leverage BlackRock Solutions’ world-class risk management, analytics and advisory capabilities on behalf of clients. BlackRock’s key client themes — Income, Alternatives, Outcome Investing, Strategic Beta, Emerging Markets and Retirement Solutions — are expected to drive the Company’s organic growth across its businesses. BlackRock’s Retail strategy is focused on an outcome-oriented approach to creating client solutions, including active, passive and alternative products, and enhanced distribution. In the United States, BlackRock is leveraging its integrated wholesaler force to further penetrate wire house distribution platforms and gain share amongst Registered Investment Advisors. Internationally, BlackRock continues to diversify the range of investment solutions available to clients, penetrate new distribution segments and capitalize on regulatory change impacting retrocession arrangements. iShares will be driven by the continued shift from active to passive investment strategies and adoption of ETFs. iShares is positioned to benefit from global market expansion, growth in fixed income ETFs and continued product innovation, while focusing on increasing U.S. market share, especially in the “buy-and-hold” segment. BlackRock believes Institutional results will be driven by strength in specialty areas, including Defined Contribution, Financial Institutions and Official Institutions, more effective cross-selling efforts and leveraging BlackRock Solutions’ analytical and risk management expertise. 31 Table of Contents Assuming a stable market environment, BlackRock anticipates that organic growth, coupled with the benefits of scale, should result in increasing operating margins over time. BlackRock believes that earnings growth and shareholder returns should also be positively impacted by the Company’s commitment to a consistent and predictable capital management strategy. NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES BlackRock reports its financial results in accordance with GAAP; however, management believes evaluating the Company’s ongoing operating results may be enhanced if investors have additional non-GAAP basis financial measures. Management reviews non-GAAP financial measures to assess ongoing operations and, for the reasons described below, considers them to be effective indicators, for both management and investors, of BlackRock’s financial performance over time. BlackRock’s management does not advocate that investors consider such non-GAAP financial measures in isolation from, or as a substitute for, financial information prepared in accordance with GAAP. Computations for all periods are derived from the consolidated statements of income as follows: (a) Operating income, as adjusted, and operating margin, as adjusted: Operating income, as adjusted, equals operating income, GAAP basis, excluding certain items management deems nonrecurring, recurring infrequently or transactions that ultimately will not impact BlackRock’s book value, as indicated in the table below. Management believes operating income, as adjusted, and operating margin, as adjusted, are effective indicators of BlackRock’s financial performance over time and, therefore, provide useful disclosure to investors. (in millions) 2013 2012 2011 Operating income, GAAP basis $ 3,857 $ 3,524 $ 3,249 Non-GAAP expense adjustments: PNC LTIP funding obligation 33 22 44 Charitable Contribution 124 — — U.K. lease exit costs — (8 ) 63 Contribution to STIFs — 30 — Merrill Lynch compensation contribution — — 7 Restructuring charges — — 32 Compensation expense related to appreciation (depreciation) on deferred compensation plans 10 6 (3 ) Operating income, as adjusted 4,024 3,574 3,392 Closed-end fund launch costs 16 22 26 Closed-end fund launch commissions 2 3 3 Operating income used for operating margin measurement $ 4,042 $ 3,599 $ 3,421 Revenue, GAAP basis $ 10,180 $ 9,337 $ 9,081 Non-GAAP adjustments: Distribution and servicing costs (353 ) (364 ) (386 ) Amortization of deferred sales commissions (52 ) (55 ) (81 ) Revenue used for operating margin measurement $ 9,775 $ 8,918 $ 8,614 Operating margin, GAAP basis 37.9 % 37.7 % 35.8 % Operating margin, as adjusted 41.4 % 40.4 % 39.7 % • Operating income, as adjusted, includes non-GAAP expense adjustments. The portion of compensation expense associated with certain long-term incentive plans (“LTIP”) funded or to be funded through share distributions to participants of BlackRock stock held by PNC and a Merrill Lynch & Co., Inc. (“Merrill Lynch”) cash compensation contribution has been excluded because it ultimately does not impact BlackRock’s book value. The expense related to the Merrill Lynch cash compensation contribution ceased at the end of third quarter 2011. In 2013, the $124 million expense related to the Charitable Contribution has been excluded from operating income, as adjusted, due to its nonrecurring nature and because the noncash, nonoperating pre-tax gain of $80 million directly related to the contributed PennyMac investment is reported in nonoperating income (expense). The U.K. lease exit costs represent costs to exit two locations in London in 2011. The amount in 2012 represents an adjustment related to the estimated lease exit costs initially recorded in 2011. The contribution to STIFs represents a contribution to certain of the Company’s bank-managed STIFs. Restructuring charges consist of compensation costs and professional fees. Compensation expense associated with appreciation (depreciation) on investments related to certain BlackRock deferred compensation plans has been excluded as returns on investments set aside for these plans, which substantially offset this expense, are reported in nonoperating income (expense). Management believes operating income exclusive of these items is a useful measure in evaluating BlackRock’s operating performance and helps enhance the comparability of this information for the reporting periods presented. • Operating margin, as adjusted, allows BlackRock to compare performance from period to period by adjusting for items that may not recur, recur infrequently or may have an economic offset in 32 Table of Contents nonoperating income (expense). BlackRock also uses operating margin, as adjusted, to monitor corporate performance and efficiency and as a benchmark to compare its performance with other companies. Management uses both GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures in evaluating BlackRock’s financial performance. The non-GAAP measure by itself may pose limitations because it does not include all of BlackRock’s revenues and expenses. Operating income used for measuring operating margin, as adjusted, is equal to operating income, as adjusted, excluding the impact of closed-end fund launch costs and related commissions. Management believes the exclusion of such costs and related commissions is useful because these costs can fluctuate considerably and revenues associated with the expenditure of these costs will not fully impact BlackRock’s results until future periods. Revenue used for operating margin, as adjusted, excludes distribution and servicing costs paid to related parties and other third parties. Management believes the exclusion of such costs is useful because it creates consistency in the treatment for certain contracts for similar services, which due to the terms of the contracts, are accounted for under GAAP on a net basis within investment advisory, administration fees and securities lending revenue. Amortization of deferred sales commissions is excluded from revenue used for operating margin measurement, as adjusted, because such costs, over time, substantially offset distribution fee revenue the Company earns. For each of these items, BlackRock excludes from revenue used for operating margin, as adjusted, the costs related to each of these items as a proxy for such offsetting revenues. (b) Nonoperating income (expense), less net income (loss) attributable to noncontrolling interests, as adjusted, is presented below. The compensation expense offset is recorded in operating income. This compensation expense has been included in nonoperating income (expense), less net income (loss) attributable to NCI, as adjusted, to offset returns on investments set aside for these plans, which are reported in nonoperating income (expense), GAAP basis. Management believes nonoperating income (expense), less net income (loss) attributable to NCI, as adjusted, provides comparability of information among reporting periods and is an effective measure for reviewing BlackRock’s nonoperating contribution to results. As compensation expense associated with (appreciation) depreciation on investments related to certain deferred compensation plans, which is included in operating income, substantially offsets the gain (loss) on the investments set aside for these plans, management believes nonoperating income (expense), less net income (loss) attributable to NCI, as adjusted, provides a useful measure, for both management and investors, of BlackRock’s nonoperating results that impact book value. During 2013, the noncash, nonoperating pre-tax gain of $80 million related to the contributed PennyMac investment has been excluded from nonoperating income (expense), less net income (loss) attributable to NCI, as adjusted due to its nonrecurring nature and because the more than offsetting associated Charitable Contribution expense of $124 million is reported in operating income. (in millions) 2013 2012 2011 Nonoperating income (expense), GAAP basis $ 116 $ (54 ) $ (114 ) Less: Net income (loss) attributable to NCI 19 (18 ) 2 Nonoperating income (expense) 97 (36 ) (116 ) Gain related to Charitable Contribution (80 ) — — Compensation expense related to (appreciation) depreciation on deferred compensation plans (10 ) (6 ) 3 Nonoperating income (expense), less net income (loss) attributable to NCI, as adjusted $ 7 $ (42 ) $ (113 ) (c) Net income attributable to BlackRock, as adjusted: Management believes net income attributable to BlackRock, Inc., as adjusted, and diluted earnings per common share, as adjusted, are useful measures of BlackRock’s profitability and financial performance. Net income attributable to BlackRock, Inc., as adjusted, equals net income attributable to BlackRock, Inc., GAAP basis, adjusted for significant nonrecurring items, charges that ultimately will not impact BlackRock’s book value or certain tax items that do not impact cash flow. See note (a) Operating income, as adjusted, and operating margin, as adjusted, for information on the PNC LTIP funding obligation, Merrill Lynch compensation contribution, Charitable Contribution, U.K. lease exit costs, contribution to STIFs and restructuring charges. The 2013 results included a tax benefit of approximately $48 million recognized in connection with the Charitable Contribution. The tax benefit has been excluded from net income attributable to BlackRock, Inc., as adjusted due to the nonrecurring nature of the Charitable Contribution. During 2013, income tax changes included adjustments related to the revaluation of certain deferred income tax liabilities, including the effect of legislation enacted in the United Kingdom and domestic state and local income tax changes. During 2012, income tax changes included adjustments related to the revaluation of certain deferred income tax liabilities, including the effect of legislation enacted in the United Kingdom and the state and local income tax effect resulting from changes in the Company’s organizational structure. During 2011, income tax changes included adjustments related to the revaluation of certain deferred income tax liabilities due to a state tax election and enacted U.K., Japan, U.S. state and local tax legislation. The resulting decrease in income taxes has been excluded from net income attributable to BlackRock, Inc., as adjusted, as these items will not have a cash flow impact and to ensure comparability among periods presented. 33 Table of Contents (in millions, except per share data) 2013 2012 2011 Net income attributable to BlackRock, GAAP basis $ 2,932 $ 2,458 $ 2,337 Non-GAAP adjustments, net of tax:(d) PNC LTIP funding obligation 23 14 30 Amount related to the Charitable Contribution (4 ) — — U.K. lease exit costs — (5 ) 43 Contribution to STIFs — 21 — Merrill Lynch compensation contribution — — 5 Restructuring charges — — 22 Income tax changes (69 ) (50 ) (198 ) Net income attributable to BlackRock, as adjusted $ 2,882 $ 2,438 $ 2,239 Allocation of net income, as adjusted, to common shares(e) $ 2,882 $ 2,435 $ 2,218 Diluted weighted-average common shares outstanding(f) 173.8 178.0 187.1 Diluted earnings per common share, GAAP basis(f) $ 16.87 $ 13.79 $ 12.37 Diluted earnings per common share, as adjusted(f) $ 16.58 $ 13.68 $ 11.85 (d) For each period presented, the non-GAAP adjustments, including the PNC LTIP funding obligation, Merrill Lynch compensation contribution, U.K. lease exit costs, contribution to STIFs and restructuring charges were tax effected at the respective blended rates applicable to the adjustments. Amounts for 2013 also included the tax benefit of approximately $48 million related to the Charitable Contribution. (e) Amounts for 2012 and 2011 exclude net income attributable to participating securities (see below). (f) Nonvoting participating preferred stock is considered to be a common stock equivalent for purposes of determining basic and diluted earnings per share calculations. Prior to 2013, certain unvested restricted stock units were not included in diluted weighted-average common shares outstanding as they were deemed participating securities in accordance with required provisions of Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”) 260-10, Earnings per Share. In 2012 and 2011, average outstanding participating securities were 0.2 million and 1.8 million, respectively.

AUM increased $532.5 billion, or 14%, to $4.324 trillion at December 31, 2013 from $3.792 trillion at December 31, 2012. The increase in AUM was driven by net market appreciation of $398.7 billion, net inflows of $119.7 billion and acquired AUM related to the MGPA acquisition and the Credit Suisse ETF Transaction, partially offset by foreign exchange net losses. Net market appreciation of $398.7 billion included $404.3 billion from equity products, primarily due to positive movements in U.S. and global equity markets. The $12.9 billion decrease in AUM from foreign exchange movements was due to the strengthening of the U.S. dollar, primarily against the Japanese yen and the Canadian dollar, partially offset by the weakening of the U.S. dollar against the pound sterling and the euro. 37 Table of Contents The following table presents the component changes in AUM by client type and product for 2012.

(3) Foreign exchange reflects the impact of converting non-U.S. dollar denominated AUM into U.S. dollars for reporting purposes. (4) Amounts include commodity iShares. (5) Advisory AUM represents long-term portfolio liquidation assignments. Redemptions include planned client distributions. AUM increased $278.9 billion, or 8%, to $3.792 trillion at December 31, 2012 from $3.513 trillion at December 31, 2011. The increase in AUM was driven largely by market gains and positive net new business, excluding the effect of two single client low-fee, institutional index fixed income outflows of $36.0 billion and $74.2 billion in the first quarter of 2012 and the third quarter of 2012, respectively. Total flows included $74.5 billion of planned advisory distributions and acquired AUM related to the SRPEP and the Claymore Transactions of $13.7 billion. Net market appreciation of $321.4 billion reflected growth in U.S. and global equity markets and $67.8 billion appreciation in fixed income products across the majority of strategies. The $15.7 billion net increase in AUM from converting non-U.S. dollar denominated AUM into U.S. dollars was primarily due to the weakening of the U.S. dollar against the pound sterling and the euro, partially offset by the strengthening of the U.S. dollar against the Japanese yen. DISCUSSION OF FINANCIAL RESULTS Introduction BlackRock derives a substantial portion of its revenue from investment advisory and administration fees, which are recognized as the services are performed. Such fees are primarily based on predetermined percentages of the market value of AUM or percentages of committed capital during investment periods of certain alternative products and are affected by changes in AUM, including market appreciation or depreciation, foreign exchange translation and net subscriptions or redemptions. Net subscriptions or redemptions represent the sum of new client assets, additional fundings from existing clients (including dividend reinvestment), withdrawals of assets from, and termination of, client accounts and distributions to investors representing return of capital and return on investments to investors. Market appreciation or depreciation includes current income earned on, and changes in the fair value of, securities held in client accounts. Foreign exchange translation reflects the impact of converting non-U.S. dollar denominated AUM into U.S. dollars for reporting purposes. BlackRock also earns revenue by lending securities on behalf of clients to highly rated banks and broker-dealers. The securities loaned are secured by collateral in the form of cash or securities, with minimum collateral generally ranging from approximately 102% to 112% of the value of the loaned securities. Generally, the revenue earned is shared between BlackRock and the funds or accounts managed by the Company from which the securities are borrowed. Historically, securities lending revenue in the second quarter exceeds the other quarters during the year driven by higher seasonal demand. Investment advisory agreements for certain separate accounts and investment funds provide for performance fees based upon relative and/or absolute investment performance, in addition to base fees based on AUM. Investment advisory performance fees generally are earned after a given period of time and when investment performance exceeds a contractual threshold. As such, the 39 Table of Contents timing of recognition of performance fees may increase the volatility of BlackRock’s revenue and earnings. Historically, the magnitude of performance fees in the third and fourth quarters generally exceeds that of the first two calendar quarters in a year due to the greater number of products with performance measurement periods that end on either September 30 or December 31. BlackRock provides a variety of risk management, investment analytic and investment system and advisory services to financial institutions, pension funds, asset managers, foundations, consultants, mutual fund sponsors, real estate investment trusts and government agencies. These services are provided under the brand name BlackRock Solutions and include a wide array of risk management services, valuation services related to illiquid securities, disposition and workout assignments (including long-term portfolio liquidation assignments), strategic planning and execution, and enterprise investment system outsourcing to clients. The Company’s Aladdin® operating platform serves as the investment/risk solutions system for BlackRock and other institutional investors. Fees earned for BlackRock Solutions and advisory services are determined using some, or all, of the following methods: (i) percentages of various attributes of advisory AUM or value of positions on the Aladdin platform, (ii) fixed fees and (iii) performance fees if contractual thresholds are met. BlackRock builds upon its leadership position to meet the growing need for investment and risk management solutions. Through its scale and diversity of products, it is able to provide its clients with customized solutions including fiduciary outsourcing for liability-driven investments and overlay strategies for pension plan sponsors, balance sheet management and related services for insurance companies and target date and target return funds, as well as asset allocation portfolios, for retail investors. BlackRock is also able to service these clients via its Aladdin platform to provide risk management and other outsourcing services for institutional investors and custom and tailored solutions to address complex risk exposures. The Company earns fees for transition management services primarily comprised of commissions from acting as a broker-dealer in connection with buying and selling securities on behalf of its customers. Commissions related to transition management services are recorded on a trade-date basis as securities transactions occur. The Company also earns revenue related to certain strategic investments accounted for as equity method investments. Operating expenses reflect employee compensation and benefits, distribution and servicing costs, amortization of deferred sales commissions, direct fund expenses, general and administration expenses and amortization of finite-lived intangible assets. • Employee compensation and benefits expense includes salaries, commissions, temporary help, deferred and incentive compensation, employer payroll taxes, severance and related benefit costs. • Distribution and servicing costs, which are primarily AUM driven, include payments made to Merrill Lynch-affiliated entities under a global distribution agreement, to PNC and Barclays, as well as other third parties, primarily associated with obtaining and retaining client investments in certain BlackRock products. • Direct fund expenses primarily consist of third-party nonadvisory expenses incurred by BlackRock related to certain funds for the use of index trademarks, reference data for indices, custodial services, fund administration, fund accounting, transfer agent services, shareholder reporting services, legal expenses, audit and tax services as well as other fund-related expenses directly attributable to the nonadvisory operations of the fund. These expenses may vary over time with fluctuations in AUM, number of shareholder accounts, or other attributes directly related to volume of business. • General and administration expenses include marketing and promotional, occupancy and office-related costs, portfolio services (including clearing expenses related to transition management services), technology, professional services, communications, closed-end fund launch costs and other general and administration expenses, including the impact of foreign currency remeasurement. Nonoperating income (expense) includes the effect of changes in the valuations on investments (excluding available-for-sale investments) and earnings on equity method investments as well as interest and dividend income and interest expense. Other comprehensive income includes changes in valuations related to available-for-sale investments. BlackRock primarily holds seed and co-investments in sponsored investment products that invest in a variety of asset classes, including private equity, distressed credit/mortgage debt securities, hedge funds and real estate. Investments generally are made for co-investment purposes, to establish a performance track record, to hedge exposure to certain deferred compensation plans or for regulatory purposes, including Federal Reserve Bank stock. BlackRock does not engage in proprietary trading activities that could conflict with the interests of its clients. In addition, nonoperating income (expense) includes the impact of changes in the valuations of consolidated sponsored investment funds and consolidated collateralized loan obligations (“CLOs”). The portion of nonoperating income (expense) not attributable to BlackRock is allocated to NCI on the consolidated statements of income. 40 Table of Contents Revenue (in millions) 2013 2012 2011 Investment advisory, administration fees and securities lending revenue: Equity: Active $ 1,741 $ 1,753 $ 1,967 iShares 2,390 1,941 1,847 Fixed income: Active 1,269 1,182 1,104 iShares 464 441 317 Multi-asset 1,039 957 894 Alternatives: Core 576 525 557 Currency and commodities 107 131 136 Subtotal 7,586 6,930 6,822 Non-ETF Index: Equity 594 552 488 Fixed income 238 229 203 Subtotal Non-ETF Index 832 781 691 Long-term 8,418 7,711 7,513 Cash management 321 361 383 Total base fees 8,739 8,072 7,896 Investment advisory performance fees: Equity 91 88 145 Fixed income 25 48 35 Multi-asset 24 15 20 Alternatives 421 312 171 Total 561 463 371 BlackRock Solutions and advisory 577 518 510 Distribution fees 73 71 100 Other revenue 230 213 204 Total revenue $ 10,180 $ 9,337 $ 9,081 The table below lists the asset type mix of investment advisory, administration fees and securities lending revenue (collectively “base fees”) and mix of average AUM by asset class: Mix of Base Fees Mix of Average AUM by Asset Class(1) 2013 2012 2011 2013 2012 2011 Equity: Active 20 % 22 % 25 % 7 % 8 % 9 % iShares 26 % 23 % 23 % 16 % 13 % 13 % Fixed income: Active 15 % 15 % 14 % 16 % 18 % 19 % iShares 5 % 5 % 4 % 5 % 5 % 4 % Multi-asset 12 % 12 % 11 % 7 % 7 % 6 % Alternatives: Core 7 % 7 % 7 % 2 % 2 % 2 % Currency and commodities 1 % 2 % 2 % 1 % 1 % 1 % Subtotal 86 % 86 % 86 % 54 % 54 % 54 % Non-ETF Index: Equity 7 % 7 % 6 % 29 % 26 % 26 % Fixed income 3 % 3 % 3 % 10 % 13 % 13 % Subtotal Non-ETF Index: 10 % 10 % 9 % 39 % 39 % 39 % Long-term 96 % 96 % 95 % 93 % 93 % 93 % Cash management 4 % 4 % 5 % 7 % 7 % 7 % Total excluding Advisory AUM 100 % 100 % 100 % 100 % 100 % 100 % (1) Average AUM is calculated as the average of the month-end spot AUM amounts for the trailing thirteen months. 41 Table of Contents 2013 Compared with 2012 Revenues increased $843 million, or 9%, from 2012, reflecting growth in markets, long-term net inflows and strength in performance fees and BlackRock Solutions and advisory revenue. Investment advisory, administration fees and securities lending revenue of $8,739 million for 2013 increased $667 million from $8,072 million in 2012 due to growth in long-term average AUM. Securities lending fees decreased $63 million from 2012 to $447 million in 2013 driven by lower spreads consistent with industry trends, partially offset by an increase in average balances of securities on loan. Investment advisory performance fees were $561 million in 2013 compared with $463 million in 2012, primarily reflecting higher fees from alternative products, including fund of funds and single-strategy hedge funds. Both years reflected significant fees from the liquidation of opportunistic funds. BlackRock Solutions and advisory revenue in 2013 totaled $577 million compared with $518 million in 2012. The current year reflected a $47 million increase in Aladdin business revenues to $421 million and higher advisory assignments revenue. Other revenue increased $17 million, largely reflecting higher transition management service fees and higher earnings from certain strategic investments. 2012 Compared with 2011 Revenues increased $256 million, or 3%, from 2011 reflecting market growth, positive flows, improvements in securities lending revenue and strength in performance fees. Investment advisory, administration fees and securities lending revenue totaled $8,072 million in 2012 compared with $7,896 million in 2011, reflecting an improvement in securities lending revenue and higher advisory fees reflecting higher long-term average AUM. Securities lending fees were $510 million in 2012 compared with $397 million in 2011, reflecting higher lending rates and an increase in average balances of securities on loan. Investment advisory performance fees were $463 million in 2012 compared with $371 million in 2011, primarily reflecting higher performance fees from alternative products, including fees from a disposition-related opportunistic fund, which were partially offset by lower fees from equity products. BlackRock Solutions and advisory revenue in 2012 increased $8 million, or 2%, from 2011, primarily due to a $51 million increase in Aladdin business revenue to $374 million, partially offset by the run off of revenues associated with a lower level of advisory assets and lower one-time revenue from advisory assignments. Distribution fees of $71 million in 2012 decreased $29 million, or 29%, from $100 million in 2011, primarily due to lower AUM in certain share classes of BlackRock funds. Other revenue increased $9 million, largely reflecting higher earnings from certain strategic investments, partially offset by lower sales commissions and marketing fees earned for services to distribute iPath® products. 42 Table of Contents Expenses (in millions) 2013 2012 2011 Expenses, GAAP: Employee compensation and benefits $ 3,560 $ 3,287 $ 3,199 Distribution and servicing costs 353 364 386 Amortization of deferred sales commissions 52 55 81 Direct fund expenses 657 591 563 General and administration: Marketing and promotional 409 384 315 Occupancy and office related 277 248 373 Portfolio services 203 196 189 Technology 160 150 146 Professional services 128 114 139 Communications 37 39 40 Regulatory, filing and license fees 31 17 16 Charitable Contribution 124 — — Closed-end fund launch costs 16 22 26 Other general and administration 155 189 171 Total general and administration expenses 1,540 1,359 1,415 Restructuring charges — — 32 Amortization of intangible assets 161 157 156 Total expenses, GAAP $ 6,323 $ 5,813 $ 5,832 Less non-GAAP expense adjustments: Employee compensation and benefits: PNC LTIP funding obligation 33 22 44 Merrill Lynch compensation contribution — — 7 Compensation expense related to appreciation (depreciation) on deferred compensation plans 10 6 (3 ) Subtotal 43 28 48 General and administration: Charitable Contribution 124 — — U.K. lease exit costs — (8 ) 63 Contribution to STIFs — 30 — Subtotal 124 22 63 Restructuring charges — — 32 Total non-GAAP expense adjustments 167 50 143 Expenses, as adjusted: Employee compensation and benefits 3,517 3,259 3,151 Distribution and servicing costs 353 364 386 Amortization of deferred sales commissions 52 55 81 Direct fund expenses 657 591 563 General and administration 1,416 1,337 1,352 Amortization of intangible assets 161 157 156 Total expenses, as adjusted $ 6,156 $ 5,763 $ 5,689 2013 Compared with 2012 GAAP. Expenses increased $510 million, or 9%, from 2012, primarily reflecting higher revenue-related expenses and the $124 million expense related to the Charitable Contribution. Employee compensation and benefits expense increased $273 million, or 8%, to $3,560 million in 2013 from $3,287 million in 2012, reflecting increased headcount and higher incentive compensation driven by higher operating income, including higher performance fees. Employees at December 31, 2013 totaled approximately 11,400 compared with approximately 10,500 at December 31, 2012. Distribution and servicing costs totaled $353 million in 2013 compared with $364 million in 2012. These costs included payments to Bank of America/Merrill Lynch under a global distribution agreement and PNC, as well as other third parties, primarily associated with the distribution and servicing of client investments in certain BlackRock products. Distribution and servicing costs for 2013 and 2012 included $184 million and $195 million, respectively, of costs attributable to Bank of America/Merrill Lynch. Direct fund expenses increased $66 million, reflecting higher average AUM, primarily related to iShares, where BlackRock pays certain nonadvisory expenses of the funds. General and administration expenses increased $181 million, largely driven by the $124 million expense related to the Charitable Contribution, higher marketing and promotional costs and various lease exit costs. The full year 2012 included a one-time $30 million contribution to STIFs. 43 Table of Contents As Adjusted. Expenses, as adjusted, increased $393 million, or 7%, to $6,156 million in 2013 from $5,763 million in 2012. The increase in total expenses, as adjusted, is primarily attributable to increases in employee compensation and benefits, direct fund expenses and general and administration expenses. 2012 Compared with 2011 GAAP. Expenses decreased $19 million to $5,813 million from 2011, primarily reflecting a reduction in general and administration expenses, amortization of deferred sales commissions and distribution and servicing costs, partially offset by higher employee compensation and benefits and direct fund expenses. General and administration expenses in 2012 included a $30 million charge related to a contribution to STIFs. Employee compensation and benefits expense increased $88 million, or 3%, to $3,287 million in 2012 from $3,199 million in 2011, reflecting an increase in incentive compensation driven by higher operating income, including higher performance fees. Employees at December 31, 2012 totaled approximately 10,500 compared with approximately 10,100 at December 31, 2011. Distribution and servicing costs decreased $22 million, or 6%, to $364 million in 2012 from $386 million in 2011. The $22 million decrease related to lower service fees from variable annuities and lower cash management-related distribution costs. Distribution and servicing costs for 2012 and 2011 included $195 million and $207 million, respectively, of costs attributable to Bank of America/Merrill Lynch. Amortization of deferred sales commissions decreased $26 million, or 32%, to $55 million in 2012 from $81 million in 2011, primarily related to lower sales in certain share classes of U.S. open-end mutual funds. Direct fund expenses increased $28 million from 2011 million, primarily reflecting growth in average AUM for the funds (predominantly iShares) where BlackRock pays certain nonadvisory expenses of the funds. General and administration expenses decreased $56 million, or 4%, to $1,359 million in 2012 from $1,415 million in 2011. Lower occupancy and office-related expenses, primarily due to $63 million of U.K. lease exit costs incurred in 2011, and lower professional services costs contributed to the overall net decrease in general and administration expenses. The decrease in general and administration expenses was partially offset by higher marketing and promotional expenses in connection with the brand campaign and a one-time contribution to STIFs. Restructuring charges of $32 million recorded in 2011, primarily related to severance, accelerated amortization of certain previously granted stock awards, and legal and outplacement costs associated with a reduction in work force and reengineering efforts. As Adjusted. Expenses, as adjusted, increased $74 million, or 1%, to $5,763 million in 2012 from $5,689 million in 2011. The increase in total expenses, as adjusted, is primarily attributable to increases in employee compensation and benefits and direct fund expenses, partially offset by a reduction in amortization of deferred sales commissions, distribution and servicing costs and general and administration expenses.

Net interest expense increased $10 million from 2012 primarily due to lower dividend income. For further information on the Company’s long-term debt, see Liquidity and Capital Resources herein. 2012 Compared with 2011 Net gains on investments increased $117 million from 2011 due to higher net positive marks in 2012 compared with 2011. Net interest expense increased from 2011, primarily due to long-term debt issuances in May 2011 and May 2012.

The Company’s tax rate is affected by tax rates in foreign jurisdictions and the relative amount of income earned in those jurisdictions, which the Company expects to be fairly consistent in the near term. The significant foreign jurisdictions, which have lower statutory tax rates than the U.S. federal statutory rate of 35%, include the United Kingdom, Luxembourg, Canada and the Netherlands. U.S. income taxes were not provided for certain undistributed foreign earnings intended to be indefinitely reinvested outside the United States. 2013. The GAAP effective tax rate of 25.8% for 2013 included a $69 million net noncash benefit primarily related to the revaluation of certain deferred income tax liabilities, including the effect of legislation enacted in the United Kingdom and domestic state and local income tax changes. In addition, 2013 included the approximately $48 million tax benefit recognized in connection with the Charitable Contribution, a tax benefit of approximately $29 million, primarily due to the realization of tax loss carryforwards, and benefits from certain nonrecurring items. 45 Table of Contents The as adjusted effective tax rate of 28.5% for 2013 included a tax benefit of approximately $29 million, primarily due to the realization of tax loss carryforwards, and benefits from certain nonrecurring items and excluded the $69 million net noncash benefit and the $48 million tax benefit related to the Charitable Contribution mentioned above. 2012. The GAAP effective tax rate of 29.5% for 2012 included a $21 million benefit related to the resolution of certain outstanding tax positions and a $50 million net noncash benefit related to the revaluation of certain deferred income tax liabilities, including the effect of tax legislation enacted in the United Kingdom and the state and local income tax effect resulting from changes in the Company’s organizational structure. The as adjusted effective tax rate of 31.0% for 2012 excluded the $50 million net noncash tax benefit mentioned above. 2011. The GAAP effective tax rate of 25.4% for 2011 included a $24 million benefit related to the resolution of certain outstanding tax positions and $198 million of net noncash tax benefits due to a state tax election and enacted U.K., Japan, U.S. state and local tax legislation. The 2011 as adjusted effective tax rate of 31.7% included the $24 million benefit related to the revaluation of certain deferred income tax liabilities and excluded the $198 million net noncash benefit. BALANCE SHEET OVERVIEW As Adjusted Balance Sheet The following table presents a reconciliation of the consolidated statement of financial condition presented on a GAAP basis to the consolidated statement of financial condition, excluding the impact of separate account assets and separate account collateral held under securities lending agreements (directly related to lending separate account securities) and separate account liabilities and separate account collateral liabilities under securities lending agreements, consolidated variable interest entities (“VIEs”) and consolidated sponsored investment funds. The Company presents the as adjusted balance sheet as additional information to enable investors to exclude certain assets that have equal and offsetting liabilities or noncontrolling interests that ultimately do not have an impact on stockholders’ equity (excluding appropriated retained earnings related to consolidated collateralized loan obligations (“CLOs”)) or cash flows. Management views the as adjusted balance sheet, a non-GAAP financial measure, as an economic presentation of its total assets and liabilities; however, it does not advocate that investors consider such non-GAAP financial measures in isolation from, or as a substitute for, financial information prepared in accordance with GAAP. Separate Account Assets and Liabilities and Separate Account Collateral Held under Securities Lending Agreements Separate account assets are maintained by BlackRock Life Limited, a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company, which is a registered life insurance company in the United Kingdom, and represent segregated assets held for purposes of funding individual and group pension contracts. The Company records equal and offsetting separate account liabilities. The separate account assets are not available to creditors of the Company and the holders of the pension contracts have no recourse to the Company’s assets. The net investment income attributable to separate account assets accrues directly to the contract owners and is not reported on the consolidated statements of income. While BlackRock has no economic interest in these assets or liabilities, BlackRock earns an investment advisory fee for the service of managing these assets on behalf of the clients. In addition, the Company records on its consolidated statements of financial condition the separate account collateral received under securities lending arrangements as its own asset in addition to an equal and offsetting separate account collateral liability for the obligation to return the collateral. Consolidated VIEs At December 31, 2013, BlackRock’s consolidated VIEs included multiple CLOs and one private investment fund. The assets of these VIEs are not available to creditors of the Company and the Company has no obligation to settle the liabilities of the VIEs. While BlackRock has no material economic interest in these assets or liabilities, BlackRock earns an investment advisory fee, as well as a potential performance fee, for the service of managing these assets on behalf of clients. Consolidated Sponsored Investment Funds The Company consolidates certain sponsored investment funds primarily because it is deemed to control such funds. The Company may not be readily able to access cash and cash equivalents held by consolidated sponsored investment funds to use in its operating activities. In addition, the Company may not be readily able to sell investments held by consolidated sponsored investment funds in order to obtain cash for use in the Company’s operations. 46 Table of Contents December 31, 2013 Segregated client assets generating advisory fees in which BlackRock has no economic interest or liability (in millions) GAAPBasis SeparateAccountAssets/Collateral ConsolidatedVIEs ConsolidatedSponsoredInvestmentFunds AsAdjusted Assets Cash and cash equivalents $ 4,390 $ — $ — $ 114 $ 4,276 Accounts receivable 2,247 — — — 2,247 Investments 2,151 — — 94 2,057 Assets of consolidated VIEs 2,486 — 2,486 — — Separate account assets and collateral held under securities lending agreements 176,901 176,901 — — — Other assets(1) 1,217 — — 20 1,197 Subtotal 189,392 176,901 2,486 228 9,777 Goodwill and intangible assets, net 30,481 — — — 30,481 Total assets $ 219,873 $ 176,901 $ 2,486 $ 228 $ 40,258 Liabilities Accrued compensation and benefits $ 1,747 $ — $ — $ — $ 1,747 Accounts payable and accrued liabilities 1,084 — — — 1,084 Borrowings 4,939 — — — 4,939 Liabilities of consolidated VIEs 2,443 — 2,443 — — Separate account liabilities and collateral liabilities under securities lending agreements 176,901 176,901 — — — Deferred income tax liabilities 5,085 — — — 5,085 Other liabilities 1,004 — — 39 965 Total liabilities 193,203 176,901 2,443 39 13,820 Equity Total stockholders’ equity(2) 26,460 — 22 — 26,438 Noncontrolling interests 210 — 21 189 — Total equity 26,670 — 43 189 26,438 Total liabilities and equity $ 219,873 $ 176,901 $ 2,486 $ 228 $ 40,258 (1) Amounts include property and equipment and other assets. (2) GAAP amount includes $22 million of appropriated retained earnings related solely to consolidated CLOs in which the Company has no equity exposure. The following discussion summarizes the significant changes in assets and liabilities on a GAAP basis. The discussion does not include changes related to assets and liabilities that are equal and offsetting and have no impact on BlackRock’s stockholders’ equity. Assets. Cash and cash equivalents at December 31, 2013 and 2012 included $114 million and $133 million, respectively, of cash held by consolidated sponsored investment funds (see Liquidity and Capital Resources for details on the change in cash and cash equivalents during 2013). Investments increased $401 million from December 31, 2012 (for more information see Investments herein). Goodwill and intangible assets increased $169 million from December 31, 2012, primarily due to the MGPA acquisition and Credit Suisse ETF Transaction, partially offset by $161 million of intangible assets amortization expense. Other assets (including property, plant and equipment) increased $34 million from December 31, 2012, primarily related to an increase in strategic investments and other receivables, partially offset by a decrease in property and equipment due to depreciation and a decrease in current taxes receivable. Liabilities. Accrued compensation and benefits at December 31, 2013 increased $200 million from December 31, 2012, primarily due to 2013 incentive compensation accruals. Accounts payable and accrued liabilities at December 31, 2013 increased $29 million from December 31, 2012 due to an increase in current income taxes payable and increased accruals, including direct fund expenses, partially offset by lower unit trust payables (substantially offset by a decrease in unit trust receivables recorded within accounts receivable). Borrowings decreased $848 million from December 31, 2012 resulting from the repayments of $750 million and $100 million of long-term and short-term borrowings, respectively. Net deferred income tax liabilities at December 31, 2013 decreased $208 million, primarily due to the effects of temporary differences associated with stock compensation and investment income. The change also reflects the revaluation of certain deferred income tax liabilities due to legislation enacted in the United Kingdom, domestic state and local income tax changes, and realization of tax loss carryforwards. Other liabilities at December 31, 2013 increased $146 million from December 31, 2012, primarily resulting from an increase in liability of unrecognized tax benefits, a contingent liability related to the Credit Suisse ETF Transaction and other operating liabilities. 47 Table of Contents Investments Investments totaled $2,151 million at December 31, 2013 and $1,750 million at December 31, 2012. Investments include consolidated investments held by sponsored investment funds deemed to be controlled by BlackRock. Management reviews BlackRock’s investments on an “economic” basis, which eliminates the portion of investments that does not impact BlackRock’s book value or net income attributable to BlackRock. BlackRock’s management does not advocate that investors consider such non-GAAP financial measures in isolation from, or as a substitute for, financial information prepared in accordance with GAAP. The Company presents total investments, as adjusted, to enable investors to understand the portion of its investments that is owned by the Company, net of NCI, as a gauge to measure the impact of changes in net nonoperating gain (loss) on investments to net income (loss) attributable to BlackRock. The Company further presents net “economic” investment exposure, net of deferred compensation investments and hedged investments, to reflect another gauge for investors as the economic impact of investments held pursuant to deferred compensation arrangements is substantially offset by a change in compensation expense and the impact of hedged investments is substantially mitigated by swap hedges. Carried interest capital allocations are excluded as there is no impact to BlackRock’s stockholders’ equity until such amounts are realized as performance fees. Finally, the Company’s regulatory investment in Federal Reserve Bank stock, which is not subject to market or interest rate risk, is excluded from the Company’s net economic investment exposure.

The following table represents the carrying value of the Company’s economic investment exposure, by asset type, at December 31, 2013 and 2012: (in millions) December 31,2013 December 31,2012 Private equity $ 328 $ 298 Real estate 125 122 Distressed credit/mortgage funds 148 214 Hedge funds/funds of hedge funds 348 159 Other investments(1) 634 418 Total “economic” investment exposure $ 1,583 $ 1,211 (1) Other investments primarily include seed investments in fixed income and equity funds/strategies as well as U.K. government securities held for regulatory purposes.

Certain equity method investees do not account for both their financial assets and financial liabilities under fair value measures, therefore, the Company’s investment in such equity method investees may not represent fair value. (2) Amounts include cash and cash equivalents, other assets and liabilities that are consolidated from non-VIE sponsored investment funds. See Note 5, Fair Value Disclosures, to the consolidated financial statements contained in Part II, Item 8 of this filing, for total GAAP investments. LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES BlackRock Cash Flows Excluding the Impact of Consolidated Sponsored Investment Funds and VIEs BlackRock consolidates certain of its sponsored investment funds and CLOs, notwithstanding the fact BlackRock may only have a minority interest, if any, in these funds or CLOs. As a result, the consolidated statements of cash flows include the cash flows of consolidated sponsored investment funds and CLOs. The Company uses an adjusted cash flow statement, which excludes the impact of consolidated sponsored investment funds and CLOs, as a supplemental non-GAAP measure to assess liquidity and capital requirements. The Company believes that its cash flows, excluding the impact of the consolidated sponsored investment funds and CLOs, provide investors with useful information on the cash flows of BlackRock relating to its ability to fund additional operating, investing and financing activities. BlackRock’s management does not advocate that investors consider such non-GAAP measures in isolation from, or as a substitute for, its cash flows presented in accordance with GAAP. The following table presents a reconciliation of the consolidated statements of cash flows presented on a GAAP basis to the consolidated statements of cash flows, excluding the impact of the cash flows of consolidated sponsored investment funds and consolidated VIEs: (in millions) GAAPBasis Impact onCash Flowsof ConsolidatedSponsoredInvestmentFunds Impact onCash FlowsofConsolidatedVIEs Cash FlowsExcludingImpact ofConsolidatedSponsoredInvestmentFunds and VIEs Cash and cash equivalents, December 31, 2011 $ 3,506 $ 196 $ — $ 3,310 Cash flows from operating activities 2,240 (256 ) (227 ) 2,723 Cash flows from investing activities (266 ) (211 ) — (55 ) Cash flows from financing activities (944 ) 404 227 (1,575 ) Effect of exchange rate changes on cash and cash equivalents 70 — — 70 Net change in cash and cash equivalents 1,100 (63 ) — 1,163 Cash and cash equivalents, December 31, 2012 4,606 133 — 4,473 Cash flows from operating activities 3,642 (137 ) 286 3,493 Cash flows from investing activities (483 ) 39 — (522 ) Cash flows from financing activities (3,392 ) 79 (286 ) (3,185 ) Effect of exchange rate changes on cash and cash equivalents 17 — — 17 Net change in cash and cash equivalents (216 ) (19 ) — (197 ) Cash and cash equivalents, December 31, 2013 $ 4,390 $ 114 $ — $ 4,276 Sources of BlackRock’s operating cash primarily include investment advisory, administration fees and securities lending revenue, performance fees, revenue from BlackRock Solutions and advisory products and services, other revenue and distribution fees. BlackRock uses its cash to pay all operating expenses, interest and principal on the Company’s borrowings, income taxes, dividends on BlackRock’s capital stock, repurchases of the Company’s stock, capital expenditures and purchases of co-investments and seed investments. Cash flows from operating activities, excluding the impact of consolidated sponsored investment funds and VIEs, primarily include the receipt of investment advisory and administration fees, securities lending revenue and other revenue offset by the payment of operating expenses incurred in the normal course of business, including year-end incentive compensation accrued for in the prior year. Cash outflows from investing activities, excluding the impact of consolidated sponsored investment funds and VIEs, for 2013 were $522 million and primarily reflected $555 million 49 Table of Contents of investment purchases and $298 million related to the Credit Suisse ETF Transaction and the MGPA acquisition, partially offset by $342 million of net proceeds from sales and maturities of certain investments. Cash outflows from financing activities, excluding the impact of consolidated sponsored investment funds and VIEs, for 2013 were $3.2 billion, primarily resulting from $1.2 billion of share repurchases, including $1.0 billion in open market transactions and $243 million of employee tax withholdings related to employee stock transactions, $1.2 billion of cash dividend payments, a $750 million long-term debt repayment and a $100 million short-term debt repayment. Cash outflows from financing activities were partially offset by cash inflows related to $41 million of excess tax benefits from stock-based compensation. The Company manages its financial condition and funding to maintain appropriate liquidity for the business. Liquidity resources at December 31, 2013 and 2012 were as follows: (in millions) December 31,2013 December 31,2012 Cash and cash equivalents $ 4,390 $ 4,606 Cash and cash equivalents held by consolidated sponsored investment funds(1) (114 ) (133 ) Subtotal 4,276 4,473 Credit facility — undrawn 3,990 3,685 Total liquidity $ 8,266 $ 8,158 (1) The Company may not be able to access such cash to use in its operating activities. Total liquidity increased $108 million during 2013, primarily reflecting positive operating cash flow and the increased aggregate commitment of the 2013 credit facility to $3.990 billion, partially offset by the $750 million repayment of long-term borrowings, cash payments of 2012 year-end incentive awards, share repurchases, including $1.0 billion in open market transactions, and cash dividend payments. A significant portion of the Company’s $2,057 million of total investments, as adjusted, is illiquid in nature and, as such, may not be readily convertible to cash. Share Repurchase Approvals. In January 2013, the Board of Directors (the “Board”) approved an increase in the availability under the Company’s existing share repurchase program to allow for the repurchase of up to 10.2 million shares of BlackRock common stock. The Company repurchased 3.7 million common shares in open market-transactions under the share repurchase program for $1.0 billion during 2013. At December 31, 2013, there were 6.5 million shares still authorized to be repurchased. Net Capital Requirements. The Company is required to maintain net capital in certain regulated subsidiaries within a number of jurisdictions, which is partially maintained by retaining cash and cash equivalent investments in those subsidiaries or jurisdictions. As a result, such subsidiaries of the Company may be restricted in their ability to transfer cash between different jurisdictions and to their parents. Additionally, transfers of cash between international jurisdictions, including repatriation to the United States, may have adverse tax consequences that could discourage such transfers. BlackRock Institutional Trust Company, N.A. (“BTC”) is chartered as a national bank that does not accept client deposits and whose powers are limited to trust activities. BTC provides investment management services, including investment advisory and securities lending agency services, to institutional investors and other clients. BTC is subject to regulatory capital and liquid asset requirements administered by the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency. At December 31, 2013, the Company was required to maintain approximately $1.1 billion compared with $1.2 billion at December 31, 2012 in net capital in certain regulated subsidiaries, including BTC, entities regulated by the Financial Conduct Authority and Prudential Regulation Authority in the United Kingdom and the Company’s broker-dealers. The Company was in compliance with all applicable regulatory net capital requirements. The decrease in required net capital was primarily due to a reduction in the BTC minimum Tier 1 capital requirement from $500 million to $385 million in August 2013. Undistributed Earnings of Foreign Subsidiaries. As of December 31, 2013, the Company has not provided for U.S. federal and state income taxes on approximately $3.1 billion of undistributed earnings of its foreign subsidiaries. Such earnings are considered indefinitely reinvested outside the United States. The Company’s current plans do not demonstrate a need to repatriate these funds. Short-Term Borrowings 2013 Revolving Credit Facility. In March 2011, the Company entered into a five-year $3.5 billion unsecured revolving credit facility (the “2011 credit facility”). In March 2012, the 2011 credit facility was amended to extend the maturity date by one year to March 2017 and in April 2012 the amount of the aggregate commitment was increased to $3.785 billion (the “2012 credit facility”). In March 2013, the Company’s credit facility was amended to extend the maturity date by one year to March 2018 and the amount of the aggregate commitment was increased to $3.990 billion (the “2013 credit facility”). The 2013 credit facility permits the Company to request up to an additional $1.0 billion of borrowing capacity, subject to lender credit approval, increasing the overall size of the 2013 credit facility to an aggregate principal amount not to exceed $4.990 billion. Interest on borrowings outstanding accrues at a rate based on the applicable London Interbank Offered Rate plus a spread. The 2013 credit facility requires the Company not to exceed a maximum leverage ratio (ratio of net debt to earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, where net debt equals total debt less unrestricted cash) of 3 to 1, which was satisfied with a ratio of less than 1 to 1 at December 31, 2013. The 2013 credit facility provides back-up liquidity, funds ongoing working capital for general corporate purposes and funds various investment opportunities. At December 31, 2013, the Company had no amount outstanding under the 2013 credit facility. Commercial Paper Program. On October 14, 2009, BlackRock established a commercial paper program (the “CP Program”) under which the Company could issue unsecured commercial paper notes (the “CP Notes”) on a private placement basis up to a maximum aggregate amount outstanding at any time of $3.0 billion. On May 13, 2011, BlackRock increased the maximum aggregate amount that may be borrowed under the CP Program to $3.5 billion. On 50 Table of Contents May 17, 2012, BlackRock increased the maximum aggregate amount to $3.785 billion. In April 2013, BlackRock increased the maximum aggregate amount for which the Company could issue unsecured CP Notes on a private-placement basis up to a maximum aggregate amount outstanding at any time of $3.990 billion. The commercial paper program is currently supported by the 2013 credit facility. At December 31, 2013, BlackRock had no CP Notes outstanding. Long-term Borrowings. At December 31, 2013, the principal amount of long-term borrowings, including the current portion, was $4.95 billion. 2015 and 2022 Notes. In May 2012, the Company issued $1.5 billion in aggregate principal amount of unsecured unsubordinated obligations. These notes were issued as two separate series of senior debt securities, including $750 million of 1.375% notes maturing in June 2015 (the “2015 Notes”) and $750 million of 3.375% notes maturing in June 2022 (the “2022 Notes”). Net proceeds were used to fund the repurchase of BlackRock’s common stock and Series B Preferred from Barclays and affiliates and for general corporate purposes. Interest on the 2015 Notes and 2022 Notes of approximately $10 million and $25 million per year, respectively, is payable semi-annually on June 1 and December 1 of each year, which commenced December 1, 2012. The 2015 Notes and 2022 Notes may be redeemed prior to maturity at any time in whole or in part at the option of the Company at a “make-whole” redemption price. The “make-whole” redemption price represents a price, subject to the specific terms of the 2015 and 2022 Notes and related indenture, that is the greater of (a) par value and (b) the present value of future payments that will not be paid because of an early redemption, which is discounted at a fixed spread over a comparable Treasury security. 2013 and 2021 Notes. In May 2011, the Company issued $1.5 billion in aggregate principal amount of unsecured unsubordinated obligations. These notes were issued as two separate series of senior debt securities, including $750 million of 4.25% notes maturing in May 2021 and $750 million of floating rate notes (“2013 Floating Rate Notes”), which were repaid in May 2013. Net proceeds of this offering were used to fund the repurchase of BlackRock’s Series B Preferred from affiliates of Merrill Lynch. Interest on the 4.25% notes due in 2021 (“2021 Notes”) is payable semi-annually on May 24 and November 24 of each year, which commenced November 24, 2011, and is approximately $32 million per year. The 2021 Notes may be redeemed prior to maturity at any time in whole or in part at the option of the Company at a “make-whole” redemption price. In May 2011, in conjunction with the issuance of the 2013 Floating Rate Notes, the Company entered into a $750 million notional interest rate swap maturing in 2013 to hedge the future cash flows of its obligation at a fixed rate of 1.03%. During the second quarter of 2013, the interest rate swap matured and the 2013 Floating Rate Notes were fully repaid. 2012, 2014 and 2019 Notes. In December 2009, the Company issued $2.5 billion in aggregate principal amount of unsecured and unsubordinated obligations. These notes were issued as three separate series of senior debt securities, including $0.5 billion of 2.25% notes, which were repaid in December 2012, $1.0 billion of 3.50% notes and $1.0 billion of 5.0% notes maturing in December 2014 and 2019, respectively. Net proceeds of this offering were used to repay borrowings under the CP program, which was used to finance a portion of the BGI Transaction, and for general corporate purposes. These notes may be redeemed prior to maturity at any time in whole or in part at the option of the Company at a “make-whole” redemption price. Interest on the 2014 Notes and 2019 Notes of approximately $35 million and $50 million per year, respectively, is payable semi-annually in arrears on June 10 and December 10 of each year. 2017 Notes. In September 2007, the Company issued $700 million in aggregate principal amount of 6.25% senior unsecured and unsubordinated notes maturing on September 15, 2017 (the “2017 Notes”). A portion of the net proceeds of the 2017 Notes was used to fund the initial cash payment for the acquisition of the fund of funds business of Quellos Group, LLC in October 2007 (the “Quellos Transaction”) and the remainder was used for general corporate purposes. Interest is payable semi-annually in arrears on March 15 and September 15 of each year, or approximately $44 million per year. The 2017 Notes may be redeemed prior to maturity at any time in whole or in part at the option of the Company at a “make-whole” redemption price. Contractual Obligations, Commitments and Contingencies The following table sets forth contractual obligations, commitments and contingencies by year of payment at December 31, 2013: (in millions) 2014 2015 2016 2017 2018 Thereafter Total Contractual obligations and commitments: Long-term borrowings(1): Principal $ 1,000 $ 750 $ — $ 700 $ — $ 2,500 $ 4,950 Interest 196 156 151 151 107 218 979 Operating leases 135 127 110 109 106 699 1,286 Purchase obligations 83 77 31 8 — — 199 Investment commitments 216 — — — — — 216 Total contractual obligations and commitments 1,630 1,110 292 968 213 3,417 7,630 Contingent obligations: Contingent distribution obligations 172 172 172 — — — 516 Contingent payments related to business acquisitions(2) 4 5 11 8 23 24 75 Total contractual obligations, commitments and contingent obligations(3) $ 1,806 $ 1,287 $ 475 $ 976 $ 236 $ 3,441 $ 8,221 51 Table of Contents (1) Long-term borrowings exclude the borrowings of consolidated CLOs. The Company has no obligation to settle the liabilities of these CLOs. (2) The amount of contingent payments reflected for any year represents the expected payment amounts, using foreign currency exchange rates as of December 31, 2013, under the terms of the business acquisition’s agreement. The maximum potential payment amount related to Credit Suisse ETF Transaction is approximately $24 million for any year during a seven year period. There is no maximum amount for payments related to the MGPA Transaction. The fair value of the contingent obligations is not significant to the consolidated statement of financial condition and is recorded within other liabilities. (3) At December 31, 2013, the Company had $372 million of net unrecognized tax benefits. Due to the uncertainty of timing and amounts that will ultimately be paid, this amount has been excluded from the table above. Operating Leases. The Company leases its primary office locations under agreements that expire on varying dates through 2035. In connection with certain lease agreements, the Company is responsible for escalation payments. The contractual obligations table above includes only guaranteed minimum lease payments for such leases and does not project potential escalation or other lease-related payments. These leases are classified as operating leases and, as such, are not recorded as liabilities on the consolidated statements of financial condition. Purchase Obligations. In the ordinary course of business, BlackRock enters into contracts or purchase obligations with third parties whereby the third parties provide services to or on behalf of BlackRock. Purchase obligations included in the contractual obligations table above represent executory contracts, which are either noncancelable or cancelable with a penalty. At December 31, 2013, the Company’s obligations primarily reflected standard service contracts for portfolio, market data, office-related services and third-party marketing and promotional services. Purchase obligations are recorded on the Company’s financial statements when services are provided and, as such, obligations for services not received are not included in the consolidated statement of financial condition at December 31, 2013. Investment Commitments. At December 31, 2013, the Company had $216 million of various capital commitments to fund sponsored investment funds, including funds of private equity funds, real estate funds, infrastructure funds, opportunistic funds and distressed credit funds. This amount excludes additional commitments made by consolidated funds of funds to underlying third-party funds as third-party noncontrolling interest holders have the legal obligation to fund the respective commitments of such funds of funds. Generally, the timing of the funding of these commitments is unknown and the commitments are callable on demand at any time prior to the expiration of the commitment. These unfunded commitments are not recorded on the consolidated statements of financial condition. These commitments do not include potential future commitments approved by the Company, but which are not yet legally binding. The Company intends to make additional capital commitments from time to time to fund additional investment products for, and with, its clients. Carried Interest Clawback. As a general partner in certain investment funds, including private equity partnerships and certain hedge funds, the Company may receive carried interest cash distributions from the partnerships in accordance with distribution provisions of the partnership agreements. The Company may, from time to time, be required to return all or a portion of such distributions to the limited partners in the event the limited partners do not achieve a return as specified in the various partnership agreements. Therefore, BlackRock records carried interest subject to such clawback provisions in investments, or cash to the extent that it is distributed, and as a deferred carried interest liability on its consolidated statements of financial condition. Carried interest is realized and recorded as performance fees on BlackRock’s consolidated statements of income upon the earlier of the termination of the investment fund or when the likelihood of clawback is mathematically improbable. Contingent Payments Related to Business Acquisitions. In connection with the Credit Suisse ETF Transaction, BlackRock is required to make contingent payments annually to Credit Suisse, subject to achieving specified thresholds during a seven year period, subsequent to the acquisition date. In addition, BlackRock is required to make contingent payments related to the MGPA Transaction during a five year period, subject to achieving specified thresholds, subsequent to the acquisition date. The fair value of the contingent payments at December 31, 2013 is not significant to the consolidated statement of financial condition and is included in other liabilities. Indemnifications. In many of the Company’s contracts, including the BGI, Merrill Lynch Investment Managers (“MLIM”) and Quellos Transaction agreements, BlackRock agrees to indemnify third parties under certain circumstances. The terms of the indemnities vary from contract to contract and the amount of indemnification liability, if any, cannot be determined and, therefore, has not been included in the table above or recorded in the consolidated statement of financial condition at December 31, 2013. See further discussion in Note 13, Commitments and Contingencies, to the consolidated financial statements beginning on page F-1 of this Form 10-K. On behalf of certain clients, the Company lends securities to highly rated banks and broker-dealers. In these securities lending transactions, the borrower is required to provide and maintain collateral at or above regulatory minimums. Securities on loan are marked to market daily to determine if the borrower is required to pledge additional collateral. BlackRock has issued certain indemnifications to certain securities lending clients against potential losses resulting from a borrower’s failure to fulfill its obligations should the value of the collateral pledged by the borrower at the time of default be insufficient to cover the borrower’s obligations under the securities lending agreement. At December 31, 2013, the Company indemnified certain of its clients for their securities lending loan balances of approximately $118.3 billion. The Company held, as agent, cash and securities totaling $124.6 billion as collateral for indemnified securities on loan at December 31, 2013. The fair value of these indemnifications was not material at December 31, 2013. The Company currently expects indemnified balances to continue to increase over time. While the collateral pledged by a borrower is intended to be sufficient to offset the borrower’s obligations to return securities borrowed and any other amounts owing to the lender under the relevant securities lending agreement, in the event of a borrower default, the Company can give no assurance that the collateral pledged by the borrower will be sufficient to fulfill such obligations. If the amount of such pledged collateral is not sufficient to fulfill such obligations 52 Table of Contents to a client for whom the Company has provided indemnification, BlackRock would be responsible for the amount of the shortfall. These indemnifications cover only the collateral shortfall described above, and do not in any way guarantee, assume or otherwise insure the investment performance or return of any cash collateral vehicle into which securities lending cash collateral is invested. Contingent Distribution Obligations. In November 2010, BlackRock entered into a second amended and restated global distribution agreement with Merrill Lynch, which requires the Company to make payments to Merrill Lynch contingent upon sales of products and level of AUM maintained in certain BlackRock products. The initial term of the agreement remained in effect until January 2014. After such term, the agreement renewed for one automatic three-year extension. The following items have not been included in the contractual obligations, commitments and contingencies table: Compensation and Benefit Obligations. The Company has various compensation and benefit obligations, including bonuses, commissions and incentive payments payable, defined contribution plan matching contribution obligations, and deferred compensation arrangements, that are excluded from the contractual obligations and commitments table above. These arrangements are discussed in more detail in Note 14, Stock-Based Compensation, and Note 15, Employee Benefit Plans, to the consolidated financial statements beginning on page F-1 of this Form 10-K. Accrued compensation and benefits at December 31, 2013 totaled $1,747 million and included incentive compensation of $1,335 million, deferred compensation of $164 million and other compensation and benefits related obligations of $248 million. Substantially all of the incentive compensation liability was paid in the first quarter of 2014, while the deferred compensation obligations are generally payable over periods up to five years. Separate Account Liabilities. At December 31, 2013, the Company had $155.1 billion of separate account assets and offsetting liabilities on the consolidated statement of financial condition. The timing of payments of these contractual obligations is inherently uncertain and varies by customer. As such, these liabilities have been excluded from the contractual obligations table above. Critical Accounting Policies The preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods. Actual results could differ significantly from those estimates. Management considers the following critical accounting policies important to understanding the consolidated financial statements. For a summary of these and additional accounting policies see Note 2, Significant Accounting Policies, to the consolidated financial statements beginning on page F-1 of this Form 10-K. Consolidation of Sponsored Investment Funds and Securitization Products. Consolidation of sponsored investment funds and securitization products (collectively “investment products”) is determined pursuant to ASC 810, Consolidation. The accounting method used by the Company depends upon the influence the Company has over its investee, the investment product. To the extent that BlackRock can exert control over the financial and operating policies of the investment product, which generally exists if there is a 50% or greater voting interest or if partners or members of certain products do not have substantive rights, BlackRock consolidates the investment product. For investment products in which BlackRock’s voting interest is less than 50%, an analysis is performed to determine if the investment product is a VIE or a voting rights entity. Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities. Certain investment products for which the risks and rewards of ownership are not directly linked to voting interests may be deemed VIEs. BlackRock reviews factors, including the rights of the equity holders and obligations of equity holders to absorb losses or receive expected residual returns, to determine if the investment product is a VIE. BlackRock continuously evaluates such factors as facts and circumstances change. BlackRock is required to consolidate a VIE when it is deemed to be the primary beneficiary (“PB”). Accounting Standards Update (“ASU”) 2010-10, Amendments to Statement 167 for Certain Investment Funds (“ASU 2010-10”) defers the application of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (“SFAS”) No. 167, Amendments to FASB Interpretation No. 46(R), for certain investment funds, including money market funds. The PB of a VIE that is an investment fund that meets the conditions of ASU 2010-10 is the enterprise that has a variable interest (or combination of variable interests, including those of related parties) that absorbs the majority of the entity’s expected losses, receives a majority of the entity’s expected residual returns, or both. The PB of a VIE that does not meet the conditions for deferral in ASU 2010-10 is the enterprise that has the power to direct activities of the entity that most significantly impact the entity’s economic performance and has the obligation to absorb losses or the right to receive benefits that potentially could be significant to the VIE. Significant judgment is required in the determination of whether the Company is the PB of a VIE. If the Company is determined to be the PB of a VIE, BlackRock will consolidate the entity. In order to determine whether the Company is the PB of a VIE for entities that meet the conditions of ASU 2010-10, management must make significant estimates and assumptions of projected future cash flows. Assumptions made in such analyses include, but are not limited to, market prices of securities, market interest rates, potential credit defaults on individual securities or default rates on a portfolio of securities, prepayments, realization of gains, liquidity or marketability of certain securities, discount rates and the probability of certain other outcomes. In the normal course of business, the Company is the manager of various types of sponsored investment vehicles, including collateralized debt obligations (“CDOs”) or CLOs that do not meet the conditions of ASU 2010-10 and sponsored investment funds, which may be considered VIEs. 53 Table of Contents At December 31, 2013, the following balances related to VIEs were included on the consolidated statements of financial condition: (in millions) CLOs SponsoredPrivateEquity Fund TotalConsolidatedVIEs Assets of consolidated VIEs: Cash and cash equivalents $ 156 $ 5 $ 161 Bank loans, bonds, other investments and other assets 2,309 16 2,325 Liabilities of consolidated VIEs: Borrowings (2,369 ) — (2,369 ) Other liabilities (74 ) — (74 ) Appropriated retained earnings (22 ) — (22 ) Noncontrolling interests of consolidated VIEs — (21 ) (21 ) Total BlackRock net interests in consolidated VIEs $ — $ — $ — CLOs. At December 31, 2013, BlackRock was the manager of over 20 CLOs/CDOs and other securitization entities. BlackRock was determined to be the PB for certain of these CLOs, which required BlackRock to consolidate these VIEs. BlackRock was deemed to be the PB because it has the power to direct the activities of the CLOs that most significantly impact the entities’ economic performance and has the right to receive benefits that potentially could be significant to the VIE. The Company recorded appropriated retained earnings for the difference between the assets and liabilities of the CLOs recorded on the consolidated statement of financial condition as the CLO noteholders ultimately will receive the benefits or absorb the losses associated with the CLOs’ assets and liabilities. Changes in the fair value of the assets and liabilities of these CLOs have no impact on net income attributable to BlackRock or its cash flows. Excluding outstanding management receivables, the Company has no risk of loss with its involvement with these VIEs. Sponsored Private Equity Fund of Funds. At December 31, 2013, BlackRock was determined to be the PB of one investment fund of funds and was deemed to absorb the majority of the variability due to its de-facto related-party relationships with other partners in the fund, which limited the ability of the partners to transfer or sell their interests without BlackRock’s consent as the general partner of the fund. Changes in the fair value of the assets and liabilities of this VIE recorded on the consolidated statements of financial condition have no impact on net income attributable to BlackRock. Excluding outstanding management fee receivables, the Company has no risk of loss related to its involvement with this VIE. Consolidation of Voting Rights Entities. To the extent that BlackRock can exert control over the financial and operating policies of the investee, which generally exists if there is a 50% or greater voting interest or if partners or members of certain products do not have substantive rights, BlackRock consolidates the investee. The Company, as general partner or managing member of certain sponsored investment funds, generally is presumed to control funds that are limited partnerships or limited liability companies. Pursuant to ASC 810-20, Control of Partnerships and Similar Entities (“ASC 810-20”), the Company reviews such investment vehicles to determine if such a presumption can be overcome by determining whether other nonaffiliated partners or members of the limited partnership or limited liability company have the substantive ability to dissolve (liquidate) the investment vehicle, or otherwise to remove BlackRock as the general partner or managing member without cause based on a simple unaffiliated majority vote, or have other substantive participating rights. If the investment vehicle is not a VIE and the presumption of control is not overcome, BlackRock will consolidate the investment vehicle. At December 31, 2013 and 2012, as a result of consolidation of various investment products deemed to be voting rights entities, including products where BlackRock owns 50% or greater of the voting rights of the product, under the consolidation policies described above, the Company had the following balances on its consolidated statements of financial condition: (in millions) December 31,2013 December 31,2012 Cash and cash equivalents $ 114 $ 133 Investments: Trading investments 385 123 Other investments 441 401 Other assets 20 25 Other liabilities (39 ) (65 ) Noncontrolling interests (189 ) (187 ) BlackRock’s net interests in consolidated investment funds $ 732 $ 430 The Company retained the specialized accounting of these investment funds pursuant to ASC 810. VIEs, including a consolidated sponsored investment fund and CLOs, were excluded from the balances above as the balances of these VIEs are reported separately on the consolidated statements of financial condition. Investments Equity Method Investments. For equity investments where BlackRock does not control the investee, and where it is not the PB of a VIE, but can exert significant influence over the financial and operating policies of the investee, the Company follows the equity method of accounting. The evaluation of whether the Company exerts control or significant influence over the financial and operational policies of its investees requires significant judgment based on the facts and circumstances surrounding each individual investment. Factors considered in these evaluations may include the type of investment, the legal structure of the investee, the 54 Table of Contents terms and structure of the investment agreement, including investor voting or other rights, the terms of BlackRock’s advisory agreement or other agreements with the investee, any influence BlackRock may have on the governing board of the investee, the legal rights of other investors in the entity pursuant to the fund’s operating documents and the relationship between BlackRock and other investors in the entity. BlackRock’s equity method investees that are investment companies record their underlying investments at fair value. Therefore, under the equity method of accounting, BlackRock’s share of the investee’s underlying net income predominantly represents fair value adjustments in the investments held by the equity method investees. BlackRock’s share of the investee’s underlying net income or loss is based upon the most currently available information and is recorded as nonoperating income (expense) for investments in investment companies, or as other revenue for certain strategic investments, which are recorded in other assets, since such investees are considered to be an extension of BlackRock’s core business. At December 31, 2013, the Company had $736 million and $163 million of equity method investments, including equity method investments held for deferred compensation, reflected within investments and other assets, respectively, and at December 31, 2012, the Company had $604 million and $124 million of equity method investees reflected in investments and other assets, respectively. Impairment of Investments. The Company’s management periodically assesses its equity method, available-for-sale, held-to-maturity and cost investments for impairment. If circumstances indicate that impairment may exist, investments are evaluated using market values, where available, or the expected future cash flows of the investment. If the undiscounted expected future cash flows are lower than the Company’s carrying value of the investment, an impairment charge is recorded in the consolidated statement of income. When the fair value of available-for-sale securities is lower than cost, the Company evaluates the security to determine whether the impairment is considered “other-than-temporary”. In making this determination for equity securities, the Company considers, among other factors, the length of time the security has been in a loss position, the extent to which the security’s market value is less than cost, the financial condition and near-term prospects of the security’s issuer and the Company’s ability and intent to hold the security for a length of time sufficient to allow for recovery of such unrealized losses. If the impairment is considered other-than-temporary, an impairment charge is recorded in nonoperating income (expense) on the consolidated statement of income. In making this determination for debt securities, the Company considers whether: (1) it has the intent to sell the security, (2) it is more likely than not that it will be required to sell the security before recovery or (3) it expects to recover the entire amortized cost basis of the security. If the Company does not intend to sell a security and it is not more likely than not that it will be required to sell the security, but the security has suffered a credit loss, the credit loss will be bifurcated from the total impairment and recorded in earnings with the remaining portion recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income. Evaluation of securities impairments involves significant assumptions and management judgments, which could differ from actual results, and these differences could have a material impact on the consolidated statements of income. Fair Value Measurements. Hierarchy of Fair Value Inputs. The provisions of ASC 820, Fair Value Measurement (“ASC 820”), establish a hierarchy that prioritizes inputs to valuation techniques used to measure fair value and require companies to disclose the fair value of their financial instruments according to the fair value hierarchy (i.e., Level 1, 2 and 3 inputs, as defined). The fair value hierarchy gives the highest priority to quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities and the lowest priority to unobservable inputs. See Note 2, Significant Accounting Policies, for further description of the Company’s assets and liabilities measured at fair value. Significance of Inputs. The Company’s assessment of the significance of a particular input to the fair value measurement in its entirety requires judgment and considers factors specific to the financial instrument. Valuation Techniques. The fair values of certain Level 3 assets and liabilities were determined using various methodologies as appropriate, including NAVs of underlying investments, third-party pricing vendors, broker quotes and market and income approaches. Such quotes and modeled prices are evaluated for reasonableness through various procedures, including due diligence reviews of third-party pricing vendors, variance analyses, consideration of the current market environment and other analytical procedures. BlackRock’s $574 million of Level 3 investments, or 27% of total GAAP investments at December 31, 2013, primarily included co-investments in private equity fund of funds and private equity funds, funds of hedge funds as well as alternative hedge funds that invest in distressed credit and mortgage securities and real estate equity products. As a practical expedient, the Company relies on NAV as the fair value for certain investments. The inputs to value these investments may include BlackRock capital accounts for its partnership interests in various alternative investments, including distressed credit hedge funds, real estate and private equity funds, which may be adjusted by using the returns of certain market indices. The various partnerships are investment companies, which record their underlying investments at fair value based on fair value policies established by management of the underlying fund. Fair value policies at the underlying fund generally require the fund to utilize pricing/valuation information from third-party sources, including independent appraisals. However, in some instances, current valuation information for illiquid securities or securities in markets that are not active may not be available from any third-party source or fund management may conclude that the valuations that are available from third-party sources are not reliable. In these instances, fund management may perform model-based analytical valuations that may be used as an input to value these investments. A significant amount of inputs used to value equity, debt securities and bank loans is sourced from well-recognized third-party pricing vendors. Generally, prices obtained from pricing vendors are categorized as Level 1 inputs for identical securities traded in active markets and as Level 2 55 Table of Contents for other similar securities if the vendor uses observable inputs in determining the price. Annually, BlackRock’s internal valuation committee or other designated groups review both the valuation methodologies, including the general assumptions and methods used to value various asset classes, and operational processes with these vendors. In addition, on a quarterly basis, meetings are held with key vendors to identify any significant changes to the vendors’ processes. In addition, quotes obtained from brokers generally are non-binding and categorized as Level 3 inputs. However, if the Company is able to determine that market participants have transacted for the asset in an orderly manner near the quoted price or if the Company can determine that the inputs used by the broker are observable, the quote is classified as a Level 2 input. Changes in Valuation. Changes in value on $1,622 million of investments will impact the Company’s nonoperating income (expense), $183 million will impact accumulated other comprehensive income, $243 million are held at cost or amortized cost and the remaining $103 million relates to carried interest, which will not impact nonoperating income (expense). At December 31, 2013, changes in fair value of approximately $785 million of such investments within consolidated sponsored investment funds will impact BlackRock’s net income (loss) attributable to noncontrolling interests expense on the consolidated statements of income. BlackRock’s net exposure to changes in fair value of such consolidated sponsored investment funds was $691 million. Goodwill and Intangible Assets The value of advisory contracts acquired in business acquisitions to manage AUM in proprietary open-end investment funds as well as collective trust funds without a specified termination date are classified as indefinite-lived intangible assets. The assignment of indefinite lives to such investment fund contracts is based upon the assumption that there is no foreseeable limit on the contract period to manage these funds due to the likelihood of continued renewal at little or no cost. In addition, trade names/trademarks are considered indefinite-lived intangibles as they are expected to generate cash flows indefinitely. Goodwill represents the cost of a business acquisition in excess of the fair value of the net assets acquired. In accordance with the applicable provisions of ASC 350, Intangibles – Goodwill and Other (“ASC 350”), indefinite-lived intangible assets and goodwill are not amortized. Finite-lived management contracts, which relate to acquired separate accounts and funds with a specified termination date, are amortized over their remaining expected useful lives, which, at December 31, 2013, ranged from 1 to 11 years with a weighted-average remaining estimated useful life of 4.3 years. Goodwill. The Company assesses its goodwill for impairment at least annually, considering such factors as the book value and the market capitalization of the Company. The impairment assessment performed as of July 31, 2013 indicated that no impairment charge was required. The Company continuously monitors its book value per share as compared with closing prices of its common stock for potential indicators of impairment. At December 31, 2013, the Company’s common stock closed at $316.47 which exceeded its book value per share of approximately $156.69 after excluding appropriated retained earnings. Indefinite-lived and finite-lived intangibles. The Company performs assessments to determine if any intangible assets are potentially impaired and whether the indefinite-life and finite-life classifications are still appropriate. In evaluating whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of indefinite-lived intangibles is less than its carrying value, BlackRock assesses various significant factors including AUM, revenue basis points, projected AUM growth rates, operating margins, tax rates and discount rates. In addition, the Company considers other factors including: (i) macroeconomic conditions such as a deterioration in general economic conditions, limitations on accessing capital, fluctuations in foreign exchange rates, or other developments in equity and credit markets; (ii) industry and market considerations such as a deterioration in the environment in which an entity operates, an increased competitive environment, a decline in market-dependent multiples or metrics, a change in the market for an entity’s services, or regulatory, legal or political developments; and (iii) entity-specific events, such as a change in management or key personnel, overall financial performance and litigation that could affect significant inputs. If potential impairment circumstances are considered to exist, the Company will perform an impairment test, using an undiscounted cash flow analysis. Actual results could differ from these cash flow estimates, which could materially impact the impairment conclusion. If the asset is determined to be impaired, the difference between the book value of the asset and its current fair value would be recognized as an expense in the period in which the impairment occurs. In addition, management judgment is required to estimate the period over which finite-lived intangible assets will contribute to the Company’s cash flows and the pattern in which these assets will be consumed. A change in the remaining useful life of any of these assets, or the reclassification of an indefinite-lived intangible asset to a finite-lived intangible asset, could have a significant impact on the Company’s amortization expense, which was $161 million, $157 million and $156 million for 2013, 2012 and 2011, respectively. In 2013, 2012 and 2011, the Company performed impairment tests, including evaluating various qualitative factors and performing certain quantitative assessments in 2013. The Company determined that no impairment charges were required, the classification of indefinite-lived versus finite-lived intangibles was still appropriate and no changes to the expected lives of the finite-lived intangibles were required. The Company continuously monitors various factors, including AUM, for potential indicators of impairment. Income Taxes. The Company accounts for income taxes under the asset and liability method prescribed by ASC 740, Income Taxes (“ASC 740”). Deferred income tax assets and liabilities are recognized for future tax consequences attributable to temporary differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases using currently enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to reverse. The effect of a change in tax rates on deferred tax assets and liabilities is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date. Significant management judgment is required in estimating the ranges of possible outcomes and determining the probability of favorable or unfavorable tax outcomes and potential interest and penalties related to such unfavorable 56 Table of Contents outcomes. Actual future tax consequences relating to uncertain tax positions may be materially different than the Company’s current estimates. At December 31, 2013, BlackRock had $467 million of gross unrecognized tax benefits, of which $304 million, if recognized, would affect the effective tax rate. In accordance with ASC 740, management is required to estimate the timing of the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities, make assumptions about the future deductibility of deferred income tax assets and assess deferred income tax liabilities based on enacted tax rates for the appropriate tax jurisdictions to determine the amount of such deferred income tax assets and liabilities. At December 31, 2013, the Company had deferred tax assets of $4 million and deferred tax liabilities of approximately $5,085 million on the consolidated statement of financial condition. Changes in the calculated deferred tax assets and liabilities may occur in certain circumstances, including statutory income tax rate changes, statutory tax law changes, changes in the anticipated timing of recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities or changes in the structure or tax status of the Company. ASC 740 requires the Company to assess whether a valuation allowance should be established against its deferred income tax assets based on consideration of all available evidence, both positive and negative, using a more likely than not standard. This assessment considers, among other matters, the nature, frequency and severity of recent losses, forecast of future profitability, the duration of statutory carry back and carry forward periods, the Company’s experience with tax attributes expiring unused, and tax planning alternatives. At December 31, 2013, the Company had recorded a deferred tax asset of $99 million for unrealized investment losses; however, no valuation allowance has been established because the Company expects to hold certain investments which invest in fixed income securities over a period sufficient for them to recover their unrealized losses, and generate future capital gains sufficient to offset the unrealized capital losses. Based on the weight of available evidence, it is more likely than not that the deferred tax asset will be realized. However, changes in circumstance could cause the Company to revalue its deferred tax balances with the resulting change impacting the consolidated statements of income in the period of the change. Such changes may be material to the Company’s consolidated financial statements. See Note 21, Income Taxes, to the consolidated financial statements beginning on page F-1 of this Form 10-K for further details. The Company records income taxes based upon its estimated income tax liability or benefit. The Company’s actual tax liability or benefit may differ from the estimated income tax liability or benefit. The Company had current income taxes receivables of approximately $89 million and current income taxes payables of $168 million at December 31, 2013. Revenue Recognition. Investment advisory and administration fees are recognized as the services are performed. Such fees are primarily based on pre-determined percentages of the market value of AUM or, in the case of certain real estate clients, net operating income generated by the underlying properties. Investment advisory and administration fees are affected by changes in AUM, including market appreciation or depreciation, foreign exchange translation and net subscriptions or redemptions. Investment advisory and administration fees for investment funds are shown net of fees waived pursuant to contractual expense limitations of the funds or voluntary waivers. The Company contracts with third parties and related parties for various fund distribution and shareholder servicing to be performed on behalf of certain funds the Company manages. Such arrangements generally are priced as a portion of the management fee paid by the fund. In certain cases, the fund takes on the primary responsibility for payment for services such that the Company bears no credit risk to the third party. The Company accounts for such retrocession arrangements in accordance with ASC 605-45, Revenue Recognition — Principle Agent Considerations (“ASC 605-45”), and records its management fees net of retrocessions. Retrocessions for 2013, 2012 and 2011 were $785 million, $793 million and $928 million, respectively. The Company has additional contracts for similar services with third parties, which due to the terms of the contracts, are recorded as distribution and servicing costs and thus not netted on the consolidated statements of income. The Company earns revenue by lending securities on behalf of clients to highly rated banks and broker-dealers. Such revenues are accounted for on an accrual basis. The securities loaned are secured by collateral, generally ranging from 102% to 112% of the value of the loaned securities. Generally, the revenue earned is shared between the Company and the funds or accounts managed by the Company from which the securities are borrowed. For 2013, 2012 and 2011, securities lending revenue totaled $447 million, $510 million and $397 million, respectively, and is recorded in investment advisory, administration fees and securities lending revenue on the consolidated statements of income. Investment advisory, administration fees and securities lending revenue are reported together as the fees for these services often are agreed upon with clients as a bundled fee. The Company receives investment advisory performance fees or incentive allocations, including carried interest allocations, from certain actively managed investment funds and certain SMAs. These performance fees are earned upon exceeding specified relative or absolute investment return thresholds. Such fees are recorded upon completion of the measurement period, which varies by product or account, and could be monthly, quarterly, annually or longer. For the years ended 2013, 2012 and 2011, performance fee revenue totaled $561 million, $463 million and $371 million, respectively. In addition, the Company receives carried interest from certain alternative investments upon exceeding performance thresholds. BlackRock may be required to return all, or part, of such carried interest depending upon future performance of these funds. Therefore, BlackRock records carried interest subject to such clawback provisions in investments or cash to the extent that it is distributed, on its consolidated statements of financial condition. Carried interest is realized and recorded as performance fee revenue upon the earlier of the termination of the investment fund or when the likelihood of clawback is mathematically improbable. The Company records a deferred carried interest liability to the extent it receives cash or capital allocations related to carried interest prior to meeting the revenue recognition criteria. At December 31, 2013 and 2012, the Company had $108 million and $97 million, respectively, of deferred carried interest recorded in other liabilities on the consolidated statements of financial condition. The ultimate recognition of performance fee revenue, if any, for these products is unknown. 57 Table of Contents Fees earned for BlackRock Solutions, which include advisory services, are recorded as services are performed or when completed and are determined using some, or all, of the following methods: (i) percentages of various attributes of advisory AUM or value of positions on the Aladdin platform, (ii) fixed fees and (iii) performance fees if contractual thresholds are met. Revenue earned on advisory assignments was comprised of one-time advisory and portfolio structuring fees and ongoing fees based on AUM of the respective portfolio assignment. For 2013, 2012 and 2011, BlackRock Solutions and advisory revenue totaled $577 million, $518 million and $510 million, respectively. Adjustments to revenue arising from initial estimates recorded historically have been immaterial since the majority of BlackRock’s investment advisory and administration revenue is calculated based on the fair value of AUM and since the Company does not record performance revenues until performance thresholds have been exceeded and the likelihood of clawback is mathematically improbable. RECENT DEVELOPMENTS Accounting Developments For accounting pronouncements that the Company adopted during 2013 and for recent accounting pronouncements not yet adopted, see Note 2, Significant Accounting Policies, in the consolidated financial statements. Item 7a. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk AUM Market Price Risk. BlackRock’s investment advisory and administration fees are primarily comprised of fees based on a percentage of the value of AUM and, in some cases, performance fees expressed as a percentage of the returns realized on AUM. At December 31, 2013, the majority of the Company’s investment advisory and administration fees were based on average or period end AUM of the applicable investment funds or separate accounts. Movements in equity market prices, interest rates/credit spreads, foreign exchange rates or all three could cause the value of AUM to decline, which would result in lower investment advisory and administration fees. Corporate Investments Portfolio Risks. As a leading investment management firm, BlackRock devotes significant resources across all of its operations to identifying, measuring, monitoring, managing and analyzing market and operating risks, including the management and oversight of its own investment portfolio. The Board of Directors of the Company has adopted guidelines for the review of investments to be made by the Company, requiring, among other things, that investments be reviewed by certain senior officers of the Company, and that certain investments may be referred to the Audit Committee or the Board of Directors, depending on the circumstances, for approval. In the normal course of its business, BlackRock is exposed to equity market price risk, interest rate/credit spread risk and foreign exchange rate risk associated with its corporate investments. BlackRock has investments primarily in sponsored investment products that invest in a variety of asset classes, including real estate, private equity and hedge funds. Investments generally are made for co-investment purposes, to establish a performance track record, to hedge exposure to certain deferred compensation plans or for regulatory purposes. Currently, the Company has a seed capital hedging program in which it enters into swaps to hedge market and interest rate exposure to certain investments. At December 31, 2013, the Company had outstanding total return swaps and interest rate swaps with an aggregate notional value of approximately $117 million and $71 million, respectively. At December 31, 2013, approximately $826 million of BlackRock’s total investments were maintained in sponsored investment funds deemed to be controlled by BlackRock in accordance with GAAP and, therefore, are consolidated even though BlackRock may not own a majority of such funds. Excluding the impact of the Federal Reserve Bank stock, carried interest, investments made to hedge exposure to certain deferred compensation plans and certain investments that are hedged via the seed capital hedging program, the Company’s economic exposure to its investment portfolio is $1,583 million. See Management’s Discussion and Analysis-Balance Sheet Overview-Investments for further information on the Company’s investments. The “economic” investment exposure of the portfolio is presented below: Equity Market Price Risk. At December 31, 2013, the Company’s net exposure to equity market price risk in its investment portfolio was approximately $828 million of the Company’s total economic investment exposure. Investments subject to market price risk include private equity and real estate investments, hedge funds and funds of funds as well as mutual funds. The Company estimates that a hypothetical 10% adverse change in market prices would result in a decrease of approximately $82.8 million in the carrying value of such investments. Interest Rate/Credit Spread Risk. At December 31, 2013, the Company was exposed to interest-rate risk and credit spread risk as a result of approximately $755 million of investments in debt securities and sponsored investment products that invest primarily in debt securities. Management considered a hypothetical 100 basis point fluctuation in interest rates or credit spreads and estimates that the impact of such a fluctuation on these investments, in the aggregate, would result in a decrease, or increase, of approximately $12.7 million in the carrying value of such investments. Foreign Exchange Rate Risk. As discussed above, the Company invests in sponsored investment products that invest in a variety of asset classes. The carrying value of the total economic investment exposure denominated in foreign currencies, primarily the pound sterling and euro, was $222 million at December 31, 2013. A 10% adverse change in the applicable foreign exchange rates would result in approximately a $22.2 million decline in the carrying value of such investments. Other Market Risks. The Company executes forward foreign currency exchange contracts to mitigate the risk of foreign exchange risk movements. At December 31, 2013, the Company had outstanding forward foreign currency exchange contracts with an aggregate notional value of approximately $792 million. 58 Table of Contents",2023-12-30 18:58:51.156171

In addition, unvested restricted stock units (“RSUs”) that contain nonforfeitable rights to dividends are not included for 2012 as they were deemed to be participating securities in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (“GAAP”). Upon vesting of the participating RSUs, the shares were added to the weighted-average shares outstanding that resulted in an increase to the percentage of net income attributable to common shares. The Company’s remaining participating securities vested in January 2013. (4) Total BlackRock stockholders’ equity, excluding an appropriated retained deficit of $19 million for 2014 and appropriated retained earnings of $22 million and $29 million for 2013 and 2012, respectively, divided by total common and preferred shares outstanding at December 31 of the respective year-end. 2014 COMPARED WITH 2013 GAAP. Operating income of $4,474 million increased $617 million from 2013, reflecting growth in base fees and BlackRock Solutions and advisory revenue, partially offset by higher expense. The Company’s 2014 expense reflected higher revenue-related expense, including compensation and direct fund expense. Expense for 2014 also included a $50 million reduction of an indemnification asset recorded in general and administration expense (offset by a $50 million tax benefit—see Income Tax Expense within Discussion of Financial Results for more information) and $11 million of closed-end fund launch costs. The 2013 expense included $124 million of expense related to the Charitable Contribution described below and $18 million of closed-end fund launch costs. Nonoperating income (expense), less net income (loss) attributable to NCI, decreased $146 million from 2013. The prior year included a $39 million noncash, nonoperating pre-tax gain related to the carrying value of the Company’s equity method investment as a result of an initial public offering of PennyMac Financial Services, Inc. (the “PennyMac IPO”). In addition, in 2013, the Company made a charitable contribution of approximately six million units of the Company’s investment in PennyMac to a donor advised fund (the “Charitable Contribution”). In connection with the Charitable Contribution, the Company also recorded a noncash, nonoperating pre-tax gain of $80 million related to the contributed investment. The decrease in nonoperating income (expense) also reflected net lower returns on the co-investment and seed portfolio and higher interest expense resulting from a long-term debt issuance in March 2014, partially offset by the positive impact of the monetization of a nonstrategic, opportunistic private equity investment during 2014. 29 Table of Contents Income tax expense of $1,131 million included $94 million of tax benefits, including the $50 million tax benefit mentioned above. Income tax expense for 2014 and 2013 reflected the revaluation of deferred income tax liabilities related to intangible assets and goodwill. Income tax expense for 2014 included a $9 million net noncash tax benefit arising primarily from state and local income tax changes and a $73 million net tax benefit related to several favorable nonrecurring items. Income tax expense for 2013 included a $69 million noncash tax benefit, primarily related to legislation enacted in the United Kingdom and state and local income tax changes. In addition, 2013 income tax expense included a tax benefit of approximately $48 million recognized in connection with the Charitable Contribution, a tax benefit of approximately $29 million, primarily due to the realization of tax loss carryforwards, and benefits from certain nonrecurring items. Earnings per diluted common share rose $2.38, or 14%, from 2013 due to higher net income and the benefit of share repurchases. As Adjusted. Operating income of $4,563 million and operating margin of 42.9% increased $539 million and 150 basis points, respectively, from 2013. The current year results excluded a $50 million general and administrative expense related to the reduction of an indemnification asset. The 2014 income tax expense included a $73 million net tax benefit and excluded a $50 million tax benefit associated with the reduction of the same indemnification asset and $9 million of net noncash benefits described above. The 2013 results excluded the financial impact of the Charitable Contribution, but included the $39 million pre-tax nonoperating gain related to the PennyMac IPO. The 2013 income tax expense included a tax benefit of approximately $29 million and benefits from certain nonrecurring items and excluded the $69 million net noncash benefit, described above. Earnings per diluted common share rose $2.76, or 17%, from 2013. 2013 COMPARED WITH 2012 GAAP. Operating income of $3,857 million increased $333 million from 2012, reflecting growth in base fees, strong performance fees and higher BlackRock Solutions and advisory revenue, partially offset by higher expenses, primarily due to the previously mentioned $124 million expense related to the Charitable Contribution and higher revenue-related expense. Operating income in 2012 included a $30 million charge related to a contribution to certain of the Company’s bank-managed short-term investment funds (“STIFs”). Nonoperating income (expense), less net income (loss) attributable to NCI, increased $133 million due to the $39 million pre-tax gain related to the PennyMac IPO and the $80 million related to the Charitable Contribution and higher net positive marks on investments during 2013 compared with 2012. Income tax expense included a $69 million net noncash benefit for 2013 and a $30 million net noncash benefit for 2012. The net noncash benefits for both periods primarily related to the revaluation of certain deferred income tax liabilities, including legislation enacted in the United Kingdom and domestic state and local income tax changes. In addition, 2013 income tax expense included a tax benefit of approximately $48 million recognized in connection with the Charitable Contribution, a tax benefit of approximately $29 million, primarily due to the realization of tax loss carryforwards and benefits from certain nonrecurring items. Earnings per diluted common share rose $3.08, or 22%, compared with 2012 due to higher net income and the benefit of share repurchases. As Adjusted. Operating income of $4,024 million and operating margin of 41.4% increased $450 million and 100 basis points, respectively, from 2012. The current year results included the previously mentioned $39 million pre-tax nonoperating gain related to the PennyMac IPO. Income tax expense included a tax benefit of approximately $29 million, primarily due to the realization of tax loss carryforwards, and benefits from certain nonrecurring items and excluded the $69 million net noncash benefit in 2013 and the $30 million net noncash benefit in 2012 described above. Earnings per diluted common share rose $2.90, or 21%, from 2012. The financial impact related to the Charitable Contribution has been excluded from as adjusted results for 2013. See Non-GAAP Financial Measures for further information on as adjusted items.

Assuming a stable market environment, BlackRock anticipates that organic growth, coupled with the benefits of scale, should result in increasing operating margins over time. 30 Table of Contents BlackRock believes that earnings growth and shareholder returns should also be positively impacted by the Company’s commitment to a consistent and predictable capital management strategy. NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES BlackRock reports its financial results in accordance with GAAP; however, management believes evaluating the Company’s ongoing operating results may be enhanced if investors have additional non-GAAP financial measures. Management reviews non-GAAP financial measures to assess ongoing operations and, for the reasons described below, considers them to be effective indicators, for both management and investors, of BlackRock’s financial performance over time. BlackRock’s management does not advocate that investors consider such non-GAAP financial measures in isolation from, or as a substitute for, financial information prepared in accordance with GAAP. Computations for all periods are derived from the consolidated statements of income as follows: (1) Operating income, as adjusted, and operating margin, as adjusted: Operating income, as adjusted, equals operating income, GAAP basis, excluding certain items management deems nonrecurring, recurring infrequently or transactions that ultimately will not impact BlackRock’s book value. Management believes operating income, as adjusted, and operating margin, as adjusted, are effective indicators of BlackRock’s financial performance over time and, therefore, provide useful disclosure to investors.

The portion of compensation expense associated with certain long-term incentive plans (“LTIP”) funded, or to be funded, through share distributions to participants of BlackRock stock held by PNC has been excluded because it ultimately does not impact BlackRock’s book value. In 2014, general and administration expense relating to the reduction of an indemnification asset has been excluded since it is directly offset by a tax benefit of the same amount and, consequently, does not impact BlackRock’s book value. In 2013, the $124 million expense related to the Charitable Contribution has been excluded from operating income, as adjusted, due to its nonrecurring nature and because the noncash, nonoperating pre-tax gain of $80 million directly related to the contributed PennyMac investment is reported in nonoperating income (expense). The U.K. lease exit amount in 2012 represents an adjustment related to the estimated lease exit costs initially recorded in 2011 and the contribution to STIFs represents a contribution to certain of the Company’s bank-managed STIFs. Both the U.K. lease exit amount and contribution to STIFs have been excluded from operating income, as adjusted due to their nonrecurring nature. Compensation expense associated with appreciation (depreciation) on investments related to certain BlackRock deferred compensation plans has been excluded as returns on investments set aside for these plans, which substantially offset this expense, are reported in nonoperating income (expense). Management believes operating income exclusive of these items is a useful measure in evaluating BlackRock’s operating performance and helps enhance the comparability of this information for the reporting periods presented. • Operating margin, as adjusted, allows BlackRock to compare performance from period to period by adjusting for items that may not recur, recur infrequently or may have an economic offset in nonoperating income (expense). BlackRock also uses operating margin, as adjusted, to monitor corporate performance and efficiency and as a benchmark to compare its performance with other companies. Management uses both GAAP and non-GAAP financial 31 Table of Contents measures in evaluating BlackRock’s financial performance. The non-GAAP measure by itself may pose limitations because it does not include all of BlackRock’s revenue and expense. Operating income used for measuring operating margin, as adjusted, is equal to operating income, as adjusted, excluding the impact of closed-end fund launch costs and related commissions. Management believes the exclusion of such costs and related commissions is useful because these costs can fluctuate considerably and revenue associated with the expenditure of these costs will not fully impact BlackRock’s results until future periods. Revenue used for operating margin, as adjusted, excludes distribution and servicing costs paid to related parties and other third parties. Management believes the exclusion of such costs is useful because it creates consistency in the treatment for certain contracts for similar services, which due to the terms of the contracts, are accounted for under GAAP on a net basis within investment advisory, administration fees and securities lending revenue. Amortization of deferred sales commissions is excluded from revenue used for operating margin measurement, as adjusted, because such costs, over time, substantially offset distribution fee revenue the Company earns. For each of these items, BlackRock excludes from revenue used for operating margin, as adjusted, the costs related to each of these items as a proxy for such offsetting revenue. (2) Nonoperating income (expense), less net income (loss) attributable to NCI, as adjusted, Nonoperating income (expense), less net income (loss) attributable to NCI, as adjusted, equals nonoperating income (expense), GAAP basis, less net income (loss) attributable to NCI, adjusted for compensation expense associated with (appreciation) depreciation on investments related to certain BlackRock deferred compensation plans. The compensation expense offset is recorded in operating income. This compensation expense has been included in nonoperating income (expense), less net income (loss) attributable to NCI, as adjusted, to offset returns on investments set aside for these plans, which are reported in nonoperating income (expense), GAAP basis. Management believes nonoperating income (expense), less net income (loss) attributable to NCI, as adjusted, provides comparability of information among reporting periods and is an effective measure for reviewing BlackRock’s nonoperating contribution to results. As compensation expense associated with (appreciation) depreciation on investments related to certain deferred compensation plans, which is included in operating income, substantially offsets the gain (loss) on the investments set aside for these plans, management believes nonoperating income (expense), less net income (loss) attributable to NCI, as adjusted, provides a useful measure, for both management and investors, of BlackRock’s nonoperating results that impact book value. During 2013, the noncash, nonoperating pre-tax gain of $80 million related to the contributed PennyMac investment has been excluded from nonoperating income (expense), less net income (loss) attributable to NCI, as adjusted due to its nonrecurring nature and because the more than offsetting associated Charitable Contribution expense of $124 million is reported in operating income.

Net income attributable to BlackRock, Inc., as adjusted, equals net income attributable to BlackRock, Inc., GAAP basis, adjusted for significant nonrecurring items, charges that ultimately will not impact BlackRock’s book value or certain tax items that do not impact cash flow.

Amounts for 2013 included a tax benefit of approximately $48 million recognized in connection with the Charitable Contribution. The tax benefit has been excluded from net income attributable to BlackRock, Inc., as adjusted due to the nonrecurring nature of the Charitable Contribution. Non-GAAP adjustments for 2014, 2013 and 2012 reflected the revaluation of deferred income tax liabilities related to intangible assets and/or goodwill. The amount for 2014 included a $9 million net noncash tax benefit arising primarily from state and local income tax changes. The amount for 2013 included a $69 million noncash tax benefit, primarily related to legislation enacted in the United Kingdom and state and local income tax changes. The amount for 2012 included a $50 million noncash tax benefit, primarily related to the effect of legislation enacted in the United Kingdom and the state and local income tax effect resulting from changes in the Company’s organizational structure. Such amounts for 2014, 2013 and 2012 have been excluded from as adjusted results as they will not have a cash flow impact and to ensure comparability among periods presented. (4) Amounts for 2012 exclude net income attributable to participating securities (see below). (5) Nonvoting participating preferred stock is considered to be a common stock equivalent for purposes of determining basic and diluted earnings per share calculations. Prior to 2013, certain unvested RSUs were not included in diluted weighted-average common shares outstanding as they were deemed participating securities. Average outstanding participating securities were 0.2 million in 2012. For further information, see Note 21, Earnings per Share, to the consolidated financial statements. Assets Under Management AUM for reporting purposes generally is based upon how investment advisory and administration fees are calculated for each portfolio.

The increase in AUM was driven by net market appreciation of $261.7 billion and net inflows of $193.8 billion, partially offset by foreign exchange movements. Net market appreciation of $261.7 billion included $140.8 billion of growth in equity products primarily due to higher U.S. equity markets, and appreciation of $98.8 billion and $21.0 billion in fixed income and multi-asset products, respectively, across the majority of strategies. AUM decreased $127.7 billion from foreign exchange movements, primarily resulting from the strengthening of the U.S. dollar against the euro, the British pound and the Japanese yen. 35 Table of Contents Component Changes in AUM for 2013 The following table presents the component changes in AUM by client type and product for 2013.

AUM increased $532.5 billion, or 14%, to $4.324 trillion at December 31, 2013 from $3.792 trillion at December 31, 2012. The increase in AUM was driven by net market appreciation of $398.7 billion, net inflows of $119.7 billion and acquired AUM related to the MGPA acquisition and the Credit Suisse ETF Transaction, partially offset by foreign exchange movements. Net market appreciation of $398.7 billion included $404.3 billion from equity products, primarily due to positive movements in U.S. and global equity markets. The $12.9 billion decrease in AUM from foreign exchange movements was due to the strengthening of the U.S. dollar, primarily against the Japanese yen and the Canadian dollar, partially offset by the weakening of the U.S. dollar against the British pound and the euro. DISCUSSION OF FINANCIAL RESULTS Introduction BlackRock derives a substantial portion of its revenue from investment advisory and administration fees, which are recognized as the services are performed. Such fees are primarily based on predetermined percentages of the market value of AUM or percentages of committed capital during investment periods of certain alternative products and are affected by changes in AUM, including market appreciation or depreciation, foreign exchange translation and net inflows or outflows. Net inflows or outflows represent the sum of new client assets, additional fundings from existing clients (including dividend reinvestment), withdrawals of assets from, and termination of, client accounts and distributions to investors representing return of capital and return on investments to investors. Market appreciation or depreciation includes current income earned on, and changes in the fair value of, securities held in client accounts. Foreign exchange translation reflects the impact of converting non-U.S. dollar denominated AUM into U.S. dollars for reporting purposes. BlackRock also earns revenue by lending securities on behalf of clients to highly rated banks and broker-dealers. The securities loaned are secured by collateral in the form of cash or securities, with minimum collateral generally ranging from approximately 102% to 112% of the value of the loaned securities. Generally, the revenue earned is shared between BlackRock and the funds or accounts managed by the Company from which the securities are borrowed. Historically, securities lending revenue in the second quarter exceeds the other quarters during the year driven by higher seasonal demand. Investment advisory agreements for certain separate accounts and investment funds provide for performance fees based upon relative and/or absolute investment performance, in addition to base fees based on AUM. Investment advisory performance fees generally are earned after a given period of time and when investment performance exceeds a contractual threshold. As such, the 37 Table of Contents timing of recognition of performance fees may increase the volatility of BlackRock’s revenue and earnings. The magnitude of performance fees can fluctuate quarterly due to the timing of carried interest recognition on alternative products; however the third and fourth quarters have a greater number of nonalternative products with performance measurement periods that end on either September 30 or December 31. BlackRock provides a variety of risk management, investment analytic and investment system and advisory services to financial institutions, pension funds, asset managers, foundations, consultants, mutual fund sponsors, real estate investment trusts and government agencies. These services are provided under the brand name BlackRock Solutions and include a wide array of risk management services, valuation services related to illiquid securities, disposition and workout assignments (including long-term portfolio liquidation assignments), strategic planning and execution, and enterprise investment system outsourcing to clients. The Company’s Aladdin® operating platform serves as the investment/risk solutions system for BlackRock and other institutional investors. Fees earned for BlackRock Solutions and advisory services are determined using some, or all, of the following methods: (i) percentages of various attributes of advisory AUM or value of positions on the Aladdin platform, (ii) fixed fees and (iii) performance fees if contractual thresholds are met. BlackRock builds upon its leadership position to meet the growing need for investment and risk management solutions. Through its scale and diversity of products, it is able to provide its clients with customized solutions including fiduciary outsourcing for liability-driven investments and overlay strategies for pension plan sponsors, balance sheet management and related services for insurance companies and target date and target return funds, as well as asset allocation portfolios, for retail investors. BlackRock is also able to service these clients via its Aladdin platform to provide risk management and other outsourcing services for institutional investors and custom and tailored solutions to address complex risk exposures. The Company earns fees for transition management services primarily comprised of commissions from acting as a broker-dealer in connection with buying and selling securities on behalf of its customers. Commissions related to transition management services are recorded on a trade-date basis as securities transactions occur. The Company also earns revenue related to certain strategic investments accounted for as equity method investments. Operating expense reflects employee compensation and benefits, distribution and servicing costs, amortization of deferred sales commissions, direct fund expense, general and administration expense and amortization of finite-lived intangible assets. • Employee compensation and benefits expense includes salaries, commissions, temporary help, deferred and incentive compensation, employer payroll taxes, severance and related benefit costs. • Distribution and servicing costs, which are primarily AUM driven, include payments made to Merrill Lynch-affiliated entities under a global distribution agreement, to PNC and Barclays, as well as other third parties, primarily associated with obtaining and retaining client investments in certain BlackRock products. • Direct fund expense primarily consist of third-party nonadvisory expense incurred by BlackRock related to certain funds for the use of index trademarks, reference data for indices, custodial services, fund administration, fund accounting, transfer agent services, shareholder reporting services, legal expense, audit and tax services as well as other fund-related expense directly attributable to the nonadvisory operations of the fund. These expenses may vary over time with fluctuations in AUM, number of shareholder accounts, or other attributes directly related to volume of business. • General and administration expense includes marketing and promotional, occupancy and office-related costs, portfolio services (including clearing expense related to transition management services), technology, professional services, communications, closed-end fund launch costs and other general and administration expense, including the impact of foreign currency remeasurement. Approximately 75% of the Company’s revenue is generated in U.S. dollars. The Company’s revenue and expense generated in foreign currencies (primarily the euro and British pound) are impacted by foreign exchange rates. Any effect of foreign exchange rate change on revenue is partially offset by a change in expense driven by the Company’s considerable non-dollar expense base related to its operations outside the United States. Nonoperating income (expense) includes the effect of changes in the valuations on investments (excluding available-for-sale investments) and earnings on equity method investments as well as interest and dividend income and interest expense. Other comprehensive income includes changes in valuations related to available-for-sale investments. BlackRock primarily holds seed and co-investments in sponsored investment products that invest in a variety of asset classes, including private equity, hedge funds and real estate. Investments generally are made for co-investment purposes, to establish a performance track record, to hedge exposure to certain deferred compensation plans or for regulatory purposes, including Federal Reserve Bank stock. BlackRock does not engage in proprietary trading activities that could conflict with the interests of its clients. In addition, nonoperating income (expense) includes the impact of changes in the valuations of consolidated sponsored investment funds and consolidated collateralized loan obligations (“CLOs”). The portion of nonoperating income (expense) not attributable to BlackRock is allocated to NCI on the consolidated statements of income. 38 Table of Contents Revenue The following table presents the Company’s revenue for 2014, 2013 and 2012.

Investment advisory, administration fees and securities lending revenue of $9,589 million for 2014 increased $850 million from $8,739 million in 2013 due to higher long-term average AUM, reflecting organic growth and market appreciation. Securities lending fees increased $30 million from 2013 to $477 million in 2014. BlackRock Solutions and advisory revenue in 2014 totaled $635 million compared with $577 million in 2013. The current year reflected higher revenue from Aladdin mandates and higher revenue from advisory assignments. BlackRock Solutions and advisory revenue included $474 million in Aladdin business revenue compared with $433 million in 2013. 2013 Compared with 2012 Revenue increased $843 million, or 9%, from 2012, reflecting growth in markets, long-term net inflows and strength in performance fees and BlackRock Solutions and advisory revenue. Investment advisory, administration fees and securities lending revenue of $8,739 million for 2013 increased $667 million from $8,072 million in 2012 due to growth in long-term average AUM. Securities lending fees decreased $63 million from 2012 to $447 million in 2013 driven by lower spreads consistent with industry trends, partially offset by an increase in average balances of securities on loan. Investment advisory performance fees were $561 million in 2013 compared with $463 million in 2012, primarily reflecting higher fees from alternative products, including fund of funds and single-strategy hedge funds. Both years reflected significant fees from the liquidation of opportunistic funds. BlackRock Solutions and advisory revenue in 2013 totaled $577 million compared with $518 million in 2012. The amount for 2013 reflected a $49 million increase in Aladdin business revenue to $433 million and higher advisory assignments revenue. Other revenue increased $17 million, largely reflecting higher transition management service fees and higher earnings from certain strategic investments. 40 Table of Contents Expense The following table presents the Company’s expenses for 2014, 2013 and 2012.

Expense increased $284 million, or 4%, from 2013, primarily reflecting higher revenue-related expenses, including compensation and direct fund expense and a $50 million reduction of an indemnification asset. Expense for 2013 included the $124 million expense related to the Charitable Contribution. Employee compensation and benefits expense increased $269 million, or 8%, to $3,829 million in 2014 from $3,560 million in 2013, reflecting higher headcount and higher incentive compensation driven by higher operating income. Employees at December 31, 2014 totaled approximately 12,200 compared with approximately 11,400 at December 31, 2013. Distribution and servicing costs totaled $364 million in 2014 compared with $353 million in 2013. These costs included payments to Bank of America/Merrill Lynch under a global distribution agreement and payments to PNC, as well as other third parties, primarily associated with the distribution and servicing of client investments in certain BlackRock products. Distribution and servicing costs for 2014 and 2013 included $183 million and $184 million, respectively, attributable to Bank of America/Merrill Lynch. Direct fund expense increased $91 million, reflecting higher average AUM, primarily related to iShares, where BlackRock pays certain nonadvisory expense of the funds. General and administration expense decreased $87 million, primarily due to the $124 million related to the Charitable 41 Table of Contents Contribution incurred in 2013 and foreign currency remeasurement, partially offset by the $50 million reduction of an indemnification asset. As Adjusted. Expense, as adjusted, increased $362 million, or 6%, to $6,518 million in 2014 from $6,156 million in 2013. The increase in total expense, as adjusted, is primarily attributable to higher employee compensation and benefits and direct fund expense. Amounts related to the reduction of the indemnification asset and the Charitable Contribution have been excluded from as adjusted results. 2013 Compared with 2012 GAAP. Expense increased $510 million, or 9%, from 2012, primarily reflecting higher revenue-related expense and the $124 million expense related to the Charitable Contribution. Employee compensation and benefits expense increased $273 million, or 8%, to $3,560 million in 2013 from $3,287 million in 2012, reflecting higher headcount and higher incentive compensation driven by higher operating income, including higher performance fees. Employees at December 31, 2013 totaled approximately 11,400 compared with approximately 10,500 at December 31, 2012. Distribution and servicing costs totaled $353 million in 2013 compared with $364 million in 2012. These costs included payments to Bank of America/Merrill Lynch under a global distribution agreement and payments to PNC, as well as other third parties, primarily associated with the distribution and servicing of client investments in certain BlackRock products. Distribution and servicing costs for 2013 and 2012 included $184 million and $195 million, respectively, attributable to Bank of America/Merrill Lynch. Direct fund expense increased $66 million, reflecting higher average AUM, primarily related to iShares, where BlackRock pays certain nonadvisory expense of the funds. General and administration expense increased $181 million, largely driven by the $124 million expense related to the Charitable Contribution, higher marketing and promotional costs and various lease exit costs. The full year 2012 included a one-time $30 million contribution to STIFs. As Adjusted. Expense, as adjusted, increased $393 million, or 7%, to $6,156 million in 2013 from $5,763 million in 2012. The increase in total expense, as adjusted, is primarily attributable to higher employee compensation and benefits, direct fund expense and general and administration expense.

(2) Amount included net gains (losses) related to equity and fixed income investments, and BlackRock’s seed capital hedging program. 2014 Compared with 2013 Net gains on investments of $154 million in 2014 decreased $132 million from 2013. Net gains on investments in 2013 included the noncash, nonoperating pre-tax gain of $80 million related to the Charitable Contribution and the $39 million pre-tax gain related to the PennyMac IPO. Net gains on investments in 2014 included the positive impact of the monetization of a nonstrategic, opportunistic private equity investment. Net interest expense increased $14 million from 2013 primarily due to higher interest expense resulting from a long-term debt issuance in March 2014. 2013 Compared with 2012 Net gains on investments of $286 million in 2013 increased $143 million from 2012 due to the $39 million pre-tax gain related to the PennyMac IPO and the $80 million pre-tax gain related to the Charitable Contribution and higher net positive marks. Net interest expense increased $10 million from 2012 primarily due to lower dividend income. For further information on the Company’s long-term debt, see Liquidity and Capital Resources herein. Income Tax Expense GAAP As adjusted (in millions) 2014 2013 2012 2014 2013 2012 Income before income taxes(1) $ 4,425 $ 3,954 $ 3,488 $ 4,507 $ 4,031 $ 3,532 Income tax expense $ 1,131 $ 1,022 $ 1,030 $ 1,197 $ 1,149 $ 1,094 Effective tax rate 25.6 % 25.8 % 29.5 % 26.6 % 28.5 % 31.0 % (1) Net of net income (loss) attributable to NCI. The Company’s tax rate is affected by tax rates in foreign jurisdictions and the relative amount of income earned in those jurisdictions, which the Company expects to be fairly consistent in the near term. The significant foreign jurisdictions, which have lower statutory tax rates than the U.S. federal statutory rate of 35%, include the United Kingdom, Luxembourg, Canada and the Netherlands. U.S. income taxes were not provided for certain undistributed foreign earnings intended to be indefinitely reinvested outside the United States. 2014. The GAAP effective tax rate of 25.6% for 2014 reflected the revaluation of deferred income tax liabilities related to intangible assets and goodwill. Income tax expense for 2014 included a $9 million net noncash benefit arising primarily from state and local income tax changes, which has been excluded from as adjusted results as it will not have a cash flow impact and to ensure comparability among periods presented. 43 Table of Contents In addition, 2014 included a $94 million tax benefit, primarily due to the resolution of certain outstanding tax matters related to the acquisition of BGI. In connection with the acquisition, BlackRock recorded a $50 million indemnification asset for unrecognized tax benefits. Due to the resolution of such tax matters in 2014, BlackRock recorded $50 million of general and administration expense to reflect the reduction of the indemnification asset and an offsetting $50 million tax benefit. The $50 million general and administrative expense and $50 million tax benefit have been excluded from as adjusted results as there is no impact on BlackRock’s book value. The current year also included a $73 million net tax benefit related to several favorable nonrecurring items. The as adjusted effective tax rate of 26.6% for 2014 included the tax benefit of approximately $73 million related to certain favorable nonrecurring items and excluded the $9 million net noncash benefit and $50 million tax benefit mentioned above. 2013. The GAAP effective tax rate of 25.8% for 2013 reflected a $69 million net noncash benefit primarily related to the revaluation of certain deferred income tax liabilities related to intangible assets and goodwill, including the effect of legislation enacted in the United Kingdom and domestic state and local income tax changes. In addition, 2013 included a tax benefit of approximately $48 million recognized in connection with the Charitable Contribution and a tax benefit of approximately $29 million, primarily due to the realization of tax loss carryforwards, and benefits from certain nonrecurring items. The as adjusted effective tax rate of 28.5% for 2013 reflected a tax benefit of approximately $29 million, primarily due to the realization of tax loss carryforwards, and benefits from certain nonrecurring items and excluded the $69 million net noncash benefit and the $48 million tax benefit related to the Charitable Contribution mentioned above. 2012. The GAAP effective tax rate of 29.5% for 2012 reflected a $21 million benefit related to the resolution of certain outstanding tax positions and a $50 million net noncash benefit related to the revaluation of certain deferred income tax liabilities, including the effect of tax legislation enacted in the United Kingdom and the state and local income tax effect resulting from changes in the Company’s organizational structure. The as adjusted effective tax rate of 31.0% for 2012 excluded the $50 million net noncash tax benefit mentioned above. BALANCE SHEET OVERVIEW As Adjusted Balance Sheet The following table presents a reconciliation of the consolidated statement of financial condition presented on a GAAP basis to the consolidated statement of financial condition, excluding the impact of separate account assets and separate account collateral held under securities lending agreements (directly related to lending separate account securities) and separate account liabilities and separate account collateral liabilities under securities lending agreements, consolidated VIEs and consolidated sponsored investment funds. The Company presents the as adjusted balance sheet as additional information to enable investors to exclude certain assets that have equal and offsetting liabilities or noncontrolling interests that ultimately do not have an impact on stockholders’ equity (excluding appropriated retained earnings related to consolidated collateralized loan obligations (“CLOs”)) or cash flows. Management views the as adjusted balance sheet, a non-GAAP financial measure, as an economic presentation of the Company’s total assets and liabilities; however, it does not advocate that investors consider such non-GAAP financial measures in isolation from, or as a substitute for, financial information prepared in accordance with GAAP. Separate Account Assets and Liabilities and Separate Account Collateral Held under Securities Lending Agreements Separate account assets are maintained by BlackRock Life Limited, a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company, which is a registered life insurance company in the United Kingdom, and represent segregated assets held for purposes of funding individual and group pension contracts. The Company records equal and offsetting separate account liabilities. The separate account assets are not available to creditors of the Company and the holders of the pension contracts have no recourse to the Company’s assets. The net investment income attributable to separate account assets accrues directly to the contract owners and is not reported on the Company’s consolidated statements of income. While BlackRock has no economic interest in these assets or liabilities, BlackRock earns an investment advisory fee for the service of managing these assets on behalf of the clients. In addition, the Company records on its consolidated statements of financial condition the separate account collateral received under BlackRock Life Limited securities lending arrangements as its own asset in addition to an equal and offsetting separate account collateral liability for the obligation to return the collateral. The collateral is not available to creditors of the Company, and the borrowers under the securities lending arrangements have no recourse to the Company’s assets. Consolidated VIEs At December 31, 2014, BlackRock’s consolidated VIEs included multiple CLOs and one private investment fund. The assets of these VIEs are not available to creditors of the Company and the Company has no obligation to settle the liabilities of the VIEs. While BlackRock has no material economic interest in these assets or liabilities, BlackRock earns an investment advisory fee, as well as a potential performance fee, for the service of managing these assets on behalf of clients. Consolidated Sponsored Investment Funds The Company consolidates certain sponsored investment funds primarily because it is deemed to control such funds. The Company may not be readily able to access cash and cash equivalents held by consolidated sponsored investment funds to use in its operating activities. In addition, the Company may not be readily able to sell investments held by consolidated sponsored investment funds in order to obtain cash for use in the Company’s operations. 44 Table of Contents December 31, 2014 Segregated client assets generating advisory fees in which BlackRock has no economic interest or liability (in millions) GAAPBasis Separate Account Assets/ Collateral Consolidated VIEs Consolidated Sponsored Investment Funds AsAdjusted Assets Cash and cash equivalents $ 5,723 $ — $ — $ 120 $ 5,603 Accounts receivable 2,120 — — — 2,120 Investments 1,921 — — 17 1,904 Assets of consolidated VIEs 3,630 — 3,630 — — Separate account assets and collateral held under securities lending agreements 194,941 194,941 — — — Other assets(1) 1,168 — — 20 1,148 Subtotal 209,503 194,941 3,630 157 10,775 Goodwill and intangible assets, net 30,305 — — — 30,305 Total assets $ 239,808 $ 194,941 $ 3,630 $ 157 $ 41,080 Liabilities Accrued compensation and benefits $ 1,865 $ — $ — $ — $ 1,865 Accounts payable and accrued liabilities 1,035 — — — 1,035 Liabilities of consolidated VIEs 3,634 — 3,634 — — Borrowings 4,938 — — — 4,938 Separate account liabilities and collateral liabilities under securities lending agreements 194,941 194,941 — — — Deferred income tax liabilities 4,989 — — — 4,989 Other liabilities 886 — — 18 868 Total liabilities 212,288 194,941 3,634 18 13,695 Equity Total stockholders’ equity(2) 27,366 — (19 ) — 27,385 Noncontrolling interests 154 — 15 139 — Total equity 27,520 — (4 ) 139 27,385 Total liabilities and equity $ 239,808 $ 194,941 $ 3,630 $ 157 $ 41,080 (1) Amounts include property and equipment and other assets. (2) GAAP amount includes $19 million of an appropriated retained deficit related solely to consolidated CLOs in which the Company has no equity exposure. The following discussion summarizes the significant changes in assets and liabilities on a GAAP basis. Please see the consolidated statements of financial condition as of December 31, 2014 and 2013 contained in Part II, Item 8 of this filing. The discussion does not include changes related to assets and liabilities that are equal and offsetting and have no impact on BlackRock’s stockholders’ equity. Assets. Cash and cash equivalents at December 31, 2014 and 2013 included $120 million and $114 million, respectively, of cash held by consolidated sponsored investment funds (see Liquidity and Capital Resources for details on the change in cash and cash equivalents during 2014). Accounts receivable at December 31, 2014 decreased $127 million from December 31, 2013 due to a decrease in unit trust receivables (substantially offset by an decrease in unit trust payables recorded within accounts payable and accrued liabilities) and lower performance fee receivables. Investments decreased $230 million from December 31, 2013 (for more information see Investments herein). Goodwill and intangible assets decreased $176 million from December 31, 2013, primarily due to $157 million of amortization of intangible assets. Other assets (including property, plant and equipment) decreased $49 million from December 31, 2013, primarily related to a decrease in property and equipment due to depreciation and the reduction of an indemnification asset, partially offset by higher earnings from certain strategic investments and an increase in current taxes receivable. Liabilities. Accrued compensation and benefits at December 31, 2014 increased $118 million from December 31, 2013, primarily due to 2014 incentive compensation accruals. Accounts payable and accrued liabilities at December 31, 2014 decreased $49 million from December 31, 2013 due to lower unit trust payables (substantially offset by an decrease in unit trust receivables recorded within accounts receivable) and a decrease in current income taxes payable, partially offset by increased accruals, including direct fund expense. Net deferred income tax liabilities at December 31, 2014 decreased $96 million, primarily due to the effects of temporary differences associated with stock compensation, investment income, and goodwill and intangibles. Other liabilities decreased $118 million from December 31, 2013, primarily resulting from a decrease in uncertain tax positions and a decrease in other operating liabilities. 45 Table of Contents Investments Investments totaled $1,921 million at December 31, 2014 and $2,151 million at December 31, 2013. Investments include consolidated investments held by sponsored investment funds deemed to be controlled by BlackRock. Management reviews BlackRock’s investments on an “economic” basis, which eliminates the portion of investments that does not impact BlackRock’s book value or net income attributable to BlackRock. BlackRock’s management does not advocate that investors consider such non-GAAP financial measures in isolation from, or as a substitute for, financial information prepared in accordance with GAAP. The Company presents total investments, as adjusted, to enable investors to understand the portion of its investments that is owned by the Company, net of NCI, as a gauge to measure the impact of changes in net nonoperating gain (loss) on investments to net income (loss) attributable to BlackRock. The Company further presents net “economic” investment exposure, net of deferred compensation investments and hedged investments, to reflect another gauge for investors as the economic impact of investments held pursuant to deferred compensation arrangements is substantially offset by a change in compensation expense and the impact of hedged investments is substantially mitigated by swap hedges. Carried interest capital allocations are excluded as there is no impact to BlackRock’s stockholders’ equity until such amounts are realized as performance fees. Finally, the Company’s regulatory investment in Federal Reserve Bank stock, which is not subject to market or interest rate risk, is excluded from the Company’s net economic investment exposure.

The following table represents the carrying value of the Company’s economic investment exposure, by asset type, at December 31, 2014 and 2013: (in millions) December 31,2014 December 31,2013 Private equity $ 314 $ 328 Real estate 117 125 Distressed credit/mortgage funds/opportunistic funds 61 148 Hedge funds/funds of hedge funds 228 348 Other investments(1) 599 634 Total “economic” investment exposure $ 1,319 $ 1,583 (1) Other investments primarily include seed investments in fixed income and equity funds/strategies as well as U.K. government securities held for regulatory purposes.

Certain equity method investees do not account for both their financial assets and financial liabilities under fair value measures, therefore, the Company’s investment in such equity method investees may not represent fair value. (2) Amounts include cash and cash equivalents, other assets and liabilities that are consolidated from non-VIE sponsored investment funds. See Note 5, Fair Value Disclosures, to the consolidated financial statements contained in Part II, Item 8 of this filing, for total GAAP investments. LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES BlackRock Cash Flows Excluding the Impact of Consolidated Sponsored Investment Funds and VIEs BlackRock consolidates certain of its sponsored investment funds and CLOs, notwithstanding the fact BlackRock may only have a minority interest, if any, in these funds or CLOs. As a result, the consolidated statements of cash flows include the cash flows of consolidated sponsored investment funds and CLOs. The Company uses an adjusted cash flow statement, which excludes the impact of consolidated sponsored investment funds and CLOs, as a supplemental non-GAAP measure to assess liquidity and capital requirements. The Company believes that its cash flows, excluding the impact of the consolidated sponsored investment funds and CLOs, provide investors with useful information on the cash flows of BlackRock relating to its ability to fund additional operating, investing and financing activities. BlackRock’s management does not advocate that investors consider such non-GAAP measures in isolation from, or as a substitute for, its cash flows presented in accordance with GAAP. The following table presents a reconciliation of the consolidated statements of cash flows presented on a GAAP basis to the consolidated statements of cash flows, excluding the impact of the cash flows of consolidated sponsored investment funds and consolidated VIEs: (in millions) GAAPBasis Impact onCash Flowsof ConsolidatedSponsoredInvestmentFunds Impact onCash FlowsofConsolidatedVIEs Cash FlowsExcludingImpact ofConsolidatedSponsoredInvestmentFunds and VIEs Cash and cash equivalents, December 31, 2012 $ 4,606 $ 133 $ — $ 4,473 Cash flows from operating activities 3,642 (137 ) 286 3,493 Cash flows from investing activities (483 ) 39 — (522 ) Cash flows from financing activities (3,392 ) 79 (286 ) (3,185 ) Effect of exchange rate changes on cash and cash equivalents 17 — — 17 Net change in cash and cash equivalents (216 ) (19 ) — (197 ) Cash and cash equivalents, December 31, 2013 $ 4,390 $ 114 $ — $ 4,276 Cash flows from operating activities 3,081 (103 ) (431 ) 3,615 Cash flows from investing activities 239 (174 ) — 413 Cash flows from financing activities (1,855 ) 283 431 (2,569) Effect of exchange rate changes on cash and cash equivalents (132 ) — — (132 ) Net change in cash and cash equivalents 1,333 6 — 1,327 Cash and cash equivalents, December 31, 2014 $ 5,723 $ 120 $ — $ 5,603 Sources of BlackRock’s operating cash primarily include investment advisory, administration fees and securities lending revenue, performance fees, revenue from BlackRock Solutions and advisory products and services, other revenue and distribution fees. BlackRock uses its cash to pay all operating expenses, interest and principal on borrowings, income taxes, dividends on BlackRock’s capital stock, repurchases of the Company’s stock, capital expenditures and purchases of co-investments and seed investments. Cash flows from operating activities, excluding the impact of consolidated sponsored investment funds and VIEs, primarily include the receipt of investment advisory and administration fees, securities lending revenue and other revenue offset by the payment of operating expenses incurred in the normal course of business, including year-end incentive compensation accrued for in the prior year. Cash inflows from investing activities, excluding the impact of consolidated sponsored investment funds and VIEs, for 2014 were $413 million and primarily reflected $739 million 47 Table of Contents of net proceeds from sales and maturities of certain investments and $143 million of distributions of capital from equity method investees, partially offset by $403 million of investment purchases. Cash outflows from financing activities, excluding the impact of consolidated sponsored investment funds and VIEs, for 2014 were $2.6 billion, primarily resulting from cash outflows related to $1,344 million of share repurchases, including $1.0 billion in open market transactions and $344 million of employee tax withholdings related to employee stock transactions, $1.3 billion of cash dividend payments and $1.0 billion of repayments of long-term borrowings. Cash outflows from financing activities were partially offset by $1.0 billion of proceeds from issuance of long-term borrowings and $106 million of excess tax benefits from vested stock-based compensation awards. The Company manages its financial condition and funding to maintain appropriate liquidity for the business. Liquidity resources at December 31, 2014 and 2013 were as follows: (in millions) December 31,2014 December 31,2013 Cash and cash equivalents $ 5,723 $ 4,390 Cash and cash equivalents held by consolidated sponsored investment funds(1) (120 ) (114 ) Subtotal 5,603 4,276 Credit facility — undrawn 3,990 3,990 Total liquidity $ 9,593 $ 8,266 (1) The Company may not be able to access such cash to use in its operating activities. Total liquidity increased $1,327 million during 2014, primarily reflecting cash from operations, partially offset by cash payments of 2013 year-end incentive awards, share repurchases of $1.3 billion and cash dividend payments. A significant portion of the Company’s $1,904 million of total investments, as adjusted, is illiquid in nature and, as such, may not be readily convertible to cash. Share Repurchases. The Company repurchased 3.2 million common shares in open market-transactions under its share repurchase program for $1.0 billion during 2014. At December 31, 2014, there were 3.4 million shares still authorized to be repurchased. In January 2015, the Board of Directors approved an increase in the availability of shares that may be repurchased under the Company’s existing share repurchase program to allow for the repurchase of up to a total of 9.4 million additional shares of BlackRock common stock. Net Capital Requirements. The Company is required to maintain net capital in certain regulated subsidiaries within a number of jurisdictions, which is partially maintained by retaining cash and cash equivalent investments in those subsidiaries or jurisdictions. As a result, such subsidiaries of the Company may be restricted in their ability to transfer cash between different jurisdictions and to their parents. Additionally, transfers of cash between international jurisdictions, including repatriation to the United States, may have adverse tax consequences that could discourage such transfers. BlackRock Institutional Trust Company, N.A. (“BTC”) is chartered as a national bank that does not accept client deposits and whose powers are limited to trust activities. BTC provides investment management services, including investment advisory and securities lending agency services, to institutional investors and other clients. BTC is subject to regulatory capital and liquid asset requirements administered by the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency. At both December 31, 2014 and 2013, the Company was required to maintain approximately $1.1 billion in net capital in certain regulated subsidiaries, including BTC, entities regulated by the Financial Conduct Authority and Prudential Regulation Authority in the United Kingdom and the Company’s broker-dealers. At such date, the Company was in compliance with all applicable regulatory net capital requirements. Undistributed Earnings of Foreign Subsidiaries. As of December 31, 2014, the Company has not provided for U.S. federal and state income taxes on approximately $3.9 billion of undistributed earnings of its foreign subsidiaries. Such earnings are considered indefinitely reinvested outside the United States. The Company’s current plans do not demonstrate a need to repatriate these funds. Short-Term Borrowings 2014 Revolving Credit Facility. In March 2011, the Company entered into a five-year $3.5 billion unsecured revolving credit facility which was amended in 2013 and 2012. In March 2014, the Company’s credit facility was further amended to extend the maturity date to March 2019. The amount of the aggregate commitment is $3.990 billion (the “2014 credit facility”). The 2014 credit facility permits the Company to request up to an additional $1.0 billion of borrowing capacity, subject to lender credit approval, increasing the overall size of the 2014 credit facility to an aggregate principal amount not to exceed $4.990 billion. Interest on borrowings outstanding accrues at a rate based on the applicable London Interbank Offered Rate plus a spread. The 2014 credit facility requires the Company not to exceed a maximum leverage ratio (ratio of net debt to earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, where net debt equals total debt less unrestricted cash) of 3 to 1, which was satisfied with a ratio of less than 1 to 1 at December 31, 2014. The 2014 credit facility provides back-up liquidity, funds ongoing working capital for general corporate purposes and funds various investment opportunities. At December 31, 2014, the Company had no amount outstanding under the 2014 credit facility. Commercial Paper Program. On October 14, 2009, BlackRock established a commercial paper program (the “CP Program”) under which the Company could issue unsecured commercial paper notes (the “CP Notes”) on a private placement basis up to a maximum aggregate amount outstanding at any time of $3.0 billion. BlackRock increased the maximum aggregate amount that could be borrowed under the CP Program to $3.5 billion in 2011 and to $3.785 billion in 2012. In April 2013, BlackRock increased the maximum aggregate amount for which the Company could issue unsecured CP Notes on a private-placement basis up to a maximum aggregate amount outstanding at any time of $3.990 billion. The CP Program is currently supported by the 2014 credit facility. At December 31, 2014, BlackRock had no CP Notes outstanding. 48 Table of Contents Long-term Borrowings. The carrying value of long-term borrowings at December 31, 2014 included the following: (in millions) Maturity Amount Carrying Value Maturity 1.375% Notes $ 750 $ 750 June 2015 6.25% Notes 700 699 September 2017 5.00% Notes 1,000 998 December 2019 4.25% Notes 750 747 May 2021 3.375% Notes 750 747 June 2022 3.50% Notes 1,000 997 March 2024 Total Long-term Borrowings $ 4,950 $ 4,938 In March 2014, the Company issued $1.0 billion in aggregate principal amount of 3.50% senior unsecured and unsubordinated notes maturing in March 2024.

Contractual Obligations, Commitments and Contingencies The following table sets forth contractual obligations, commitments and contingencies by year of payment at December 31, 2014: (in millions) 2015 2016 2017 2018 2019 Thereafter Total Contractual obligations and commitments: Long-term borrowings(1): Principal $ 750 $ — $ 700 $ — $ 1,000 $ 2,500 $ 4,950 Interest 191 186 186 142 142 269 1,116 Operating leases 126 111 112 111 105 613 1,178 Purchase obligations 168 68 11 1 — — 248 Investment commitments 161 — — — — — 161 Total contractual obligations and commitments 1,396 365 1,009 254 1,247 3,382 7,653 Contingent obligations: Contingent distribution obligations 189 189 — — — — 378 Contingent payments related to business acquisitions(2) 5 10 7 19 9 11 61 Total contractual obligations, commitments and contingent obligations(3) $ 1,590 $ 564 $ 1,016 $ 273 $ 1,256 $ 3,393 $ 8,092 (1) Long-term borrowings exclude the borrowings of consolidated CLOs. The Company has no obligation to settle the liabilities of these CLOs. (2) The amount of contingent payments reflected for any year represents the expected payment amounts, using foreign currency exchange rates as of December 31, 2014, under the terms of the business acquisition’s agreement. The remaining maximum potential payment amount related to Credit Suisse ETF Transaction is approximately $24 million for any year during the next six years. There is no maximum amount for payments related to the MGPA Transaction. The fair value of the contingent obligations is not significant to the consolidated statement of financial condition and is recorded within other liabilities. (3) At December 31, 2014, the Company had $334 million of net unrecognized tax benefits. Due to the uncertainty of timing and amounts that will ultimately be paid, this amount has been excluded from the table above. Operating Leases. The Company leases its primary office locations under agreements that expire on varying dates through 2035. In connection with certain lease agreements, the Company is responsible for escalation payments. The contractual obligations table above includes only guaranteed minimum lease payments for such leases and does not project potential escalation or other lease-related payments. These leases are classified as operating leases and, as such, are not recorded as liabilities on the consolidated statements of financial condition. Purchase Obligations. In the ordinary course of business, BlackRock enters into contracts or purchase obligations with third parties whereby the third parties provide services to or on behalf of BlackRock. Purchase obligations included in the contractual obligations table above represent executory contracts, which are either noncancelable or cancelable with a penalty. At December 31, 2014, the Company’s obligations primarily reflected standard service contracts for portfolio, market data, office-related services and third-party marketing and promotional services, and obligations for equipment. Purchase obligations are recorded on the Company’s financial statements when services are provided and, as such, obligations for services not received are not included in the consolidated statement of financial condition at December 31, 2014. Investment Commitments. At December 31, 2014, the Company had $161 million of various capital commitments to fund sponsored investment funds, including funds of private equity funds, real estate funds, infrastructure funds, opportunistic funds and distressed credit funds. This amount excludes additional commitments made by consolidated funds of funds to underlying third-party funds as third-party noncontrolling interest holders have the legal obligation to fund the respective commitments of such funds of funds. In addition to the capital commitments of $161 million, the 49 Table of Contents Company had approximately $35 million of contingent commitments for certain funds which have investment periods that have expired. Generally, the timing of the funding of these commitments is unknown and the commitments are callable on demand at any time prior to the expiration of the commitment. These unfunded commitments are not recorded on the consolidated statements of financial condition. These commitments do not include potential future commitments approved by the Company that are not yet legally binding. The Company intends to make additional capital commitments from time to time to fund additional investment products for, and with, its clients. Contingent Distribution Obligations. In November 2010, BlackRock entered into a second amended and restated global distribution agreement with Merrill Lynch, which requires the Company to make payments to Merrill Lynch contingent upon sales of products and level of AUM maintained in certain BlackRock products. The initial term of the agreement remained in effect until January 2014 and was renewed for one automatic three-year extension. Contingent Payments Related to Business Acquisitions. In connection with the Credit Suisse ETF Transaction, BlackRock is required to make contingent payments annually to Credit Suisse, subject to achieving specified thresholds during a seven-year period, subsequent to the 2013 acquisition date. In addition, BlackRock is required to make contingent payments related to the MGPA Transaction during a five-year period, subject to achieving specified thresholds, subsequent to the 2013 acquisition date. The fair value of the remaining contingent payments at December 31, 2014 is not significant to the consolidated statement of financial condition and is included in other liabilities. The following items have not been included in the contractual obligations, commitments and contingencies table: Carried Interest Clawback. As a general partner in certain investment funds, including private equity partnerships and certain hedge funds, the Company may receive carried interest cash distributions from the partnerships in accordance with distribution provisions of the partnership agreements. The Company may, from time to time, be required to return all or a portion of such distributions to the limited partners in the event the limited partners do not achieve a return as specified in the various partnership agreements. Therefore, BlackRock records carried interest subject to such clawback provisions in investments, or cash to the extent that it is distributed, and as a deferred carried interest liability on its consolidated statements of financial condition. Carried interest is realized and recorded as performance fees on BlackRock’s consolidated statements of income upon the earlier of the termination of the investment fund or when the likelihood of clawback is considered mathematically improbable. Indemnifications. In the ordinary course of business or in connection with certain acquisition agreements, BlackRock enters into contracts pursuant to which it may agree to indemnify third parties in certain circumstances. The terms of these indemnities vary from contract to contract and the amount of indemnification liability, if any, cannot be determined or the likelihood of any liability is considered remote and, therefore, has not been included in the table above or recorded in the consolidated statement of financial condition at December 31, 2014. See further discussion in Note 13, Commitments and Contingencies, to the consolidated financial statements beginning on page F-1 of this Form 10-K. On behalf of certain clients, the Company lends securities to highly rated banks and broker-dealers. In these securities lending transactions, the borrower is required to provide and maintain collateral at or above regulatory minimums. Securities on loan are marked to market daily to determine if the borrower is required to pledge additional collateral. BlackRock has issued certain indemnifications to certain securities lending clients against potential losses resulting from a borrower’s failure to fulfill its obligations should the value of the collateral pledged by the borrower at the time of default be insufficient to cover the borrower’s obligations under the securities lending agreement. At December 31, 2014, the Company indemnified certain of its clients for their securities lending loan balances of approximately $145.7 billion. The Company held, as agent, cash and securities totaling $155.8 billion as collateral for indemnified securities on loan at December 31, 2014. The fair value of these indemnifications was not material at December 31, 2014. While the collateral pledged by a borrower is intended to be sufficient to offset the borrower’s obligations to return securities borrowed and any other amounts owing to the lender under the relevant securities lending agreement, in the event of a borrower default, the Company can give no assurance that the collateral pledged by the borrower will be sufficient to fulfill such obligations. If the amount of such pledged collateral is not sufficient to fulfill such obligations to a client for whom the Company has provided indemnification, BlackRock would be responsible for the amount of the shortfall. These indemnifications cover only the collateral shortfall described above, and do not in any way guarantee, assume or otherwise insure the investment performance or return of any cash collateral vehicle into which securities lending cash collateral is invested. Compensation and Benefit Obligations. The Company has various compensation and benefit obligations, including bonuses, commissions and incentive payments payable, defined contribution plan matching contribution obligations, and deferred compensation arrangements, that are excluded from the contractual obligations and commitments table above. Accrued compensation and benefits at December 31, 2014 totaled $1,865 million and included incentive compensation of $1,418 million, deferred compensation of $204 million and other compensation and benefits related obligations of $243 million. Substantially all of the incentive compensation liability was paid in the first quarter of 2015, while the deferred compensation obligations are generally payable over periods up to five years. Critical Accounting Policies The preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expense during the reporting periods. Actual results could differ significantly from those estimates. Management considers the following critical accounting policies important to understanding the consolidated financial statements. For a summary of these and additional accounting policies see Note 2, Significant Accounting Policies, in the consolidated financial statements beginning on page F-1 of this Form 10-K. 50 Table of Contents Consolidation of Sponsored Investment Funds and Securitization Products. The accounting method used by the Company to record its investments depends upon the influence the Company has over the given investee, the sponsored investment funds and securitization products (collectively “investment products”). To the extent that BlackRock has a controlling financial interest in the investment product, which generally exists if there is a 50% or greater voting interest or if partners or members of the investment products do not have substantive rights, BlackRock consolidates the investment product. For certain investment products in which a controlling financial interest is not directly linked to voting interests, an analysis is performed to determine if the investment product is a VIE or a voting rights entity. Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities. Certain investment products for which a controlling financial interest is not directly linked to voting interests may be deemed VIEs. BlackRock reviews factors, including the rights of the equity holders and obligations of equity holders to absorb losses or receive expected residual returns, to determine if the investment product is a VIE. BlackRock continuously evaluates such factors as facts and circumstances change to determine if the initial VIE status determination must be reconsidered. BlackRock is required to consolidate a VIE when it is deemed to be the primary beneficiary (“PB”). Significant judgment is required in the determination of whether the Company is the PB of a VIE. If the Company is determined to be the PB of a VIE, BlackRock will consolidate the entity. In order to determine whether the Company is the PB of a VIE, management must make significant estimates and assumptions of projected future cash flows. Assumptions made in such analyses may include, but are not limited to, market prices of securities, market interest rates, potential credit defaults on individual securities or default rates on a portfolio of securities, prepayments, realization of gains, liquidity or marketability of certain securities, discount rates and the probability of certain other outcomes. In the normal course of business, the Company is the manager of various types of sponsored investment vehicles, including collateralized debt obligations (“CDOs”) or CLOs and sponsored investment funds, which may be considered VIEs. At December 31, 2014, the Company’s consolidated VIEs consisted primarily of CLOs. CLOs. At December 31, 2014, BlackRock was the manager of over 20 CLOs/CDOs and other securitization entities. BlackRock was determined to be the PB for certain of these CLOs, which required BlackRock to consolidate these VIEs. BlackRock was deemed to be the PB because it has the power to direct the activities of the CLOs that most significantly impact the entities’ economic performance and has the right to receive benefits that potentially could be significant to the VIE. At December 31, 2014, the Company had $3,615 million and $3,634 million in assets and liabilities, respectively, on its consolidated statement of financial condition related to these consolidated CLOs. The Company recorded appropriated retained earnings for the difference between the assets and liabilities of the CLOs recorded on the consolidated statement of financial condition as the CLO noteholders ultimately will receive the benefits or absorb the losses associated with the CLOs’ assets and liabilities. Changes in the fair value of the assets and liabilities of these CLOs have no impact on net income attributable to BlackRock or its cash flows. Excluding outstanding management fee receivables, the Company has no risk of loss related to its involvement with these VIEs. Consolidation of Voting Rights Entities. To the extent that BlackRock can exert control over the financial and operating policies of the investee, which generally exists if there is a 50% or greater voting interest or if partners or members of certain products do not have substantive rights, BlackRock consolidates the investee. The Company, as general partner or managing member of certain sponsored investment funds, generally is presumed to control funds that are limited partnerships or limited liability companies. Pursuant to Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”) 810-20, Control of Partnerships and Similar Entities (“ASC 810-20”), the Company reviews such investment vehicles to determine if such a presumption can be overcome by determining whether other nonaffiliated partners or members of the limited partnership or limited liability company have the substantive ability to dissolve (liquidate) the investment vehicle, or otherwise to remove BlackRock as the general partner or managing member without cause based on a simple unaffiliated majority vote, or have other substantive participating rights. If the investment vehicle is not a VIE and the presumption of control is not overcome, BlackRock will consolidate the investment vehicle. See Note 4, Consolidated Sponsored Investment Funds, in the notes to the consolidated financial statements beginning on page F-1 of this Form 10-K for amounts included on the Company’s consolidated financial statements deemed to be voting rights entities. Investments Equity Method Investments. For equity investments where BlackRock does not control the investee, and where it is not the PB of a VIE, but can exert significant influence over the financial and operating policies of the investee, the Company follows the equity method of accounting. The evaluation of whether the Company exerts control or significant influence over the financial and operational policies of its investees requires significant judgment based on the facts and circumstances surrounding each individual investment. Factors considered in these evaluations may include the type of investment, the legal structure of the investee, the terms and structure of the investment agreement, including investor voting or other rights, the terms of BlackRock’s advisory agreement or other agreements with the investee, any influence BlackRock may have on the governing board of the investee, the legal rights of other investors in the entity pursuant to the fund’s operating documents and the relationship between BlackRock and other investors in the entity. BlackRock’s equity method investees that are investment companies record their underlying investments at fair value. Therefore, under the equity method of accounting, BlackRock’s share of the investee’s underlying net income predominantly represents fair value adjustments in the investments held by the equity method investees. BlackRock’s share of the investee’s underlying net income or loss is based upon the most currently available information and is recorded as nonoperating income (expense) for investments in investment companies, or as other revenue for certain strategic investments, which are recorded in other assets, since such investees are considered to be an extension of BlackRock’s core business. 51 Table of Contents At December 31, 2014, the Company had $654 million and $208 million of equity method investments, including equity method investments held for deferred compensation, reflected within investments and other assets, respectively, and at December 31, 2013, the Company had $736 million and $163 million of equity method investees reflected in investments and other assets, respectively. Impairment of Investments. Management periodically assesses equity method, available-for-sale, held-to-maturity and cost investments for impairment. If circumstances indicate that impairment may exist, investments are evaluated using market values, where available, or the expected future cash flows of the investment. If the undiscounted expected future cash flows are lower than the Company’s carrying value of the investment, and the impairment is considered other-than-temporary, an impairment charge is recorded in the consolidated statement of income. When the fair value of available-for-sale securities is lower than cost, the Company evaluates the security to determine whether the impairment is considered “other-than-temporary”. In making this determination for equity securities, the Company considers, among other factors, the length of time the security has been in a loss position, the extent to which the security’s market value is less than cost, the financial condition and near-term prospects of the security’s issuer and the Company’s ability and intent to hold the security for a length of time sufficient to allow for recovery of such unrealized losses. If the impairment is considered other-than-temporary, an impairment charge is recorded in nonoperating income (expense) on the consolidated statement of income. In making this determination for debt securities, the Company considers whether: (1) it has the intent to sell the security; (2) it is more likely than not that it will be required to sell the security before recovery; or (3) it expects to recover the entire amortized cost basis of the security. If the Company does not intend to sell a security and it is not more likely than not that it will be required to sell the security, but the security has suffered a credit loss, the credit loss will be bifurcated from the total impairment and recorded in earnings with the remaining portion recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income. Evaluation of impairments involves significant assumptions and management judgments, which could differ from actual results, and these differences could have a material impact on the consolidated statements of income. Fair Value Measurements. The Company’s assessment of the significance of a particular input to the fair value measurement according to the fair value hierarchy (i.e., Level 1, 2 and 3 inputs, as defined) in its entirety requires judgment and considers factors specific to the financial instrument. See Note 2, Significant Accounting Policies, in the consolidated financial statements beginning on page F-1 of this Form 10-K for more information on fair value measurements. Level 3 inputs include the most currently available information, including capital account balances for its partnership interests in various alternative investments, which may be adjusted by using the returns of certain market indices. Certain investments that are valued using net asset values and are subject to current redemption restrictions that will not be lifted in the near term are included in Level 3. BlackRock’s $528 million of Level 3 investments, or 27% of total GAAP investments at December 31, 2014, primarily included co-investments in private equity funds of funds and private equity funds, funds of hedge funds as well as alternative hedge funds that invest in distressed credit, opportunistic funds and mortgage securities and real estate equity products. Many of these investees are investment companies, which record their underlying investments at fair value based on fair value policies established by management of the underlying fund, which could include BlackRock employees. Fair value policies at the underlying fund generally require the fund to utilize pricing/valuation information, including independent appraisals from third-party sources. However, in some instances current valuation information, for illiquid securities or securities in markets that are not active, may not be available from any third-party source or fund management may conclude that the valuations that are available from third-party sources are not reliable. In these instances, fund management may perform model-based analytical valuations to value these investments. Changes in Valuation. Changes in value on $1,460 million of investments will impact the Company’s nonoperating income (expense), $201 million will impact accumulated other comprehensive income, $175 million are held at cost or amortized cost and the remaining $85 million relates to carried interest, which will not impact nonoperating income (expense). At December 31, 2014, changes in fair value of approximately $713 million of such investments within consolidated sponsored investment funds will impact BlackRock’s net income (loss) attributable to noncontrolling interests on the consolidated statements of income. BlackRock’s net exposure to changes in fair value of such consolidated sponsored investment funds was $696 million. Goodwill and Intangible Assets The value of advisory contracts acquired in business acquisitions to manage AUM in proprietary open-end investment funds as well as collective trust funds without a specified termination date are classified as indefinite-lived intangible assets. The assignment of indefinite lives to such investment fund contracts is based upon the assumption there is no foreseeable limit on the contract period to manage these funds due to the likelihood of continued renewal at little or no cost. In addition, trade names/trademarks are considered indefinite-lived intangibles as they are expected to generate cash flows indefinitely. Goodwill represents the cost of a business acquisition in excess of the fair value of the net assets acquired. In accordance with the applicable provisions of ASC 350, Intangibles – Goodwill and Other (“ASC 350”), indefinite-lived intangible assets and goodwill are not amortized. Finite-lived management contracts, which relate to acquired separate accounts and funds with a specified termination date, are amortized over their remaining expected useful lives, which, at December 31, 2014, ranged from 1 to 10 years with a weighted-average remaining estimated useful life of 3.8 years. Goodwill. The Company assesses its goodwill for impairment at least annually, considering such factors as the book value and the market capitalization of the Company. The impairment assessment performed as of July 31, 2014 indicated no impairment charge was required. The Company continues to monitor its book value per share compared with closing prices of its common stock for potential indicators of impairment. At December 31, 2014, the Company’s common 52 Table of Contents stock closed at $357.56 which exceeded its book value, after excluding appropriated retained earnings, of approximately $164.06 per share. Indefinite-lived and finite-lived intangibles. The Company performs assessments to determine if any intangible assets are impaired and whether the indefinite-life and finite-life classifications are still appropriate. In evaluating whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of indefinite-lived intangibles is less than carrying value, BlackRock performed certain quantitative assessments and assessed various significant qualitative factors including AUM, revenue basis points, projected AUM growth rates, operating margins, tax rates and discount rates. In addition, the Company considered other factors including: (i) macroeconomic conditions such as a deterioration in general economic conditions, limitations on accessing capital, fluctuations in foreign exchange rates, or other developments in equity and credit markets; (ii) industry and market considerations such as a deterioration in the environment in which an entity operates, an increased competitive environment, a decline in market-dependent multiples or metrics, a change in the market for an entity’s services, or regulatory, legal or political developments; and (iii) entity-specific events, such as a change in management or key personnel, overall financial performance and litigation that could affect significant inputs. If potential impairment circumstances are considered to exist, the Company will perform an impairment test, using an undiscounted cash flow analysis. Actual results could differ from these cash flow estimates, which could materially impact the impairment conclusion. If the asset is determined to be impaired, the difference between the book value of the asset and its current fair value would be recognized as an expense in the period in which the impairment occurs. In addition, management judgment is required to estimate the period over which finite-lived intangible assets will contribute to the Company’s cash flows and the pattern in which these assets will be consumed. A change in the remaining useful life of any of these assets, or the reclassification of an indefinite-lived intangible asset to a finite-lived intangible asset, could have a significant impact on the Company’s amortization expense, which was $157 million, $161 million and $157 million for 2014, 2013 and 2012, respectively. In 2014, 2013 and 2012, the Company performed impairment tests, including evaluating various qualitative factors and performing certain quantitative assessments in 2014 and 2013. The Company determined that no impairment charges were required, the classification of indefinite-lived versus finite-lived intangibles was still appropriate and no changes to the expected lives of the finite-lived intangibles were required. The Company continuously monitors various factors, including AUM, for potential indicators of impairment. Income Taxes. Deferred income tax assets and liabilities are recognized for future tax consequences attributable to temporary differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases using currently enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to reverse. The effect of a change in tax rates on deferred tax assets and liabilities is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date. Significant management judgment is required in estimating the ranges of possible outcomes and determining the probability of favorable or unfavorable tax outcomes and potential interest and penalties related to such unfavorable outcomes. Actual future tax consequences relating to uncertain tax positions may be materially different than the Company’s current estimates. At December 31, 2014, BlackRock had $379 million of gross unrecognized tax benefits, of which $283 million, if recognized, would affect the effective tax rate. Management is required to estimate the timing of the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities, make assumptions about the future deductibility of deferred income tax assets and assess deferred income tax liabilities based on enacted tax rates for the appropriate tax jurisdictions to determine the amount of such deferred income tax assets and liabilities. At December 31, 2014, the Company had deferred tax assets of $10 million and net deferred tax liabilities of approximately $4,989 million on the consolidated statement of financial condition. Changes in deferred tax assets and liabilities may occur in certain circumstances, including statutory income tax rate changes, statutory tax law changes, changes in the anticipated timing of recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities or changes in the structure or tax status of the Company. Company assesses whether a valuation allowance should be established against its deferred income tax assets based on consideration of all available evidence, both positive and negative, using a more likely than not standard. The assessment considers, among other matters, the nature, frequency and severity of recent losses, forecast of future profitability, the duration of statutory carry back and carry forward periods, the Company’s experience with tax attributes expiring unused, and tax planning alternatives. At December 31, 2014, the Company had recorded a deferred tax asset of $157 million for unrealized investment losses; however, no valuation allowance has been established because the Company expects to hold certain investments which invest in fixed income securities over a period sufficient for them to recover their unrealized losses, and generate future capital gains sufficient to offset the unrealized capital losses. Based on the weight of available evidence, it is more likely than not that the deferred tax asset will be realized. However, changes in circumstance could cause the Company to revalue its deferred tax balances with the resulting change impacting the consolidated statements of income in the period of the change. Such changes may be material to the Company’s consolidated financial statements. See Note 20, Income Taxes, to the consolidated financial statements beginning on page F-1 of this Form 10-K for further details. The Company records income taxes based upon its estimated income tax liability or benefit. The Company’s actual tax liability or benefit may differ from the estimated income tax liability or benefit. The Company had current income taxes receivables of approximately $117 million and current income taxes payables of $125 million at December 31, 2014. Revenue Recognition. Investment advisory and administration fees are recognized as the services are performed. Such fees are primarily based on pre-determined percentages of the market value of AUM or, in the case of certain real estate clients, net operating income generated by the underlying properties. Investment advisory and administration fees are affected by changes in AUM, including market appreciation or depreciation, foreign exchange translation and net inflows or outflows. 53 Table of Contents Investment advisory and administration fees for investment funds are shown net of fees waived pursuant to contractual expense limitations of the funds or voluntary waivers. The Company contracts with third parties and related parties for various fund distribution and shareholder servicing to be performed on behalf of certain funds the Company manages. Such arrangements generally are priced as a portion of the management fee paid by the fund. In certain cases, the fund takes on the primary responsibility for payment for services such that the Company bears no credit risk to the third party. The Company accounts for such retrocession arrangements in accordance with ASC 605-45, Revenue Recognition — Principal Agent Considerations (“ASC 605-45”), and records its management fees net of retrocessions. Retrocessions for 2014, 2013 and 2012 were $891 million, $785 million and $793 million, respectively. The Company has additional contracts for similar services with third parties, which due to the terms of the contracts, are recorded as distribution and servicing costs and thus not netted on the consolidated statements of income. The Company earns revenue by lending securities on behalf of clients to highly rated banks and broker-dealers. Revenue is accounted for on an accrual basis. The securities loaned are secured by collateral, generally ranging from 102% to 112% of the value of the loaned securities. Generally, the revenue earned is shared between the Company and the funds or accounts managed by the Company from which the securities are borrowed. For 2014, 2013 and 2012, securities lending revenue totaled $477 million, $447 million and $510 million, respectively, and is recorded in investment advisory, administration fees and securities lending revenue on the consolidated statements of income. Investment advisory, administration fees and securities lending revenue are reported together as the fees for these services often are agreed upon with clients as a bundled fee. The Company receives investment advisory performance fees or incentive allocations, from certain actively managed investment funds and certain SMAs. These performance fees are dependent upon exceeding specified relative or absolute investment return thresholds. Such fees are recorded upon completion of the measurement period, which varies by product or account, and could be monthly, quarterly, annually or longer. In addition, the Company receives carried interest from certain alternative investment products upon exceeding performance thresholds. BlackRock may be required to return all, or part, of such carried interest depending upon future performance of these funds. Therefore, BlackRock records carried interest subject to such clawback provisions in investments or cash to the extent that it is distributed, on its consolidated statements of financial condition. Carried interest is recorded as performance fee revenue upon the earlier of the termination of the investment fund or when the likelihood of clawback is considered mathematically improbable. The Company records a deferred carried interest liability to the extent it receives cash or capital allocations related to carried interest prior to meeting the revenue recognition criteria. At December 31, 2014 and 2013, the Company had $105 million and $108 million, respectively, of deferred carried interest recorded in other liabilities on the consolidated statements of financial condition. The ultimate recognition of performance fee revenue, if any, for these products is unknown. For the years ended 2014, 2013 and 2012, performance fee revenue totaled $550 million, $561 million and $463 million, respectively. Fees earned for BlackRock Solutions, which include advisory services, are recorded as services are performed or when completed and are determined using some, or all, of the following methods: (i) percentages of various attributes of advisory AUM or value of positions on the Aladdin platform, (ii) fixed fees and (iii) performance fees if contractual thresholds are met. Revenue earned on advisory assignments was comprised of one-time advisory and portfolio structuring fees and ongoing fees based on AUM of the respective portfolio assignment. For 2014, 2013 and 2012, BlackRock Solutions and advisory revenue totaled $635 million, $577 million and $518 million, respectively. Adjustments to revenue arising from initial estimates recorded historically have been immaterial since the majority of BlackRock’s investment advisory and administration revenue is calculated based on AUM and since the Company does not record performance revenues until performance thresholds have been exceeded and the likelihood of clawback is mathematically improbable. RECENT DEVELOPMENTS Accounting Developments For accounting pronouncements that the Company adopted during 2014 and for recent accounting pronouncements not yet adopted, see Note 2, Significant Accounting Policies, in the consolidated financial statements beginning on page F-1 of this Form 10-K. Item 7a. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk AUM Market Price Risk. BlackRock’s investment advisory and administration fees are primarily comprised of fees based on a percentage of the value of AUM and, in some cases, performance fees expressed as a percentage of the returns realized on AUM. At December 31, 2014, the majority of the Company’s investment advisory and administration fees were based on average or period end AUM of the applicable investment funds or separate accounts. Movements in equity market prices, interest rates/credit spreads, foreign exchange rates or all three could cause the value of AUM to decline, which would result in lower investment advisory and administration fees. Corporate Investments Portfolio Risks. As a leading investment management firm, BlackRock devotes significant resources across all of its operations to identifying, measuring, monitoring, managing and analyzing market and operating risks, including the management and oversight of its own investment portfolio. The Board of Directors of the Company has adopted guidelines for the review of investments to be made by the Company, requiring, among other things, that investments be reviewed by certain senior officers of the Company, and that certain investments may be referred to the Audit Committee or the Board of Directors, depending on the circumstances, for approval. 54 Table of Contents In the normal course of its business, BlackRock is exposed to equity market price risk, interest rate/credit spread risk and foreign exchange rate risk associated with its corporate investments. BlackRock has investments primarily in sponsored investment products that invest in a variety of asset classes, including real estate, private equity and hedge funds. Investments generally are made for co-investment purposes, to establish a performance track record, to hedge exposure to certain deferred compensation plans or for regulatory purposes. Currently, the Company has a seed capital hedging program in which it enters into swaps to hedge market and interest rate exposure to certain investments. At December 31, 2014, the Company had outstanding total return swaps and interest rate swaps with an aggregate notional value of approximately $238 million and $84 million, respectively. At December 31, 2014, approximately $713 million of BlackRock’s total investments were maintained in sponsored investment funds deemed to be controlled by BlackRock in accordance with GAAP and, therefore, are consolidated even though BlackRock may not own a majority of such funds. Excluding the impact of the Federal Reserve Bank stock, carried interest, investments made to hedge exposure to certain deferred compensation plans and certain investments that are hedged via the seed capital hedging program, the Company’s economic exposure to its investment portfolio is $1,319 million. See Balance Sheet Overview-Investments in Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations for further information on the Company’s investments. Equity Market Price Risk. At December 31, 2014, the Company’s net exposure to equity market price risk in its investment portfolio was approximately $807 million of the Company’s total economic investment exposure. Investments subject to market price risk include private equity and real estate investments, hedge funds and funds of funds as well as mutual funds. The Company estimates that a hypothetical 10% adverse change in market prices would result in a decrease of approximately $80.7 million in the carrying value of such investments. Interest Rate/Credit Spread Risk. At December 31, 2014, the Company was exposed to interest-rate risk and credit spread risk as a result of approximately $512 million of investments in debt securities and sponsored investment products that invest primarily in debt securities. Management considered a hypothetical 100 basis point fluctuation in interest rates or credit spreads and estimates that the impact of such a fluctuation on these investments, in the aggregate, would result in a decrease, or increase, of approximately $4.8 million in the carrying value of such investments. Foreign Exchange Rate Risk. As discussed above, the Company invests in sponsored investment products that invest in a variety of asset classes. The carrying value of the total economic investment exposure denominated in foreign currencies, primarily the pound sterling and euro, was $139 million at December 31, 2014. A 10% adverse change in the applicable foreign exchange rates would result in approximately a $13.9 million decline in the carrying value of such investments. Other Market Risks. The Company executes forward foreign currency exchange contracts to mitigate the risk of certain foreign exchange risk movements. At December 31, 2014, the Company had outstanding forward foreign currency exchange contracts with an aggregate notional value of approximately $201 million.",2023-12-30 18:58:39.228042

(2) As adjusted items are described in more detail in Non-GAAP Financial Measures. (3) Nonvoting participating preferred shares are considered to be common stock equivalents for purposes of determining basic and diluted earnings per share calculations. (4) Total BlackRock stockholders’ equity, excluding an appropriated retained deficit of $19 million for 2014 and appropriated retained earnings of $22 million for 2013, divided by total common and preferred shares outstanding at December 31 of the respective year-end. 2015 Compared with 2014 GAAP. Operating income of $4,664 million increased $190 million and operating margin of 40.9% increased 50 bps from 2014. Operating income reflected growth in base fees and performance fees, partially offset by higher expense. The Company’s 2015 expense reflected higher revenue-related expense, including compensation, and distribution and servicing costs, partially offset by lower general and administration expense and lower amortization of intangible assets. In connection with the Barclays Global Investors (“BGI”) acquisition, BlackRock recorded a $50 million indemnification asset for unrecognized tax benefits. Due to the resolution of outstanding tax matters in 2014, BlackRock recorded $50 million of general and administration expense in 2014 to reflect the reduction of the indemnification asset and an offsetting $50 million tax benefit. Results for 2014 also included $11 million of closed-end fund launch costs. Nonoperating income (expense), less net income (loss) attributable to NCI, decreased $20 million from 2014 due to lower net gains on investments in 2015. Income tax expense for 2015 included a $54 million net noncash benefit associated with the revaluation of certain deferred income tax liabilities, including the effect of tax legislation enacted in the United Kingdom and state and local income tax changes and benefited from $75 million of nonrecurring items. Income tax expense for 2014 included $94 million of tax benefits, including the $50 million tax benefit mentioned above, a $9 million net noncash benefit, primarily associated with the revaluation of certain deferred income tax liabilities as a result of domestic state and local tax changes, and a $73 million net tax benefit related to several favorable nonrecurring items. Diluted earnings per common share rose $0.54, or 3%, compared with the prior year period, reflecting higher operating income and the benefit of share repurchases, partially offset by the impact of a higher 2015 effective tax rate and lower nonoperating income. As Adjusted. Operating income of $4,695 million increased $132 million from 2014 and the operating margin for both 2015 and 2014 was 42.9%. Income tax expense on an as adjusted basis for 2015 included a $75 million net benefit and excluded the net noncash benefit of $54 million described above. General and administration expense for 2014 excluded the $50 million related to the reduction of the indemnification asset described above. Income tax expense for 2014 included a $73 million net benefit and excluded a $50 million tax benefit associated with the reduction of the same indemnification asset and $9 million of net noncash benefits described above. Diluted earnings per common share rose $0.26, or 1%, from 2014. 2014 Compared with 2013 GAAP. Operating income of $4,474 million increased $617 million from 2013, reflecting growth in base fees and BlackRock Solutions and advisory revenue, partially offset by higher expense. The Company’s 2014 expense reflected higher revenue-related expense, including compensation and direct fund expense. Expense for 2014 also included the previously mentioned $50 million general and administration expense related to the reduction of an indemnification asset and $11 million of closed-end fund launch costs. The 2013 expense included $124 million of expense related to the Charitable Contribution described below and $18 million of closed-end fund launch costs. 31 Nonoperating income (expense), less net income (loss) attributable to NCI, decreased $146 million from 2013. Expense for 2013 included a $39 million noncash, nonoperating pre-tax gain related to the carrying value of the Company’s equity method investment as a result of an initial public offering of PennyMac Financial Services, Inc. (the “PennyMac IPO”). In addition, in 2013, the Company made a charitable contribution of approximately six million units of the Company’s investment in PennyMac to a donor advised fund (the “Charitable Contribution”). In connection with the Charitable Contribution, the Company also recorded a noncash, nonoperating pre-tax gain of $80 million related to the contributed investment. The decrease in nonoperating income (expense) also reflected net lower returns on the co-investment and seed portfolio and higher interest expense resulting from a long-term debt issuance in March 2014, partially offset by the positive impact of the monetization of a nonstrategic, opportunistic private equity investment during 2014. Income tax expense of $1,131 million included $94 million of tax benefits, including the $50 million tax benefit mentioned above. Income tax expense for 2014 and 2013 reflected the revaluation of deferred income tax liabilities related to intangible assets and goodwill. Income tax expense for 2014 included a $9 million net noncash benefit arising primarily from state and local income tax changes and a $73 million net benefit related to several favorable nonrecurring items. Income tax expense for 2013 included a $69 million noncash benefit, primarily related to legislation enacted in the United Kingdom and state and local income tax changes. In addition, 2013 income tax expense included a benefit of approximately $48 million recognized in connection with the Charitable Contribution, a benefit of approximately $29 million, primarily due to the realization of tax loss carryforwards, and benefits from certain nonrecurring items. Diluted earnings per common share rose $2.38, or 14%, from 2013 due to higher net income and the benefit of share repurchases. As Adjusted. Operating income of $4,563 million and operating margin of 42.9% increased $539 million and 150 basis points, respectively, from 2013. Results for 2014 excluded a $50 million general and administrative expense related to the reduction of an indemnification asset. The 2014 income tax expense included a $73 million net benefit and excluded a $50 million tax benefit associated with the reduction of the same indemnification asset and $9 million of net noncash benefits described above. The 2013 results excluded the financial impact of the Charitable Contribution, but included the $39 million pre-tax nonoperating gain related to the PennyMac IPO. The 2013 income tax expense included a benefit of approximately $29 million and benefits from certain nonrecurring items and excluded the $69 million net noncash benefit, described above. Diluted earnings per common share rose $2.76, or 17%, from 2013. See Non-GAAP Financial Measures for further information on as adjusted items. For further discussion of BlackRock’s revenue, expense, nonoperating results and income tax expense, see Discussion of Financial Results herein. Business Outlook BlackRock's framework for long-term value creation is predicated on generating differentiated organic growth, leveraging scale to increase operating margins over time, and returning capital to shareholders on a consistent basis. BlackRock's diversified platform, in terms of style, product, client and geography, enables it to generate more stable cash flows through market cycles, positioning BlackRock to invest for the long-term by striking an appropriate balance between investing for future growth and practical discretionary expense management. BlackRock’s highly diversified multi-product platform was created to meet the needs of its clients in all market environments. BlackRock is positioned to provide active and index investment solutions across asset classes and geographies and leverage BlackRock Solutions’ world-class risk management, analytics and advisory capabilities on behalf of clients. BlackRock serves a diverse mix of institutional and retail clients across the globe, including investors in iShares ETFs, maintaining differentiated client relationships and a fiduciary focus. BlackRock’s Retail strategy is focused on an outcome-oriented approach to creating client solutions, including active, index and alternative products, and enhanced distribution. In the United States, BlackRock is leveraging its integrated wholesaler force to further penetrate wirehouse distribution platforms and gain share among registered investment advisors. Internationally, BlackRock continues to diversify the range of investment solutions available to clients, penetrate new distribution channels and capitalize on regulatory change impacting retrocession arrangements. iShares growth strategy is centered on increasing global iShares market share and driving global market expansion. BlackRock intends to achieve these goals by pursuing global growth themes in client and product segments including core investments, fixed income, financial instruments and precision exposures. BlackRock believes Institutional results will be driven by strength in specialty areas, including Defined Contribution, Financial Institutions, Official Institutions and Foundations, Family Offices and Endowments; deepening client relationships through effective cross-selling efforts; enhancing BlackRock’s solutions-oriented approach and leveraging BlackRock Solutions’ analytical and risk management expertise. Non-GAAP Financial Measures BlackRock reports its financial results in accordance with GAAP; however, management believes evaluating the Company’s ongoing operating results may be enhanced if investors have additional non-GAAP financial measures. Management reviews non-GAAP financial measures to assess ongoing operations and, for the reasons described below, considers them to be effective indicators, for both management and investors, of BlackRock’s financial performance over time. Management also uses non-GAAP financial measures as a benchmark to compare its performance with other companies and to enhance the comparability of this information for the reporting periods presented. Non-GAAP measures may pose limitations because they do not include all of BlackRock’s revenue and expense. BlackRock’s management does not advocate that investors consider such non-GAAP financial measures in isolation from, or as a substitute for, financial information prepared in accordance with GAAP. Management uses both GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures in evaluating BlackRock’s financial performance. Adjustments to GAAP financial measures (“non-GAAP adjustments”) include certain items management deems nonrecurring or occur infrequently, transactions that ultimately will not impact BlackRock’s book value or certain tax items that do not impact cash flow. 32 Computations for all periods are derived from the consolidated statements of income as follows: (1) Operating income, as adjusted, and operating margin, as adjusted: Management believes operating income, as adjusted, and operating margin, as adjusted, are effective indicators of BlackRock’s financial performance over time and, therefore, provide useful disclosure to investors. (in millions) 2015 2014 2013 Operating income, GAAP basis $ 4,664 $ 4,474 $ 3,857 Non-GAAP expense adjustments: PNC LTIP funding obligation 30 32 33 Compensation expense related to appreciation (depreciation) on deferred compensation plans 1 7 10 Reduction of indemnification asset — 50 — Charitable Contribution — — 124 Operating income, as adjusted 4,695 4,563 4,024 Product launch costs and commissions 5 11 18 Operating income used for operating margin measurement $ 4,700 $ 4,574 $ 4,042 Revenue, GAAP basis $ 11,401 $ 11,081 $ 10,180 Non-GAAP adjustments: Distribution and servicing costs (409 ) (364 ) (353 ) Amortization of deferred sales commissions (48 ) (56 ) (52 ) Revenue used for operating margin measurement $ 10,944 $ 10,661 $ 9,775 Operating margin, GAAP basis 40.9 % 40.4 % 37.9 % Operating margin, as adjusted 42.9 % 42.9 % 41.4 % • Operating income, as adjusted, includes non-GAAP expense adjustments. The portion of compensation expense associated with certain long-term incentive plans (“LTIP”) funded, or to be funded, through share distributions to participants of BlackRock stock held by PNC has been excluded because it ultimately does not impact BlackRock’s book value. Compensation expense associated with appreciation (depreciation) on investments related to certain BlackRock deferred compensation plans has been excluded as returns on investments set aside for these plans, which substantially offset this expense, are reported in nonoperating income (expense). In 2014, general and administration expense relating to the reduction of an indemnification asset has been excluded since it is directly offset by a tax benefit of the same amount and, consequently, does not impact BlackRock’s book value. In 2013, the $124 million expense related to the Charitable Contribution was excluded from operating income, as adjusted, due to its nonrecurring nature and because the noncash, nonoperating pre-tax gain of $80 million directly related to the contributed PennyMac investment is reported in nonoperating income (expense). • Operating income used for measuring operating margin, as adjusted, is equal to operating income, as adjusted, excluding the impact of product launch costs (e.g. closed-end fund launch costs) and related commissions. Management believes the exclusion of such costs and related commissions is useful because these costs can fluctuate considerably and revenue associated with the expenditure of these costs will not fully impact BlackRock’s results until future periods. Revenue used for operating margin, as adjusted, excludes distribution and servicing costs paid to related parties and other third parties. Management believes the exclusion of such costs is useful because it creates consistency in the treatment for certain contracts for similar services, which due to the terms of the contracts, are accounted for under GAAP on a net basis within investment advisory, administration fees and securities lending revenue. Amortization of deferred sales commissions is excluded from revenue used for operating margin measurement, as adjusted, because such costs, over time, substantially offset distribution fee revenue the Company earns. For each of these items, BlackRock excludes from revenue used for operating margin, as adjusted, the costs related to each of these items as a proxy for such offsetting revenue. (2) Nonoperating income (expense), less net income (loss) attributable to NCI, as adjusted: Nonoperating income (expense), less net income (loss) attributable to NCI, as adjusted, equals nonoperating income (expense), GAAP basis, less net income (loss) attributable to NCI, adjusted for compensation expense associated with (appreciation) depreciation on investments related to certain BlackRock deferred compensation plans. The compensation expense offset is recorded in operating income. This compensation expense has been included in nonoperating income (expense), less net income (loss) attributable to NCI, as adjusted, to offset returns on investments set aside for these plans, which are reported in nonoperating income (expense), GAAP basis. During 2013, the noncash, nonoperating pre-tax gain of $80 million related to the contributed PennyMac investment was excluded from nonoperating income (expense), less net income (loss) attributable to NCI, as adjusted due to its nonrecurring nature and because the more than offsetting associated Charitable Contribution expense of $124 million is reported in operating income. (in millions) 2015 2014 2013 Nonoperating income (expense), GAAP basis $ (62 ) $ (79 ) $ 116 Less: Net income (loss) attributable to NCI 7 (30 ) 19 Nonoperating income (expense), net of NCI (69 ) (49 ) 97 Gain related to Charitable Contribution — — (80 ) Compensation expense related to (appreciation) depreciation on deferred compensation plans (1 ) (7 ) (10 ) Nonoperating income (expense), less net income (loss) attributable to NCI, as adjusted $ (70 ) $ (56 ) $ 7 33 (3) Net income attributable to BlackRock, as adjusted: (in millions, except per share data) 2015 2014 2013 Net income attributable to BlackRock, GAAP basis $ 3,345 $ 3,294 $ 2,932 Non-GAAP adjustments: PNC LTIP funding obligation, net of tax 22 25 23 Income tax matters (54 ) (9 ) (69 ) Amount related to the Charitable Contribution, net of tax — — (4 ) Net income attributable to BlackRock, as adjusted $ 3,313 $ 3,310 $ 2,882 Diluted weighted-average common shares outstanding(4) 169.0 171.1 173.8 Diluted earnings per common share, GAAP basis(4) $ 19.79 $ 19.25 $ 16.87 Diluted earnings per common share, as adjusted(4) $ 19.60 $ 19.34 $ 16.58 See the aforementioned discussion regarding operating income, as adjusted, and operating margin, as adjusted, for information on the PNC LTIP funding obligation and the Charitable Contribution. For each period presented, the non-GAAP adjustment related to the PNC LTIP funding obligation was tax effected at the respective blended rates applicable to the adjustments. Amounts for 2013 included a tax benefit of approximately $48 million recognized in connection with the Charitable Contribution. The tax benefit has been excluded from net income attributable to BlackRock, Inc., as adjusted due to the nonrecurring nature of the Charitable Contribution. Non-GAAP income tax matters adjustments for 2015, 2014 and 2013 reflected the revaluation of deferred income tax liabilities. The amount for 2015 included a $54 million net noncash benefit, primarily related to the impact of legislation enacted in the United Kingdom and state and local income tax changes. The amount for 2014 included a $9 million net noncash tax benefit arising primarily from state and local income tax changes. The amount for 2013 included a $69 million noncash tax benefit, primarily related to the impact of legislation enacted in the United Kingdom and state and local income tax changes. Such amounts for 2015, 2014 and 2013 have been excluded from as adjusted results as they will not have a cash flow impact and to ensure comparability among periods presented. (4) Nonvoting participating preferred stock is considered to be a common stock equivalent for purposes of determining basic and diluted earnings per share calculations. 34 Assets Under Management AUM for reporting purposes generally is based upon how investment advisory and administration fees are calculated for each portfolio.

AUM decreased $6.5 billion to $4.645 trillion at December 31, 2015 from $4.652 trillion at December 31, 2014 driven largely by foreign exchange movements and net market depreciation that more than offset organic growth. Net market depreciation of $57.5 billion was driven by $35.3 billion from equity products due to lower U.S. and global equity markets and $12.1 billion from fixed income products. AUM decreased $101.1 billion due to the impact of foreign exchange movements, primarily resulting from the strengthening of the U.S. dollar against the euro, the British pound and the Canadian dollar.

Net market appreciation of $261.7 billion included $140.8 billion of growth in equity products primarily due to higher U.S. equity markets, and appreciation of $98.8 billion and $21.0 billion in fixed income and multi-asset products, respectively, across the majority of strategies. AUM decreased $127.7 billion from foreign exchange movements, primarily resulting from the strengthening of the U.S. dollar against the euro, the British pound and the Japanese yen. Discussion of Financial Results Introduction BlackRock derives a substantial portion of its revenue from investment advisory and administration fees, which are recognized as the services are performed. Such fees are primarily based on predetermined percentages of the market value of AUM or percentages of committed capital during investment periods of certain alternative products and are affected by changes in AUM, including market appreciation or depreciation, foreign exchange translation and net inflows or outflows. Net inflows or outflows represent the sum of new client assets, additional fundings from existing clients (including dividend reinvestment), withdrawals of assets from, and termination of, client accounts and distributions to investors representing return of capital and return on investments to investors. Market appreciation or depreciation includes current income earned on, and changes in the fair value of, securities held in client accounts. Foreign exchange translation reflects the impact of translating non-U.S. dollar denominated AUM into U.S. dollars for reporting purposes. BlackRock also earns revenue by lending securities on behalf of clients to highly rated banks and broker-dealers. The securities loaned are secured by collateral in the form of cash or securities, with minimum collateral generally ranging from approximately 102% to 112% of the value of the loaned securities. Generally, the revenue earned is shared between BlackRock and the funds or accounts managed by the Company from which the securities are borrowed. Historically, securities lending revenue in the second quarter exceeds the other quarters during the year driven by higher seasonal demand. Investment advisory agreements for certain separate accounts and investment funds provide for performance fees based upon relative and/or absolute investment performance, in addition to base fees based on AUM. Investment advisory performance fees generally are earned after a given period of time and when investment performance exceeds a contractual threshold. As such, the timing of recognition of performance fees may increase the volatility of BlackRock’s revenue and earnings. The magnitude of performance fees can fluctuate quarterly due to the timing of carried interest recognition on alternative products; however, the third and fourth quarters have a greater number of nonalternative products with performance measurement periods that end on either September 30 or December 31. BlackRock provides a variety of risk management, investment analytic and investment system and advisory services to financial institutions, pension funds, asset managers, foundations, consultants, mutual fund sponsors, real estate investment trusts and government agencies. These services are provided under the brand name BlackRock Solutions and include a wide array of risk management services, valuation services related to illiquid securities, disposition and workout assignments (including long-term portfolio liquidation assignments), strategic planning and execution, and enterprise investment system outsourcing to clients. The Company’s Aladdin operating platform serves as the investment/risk solutions system for BlackRock and other institutional investors. Fees earned for BlackRock Solutions and advisory services are determined using some, or all, of the following methods: (i) percentages of various attributes of advisory AUM or value of positions on the Aladdin platform, (ii) fixed fees and (iii) performance fees if contractual thresholds are met. BlackRock builds upon its leadership position to meet the growing need for investment and risk management solutions. Through its scale and diversity of products, it is able to provide its clients with customized solutions including fiduciary outsourcing for liability-driven investments and overlay strategies for pension plan sponsors, balance sheet management and related services for insurance companies and target date and target return funds, as well as asset allocation portfolios, for retail investors. BlackRock is also able to service these clients via its Aladdin platform to provide risk management and other outsourcing services for institutional investors and custom and tailored solutions to address complex risk exposures. The Company earns fees for transition management services primarily comprised of commissions from acting as a broker-dealer in connection with buying and selling securities on behalf of its customers. Commissions related to transition management services are recorded on a trade-date basis as securities transactions occur. The Company also earns revenue related to certain strategic investments accounted for as equity method investments. 39 Operating expense reflects employee compensation and benefits, distribution and servicing costs, amortization of deferred sales commissions, direct fund expense, general and administration expense and amortization of finite-lived intangible assets. • Employee compensation and benefits expense includes salaries, commissions, temporary help, deferred and incentive compensation, employer payroll taxes, severance and related benefit costs. • Distribution and servicing costs, which are primarily AUM driven, include payments made to Merrill Lynch-affiliated entities under a global distribution agreement, to PNC and Barclays, as well as other third parties, primarily associated with obtaining and retaining client investments in certain BlackRock products. • Direct fund expense primarily consists of third-party nonadvisory expense incurred by BlackRock related to certain funds for the use of index trademarks, reference data for indices, custodial services, fund administration, fund accounting, transfer agent services, shareholder reporting services, legal expense, audit and tax services as well as other fund-related expense directly attributable to the nonadvisory operations of the fund. These expenses may vary over time with fluctuations in AUM, number of shareholder accounts, or other attributes directly related to volume of business. General and administration expense includes marketing and promotional, occupancy and office-related costs, portfolio services (including clearing expense related to transition management services), technology, professional services, communications, closed-end fund launch costs and other general and administration expense, including the impact of foreign currency remeasurement. Foreign currency remeasurement (gains) losses were $(8) million, $(11) million and $1 million for 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively. Approximately 75% of the Company’s revenue is generated in U.S. dollars. The Company’s revenue and expense generated in foreign currencies (primarily the euro and British pound) are impacted by foreign exchange rates. Any effect of foreign exchange rate change on revenue is partially offset by a change in expense driven by the Company’s considerable non-dollar expense base related to its operations outside the United States. Nonoperating income (expense) includes the effect of changes in the valuations on investments (excluding available-for-sale investments) and earnings on equity method investments as well as interest and dividend income and interest expense. Other comprehensive income includes changes in valuations related to available-for-sale investments. BlackRock primarily holds seed and co-investments in sponsored investment products that invest in a variety of asset classes, including private equity, hedge funds and real estate. Investments generally are made for co-investment purposes, to establish a performance track record or for regulatory purposes, including Federal Reserve Bank stock. BlackRock does not engage in proprietary trading activities that could conflict with the interests of its clients. In addition, nonoperating income (expense) includes the impact of changes in the valuations of consolidated sponsored investment funds. The portion of nonoperating income (expense) not attributable to BlackRock is allocated to NCI on the consolidated statements of income.

Investment advisory, administration fees and securities lending revenue of $9,840 million for 2015 increased $251 million from $9,589 million in 2014 primarily driven by organic growth, despite the impact of foreign exchange and market volatility. Securities lending revenue increased $36 million from 2014 to $513 million in 2015, reflecting an increase in average balances of securities on loan. Investment advisory performance fees were $621 million in 2015 compared with $550 million in 2014. The current year reflected higher fees from equity products and strong 2015 performance from a single hedge fund with an annual performance measurement period that ended in the third quarter of 2015. The prior year reflected a large fee associated with the liquidation of a closed-end mortgage fund in 2014. BlackRock Solutions and advisory revenue in 2015 totaled $646 million compared with $635 million in 2014. The current year reflected higher revenue from Aladdin mandates and lower revenue from disposition-related advisory assignments.

Expense increased $130 million, or 2%, from 2014, primarily reflecting higher revenue-related expense, including compensation and benefits expense, and distribution and servicing costs, partially offset by lower general and administration expense and amortization of intangible assets. Expense for 2014 included an expense related to a $50 million reduction of an indemnification asset. Employee compensation and benefits expense increased $176 million, or 5%, to $4,005 million in 2015 from $3,829 million in 2014, reflecting higher headcount, and higher incentive and deferred compensation, partially offset by the impact of foreign exchange movements. Employees at December 31, 2015 totaled approximately 13,000 compared with approximately 12,200 at December 31, 2014. Distribution and servicing costs totaled $409 million in 2015 compared with $364 million in 2014. These costs included payments to Bank of America/Merrill Lynch under a global distribution agreement and payments to PNC, as well as other third parties, primarily associated with the distribution and servicing of client investments in certain BlackRock products. Distribution and servicing costs for 2015 and 2014 included $194 million and $183 million, respectively, attributable to Bank of America/Merrill Lynch. General and administration expense decreased $73 million from 2014, primarily reflecting the previously mentioned $50 million reduction of an indemnification asset, lower marketing and promotional expense, and lower legal and regulatory expense, partially offset by the impact of transaction-related expense. Amortization of intangible assets expense decreased $29 million, or 18%, to $128 million in 2015 from $157 million in 2014, reflecting certain finite-lived intangible assets becoming fully amortized. As Adjusted. Expense, as adjusted, increased $188 million, or 3%, to $6,706 million in 2015 from $6,518 million in 2014. The increase in total expense, as adjusted, is primarily attributable to higher revenue-related expense, including compensation and benefits expense and distribution and servicing costs, partially offset by lower amortization of intangible assets and lower general and administration expense. Amounts related to the reduction of the indemnification asset in 2014 have been excluded from as adjusted results. 2014 Compared with 2013 GAAP. Expense increased $284 million, or 4%, from 2013, primarily reflecting higher revenue-related expenses, including compensation and direct fund expense and a $50 million reduction of an indemnification asset. Expense for 2013 included the $124 million expense related to the Charitable Contribution. Employee compensation and benefits expense increased $269 million, or 8%, to $3,829 million in 2014 from $3,560 million in 2013, reflecting higher headcount and higher incentive compensation driven by higher operating income. Employees at December 31, 2014 totaled approximately 12,200 compared with approximately 11,400 at December 31, 2013. Distribution and servicing costs totaled $364 million in 2014 compared with $353 million in 2013. Distribution and servicing costs for 2014 and 2013 included $183 million and $184 million, respectively, attributable to Bank of America/Merrill Lynch. Direct fund expense increased $91 million, reflecting higher average AUM, primarily related to iShares, where BlackRock pays certain nonadvisory expense of the funds. General and administration expense decreased $87 million, primarily due to the $124 million related to the Charitable Contribution incurred in 2013 and foreign currency remeasurement, partially offset by the $50 million reduction of an indemnification asset. As Adjusted. Expense, as adjusted, increased $362 million, or 6%, to $6,518 million in 2014 from $6,156 million in 2013. The increase in total expense, as adjusted, is primarily attributable to higher employee compensation and benefits and direct fund expense.

Amounts for 2015 also include net gain (loss) on consolidated VIEs. (2) Amounts primarily include net gains (losses) related to direct hedge fund strategies and hedge fund solutions. The prior year periods also included net gains related to opportunistic credit strategies. (3) Amounts include net gains (losses) related to equity and fixed income investments, and BlackRock’s seed capital hedging program. (4) The amount for 2015 primarily includes a gain related to the acquisition of certain assets of BKCA. 2015 Compared with 2014 BlackRock Kelso Capital Advisors LLC. On March 6, 2015, BlackRock acquired certain assets related to managing BlackRock Capital Investment Corporation (formerly known as BlackRock Kelso Capital Corporation) from BKCA. In connection with the acquisition, BlackRock recorded a noncash, nonoperating, pre-tax gain of $40 million related to the fair value of its pre-existing interest in BKCA. See Note 9, Goodwill, and Note 10, Intangible Assets, for further discussion on the BKCA acquisition. Net gains on investments of $109 million in 2015 decreased $45 million from 2014 due to lower net positive marks in 2015. Net gains on investments in 2015 included a $40 million gain related to the BKCA acquisition and a $35 million unrealized gain on a private equity investment. Net gains on investments in 2014 included the positive impact of the monetization of a nonstrategic, opportunistic private equity investment. Interest expense decreased $28 million from 2014 primarily due to repayments of long-term borrowings in the fourth quarter of 2014. 2014 Compared with 2013 Net gains on investments of $154 million in 2014 decreased $132 million from 2013. Net gains on investments in 2013 included the noncash, nonoperating pre-tax gain of $80 million related to the Charitable Contribution and the $39 million pre-tax gain related to the PennyMac IPO. Net gains on investments in 2014 included the positive impact of the monetization of a nonstrategic, opportunistic private equity investment. Net interest expense increased $14 million from 2013 primarily due to higher interest expense resulting from a long-term debt issuance in March 2014. For further information on the Company’s long-term debt, see Liquidity and Capital Resources herein. Income Tax Expense GAAP As adjusted (in millions) 2015 2014 2013 2015 2014 2013 Income before income taxes(1) $ 4,595 $ 4,425 $ 3,954 $ 4,625 $ 4,507 $ 4,031 Income tax expense $ 1,250 $ 1,131 $ 1,022 $ 1,312 $ 1,197 $ 1,149 Effective tax rate 27.2 % 25.6 % 25.8 % 28.4 % 26.6 % 28.5 % (1) Net of net income (loss) attributable to NCI. The Company’s tax rate is affected by tax rates in foreign jurisdictions and the relative amount of income earned in those jurisdictions, which the Company expects to be fairly consistent in the near term. The significant foreign jurisdictions, which have lower statutory tax rates than the U.S. federal statutory rate of 35%, include the United Kingdom, Channel Islands, Canada and the Netherlands. U.S. income taxes were not provided for certain undistributed foreign earnings intended to be indefinitely reinvested outside the United States. 44 2015. Income tax expense (GAAP) reflected: o a net noncash benefit of $54 million, primarily associated with the revaluation of certain deferred income tax liabilities; and o a benefit from $75 million of nonrecurring items. The as adjusted effective tax rate of 28.4% for 2015 excluded the net noncash benefit of $54 million mentioned above, as it will not have a cash flow impact and to ensure comparability among periods presented. 2014. Income tax expense (GAAP) reflected: o a $94 million tax benefit, primarily due to the resolution of certain outstanding tax matters related to the acquisition of BGI, including the previously mentioned $50 million tax benefit (see Executive Summary for more information); o a $73 million net tax benefit related to several favorable nonrecurring items; and o a net noncash benefit of $9 million associated with the revaluation of deferred income tax liabilities. The as adjusted effective tax rate of 26.6% for 2014 excluded the $9 million net noncash benefit as it will not have a cash flow impact and to ensure comparability among periods presented and $50 million tax benefit mentioned above. The $50 million general and administrative expense and $50 million tax benefit have been excluded from as adjusted results as there is no impact on BlackRock’s book value. 2013. Income tax expense (GAAP) reflected: o a $69 million net noncash benefit primarily related to the revaluation of certain deferred income tax liabilities related to intangible assets and goodwill, including the effect of legislation enacted in the United Kingdom and domestic state and local income tax changes; o a tax benefit of approximately $48 million recognized in connection with the Charitable Contribution; and o a tax benefit of approximately $29 million, primarily due to the realization of tax loss carryforwards, and benefits from certain nonrecurring items. The as adjusted effective tax rate of 28.5% for 2013 excluded the $69 million net noncash benefit and the $48 million tax benefit related to the Charitable Contribution mentioned above. Balance Sheet Overview As Adjusted Balance Sheet The following table presents a reconciliation of the consolidated statement of financial condition presented on a GAAP basis to the consolidated statement of financial condition, excluding the impact of separate account assets and separate account collateral held under securities lending agreements (directly related to lending separate account securities) and separate account liabilities and separate account collateral liabilities under securities lending agreements and consolidated sponsored investment funds, including consolidated VIEs. The Company presents the as adjusted balance sheet as additional information to enable investors to exclude certain assets that have equal and offsetting liabilities or noncontrolling interests that ultimately do not have an impact on stockholders’ equity or cash flows. Management views the as adjusted balance sheet, a non-GAAP financial measure, as an economic presentation of the Company’s total assets and liabilities; however, it does not advocate that investors consider such non-GAAP financial measures in isolation from, or as a substitute for, financial information prepared in accordance with GAAP. Separate Account Assets and Liabilities and Separate Account Collateral Held under Securities Lending Agreements Separate account assets are maintained by BlackRock Life Limited, a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company, which is a registered life insurance company in the United Kingdom, and represent segregated assets held for purposes of funding individual and group pension contracts. The Company records equal and offsetting separate account liabilities. The separate account assets are not available to creditors of the Company and the holders of the pension contracts have no recourse to the Company’s assets. The net investment income attributable to separate account assets accrues directly to the contract owners and is not reported on the Company’s consolidated statements of income. While BlackRock has no economic interest in these assets or liabilities, BlackRock earns an investment advisory fee for the service of managing these assets on behalf of its clients. In addition, the Company records on its consolidated statements of financial condition the separate account collateral received under BlackRock Life Limited securities lending arrangements as its own asset in addition to an equal and offsetting separate account collateral liability for the obligation to return the collateral. The collateral is not available to creditors of the Company, and the borrowers under the securities lending arrangements have no recourse to the Company’s assets. Consolidated Sponsored Investment Funds The Company consolidates certain sponsored investment funds accounted for as voting rights entities (“VREs”) and VIEs, (collectively, “Consolidated Sponsored Investment Funds”). See Note 2, Significant Accounting Policies, in the notes to the consolidated financial statements beginning on page F-1 of this Form 10-K for further information of the Company’s consolidation policy. 45 The Company cannot readily access cash and cash equivalents or other assets held by Consolidated Sponsored Investment Funds to use in its operating activities. In addition, the Company cannot readily sell investments held by Consolidated Sponsored Investment Funds in order to obtain cash for use in the Company’s operations.

Please see the consolidated statements of financial condition as of December 31, 2015 and 2014 contained in Part II, Item 8 of this filing.

Cash and cash equivalents at December 31, 2015 and 2014 included $100 million and $120 million, respectively, of cash held by consolidated sponsored investment funds (see Liquidity and Capital Resources for details on the change in cash and cash equivalents during 2015). Accounts receivable at December 31, 2015 increased $117 million from December 31, 2014 due to an increase in unit trust receivables (substantially offset by an increase in unit trust payables recorded within accounts payable and accrued liabilities) and higher performance fee receivables. Investments were $1,578 million at December 31, 2015 (for more information see Investments herein). Goodwill and intangible assets increased $190 million from December 31, 2014, primarily due to the BKCA, Infraestructura Institucional and FutureAdvisor acquisitions, partially offset by $128 million of amortization of intangible assets. Other assets (including property, plant and equipment) increased $284 million from December 31, 2014, primarily related to an increase in property and equipment, higher earnings from certain strategic investments, and an increase in current taxes receivable. Liabilities. Accrued compensation and benefits at December 31, 2015 increased $106 million from December 31, 2014, primarily due to 2015 incentive compensation accruals. Accounts payable and accrued liabilities at December 31, 2015 increased $33 million from December 31, 2014 due to higher unit trust payables (substantially offset by an increase in unit trust receivables recorded within accounts receivable) and increased accruals, partially offset by a decrease in current income taxes payable. Net deferred income tax liabilities at December 31, 2015 decreased $138 million, primarily due to the effects of temporary differences associated with stock compensation, the BKCA acquisition, realization of loss carryforwards, and goodwill and intangibles. Other liabilities increased $147 million from December 31, 2014, primarily resulting from an increase in uncertain tax positions and consolidated funds liabilities. 46 Investments and Investments of Consolidated VIEs The Company’s investments and investments of consolidated VIEs (collectively, “Total Investments”) were $1,578 million and $1,030 million, respectively, at December 31, 2015. Total Investments include consolidated investments held by sponsored investment funds accounted for as VREs and VIEs. Management reviews BlackRock’s Total Investments on an “economic” basis, which eliminates the portion of Total Investments that does not impact BlackRock’s book value or net income attributable to BlackRock. BlackRock’s management does not advocate that investors consider such non-GAAP financial measures in isolation from, or as a substitute for, financial information prepared in accordance with GAAP. The Company presents Total Investments, as adjusted, to enable investors to understand the portion of its Total Investments that is owned by the Company, net of NCI, as a gauge to measure the impact of changes in net nonoperating income (expense) on investments to net income (loss) attributable to BlackRock. The Company further presents net “economic” investment exposure, net of deferred compensation investments and hedged investments, to reflect another gauge for investors. The economic impact of Total Investments held pursuant to deferred compensation arrangements is substantially offset by a change in compensation expense. The impact of certain investments is substantially mitigated by swap hedges. Carried interest capital allocations are excluded as there is no impact to BlackRock’s stockholders’ equity until such amounts are realized as performance fees. Finally, the Company’s regulatory investment in Federal Reserve Bank stock, which is not subject to market or interest rate risk, is excluded from the Company’s net economic investment exposure. (in millions) December 31, 2015 December 31, 2014 Investments, GAAP $ 1,578 $ 1,921 Investments held by consolidated VIEs, GAAP(1) 1,030 3,320 Total Investments 2,608 5,241 Investments held by consolidated VREs (700 ) (713 ) Investments held by consolidated VIEs (1,030 ) (3,320 ) Net interest in consolidated VREs 616 696 Net interest in consolidated VIEs(2) 733 — Total Investments, as adjusted 2,227 1,904 Federal Reserve Bank stock (93 ) (92 ) Deferred compensation investments (79 ) (85 ) Hedged investments (407 ) (323 ) Carried interest (VIEs/VREs) (100 ) (85 ) Total “economic” investment exposure $ 1,548 $ 1,319 (1) Amounts represent investments held in sponsored investment funds that are consolidated in accordance with GAAP as either a VIE or VRE. See Note 2, Significant Accounting Policies, for further information on the Company’s consolidation policy and the 2015 adoption of ASU 2015-02. (2) Amount includes $81 million of carried interest (VIEs), which has no impact on the Company’s “economic” investment exposure. The following table represents the carrying value of the Company’s economic investment exposure, by asset type, at December 31, 2015 and 2014: (in millions) December 31, 2015 December 31, 2014 Private equity $ 375 $ 314 Real estate 91 117 Other alternatives(1) 240 289 Other investments(2) 842 599 Total “economic” investment exposure $ 1,548 $ 1,319 (1) Other alternatives include distressed credit/mortgage funds/opportunistic funds and hedge funds/funds of hedge funds. (2) Other investments primarily include seed investments in fixed income, equity and multi-asset mutual funds/strategies as well as U.K. government securities, primarily held for regulatory purposes. As adjusted investment activity for 2015 was as follows: (in millions) Total Investments, as adjusted, December 31, 2014 $ 1,904 Purchases/capital contributions 1,300 Sales/maturities (847 ) Distributions (1) (169 ) Market appreciation(depreciation)/earnings from equity method investments 24 Carried interest capital allocations/distributions received 15 Total Investments, as adjusted, December 31, 2015 $ 2,227 (1) Amounts include distributions representing return of capital and return on investments. LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES BlackRock Cash Flows Excluding the Impact of Consolidated Sponsored Investment Funds The consolidated statements of cash flows include the cash flows of the Consolidated Sponsored Investment Funds. The Company uses an adjusted cash flow statement, which excludes the impact of Consolidated Sponsored Investment Funds, as a supplemental non-GAAP measure to assess liquidity and capital requirements. The Company believes that its cash flows, excluding the impact of the Consolidated 47 Sponsored Investment Funds, provide investors with useful information on the cash flows of BlackRock relating to its ability to fund additional operating, investing and financing activities. BlackRock’s management does not advocate that investors consider such non-GAAP measures in isolation from, or as a substitute for, its cash flows presented in accordance with GAAP. The following table presents a reconciliation of the consolidated statements of cash flows presented on a GAAP basis to the consolidated statements of cash flows, excluding the impact of the cash flows of Consolidated Sponsored Investment Funds: (in millions) GAAP Basis Impact on Cash Flows of Consolidated Sponsored Investment Funds Cash Flows Excluding Impact of Consolidated Sponsored Investment Funds Cash and cash equivalents, December 31, 2013 $ 4,390 $ 114 $ 4,276 Cash flows from operating activities 3,087 (534 ) 3,621 Cash flows from investing activities 239 (174 ) 413 Cash flows from financing activities (1,861 ) 714 (2,575 ) Effect of exchange rate changes on cash and cash equivalents (132 ) — (132 ) Net change in cash and cash equivalents 1,333 6 1,327 Cash and cash equivalents, December 31, 2014 $ 5,723 $ 120 $ 5,603 Cash flows from operating activities 3,004 (348 ) 3,352 Cash flows from investing activities (465 ) (156 ) (309 ) Cash flows from financing activities (2,064 ) 484 (2,548 ) Effect of exchange rate changes on cash and cash equivalents (115 ) — (115 ) Net change in cash and cash equivalents 360 (20 ) 380 Cash and cash equivalents, December 31, 2015 $ 6,083 $ 100 $ 5,983 Sources of BlackRock’s operating cash primarily include investment advisory, administration fees and securities lending revenue, performance fees, revenue from BlackRock Solutions and advisory products and services, other revenue and distribution fees. BlackRock uses its cash to pay all operating expense, interest and principal on borrowings, income taxes, dividends on BlackRock’s capital stock, repurchases of the Company’s stock, capital expenditures and purchases of co-investments and seed investments. Cash flows from operating activities, excluding the impact of Consolidated Sponsored Investment Funds, primarily include the receipt of investment advisory and administration fees, securities lending revenue and other revenue offset by the payment of operating expenses incurred in the normal course of business, including year-end incentive compensation accrued for in the prior year. Cash outflows from investing activities, excluding the impact of Consolidated Sponsored Investment Funds, for 2015 were $309 million and primarily reflected $412 million of investment purchases, $221 million of purchases of property and equipment and $273 million related to certain acquisitions, partially offset by $531 million of net proceeds from sales and maturities of certain investments. Cash outflows from financing activities, excluding the impact of Consolidated Sponsored Investment Funds, for 2015 were $2,548 million, primarily resulting from $1.3 billion of share repurchases, including $1.1 billion in open-market transactions and $231 million of employee tax withholdings related to employee stock transactions and $1.5 billion of cash dividend payments, partially offset by $126 million of proceeds from stock options and $105 million of excess tax benefits from vested stock-based compensation awards. The Company manages its financial condition and funding to maintain appropriate liquidity for the business. Liquidity resources at December 31, 2015 and 2014 were as follows: (in millions) December 31, 2015 December 31, 2014 Cash and cash equivalents(1) $ 6,083 $ 5,723 Cash and cash equivalents held by consolidated sponsored investment funds, excluding VIEs(2) (100 ) (120 ) Subtotal 5,983 5,603 Credit facility — undrawn 4,000 3,990 Total liquidity resources(3) $ 9,983 $ 9,593 (1) The percentage of cash and cash equivalents held by the Company’s U.S. subsidiaries was approximately 50% at both December 31, 2015 and 2014. See Net Capital Requirements herein for more information on net capital requirements in certain regulated subsidiaries. (2) The Company cannot readily access such cash to use in its operating activities. (3) Amounts do not reflect year-end incentive compensation accruals of approximately $1.5 billion and $1.4 billion for 2015 and 2014, respectively, which were paid in February of the following year. Total liquidity resources increased $390 million during 2015, primarily reflecting cash from operations, partially offset by cash payments of 2014 year-end incentive awards, share repurchases of $1.3 billion and cash dividend payments. A significant portion of the Company’s $2,227 million of Total Investments, as adjusted, is illiquid in nature and, as such, cannot be readily convertible to cash. Share Repurchases. The Company repurchased 3.1 million common shares in open market-transactions under the share repurchase program for approximately $1.1 billion during 2015. At December 31, 2015, there were 6.3 million shares still authorized to be repurchased. 48 Net Capital Requirements. The Company is required to maintain net capital in certain regulated subsidiaries within a number of jurisdictions, which is partially maintained by retaining cash and cash equivalent investments in those subsidiaries or jurisdictions. As a result, such subsidiaries of the Company may be restricted in their ability to transfer cash between different jurisdictions and to their parents. Additionally, transfers of cash between international jurisdictions, including repatriation to the United States, may have adverse tax consequences that could discourage such transfers. BlackRock Institutional Trust Company, N.A. (“BTC”) is chartered as a national bank that does not accept client deposits and whose powers are limited to trust activities. BTC provides investment management services, including investment advisory and securities lending agency services, to institutional investors and other clients. BTC is subject to regulatory capital and liquid asset requirements administered by the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency. At both December 31, 2015 and 2014, the Company was required to maintain approximately $1.1 billion in net capital in certain regulated subsidiaries, including BTC, entities regulated by the Financial Conduct Authority and Prudential Regulation Authority in the United Kingdom, and the Company’s broker-dealers. The Company was in compliance with all applicable regulatory net capital requirements. Undistributed Earnings of Foreign Subsidiaries. As of December 31, 2015, the Company has not provided for U.S. federal and state income taxes on approximately $4.7 billion of undistributed earnings of its foreign subsidiaries. Such earnings are considered indefinitely reinvested outside the United States. The Company’s current plans do not demonstrate a need to repatriate these funds. Short-Term Borrowings 2015 Revolving Credit Facility. In April 2015, the Company’s credit facility was further amended to extend the maturity date to March 2020 and to increase the amount of the aggregate commitment to $4.0 billion (the “2015 credit facility”). The 2015 credit facility permits the Company to request up to an additional $1.0 billion of borrowing capacity, subject to lender credit approval, increasing the overall size of the 2015 credit facility to an aggregate principal amount not to exceed $5.0 billion. Interest on borrowings outstanding accrues at a rate based on the applicable London Interbank Offered Rate plus a spread. The 2015 credit facility requires the Company not to exceed a maximum leverage ratio (ratio of net debt to earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, where net debt equals total debt less unrestricted cash) of 3 to 1, which was satisfied with a ratio of less than 1 to 1 at December 31, 2015. The 2015 credit facility provides back-up liquidity to fund ongoing working capital for general corporate purposes and various investment opportunities. At December 31, 2015, the Company had no amount outstanding under the 2015 credit facility. Commercial Paper Program. The maximum aggregate amount for which the Company could issue unsecured commercial paper notes (the “CP Notes”) on a private-placement basis up to a maximum aggregate amount outstanding at any time of $4.0 billion as amended in April 2015. The commercial paper program is currently supported by the 2015 credit facility. At December 31, 2015, BlackRock had no CP Notes outstanding. Long-Term Borrowings. The carrying value of long-term borrowings at December 31, 2015 included the following: (in millions) Maturity Amount Carrying Value Maturity 6.25% Notes $ 700 $ 699 September 2017 5.00% Notes 1,000 997 December 2019 4.25% Notes 750 745 May 2021 3.375% Notes 750 744 June 2022 3.50% Notes 1,000 992 March 2024 1.25% Notes 760 753 May 2025 Total Long-term Borrowings $ 4,960 $ 4,930 During 2015, the Company fully repaid $750 million of 1.375% notes at maturity. In May 2015, the Company issued €700 million of 1.25% senior unsecured notes maturing in May 2025. Upon conversion to U.S. dollars the Company designated the €700 million debt offering as a net investment hedge to offset its currency exposure relating to its net investment in certain euro functional currency operations. For more information on Company’s borrowings, see Note 12, Borrowings, in the notes to the consolidated financial statements beginning on page F-1 of this Form 10-K. Contractual Obligations, Commitments and Contingencies The following table sets forth contractual obligations, commitments and contingencies by year of payment at December 31, 2015: (in millions) 2016 2017 2018 2019 2020 Thereafter Total Contractual obligations and commitments: Long-term borrowings: Principal $ — $ 700 $ — $ 1,000 $ — $ 3,260 $ 4,960 Interest 196 196 152 152 102 224 1,022 Operating leases 134 133 131 125 120 560 1,203 Purchase obligations 79 50 2 — — — 131 Investment commitments 179 — — — — — 179 Total contractual obligations and commitments 588 1,079 285 1,277 222 4,044 7,495 Contingent obligations: Contingent distribution obligations 185 — — — — — 185 Contingent payments related to business acquisitions(1) 12 8 21 10 12 — 63 Total contractual obligations, commitments and contingent obligations(2) $ 785 $ 1,087 $ 306 $ 1,287 $ 234 $ 4,044 $ 7,743 49 (1) The amount of contingent payments reflected for any year represents the expected payment amounts using foreign currency exchange rates as of December 31, 2015 under the terms of the business acquisition’s agreement. The fair value of the contingent obligations is not significant to the consolidated statement of financial condition and is recorded within other liabilities. (2) At December 31, 2015, the Company had approximately $350 million of net unrecognized tax benefits. Due to the uncertainty of timing and amounts that will ultimately be paid, this amount has been excluded from the table above. Operating Leases. The Company leases its primary office locations under agreements that expire on varying dates through 2035. In connection with certain lease agreements, the Company is responsible for escalation payments. The contractual obligations table above includes only guaranteed minimum lease payments for such leases and does not project potential escalation or other lease-related payments. These leases are classified as operating leases and, as such, are not recorded as liabilities on the consolidated statements of financial condition. Purchase Obligations. In the ordinary course of business, BlackRock enters into contracts or purchase obligations with third parties whereby the third parties provide services to or on behalf of BlackRock. Purchase obligations included in the contractual obligations table above represent executory contracts, which are either noncancelable or cancelable with a penalty. At December 31, 2015, the Company’s obligations primarily reflected standard service contracts for portfolio services, market data, office-related services and third-party marketing and promotional services, and obligations for equipment. Purchase obligations are recorded on the consolidated financial statements when services are provided and, as such, obligations for services and equipment not received are not included in the consolidated statement of financial condition at December 31, 2015. Investment Commitments. At December 31, 2015, the Company had $179 million of various capital commitments to fund sponsored investment funds, including consolidated VIEs. These funds include private equity funds, real estate funds, infrastructure funds and opportunistic funds. This amount excludes additional commitments made by consolidated funds of funds to underlying third-party funds as third-party noncontrolling interest holders have the legal obligation to fund the respective commitments of such funds of funds. In addition to the capital commitments of $179 million, the Company had approximately $38 million of contingent commitments for certain funds which have investment periods that have expired. Generally, the timing of the funding of these commitments is unknown and the commitments are callable on demand at any time prior to the expiration of the commitment. These unfunded commitments are not recorded on the consolidated statements of financial condition. These commitments do not include potential future commitments approved by the Company that are not yet legally binding. The Company intends to make additional capital commitments from time to time to fund additional investment products for, and with, its clients. Contingent Distribution Obligations. In November 2010, BlackRock entered into a second amended and restated global distribution agreement with Merrill Lynch, which requires the Company to make payments to Merrill Lynch contingent upon sales of products and level of AUM maintained in certain BlackRock products. The initial term of the agreement remained in effect until January 2014 and was renewed for one automatic three-year extension. Contingent Payments Related to Business Acquisitions. In connection with certain acquisitions, BlackRock is required to make contingent payments, subject to the acquired businesses achieving specified performance targets over a certain period, subsequent to the applicable acquisition date. The fair value of the remaining aggregate contingent payments at December 31, 2015 is included in other liabilities and is not significant to the consolidated statement of financial condition. The following items have not been included in the contractual obligations, commitments and contingencies table: Carried Interest Clawback. As a general partner in certain investment funds, including private equity partnerships and certain hedge funds, the Company may receive carried interest cash distributions from the partnerships in accordance with distribution provisions of the partnership agreements. The Company may, from time to time, be required to return all or a portion of such distributions to the limited partners in the event the limited partners do not achieve a return as specified in the various partnership agreements. Therefore, BlackRock records carried interest subject to such clawback provisions in Total Investments, or cash/cash of consolidated VIEs to the extent that it is distributed, and as a deferred carried interest liability/other liabilities of consolidated VIEs on its consolidated statements of financial condition. Carried interest is recorded as performance fees on BlackRock’s consolidated statements of income upon the earlier of the termination of the investment fund or when the likelihood of clawback is considered mathematically improbable. Indemnifications. In the ordinary course of business or in connection with certain acquisition agreements, BlackRock enters into contracts pursuant to which it may agree to indemnify third parties in certain circumstances. The terms of these indemnities vary from contract to contract and the amount of indemnification liability, if any, cannot be determined or the likelihood of any liability is considered remote and, therefore, has not been included in the table above or recorded in the consolidated statement of financial condition at December 31, 2015. See further discussion in Note 13, Commitments and Contingencies, to the consolidated financial statements beginning on page F-1 of this Form 10-K. On behalf of certain clients, the Company lends securities to highly rated banks and broker-dealers. In these securities lending transactions, the borrower is required to provide and maintain collateral at or above regulatory minimums. Securities on loan are marked to market daily to determine if the borrower is required to pledge additional collateral. BlackRock has issued certain indemnifications to certain securities lending clients against potential loss resulting from a borrower’s failure to fulfill its obligations under the securities lending agreement should the value of the collateral pledged by the borrower at the time of default be insufficient to cover the borrower’s obligation under the securities lending agreement. At December 31, 2015, the Company indemnified certain of its clients for their securities lending loan balances of approximately $169.3 billion. The Company held, as agent, cash and securities totaling $179.6 billion as collateral for indemnified securities on loan at December 31, 2015. The fair value of these indemnifications was not material at December 31, 2015. While the collateral pledged by a borrower is intended to be sufficient to offset the borrower’s obligations to return securities borrowed and any other amounts owing to the lender under the relevant securities lending agreement, in the event of a borrower default, the Company can give no assurance that the collateral pledged by the borrower will be sufficient to fulfill such obligations. If the amount of such pledged collateral is not sufficient to fulfill such obligations to a client for whom the Company has provided indemnification, BlackRock would be responsible for the amount of the shortfall. These indemnifications cover only the collateral shortfall described above, and do not in any way guarantee, assume or otherwise insure the investment performance or return of any cash collateral vehicle into which securities lending cash collateral is invested. 50 Compensation and Benefit Obligations. The Company has various compensation and benefit obligations, including bonuses, commissions and incentive payments payable, defined contribution plan matching contribution obligations, and deferred compensation arrangements, that are excluded from the contractual obligations and commitments table above. Accrued compensation and benefits at December 31, 2015 totaled $1,971 million and included incentive compensation of $1,452 million, deferred compensation of $266 million and other compensation and benefits related obligations of $253 million. Substantially all of the incentive compensation liability was paid in the first quarter of 2016, while the deferred compensation obligations are generally payable over periods of up to five years. Critical Accounting Policies The preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expense during the reporting periods. Actual results could differ significantly from those estimates. Management considers the following critical accounting policies important to understanding the consolidated financial statements. For a summary of these and additional accounting policies see Note 2, Significant Accounting Policies, in the consolidated financial statements beginning on page F-1 of this Form 10-K. Consolidation In the normal course of business, the Company is the manager of various types of sponsored investment vehicles. The Company performs an analysis for investment products to determine if the product is a VIE or a VRE. Assessing whether an entity is a VIE or a VRE involves judgment and analysis. Factors considered in this assessment include the entity’s legal organization, the entity’s capital structure and equity ownership, and any related party or de facto agent implications of the Company’s involvement with the entity. Investments that are determined to be VREs are consolidated if the Company can exert control over the financial and operating policies of the investee, which generally exists if there is greater than 50% voting interest. See Note 4, Consolidated Voting Right Entities, in the notes to the consolidated financial statements beginning on page F-1 of this Form 10-K for more information. Investments that are determined to be VIEs are consolidated if the Company is the primary beneficiary (“PB”) of the entity. At December 31, 2015, BlackRock was determined to be the PB for certain investment products that were determined to be VIEs, which required BlackRock to consolidate them. BlackRock was deemed to be the PB because it has the power to direct the activities that most significantly impact the entities’ economic performance and has the obligation to absorb losses or the right to receive benefits that potentially could be significant to the VIE. See Note 5, Variable Interest Entities, in the notes to the consolidated financial statements beginning on page F-1 of this Form 10-K for more information. See Note 2, Significant Accounting Policies — Accounting Pronouncements Adopted in 2015, in the notes to the consolidated financial statements beginning on page F-1 of this Form 10-K for more information on ASU 2015-02. Investments Equity Method Investments. For equity investments where BlackRock does not control the investee, and where it is not the PB of a VIE, but can exert significant influence over the financial and operating policies of the investee, the Company follows the equity method of accounting. The evaluation of whether the Company exerts control or significant influence over the financial and operational policies of its investees requires significant judgment based on the facts and circumstances surrounding each individual investment. Factors considered in these evaluations may include the type of investment, the legal structure of the investee, the terms and structure of the investment agreement, including investor voting or other rights, the terms of BlackRock’s advisory agreement or other agreements with the investee, any influence BlackRock may have on the governing board of the investee, the legal rights of other investors in the entity pursuant to the fund’s operating documents and the relationship between BlackRock and other investors in the entity. BlackRock’s equity method investees that are investment companies record their underlying investments at fair value. Therefore, under the equity method of accounting, BlackRock’s share of the investee’s underlying net income predominantly represents fair value adjustments in the investments held by the equity method investees. BlackRock’s share of the investee’s underlying net income or loss is based upon the most currently available information and is recorded as nonoperating income (expense) for investments in investment companies, or as other revenue for certain strategic investments, which are recorded in other assets, since such investees are considered to be an extension of BlackRock’s core business. At December 31, 2015, the Company had $527 million and $265 million of equity method investments, including equity method investments held for deferred compensation, reflected within investments and other assets, respectively, and at December 31, 2014, the Company had $654 million and $208 million of equity method investees reflected in investments and other assets, respectively. Impairments of Investments. Management periodically assesses equity method, available-for-sale, held-to-maturity and cost investments for other-than-temporary Impairment (“OTTI”). If an OTTI exists, an impairment charge is recorded in nonoperating income (expense) on the consolidated statements of the income. For equity method, held-to-maturity and cost method investments, if circumstances indicate that an OTTI may exist, the investments are evaluated using market values, where available, or the expected future cash flows of the investment. If the Company determines an OTTI exists, an impairment charge is recognized for the excess of the carrying amount of the investment over its estimated fair value. For available-for-sale securities, when the fair value is lower than cost, the Company considers, among other factors, the length of time the security has been in a loss position, the extent to which the security’s fair value is less than cost, the financial condition and near-term prospects of the security’s issuer and the Company’s ability and intent to hold the security for a length of time sufficient to allow for recovery of such unrealized losses. For equity securities, if the impairment is considered other-than-temporary, an impairment charge is recognized for the excess of the carrying amount of the investment over its fair value. For debt securities, the Company considers whether: (1) it has the intent to sell the security; (2) it is more likely than not that it will be required to sell the security before recovery; or (3) it expects to recover the entire amortized cost basis of the security. If the Company intends to sell the security or it is more likely than not that it will be required to sell the 51 security, the entire difference between the amortized cost and fair value must be recognized in earnings. If the Company does not intend to sell a security and it is not more likely than not that it will be required to sell the security but the security has suffered an impairment related to credit, the credit loss will be bifurcated from the total decline in value and recorded in earnings with the remaining portion recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income. For the Company’s investments in CLOs, the Company reviews cash flow estimates over the life of each CLO investment. On a quarterly basis, if the present value of the estimated future cash flows is lower than the carrying value of the investment and there is an adverse change in estimated cash flows, an impairment is considered to be other-than-temporary. An impairment charge is recognized for the excess of the carrying amount of the investment over its estimated fair value. Evaluation of impairments involves significant assumptions and management judgments, which could differ from actual results, and these differences could have a material impact on the consolidated statements of income. Fair Value Measurements The Company’s assessment of the significance of a particular input to the fair value measurement according to the fair value hierarchy (i.e., Level 1, 2 and 3 inputs, as defined) in its entirety requires judgment and considers factors specific to the financial instrument. See Note 2, Significant Accounting Policies, in the consolidated financial statements beginning on page F-1 of this Form 10-K for more information on fair value measurements. Changes in Valuation. Changes in value on $2,261 million of Total Investments will impact the Company’s nonoperating income (expense), $44 million will impact accumulated other comprehensive income, $203 million are held at cost or amortized cost and the remaining $100 million relates to carried interest, which will not impact nonoperating income (expense). At December 31, 2015, changes in fair value of approximately $1,649 million of such consolidated VIEs/VREs will impact BlackRock’s net income (loss) attributable to noncontrolling interests on the consolidated statements of income. BlackRock’s net exposure to changes in fair value of such consolidated sponsored investment funds was $1,268 million. Goodwill and Intangible Assets The value of advisory contracts acquired in business acquisitions to manage AUM in proprietary open-end investment funds as well as collective trust funds without a specified termination date are classified as indefinite-lived intangible assets. The assignment of indefinite lives to such investment fund contracts is based upon the assumption there is no foreseeable limit on the contract period to manage these funds due to the likelihood of continued renewal at little or no cost. In addition, trade names/trademarks are considered indefinite-lived intangibles as they are expected to generate cash flows indefinitely. Goodwill represents the cost of a business acquisition in excess of the fair value of the net assets acquired. In accordance with the applicable provisions of ASC 350, Intangibles – Goodwill and Other (“ASC 350”), indefinite-lived intangible assets and goodwill are not amortized. Finite-lived management contracts, which relate to acquired separate accounts and funds with a specified termination date, are amortized over their remaining expected useful lives, which, at December 31, 2015, ranged from 1 to 9 years with a weighted-average remaining estimated useful life of 3.7 years. Goodwill. The Company assesses its goodwill for impairment at least annually, considering such factors as the book value and the market capitalization of the Company. The impairment assessment performed as of July 31, 2015 indicated no impairment charge was required. The Company continues to monitor its book value per share compared with closing prices of its common stock for potential indicators of impairment. At December 31, 2015, the Company’s common stock closed at $340.52, which exceeded its book value of approximately $172.12 per share. Indefinite-lived and finite-lived intangibles. The Company performs assessments to determine if any intangible assets are impaired and whether the indefinite-life and finite-life classifications are still appropriate. In evaluating whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of indefinite-lived intangibles is less than carrying value, BlackRock performed certain quantitative assessments and assessed various significant qualitative factors including AUM, revenue basis points, projected AUM growth rates, operating margins, tax rates and discount rates. In addition, the Company considered other factors including: (i) macroeconomic conditions such as a deterioration in general economic conditions, limitations on accessing capital, fluctuations in foreign exchange rates, or other developments in equity and credit markets; (ii) industry and market considerations such as a deterioration in the environment in which an entity operates, an increased competitive environment, a decline in market-dependent multiples or metrics, a change in the market for an entity’s services, or regulatory, legal or political developments; and (iii) entity-specific events, such as a change in management or key personnel, overall financial performance and litigation that could affect significant inputs used to determine the fair value of the indefinite-lived intangible asset. If an indefinite-lived intangible is determined to be more likely than not impaired, then the fair value of the asset is compared with its carrying value and any excess of the carrying value over the fair value would be recognized as an expense in the period in which the impairment occurs. For finite-lived intangible assets, if potential impairment circumstances are considered to exist, the Company will perform a recoverability test, using an undiscounted cash flow analysis. Actual results could differ from these cash flow estimates, which could materially impact the impairment conclusion. If the carrying value of the asset is determined not to be recoverable based on the undiscounted cash flow test, the difference between the book value of the asset and its current fair value would be recognized as an expense in the period in which the impairment occurs. In addition, management judgment is required to estimate the period over which finite-lived intangible assets will contribute to the Company’s cash flows and the pattern in which these assets will be consumed. A change in the remaining useful life of any of these assets, or the reclassification of an indefinite-lived intangible asset to a finite-lived intangible asset, could have a significant impact on the Company’s amortization expense, which was $128 million, $157 million and $161 million for 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively. In 2015, 2014 and 2013, the Company performed impairment tests, including evaluating various qualitative factors and performing certain quantitative assessments. The Company determined that no impairment charges were required, the classification of indefinite-lived versus 52 finite-lived intangibles was still appropriate and no changes to the expected lives of the finite-lived intangibles were required. The Company continuously monitors various factors, including AUM, for potential indicators of impairment. Income Taxes Deferred income tax assets and liabilities are recognized for future tax consequences attributable to temporary differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases using currently enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to reverse. The effect of a change in tax rates on deferred tax assets and liabilities is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date. Significant management judgment is required in estimating the ranges of possible outcomes and determining the probability of favorable or unfavorable tax outcomes and potential interest and penalties related to such unfavorable outcomes. Actual future tax consequences relating to uncertain tax positions may be materially different than the Company’s current estimates. At December 31, 2015, BlackRock had $466 million of gross unrecognized tax benefits, of which $320 million, if recognized, would affect the effective tax rate. Management is required to estimate the timing of the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities, make assumptions about the future deductibility of deferred income tax assets and assess deferred income tax liabilities based on enacted tax rates for the appropriate tax jurisdictions to determine the amount of such deferred income tax assets and liabilities. At December 31, 2015, the Company had deferred tax assets of $20 million and net deferred tax liabilities of approximately $4,851 million on the consolidated statement of financial condition. Changes in deferred tax assets and liabilities may occur in certain circumstances, including statutory income tax rate changes, statutory tax law changes, changes in the anticipated timing of recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities or changes in the structure or tax status of the Company. The Company assesses whether a valuation allowance should be established against its deferred income tax assets based on consideration of all available evidence, both positive and negative, using a more likely than not standard. The assessment considers, among other matters, the nature, frequency and severity of recent losses, forecast of future profitability, the duration of statutory carry back and carry forward periods, the Company’s experience with tax attributes expiring unused, and tax planning alternatives. The Company records income taxes based upon its estimated income tax liability or benefit. The Company’s actual tax liability or benefit may differ from the estimated income tax liability or benefit. The Company had current income taxes receivables of approximately $166 million and current income taxes payables of $79 million at December 31, 2015. Revenue Recognition Investment advisory and administration fees are recognized as the services are performed. Such fees are primarily based on pre-determined percentages of the market value of AUM or, in the case of certain real estate clients, net operating income generated by the underlying properties. Investment advisory and administration fees are affected by changes in AUM, including market appreciation or depreciation, foreign exchange translation and net inflows or outflows. Investment advisory and administration fees for investment funds are shown net of fees waived pursuant to contractual expense limitations of the funds or voluntary waivers. The Company contracts with third parties and related parties for various fund distribution and shareholder servicing to be performed on behalf of certain funds the Company manages. Such arrangements generally are priced as a portion of the management fee paid by the fund. In certain cases, the fund takes on the primary responsibility for payment for services such that the Company bears no credit risk to the third-party. The Company accounts for such retrocession arrangements in accordance with ASC 605-45, Revenue Recognition — Principal Agent Considerations (“ASC 605-45”), and records its management fees net of retrocessions. Retrocessions for 2015, 2014 and 2013 were $870 million, $891 million and $785 million, respectively. The Company has additional contracts for similar services with third parties, which due to the terms of the contracts, are recorded as distribution and servicing costs and thus not netted on the consolidated statements of income. The Company earns revenue by lending securities on behalf of clients to highly rated banks and broker-dealers. Revenue is accounted for on an accrual basis. The securities loaned are secured by collateral, generally ranging from 102% to 112% of the value of the loaned securities. Generally, the revenue earned is shared between the Company and the funds or accounts managed by the Company from which the securities are borrowed. For 2015, 2014 and 2013, securities lending revenue earned by the Company totaled $513 million, $477 million and $447 million, respectively, and is recorded in investment advisory, administration fees and securities lending revenue on the consolidated statements of income. Investment advisory, administration fees and securities lending revenue are reported together as the fees for these services often are agreed upon with clients as a bundled fee. The Company receives investment advisory performance fees or incentive allocations, from certain actively managed investment funds and certain SMAs. These performance fees are dependent upon exceeding specified relative or absolute investment return thresholds. Such fees are recorded upon completion of the measurement period, which varies by product or account, and could be monthly, quarterly, annually or longer. In addition, the Company is allocated carried interest from certain alternative investment products upon exceeding performance thresholds. BlackRock may be required to reverse/return all, or part, of such carried interest allocations depending upon future performance of these funds. Therefore, BlackRock records carried interest subject to such clawback provisions in Total Investments or cash/cash of consolidated VIEs to the extent that it is distributed, on its consolidated statements of financial condition. Carried interest is recorded as performance fee revenue upon the earlier of the termination of the investment fund or when the likelihood of clawback is considered mathematically improbable. The Company records a deferred carried interest liability to the extent it receives cash or capital allocations related to carried interest prior to meeting the revenue recognition criteria. At December 31, 2015 and 2014, the Company had $143 million and $105 million, respectively, of deferred carried interest recorded in other liabilities/other liabilities of consolidated VIEs on the consolidated statements of financial condition. A portion of the deferred carried interest liability will be paid to certain employees. The ultimate timing of the recognition of performance fee revenue, if any, for these products is unknown. 53 The following table presents changes in the deferred carried interest liability (including the portion related to consolidated VIEs) for 2015 and 2014: (in millions) 2015 2014 Beginning balance $ 105 $ 108 Net increase (decrease) 69 69 Performance fee revenue recognized (31 ) (72 ) Ending balance $ 143 $ 105 For 2015, 2014 and 2013, performance fee revenue totaled $621 million, $550 million and $561 million, respectively. Fees earned for BlackRock Solutions, which include advisory services, are recorded as services are performed or when completed and are determined using some, or all, of the following methods: (i) percentages of various attributes of advisory AUM or value of positions on the Aladdin platform, (ii) fixed fees and (iii) performance fees if contractual thresholds are met. Revenue earned on advisory assignments was comprised of one-time advisory and portfolio structuring fees and ongoing fees based on AUM of the respective portfolio assignment. For 2015, 2014 and 2013, BlackRock Solutions and advisory revenue totaled $646 million, $635 million and $577 million, respectively. Adjustments to revenue arising from initial estimates recorded historically have been immaterial since the majority of BlackRock’s investment advisory and administration revenue is calculated based on AUM and since the Company does not record performance revenue until performance thresholds have been exceeded and the likelihood of clawback is mathematically improbable. Recent Developments In November 2015, the Company announced that it had entered an agreement to assume investment management responsibilities of approximately $87 billion of cash assets under management from BofA® Global Capital Management, Bank of America’s asset management business. The transaction is expected to close in the first half of 2016, subject to customary regulatory approvals and closing conditions. This transaction is not expected to be material to the Company’s consolidated financial condition or results of operations. Accounting Developments For accounting pronouncements that the Company adopted during 2015 and for recent accounting pronouncements not yet adopted, see Note 2, Significant Accounting Policies, in the consolidated financial statements beginning on page F-1 of this Form 10-K. Item 7a. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk AUM Market Price Risk. BlackRock’s investment advisory and administration fees are primarily comprised of fees based on a percentage of the value of AUM and, in some cases, performance fees expressed as a percentage of the returns realized on AUM. At December 31, 2015, the majority of the Company’s investment advisory and administration fees were based on average or period end AUM of the applicable investment funds or separate accounts. Movements in equity market prices, interest rates/credit spreads, foreign exchange rates or all three could cause the value of AUM to decline, which would result in lower investment advisory and administration fees. Corporate Investments Portfolio Risks. As a leading investment management firm, BlackRock devotes significant resources across all of its operations to identifying, measuring, monitoring, managing and analyzing market and operating risks, including the management and oversight of its own investment portfolio. The Board of Directors of the Company has adopted guidelines for the review of investments to be made by the Company, requiring, among other things, that investments be reviewed by certain senior officers of the Company, and that certain investments may be referred to the Audit Committee or the Board of Directors, depending on the circumstances, for approval. In the normal course of its business, BlackRock is exposed to equity market price risk, interest rate/credit spread risk and foreign exchange rate risk associated with its corporate investments. BlackRock has investments primarily in sponsored investment products that invest in a variety of asset classes, including real estate, private equity and hedge funds. Investments generally are made for co-investment purposes, to establish a performance track record, to hedge exposure to certain deferred compensation plans or for regulatory purposes. Currently, the Company has a seed capital hedging program in which it enters into swaps to hedge market and interest rate exposure to certain investments. At December 31, 2015, the Company had outstanding total return swaps and interest rate swaps with an aggregate notional value of approximately $360 million and $46 million, respectively. At December 31, 2015, approximately $1.7 billion of BlackRock’s Total Investments were maintained in consolidated sponsored investment funds accounted for as VREs and VIEs. Excluding the impact of the Federal Reserve Bank stock, carried interest, investments made to hedge exposure to certain deferred compensation plans and certain investments that are hedged via the seed capital hedging program, the Company’s economic exposure to its investment portfolio is $1,548 million. See Balance Sheet Overview-Investments and Investments of Consolidated VIEs in Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations for further information on the Company’s Total Investments. Equity Market Price Risk. At December 31, 2015, the Company’s net exposure to equity market price risk in its investment portfolio was approximately $578 million of the Company’s total economic investment exposure. Investments subject to market price risk include private equity and real estate investments, hedge funds and funds of funds as well as mutual funds. The Company estimates that a hypothetical 10% adverse change in market prices would result in a decrease of approximately $57.8 million in the carrying value of such investments. Interest-Rate/Credit Spread Risk. At December 31, 2015, the Company was exposed to interest rate risk and credit spread risk as a result of approximately $970 million of Total Investments in debt securities and sponsored investment products that invest primarily in debt securities. Management considered a hypothetical 100 basis point fluctuation in interest rates or credit spreads and estimates that the impact of such a 54 fluctuation on these investments, in the aggregate, would result in a decrease, or increase, of approximately $14.6 million in the carrying value of such investments. Foreign Exchange Rate Risk. As discussed above, the Company invests in sponsored investment products that invest in a variety of asset classes. The carrying value of the total economic investment exposure denominated in foreign currencies, primarily the pound sterling and euro, was $343 million at December 31, 2015. A 10% adverse change in the applicable foreign exchange rates would result in approximately a $34.3 million decline in the carrying value of such investments. Other Market Risks. The Company executes forward foreign currency exchange contracts to mitigate the risk of certain foreign exchange risk movements. At December 31, 2015, the Company had outstanding forward foreign currency exchange contracts with an aggregate notional value of approximately $169 million.",2023-12-30 18:58:54.869621

Overview BlackRock, Inc. (together, with its subsidiaries, unless the context otherwise indicates, “BlackRock” or the “Company”) is a leading publicly traded investment management firm with $5.1 trillion of AUM at December 31, 2016. With approximately 13,000 employees in more than 30 countries, BlackRock provides a broad range of investment and risk management services to institutional and retail clients worldwide. For further information see Business, in Part I, Item 1 and Note 1, Introduction and Basis of Presentation, in the notes to the consolidated financial statements contained in Part II, Item 8. Acquisitions and Divestitures In April 2016, the Company completed a transaction with BofA® Global Capital Management that transferred investment management responsibilities of $80.6 billion of cash assets under management to the Company. Total consideration included contingent consideration valued at $75 million at time of close. BlackRock’s platform provides clients with broad access to high quality, global liquidity investment solutions. In August 2016, the Company completed the transfer of its UK Defined Contribution Administration and Platform business to Aegon N.V. (“Aegon”). The Company continues to be the primary investment manager for the clients who transferred to Aegon in connection with the transaction. The associated Part VII transfer of the underlying assets and liabilities to Aegon remains subject to regulatory and court approval, which is expected to be finalized during the first quarter of 2018. These transactions were not material to the Company’s consolidated statements of financial condition or results of operations. United Kingdom Exit from European Union In June 2016, the United Kingdom held a referendum in which voters approved an exit from the European Union (“EU”), commonly referred to as ""Brexit"", which resulted in significant volatility in several international markets. The timing and the outcome of the negotiations between the United Kingdom and the EU in connection with Brexit are both highly uncertain and information regarding the long-term consequences of the vote is expected to become clearer over time. The Company will continue to monitor the potential impact of Brexit on its consolidated statements of financial condition and results of operations. 31 Business Outlook BlackRock's framework for long-term value creation is predicated on generating differentiated organic growth, leveraging scale to increase operating margins over time, and returning capital to shareholders on a consistent basis. BlackRock's diversified platform, in terms of style, product, client and geography, enables it to generate more stable cash flows through market cycles, positioning BlackRock to invest for the long-term by striking an appropriate balance between investing for future growth and prudent discretionary expense management. BlackRock’s highly diversified multi-product platform was created to meet the needs of its clients in all market environments. BlackRock is positioned to provide active and index investment solutions across asset classes and geographies and leverage BlackRock Solutions’ world-class risk management, analytics and advisory capabilities on behalf of clients.

(3) Total BlackRock stockholders’ equity, excluding an appropriated retained deficit of $19 million for 2014, divided by total common and preferred shares outstanding at December 31 of the respective year-end. 2016 Compared with 2015 GAAP. Operating income of $4,570 million decreased $94 million from 2015. Operating income was impacted by lower performance fees, partially offset by expense discipline and growth in Aladdin revenue. Operating income also reflected a restructuring charge of $76 million recorded in the first quarter of 2016 in connection with a project to streamline and simplify the organization. Operating margin of 41% increased 10 bps from 2015 driven by continued expense discipline. Nonoperating income (expense), less net income (loss) attributable to noncontrolling interests (“NCI”), decreased $39 million from 2015 due to lower net gains on investments, partially offset by higher interest and dividend income during 2016. Net gains on investments in 2015 included a $40 million noncash gain related to the BlackRock Kelso Capital Advisors LLC (“BKCA”) transaction and a $35 million unrealized gain on a private equity investment. Income tax expense for 2016 included a $30 million net noncash tax benefit associated with the revaluation of certain deferred income tax liabilities, including the effect of tax legislation enacted in the United Kingdom, and state and local income tax changes. Income tax expense for 2016 also included nonrecurring tax benefits of $65 million. Income tax expense for 2015 included a $54 million net noncash benefit associated with the revaluation of certain deferred income tax liabilities and nonrecurring tax benefits of $75 million. 32 Diluted earnings per common share decreased $0.75, or 4%, compared with the prior year period, reflecting lower nonoperating income and a higher tax rate in 2016, partially offset by the benefit of share repurchases. As Adjusted. Operating income of $4,674 million decreased $21 million, and operating margin of 43.7% increased 80 bps, from 2015. The pre-tax restructuring charge of $76 million described above was excluded from as adjusted results. Income tax expense for 2016 and 2015 excluded the previously described net noncash benefits of $30 million and $54 million, respectively, and included the nonrecurring tax benefits described above. Diluted earnings per common share decreased $0.31, or 2%, from 2015. 2015 Compared with 2014 GAAP. Operating income of $4,664 million increased $190 million and operating margin of 40.9% increased 50 bps from 2014. Operating income reflected growth in base fees and performance fees, partially offset by higher expense. The Company’s 2015 expense reflected higher revenue-related expense, including compensation, and distribution and servicing costs, partially offset by lower general and administration expense, and lower amortization of intangible assets. In connection with the Barclays Global Investors (“BGI”) acquisition, BlackRock recorded a $50 million indemnification asset for unrecognized tax benefits. Due to the resolution of outstanding tax matters in 2014, BlackRock recorded $50 million of general and administration expense in 2014 to reflect the reduction of the indemnification asset and an offsetting $50 million tax benefit. Results for 2014 also included $11 million of closed-end fund launch costs. Nonoperating income (expense), less net income (loss) attributable to NCI, decreased $20 million from 2014 due to lower net gains on investments in 2015. Income tax expense for 2015 included a $54 million net noncash benefit described above and nonrecurring tax benefits of $75 million. Income tax expense for 2014 included $94 million of tax benefits, including the $50 million tax benefit mentioned above, a $9 million net noncash benefit, primarily associated with the revaluation of certain deferred income tax liabilities as a result of domestic state and local tax changes, and a $73 million net tax benefit related to several favorable nonrecurring items. Diluted earnings per common share rose $0.54, or 3%, compared with the prior year period, reflecting higher operating income and the benefit of share repurchases, partially offset by the impact of a higher 2015 effective tax rate and lower nonoperating income. As Adjusted. Operating income of $4,695 million increased $132 million from 2014 and the operating margin for both 2015 and 2014 was 42.9%. Income tax expense on an as adjusted basis for 2015 included a $75 million net benefit and excluded the net noncash benefit of $54 million described above. General and administration expense for 2014 excluded the $50 million related to the reduction of the indemnification asset described above. Income tax expense for 2014 included a $73 million net benefit and excluded a $50 million tax benefit associated with the reduction of the same indemnification asset and $9 million of net noncash benefits described above. Diluted earnings per common share rose $0.26, or 1%, from 2014. See Non-GAAP Financial Measures for further information on as adjusted items. For further discussion of BlackRock’s revenue, expense, nonoperating results and income tax expense, see Discussion of Financial Results herein. Non-GAAP Financial Measures BlackRock reports its financial results in accordance with GAAP; however, management believes evaluating the Company’s ongoing operating results may be enhanced if investors have additional non-GAAP financial measures. Management reviews non-GAAP financial measures to assess ongoing operations and, for the reasons described below, considers them to be effective indicators, for both management and investors, of BlackRock’s financial performance over time. Management also uses non-GAAP financial measures as a benchmark to compare its performance with other companies and to enhance the comparability of this information for the reporting periods presented. Non-GAAP measures may pose limitations because they do not include all of BlackRock’s revenue and expense. BlackRock’s management does not advocate that investors consider such non-GAAP financial measures in isolation from, or as a substitute for, financial information prepared in accordance with GAAP. Management uses both GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures in evaluating BlackRock’s financial performance. Adjustments to GAAP financial measures (“non-GAAP adjustments”) include certain items management deems nonrecurring or that occur infrequently, transactions that ultimately will not impact BlackRock’s book value or certain tax items that do not impact cash flow. 33 Computations for all periods are derived from the consolidated statements of income as follows: (1) Operating income, as adjusted, and operating margin, as adjusted: Management believes operating income, as adjusted, and operating margin, as adjusted, are effective indicators of BlackRock’s financial performance over time and, therefore, provide useful disclosure to investors. (in millions) 2016 2015 2014 Operating income, GAAP basis $ 4,570 $ 4,664 $ 4,474 Non-GAAP expense adjustments: Restructuring charge 76 — — PNC LTIP funding obligation 28 30 32 Compensation expense related to appreciation (depreciation) on deferred compensation plans — 1 7 Reduction of indemnification asset — — 50 Operating income, as adjusted 4,674 4,695 4,563 Product launch costs and commissions — 5 11 Operating income used for operating margin measurement $ 4,674 $ 4,700 $ 4,574 Revenue, GAAP basis $ 11,155 $ 11,401 $ 11,081 Non-GAAP adjustments: Distribution and servicing costs (429 ) (409 ) (364 ) Amortization of deferred sales commissions (34 ) (48 ) (56 ) Revenue used for operating margin measurement $ 10,692 $ 10,944 $ 10,661 Operating margin, GAAP basis 41.0 % 40.9 % 40.4 % Operating margin, as adjusted 43.7 % 42.9 % 42.9 % • Operating income, as adjusted, includes non-GAAP expense adjustments. The portion of compensation expense associated with certain long-term incentive plans (“LTIP”) funded, or to be funded, through share distributions to participants of BlackRock stock held by PNC has been excluded because it ultimately does not impact BlackRock’s book value. Compensation expense associated with appreciation (depreciation) on investments related to certain BlackRock deferred compensation plans has been excluded, as returns on investments set aside for these plans, which substantially offset this expense, are reported in nonoperating income (expense). In 2016, a restructuring charge primarily comprised of severance and accelerated amortization expense of previously granted deferred compensation awards has been excluded to provide more meaningful analysis of BlackRock’s ongoing operations and to ensure comparability among periods presented. In 2014, general and administration expense relating to the reduction of an indemnification asset has been excluded since it is directly offset by a tax benefit of the same amount and, consequently, does not impact BlackRock’s book value. • Operating income used for measuring operating margin, as adjusted, is equal to operating income, as adjusted, excluding the impact of product launch costs (e.g. closed-end fund launch costs) and related commissions. Management believes the exclusion of such costs and related commissions is useful because these costs can fluctuate considerably and revenue associated with the expenditure of these costs will not fully impact BlackRock’s results until future periods. Revenue used for operating margin, as adjusted, excludes distribution and servicing costs paid to related parties and other third parties. Management believes such costs represent a benchmark for the amount of revenue passed through to external parties who distribute the Company’s products. In addition, management believes the exclusion of such costs is useful because it creates consistency in the treatment for certain contracts for similar services, which due to the terms of the contracts, are accounted for under GAAP on a net basis within investment advisory, administration fees and securities lending revenue. Amortization of deferred sales commissions is excluded from revenue used for operating margin measurement, as adjusted, because such costs, over time, substantially offset distribution fee revenue the Company earns. For each of these items, BlackRock excludes from revenue used for operating margin, as adjusted, the costs related to each of these items as a proxy for such offsetting revenue. (2) Nonoperating income (expense), less net income (loss) attributable to NCI, as adjusted: Nonoperating income (expense), less net income (loss) attributable to NCI, as adjusted, equals nonoperating income (expense), GAAP basis, less net income (loss) attributable to NCI, adjusted for compensation expense associated with (appreciation) depreciation on investments related to certain BlackRock deferred compensation plans. The compensation expense offset is recorded in operating income. This compensation expense has been included in nonoperating income (expense), less net income (loss) attributable to NCI, as adjusted, to offset returns on investments set aside for these plans, which are reported in nonoperating income (expense), GAAP basis. Management believes nonoperating income (expense), less net income (loss) attributable to NCI, as adjusted, provides comparability of information among reporting periods and is an effective measure for reviewing BlackRock’s nonoperating contribution to results.

Net income attributable to BlackRock, Inc., as adjusted, equals net income attributable to BlackRock, Inc., GAAP basis, adjusted for significant nonrecurring items, charges that ultimately will not impact BlackRock’s book value or certain tax items that do not impact cash flow. See aforementioned discussion regarding operating income, as adjusted, and operating margin, as adjusted, for information on the PNC LTIP funding obligation and the restructuring charge. For each period presented, the non-GAAP adjustment related to the restructuring charge and PNC LTIP funding obligation was tax effected at the respective blended rates applicable to the adjustments. Amounts for income tax matters represent net noncash (benefits) expense primarily associated with the revaluation of certain deferred tax liabilities related to intangible assets and goodwill. Amounts have been excluded from the as adjusted results as these items will not have a cash flow impact and to ensure comparability among periods presented. Per share amounts reflect net income attributable to BlackRock, as adjusted divided by diluted weighted average common shares outstanding. (4) Nonvoting participating preferred stock is considered to be a common stock equivalent for purposes of determining basic and diluted earnings per share calculations. 35 Assets Under Management AUM for reporting purposes generally is based upon how investment advisory and administration fees are calculated for each portfolio. Net asset values, total assets, committed assets or other measures may be used to determine portfolio AUM.

AUM increased $502.4 billion to $5.1 trillion at December 31, 2016 from $4.6 trillion at December 31, 2015 driven by net market appreciation, positive net inflows and AUM acquired in the BofA Global Capital Management transaction, partially offset by the impact of foreign exchange movements. Net market appreciation of $326.4 billion was driven by $219.0 billion from equity products, $82.8 billion from fixed income products and $22.5 billion from multi-asset products across the majority of strategies. AUM decreased $106.8 billion due to the impact of foreign exchange movements, primarily resulting from the strengthening of the U.S. dollar, largely against the British pound and the Euro.

(3) Average AUM is calculated as the average of the month-end spot AUM amounts for the trailing thirteen months. (4) Advisory AUM represents long-term portfolio liquidation assignments. AUM decreased $6.5 billion to $4.645 trillion at December 31, 2015 from $4.652 trillion at December 31, 2014 driven largely by foreign exchange movements and net market depreciation that more than offset organic growth. Net market depreciation of $57.5 billion was driven by $35.3 billion from equity products due to lower U.S. and global equity markets and $12.1 billion from fixed income products. AUM decreased $101.1 billion due to the impact of foreign exchange movements, primarily resulting from the strengthening of the U.S. dollar against the Euro, the British pound and the Canadian dollar. Discussion of Financial Results Introduction BlackRock derives a substantial portion of its revenue from investment advisory and administration fees, which are recognized as the services are performed. Such fees are primarily based on predetermined percentages of the market value of AUM or percentages of committed capital during investment periods of certain alternative products and are affected by changes in AUM, including market appreciation or depreciation, foreign exchange translation and net inflows or outflows. Net inflows or outflows represent the sum of new client assets, additional fundings 39 from existing clients (including dividend reinvestment), withdrawals of assets from, and termination of, client accounts and distributions to investors representing return of capital and return on investments to investors. Market appreciation or depreciation includes current income earned on, and changes in the fair value of, securities held in client accounts. Foreign exchange translation reflects the impact of translating non-U.S. dollar denominated AUM into U.S. dollars for reporting purposes. BlackRock also earns revenue by lending securities on behalf of clients to highly rated banks and broker-dealers. The securities loaned are secured by collateral in the form of cash or securities, with minimum collateral generally ranging from approximately 102% to 112% of the value of the loaned securities. Generally, the revenue earned is shared between BlackRock and the funds or accounts managed by the Company from which the securities are borrowed. Historically, securities lending revenue in the second quarter exceeds revenue in the other quarters during the year driven by higher seasonal demand. Investment advisory agreements for certain separate accounts and investment funds provide for performance fees based upon relative and/or absolute investment performance, in addition to base fees based on AUM. Investment advisory performance fees generally are earned after a given period of time and when investment performance exceeds a contractual threshold. As such, the timing of recognition of performance fees may increase the volatility of BlackRock’s revenue and earnings. The magnitude of performance fees can fluctuate quarterly due to the timing of carried interest recognition on alternative products; however, the third and fourth quarters have a greater number of nonalternative products with performance measurement periods that end on either September 30 or December 31. BlackRock provides a variety of risk management, investment analytic and investment system and advisory services to financial institutions, pension funds, asset managers, foundations, consultants, mutual fund sponsors, real estate investment trusts, government agencies and retail intermediaries. These services are provided under the brand name BlackRock Solutions and include a wide array of risk management services, valuation services related to illiquid securities, disposition and workout assignments (including long-term portfolio liquidation assignments), strategic planning and execution, enterprise investment system outsourcing and wealth management technology services to clients. The Company’s Aladdin operating platform serves as the investment/risk solutions system for BlackRock and other institutional investors. Fees earned for BlackRock Solutions and advisory services are determined using some, or all, of the following methods: (i) percentages of various attributes of advisory AUM or value of positions on the Aladdin platform, (ii) fixed-rate fees and (iii) fees billed on a time and materials basis. BlackRock builds upon its leadership position to meet the growing need for investment and risk management solutions. Through its scale and diversity of products, it is able to provide its clients with customized solutions including fiduciary outsourcing for liability-driven investments and overlay strategies for pension plan sponsors, balance sheet management and related services for insurance companies and target date and target return funds, as well as asset allocation portfolios, for retail investors. BlackRock is also able to service these clients via its Aladdin platform to provide risk management and other outsourcing services for institutional investors and custom and tailored solutions to address complex risk exposures. The Company earns fees for transition management services primarily comprised of commissions from acting as a broker-dealer in connection with buying and selling securities on behalf of its customers. Commissions related to transition management services are recorded on a trade-date basis as securities transactions occur. The Company also earns revenue related to certain strategic investments accounted for as equity method investments. Operating expense reflects employee compensation and benefits, distribution and servicing costs, amortization of deferred sales commissions, direct fund expense, general and administration expense and amortization of finite-lived intangible assets. • Employee compensation and benefits expense includes salaries, commissions, temporary help, deferred and incentive compensation, employer payroll taxes, severance and related benefit costs. • Distribution and servicing costs, which are primarily AUM driven, include payments made to third parties, primarily associated with obtaining and retaining client investments in certain BlackRock products. • Direct fund expense primarily consists of third-party nonadvisory expense incurred by BlackRock related to certain funds for the use of index trademarks, reference data for indices, custodial services, fund administration, fund accounting, transfer agent services, shareholder reporting services, legal expense, and audit and tax services as well as other fund-related expense directly attributable to the nonadvisory operations of the fund. These expenses may vary over time with fluctuations in AUM, number of shareholder accounts, or other attributes directly related to volume of business. General and administration expense includes marketing and promotional, occupancy and office-related costs, portfolio services (including clearing expense related to transition management services), technology, professional services, communications, product launch costs and other general and administration expense, including the impact of foreign currency remeasurement. Foreign currency remeasurement (gains) losses were $(6) million, $(8) million and $(11) million for 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively. Approximately 75% of the Company’s revenue is generated in U.S. dollars. The Company’s revenue and expense generated in foreign currencies (primarily the Euro and British pound) are impacted by foreign exchange rates. Any effect of foreign exchange rate change on revenue is partially offset by a change in expense driven by the Company’s considerable non-dollar expense base related to its operations outside the United States. Nonoperating income (expense) includes the effect of changes in the valuations on investments (excluding available-for-sale investments) and earnings on equity method investments as well as interest and dividend income and interest expense. Other comprehensive income includes changes in valuations related to available-for-sale investments. BlackRock primarily holds seed and co-investments in sponsored investment products that invest in a variety of asset classes, including private equity, hedge funds and real assets. Investments generally are made for co-investment purposes, to establish a performance track record or for regulatory purposes, including Federal Reserve Bank stock. BlackRock does not engage in proprietary trading activities that could conflict with the interests of its clients. In addition, nonoperating income (expense) includes the impact of changes in the valuations of consolidated sponsored investment funds. The portion of nonoperating income (expense) not attributable to BlackRock is allocated to NCI on the consolidated statements of income. 40 Revenue The following table presents the Company’s revenue for 2016, 2015 and 2014.

Investment advisory, administration fees and securities lending revenue of $9,880 million for 2016 increased $40 million from $9,840 million in 2015 reflecting the impact of organic growth and higher markets on average AUM, the effect of AUM acquired in the BofA Global Capital Management transaction and lower yield-related fee waivers on certain money market funds, partially offset by the impact of divergent beta and mix shift, and the impact of foreign exchange movements. Securities lending revenue increased $66 million from 2015 to $579 million in 2016, primarily reflecting an increase in average balances of securities on loan and higher spreads. Investment advisory performance fees were $295 million in 2016 compared with $621 million in 2015. The decrease was primarily driven by lower fees from equity and alternative products, including the impact of the strong performance from a single hedge fund with an annual performance measurement period that ended in the third quarter of 2015. BlackRock Solutions and advisory revenue in 2016 totaled $714 million compared with $646 million in 2015. The current year reflected higher revenue from Aladdin mandates. BlackRock Solutions and advisory revenue included $595 million in Aladdin revenue compared with $528 million in 2015. 2015 Compared with 2014 Revenue increased $320 million, or 3%, from 2014, driven by higher base fees and growth in performance fees. Investment advisory, administration fees and securities lending revenue of $9,840 million for 2015 increased $251 million from $9,589 million in 2014 primarily driven by organic growth, despite the impact of foreign exchange and market volatility. Securities lending revenue increased $36 million from 2014 to $513 million in 2015, reflecting an increase in average balances of securities on loan. Investment advisory performance fees were $621 million in 2015 compared with $550 million in 2014. The increase from 2014 reflected higher fees from equity products and strong performance from a single hedge fund. Investment advisory performance fees in 2014 reflected a large fee associated with the liquidation of a closed-end mortgage fund. BlackRock Solutions and advisory revenue in 2015 totaled $646 million compared with $635 million in 2014. The increase from 2014 reflected higher revenue from Aladdin mandates and lower revenue from disposition-related advisory assignments. BlackRock Solutions and advisory revenue included $528 million in Aladdin revenue compared with $474 million in 2014. 42 Expense The following table presents the Company’s expense for 2016, 2015 and 2014.

Expense decreased $152 million, or 2%, from 2015, reflecting lower compensation and benefits expense, expense discipline and lower amortization of intangible assets, partially offset by a restructuring charge recorded in 2016. Employee compensation and benefits expense decreased $125 million, or 3%, to $3,880 million in 2016 from $4,005 million in 2015, reflecting lower incentive compensation, primarily driven by lower performance fees. Distribution and servicing costs totaled $429 million in 2016 compared with $409 million in 2015. General and administration expense decreased $79 million from 2015, reflecting expense discipline and the impact of higher transaction-related expense recorded in 2015. Restructuring charge of $76 million, primarily comprised of severance and accelerated amortization expense of previously granted deferred compensation awards, was recorded in 2016 in connection with a project to streamline and simplify the organization. Amortization of intangible assets expense decreased $29 million, or 23%, to $99 million in 2016 from $128 million in 2015, primarily reflecting certain finite-lived intangible assets becoming fully amortized. As Adjusted. Expense, as adjusted, decreased $225 million, or 3%, to $6,481 million in 2016 from $6,706 million in 2015. The decrease in total expense, as adjusted, is primarily attributable to lower employee compensation and benefits expense, expense discipline and lower amortization of intangible assets. The restructuring charge has been excluded from the as adjusted results. 2015 Compared with 2014 GAAP. Expense increased $130 million, or 2%, from 2014, primarily reflecting higher revenue-related expense, including compensation and benefits expense, and distribution and servicing costs, partially offset by lower general and administration expense and amortization of intangible assets. Expense for 2014 included an expense related to a $50 million reduction of an indemnification asset. 43 Employee compensation and benefits expense increased $176 million, or 5%, to $4,005 million in 2015 from $3,829 million in 2014, reflecting higher headcount, and higher incentive and deferred compensation, partially offset by the impact of foreign exchange movements. Employees at December 31, 2015 totaled approximately 13,000 compared with approximately 12,200 at December 31, 2014. Distribution and servicing costs totaled $409 million in 2015 compared with $364 million in 2014. General and administration expense decreased $73 million from 2014, primarily reflecting the previously mentioned $50 million reduction of an indemnification asset, lower marketing and promotional expense, and lower legal and regulatory expense, partially offset by the impact of transaction-related expense. Amortization of intangible assets expense decreased $29 million, or 18%, to $128 million in 2015 from $157 million in 2014, reflecting certain finite-lived intangible assets becoming fully amortized. As Adjusted. Expense, as adjusted, increased $188 million, or 3%, to $6,706 million in 2015 from $6,518 million in 2014. The increase in total expense, as adjusted, is primarily attributable to higher revenue-related expense, including compensation and benefits expense and distribution and servicing costs, partially offset by lower amortization of intangible assets and lower general and administration expense. Amounts related to the reduction of the indemnification asset in 2014 have been excluded from as adjusted results. Nonoperating Results Nonoperating income (expense), less net income (loss) attributable to NCI for 2016, 2015 and 2014 was as follows: (in millions) 2016 2015 2014 Nonoperating income (expense), GAAP basis(1) $ (110 ) $ (62 ) $ (79 ) Less: Net income (loss) attributable to NCI (2 ) 7 (30 ) Nonoperating income (expense)(2) (108 ) (69 ) (49 ) Compensation expense related to (appreciation) depreciation on deferred compensation plans — (1 ) (7 ) Nonoperating income (expense), as adjusted(2) $ (108 ) $ (70 ) $ (56 ) (1) Amounts included a gain of $16 million, a gain of $58 million and a loss of $41 million attributable to consolidated variable interest entities (“VIEs”) for 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively.

Amounts for 2016 and 2015 also include net gain (loss) on consolidated VIEs. (2) Amounts primarily include net gains (losses) related to direct hedge fund strategies and hedge fund solutions. The prior year periods also included net gains related to opportunistic credit strategies. (3) Amounts include net gains (losses) related to equity and fixed income investments, and BlackRock’s seed capital hedging program. (4) The amount for 2015 primarily includes a gain related to the acquisition of certain assets of BKCA. 2016 Compared with 2015 Net gains on investments of $57 million in 2016 decreased $52 million from 2015 due to lower net gains in 2016. Net gains on investments in 2015 included a $40 million gain related to the BKCA acquisition and a $35 million unrealized gain on a private equity investment. Interest and dividend income increased $14 million from 2015 primarily due to higher dividend income in 2016. 44 2015 Compared with 2014 Net gains on investments of $109 million in 2015 decreased $45 million from 2014 due to lower net gains in 2015. Net gains on investments in 2015 included a $40 million gain related to the BKCA acquisition and a $35 million unrealized gain on a private equity investment. Net gains on investments in 2014 included the positive impact of the monetization of a nonstrategic, opportunistic private equity investment. Interest expense decreased $28 million from 2014 primarily due to repayments of long-term borrowings in the fourth quarter of 2014. Income Tax Expense GAAP As adjusted (in millions) 2016 2015 2014 2016 2015 2014 Operating income(1) $ 4,570 $ 4,664 $ 4,474 $ 4,674 $ 4,695 $ 4,563 Total nonoperating income (expense)(1),(2) (108 ) (69 ) (49 ) (108 ) (70 ) (56 ) Income before income taxes(2) $ 4,462 $ 4,595 $ 4,425 $ 4,566 $ 4,625 $ 4,507 Income tax expense $ 1,290 $ 1,250 $ 1,131 $ 1,352 $ 1,312 $ 1,197 Effective tax rate 28.9 % 27.2 % 25.6 % 29.6 % 28.4 % 26.6 % (1) See Non-GAAP Financial Measures for further information on and reconciliation of as adjusted items. (2) Net of net income (loss) attributable to NCI. The Company’s tax rate is affected by tax rates in foreign jurisdictions and the relative amount of income earned in those jurisdictions, which the Company expects to be fairly consistent in the near term. The significant foreign jurisdictions that have lower statutory tax rates than the U.S. federal statutory rate of 35% include the United Kingdom, Channel Islands, Ireland and Canada. U.S. income taxes were not provided for certain undistributed foreign earnings intended to be indefinitely reinvested outside the United States. 2016. Income tax expense (GAAP) reflected: o a net noncash benefit of $30 million, primarily associated with the revaluation of certain deferred income tax liabilities; and o a benefit from $65 million of nonrecurring items, including the resolution of certain outstanding tax matters. The as adjusted effective tax rate of 29.6% for 2016 excluded the net noncash benefit of $30 million mentioned above, as it will not have a cash flow impact and to ensure comparability among periods presented. 2015. Income tax expense (GAAP) reflected: o a net noncash benefit of $54 million, primarily associated with the revaluation of certain deferred income tax liabilities; and o a benefit from $75 million of nonrecurring items, primarily due to the realization of losses from changes in the Company’s organizational tax structure and the resolution of certain outstanding tax matters. The as adjusted effective tax rate of 28.4% for 2015 excluded the net noncash benefit of $54 million mentioned above, as it will not have a cash flow impact and to ensure comparability among periods presented. 2014. Income tax expense (GAAP) reflected: o a $94 million tax benefit, primarily due to the resolution of certain outstanding tax matters related to the acquisition of BGI, including the previously mentioned $50 million tax benefit (see Executive Summary for more information); o a $73 million net tax benefit related to several favorable nonrecurring items; and o a net noncash benefit of $9 million associated with the revaluation of deferred income tax liabilities. The as adjusted effective tax rate of 26.6% for 2014 excluded the $9 million net noncash benefit as it will not have a cash flow impact and to ensure comparability among periods presented and the $50 million tax benefit mentioned above. The $50 million general and administrative expense and $50 million tax benefit have been excluded from as adjusted results as there is no impact on BlackRock’s book value. Balance Sheet Overview As Adjusted Balance Sheet The following table presents a reconciliation of the consolidated statement of financial condition presented on a GAAP basis to the consolidated statement of financial condition, excluding the impact of separate account assets and separate account collateral held under securities lending agreements (directly related to lending separate account securities) and separate account liabilities and separate account collateral liabilities under securities lending agreements and consolidated sponsored investment funds, including consolidated VIEs. The Company presents the as adjusted balance sheet as additional information to enable investors to exclude certain assets that have equal and offsetting liabilities or noncontrolling interests that ultimately do not have an impact on stockholders’ equity or cash flows. Management views the as adjusted balance sheet, a non-GAAP financial measure, as an economic presentation of the Company’s total assets and liabilities; however, it does not advocate that investors consider such non-GAAP financial measures in isolation from, or as a substitute for, financial information prepared in accordance with GAAP. 45 Separate Account Assets and Liabilities and Separate Account Collateral Held under Securities Lending Agreements Separate account assets are maintained by BlackRock Life Limited, a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company that is a registered life insurance company in the United Kingdom, and represent segregated assets held for purposes of funding individual and group pension contracts. The Company records equal and offsetting separate account liabilities. The separate account assets are not available to creditors of the Company and the holders of the pension contracts have no recourse to the Company’s assets. The net investment income attributable to separate account assets accrues directly to the contract owners and is not reported on the Company’s consolidated statements of income. While BlackRock has no economic interest in these assets or liabilities, BlackRock earns an investment advisory fee for the service of managing these assets on behalf of its clients. In addition, the Company records on its consolidated statements of financial condition the separate account collateral received under BlackRock Life Limited securities lending arrangements as its own asset in addition to an equal and offsetting separate account collateral liability for the obligation to return the collateral. The collateral is not available to creditors of the Company, and the borrowers under the securities lending arrangements have no recourse to the Company’s assets. Consolidated Sponsored Investment Funds The Company consolidates certain sponsored investment funds accounted for as voting rights entities (“VREs”) and VIEs, (collectively, “Consolidated Sponsored Investment Funds”). See Note 2, Significant Accounting Policies, in the notes to the consolidated financial statements contained in Part II, Item 8 of this filing for more information on the Company’s consolidation policy. The Company cannot readily access cash and cash equivalents or other assets held by Consolidated Sponsored Investment Funds to use in its operating activities. In addition, the Company cannot readily sell investments held by Consolidated Sponsored Investment Funds in order to obtain cash for use in the Company’s operations.

(2) Amounts represent the portion of assets and liabilities of Consolidated Sponsored Investment Funds attributable to NCI. (3) Amounts include property and equipment and other assets. (4) Amount includes approximately $5.6 billion of deferred income tax liabilities related to goodwill and intangibles. See Note 21, Income Taxes, in the notes to the consolidated financial statements contained in Part II, Item 8 of this filing for more information. The following discussion summarizes the significant changes in assets and liabilities on a GAAP basis. Please see the consolidated statements of financial condition as of December 31, 2016 and 2015 contained in Part II, Item 8 of this filing. The discussion does not include changes related to assets and liabilities that are equal and offsetting and have no impact on BlackRock’s stockholders’ equity. Assets. Cash and cash equivalents at December 31, 2016 and 2015 included $53 million and $100 million, respectively, of cash held by consolidated VREs (see Liquidity and Capital Resources for details on the change in cash and cash equivalents during 2016). 46 Accounts receivable at December 31, 2016 increased $113 million from December 31, 2015 primarily due to higher alternative products and BlackRock Solutions receivables and an increase in unit trust receivables (substantially offset by an increase in unit trust payables recorded within accounts payable and accrued liabilities), partially offset by lower securities lending receivables. Investments were $1,595 million at December 31, 2016 (for more information see Investments herein). Goodwill and intangible assets decreased $14 million from December 31, 2015, primarily due to $99 million of amortization of intangible assets, partially offset by intangible assets and goodwill acquired from the BofA Global Capital Management transaction. Other assets (including property and equipment) increased $188 million from December 31, 2015, primarily related to an increase in earnings from certain strategic investments and current taxes receivable. Liabilities. Accrued compensation and benefits at December 31, 2016 decreased $91 million from December 31, 2015, primarily due to lower 2016 incentive compensation accruals. Accounts payable and accrued liabilities at December 31, 2016 increased $26 million from December 31, 2015 due to higher unit trust payables (substantially offset by an increase in unit trust receivables recorded within accounts receivable). Net deferred income tax liabilities at December 31, 2016 decreased $11 million, primarily as a result of revaluation of certain deferred income tax liabilities due to the tax legislation enacted in the United Kingdom and the effects of temporary differences associated with stock compensation, and unrealized investment losses. Investments and Investments of Consolidated VIEs The Company’s investments and investments of consolidated VIEs (collectively, “Total Investments”) were $1,595 million and $1,008 million, respectively, at December 31, 2016. Total Investments include consolidated investments held by sponsored investment funds accounted for as VREs and VIEs. Management reviews BlackRock’s Total Investments on an “economic” basis, which eliminates the portion of Total Investments that does not impact BlackRock’s book value or net income attributable to BlackRock. BlackRock’s management does not advocate that investors consider such non-GAAP financial measures in isolation from, or as a substitute for, financial information prepared in accordance with GAAP. The Company presents Total Investments, as adjusted, to enable investors to understand the portion of Total Investments that is owned by the Company, net of NCI, as a gauge to measure the impact of changes in net nonoperating income (expense) on investments to net income (loss) attributable to BlackRock. The Company further presents net “economic” investment exposure, net of deferred compensation investments and hedged investments, to reflect another gauge for investors. The economic impact of Total Investments held pursuant to deferred compensation arrangements is offset by a change in compensation expense. The impact of certain investments is substantially mitigated by swap hedges. Carried interest capital allocations are excluded as there is no impact to BlackRock’s stockholders’ equity until such amounts are realized as performance fees. Finally, the Company’s regulatory investment in Federal Reserve Bank stock, which is not subject to market or interest rate risk, is excluded from the Company’s net economic investment exposure. (in millions) December 31, 2016 December 31, 2015 Investments, GAAP $ 1,595 $ 1,578 Investments held by consolidated VIEs, GAAP 1,008 1,030 Total Investments 2,603 2,608 Investments held by consolidated VREs (465 ) (700 ) Investments held by consolidated VIEs (1,008 ) (1,030 ) Net interest in consolidated VREs 444 616 Net interest in consolidated VIEs(1) 840 733 Total Investments, as adjusted 2,414 2,227 Federal Reserve Bank stock (89 ) (93 ) Deferred compensation investments (66 ) (79 ) Hedged investments (614 ) (407 ) Carried interest (VIEs/VREs) (126 ) (100 ) Total “economic” investment exposure $ 1,519 $ 1,548 (1) Amount includes $108 million and $81 million of carried interest (VIEs) as of December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively, which has no impact on the Company’s “economic” investment exposure. The following table represents the carrying value of the Company’s economic investment exposure, by asset type, at December 31, 2016 and 2015: (in millions) December 31, 2016 December 31, 2015 Private equity $ 334 $ 375 Real assets 94 104 Other alternatives(1) 245 227 Other investments(2) 846 842 Total “economic” investment exposure $ 1,519 $ 1,548 (1) Other alternatives include distressed credit/mortgage funds/opportunistic funds and hedge funds/funds of hedge funds. (2) Other investments primarily include seed investments in fixed income, equity and multi-asset mutual funds/strategies as well as U.K. government securities, primarily held for regulatory purposes. 47 As adjusted investment activity for 2016 was as follows: (in millions) Total Investments, as adjusted, December 31, 2015 $ 2,227 Purchases/capital contributions 1,234 Sales/maturities (976 ) Distributions (1) (134 ) Market appreciation(depreciation)/earnings from equity method investments 82 Carried interest capital allocations/distributions received 26 Other (45 ) Total Investments, as adjusted, December 31, 2016 $ 2,414 (1) Amount includes distributions representing return of capital and return on investments. LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES BlackRock Cash Flows Excluding the Impact of Consolidated Sponsored Investment Funds The consolidated statements of cash flows include the cash flows of the Consolidated Sponsored Investment Funds. The Company uses an adjusted cash flow statement, which excludes the impact of Consolidated Sponsored Investment Funds, as a supplemental non-GAAP measure to assess liquidity and capital requirements. The Company believes that its cash flows, excluding the impact of the Consolidated Sponsored Investment Funds, provide investors with useful information on the cash flows of BlackRock relating to its ability to fund additional operating, investing and financing activities. BlackRock’s management does not advocate that investors consider such non-GAAP measures in isolation from, or as a substitute for, its cash flows presented in accordance with GAAP. The following table presents a reconciliation of the consolidated statements of cash flows presented on a GAAP basis to the consolidated statements of cash flows, excluding the impact of the cash flows of Consolidated Sponsored Investment Funds: (in millions) GAAP Basis Impact on Cash Flows of Consolidated Sponsored Investment Funds Cash Flows Excluding Impact of Consolidated Sponsored Investment Funds Cash and cash equivalents, December 31, 2014 $ 5,723 $ 120 $ 5,603 Cash flows from operating activities 3,004 (348 ) 3,352 Cash flows from investing activities (465 ) (156 ) (309 ) Cash flows from financing activities (2,064 ) 484 (2,548 ) Effect of exchange rate changes on cash and cash equivalents (115 ) — (115 ) Net change in cash and cash equivalents 360 (20 ) 380 Cash and cash equivalents, December 31, 2015 $ 6,083 $ 100 $ 5,983 Cash flows from operating activities 2,154 (1,063 ) 3,217 Cash flows from investing activities (188 ) (130 ) (58 ) Cash flows from financing activities (1,685 ) 1,146 (2,831 ) Effect of exchange rate changes on cash and cash equivalents (273 ) — (273 ) Net change in cash and cash equivalents 8 (47 ) 55 Cash and cash equivalents, December 31, 2016 $ 6,091 $ 53 $ 6,038 Sources of BlackRock’s operating cash primarily include investment advisory, administration fees and securities lending revenue, performance fees, revenue from BlackRock Solutions and advisory products and services, other revenue and distribution fees. BlackRock uses its cash to pay all operating expense, interest and principal on borrowings, income taxes, dividends on BlackRock’s capital stock, repurchases of the Company’s stock, capital expenditures and purchases of co-investments and seed investments. For details of the Company’s GAAP cash flows from operating, investing and financing activities, see the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows contained in Part II, Item 8 of this filing. Cash flows from operating activities, excluding the impact of Consolidated Sponsored Investment Funds, primarily include the receipt of investment advisory and administration fees, securities lending revenue and performance fees offset by the payment of operating expenses incurred in the normal course of business, including year-end incentive compensation accrued for in the prior year. Cash outflows from investing activities, excluding the impact of Consolidated Sponsored Investment Funds, for 2016 were $58 million and primarily reflected $384 million of investment purchases, $119 million of purchases of property and equipment and $30 million related to an acquisition, partially offset by $441 million of net proceeds from sales and maturities of certain investments. Cash outflows from financing activities, excluding the impact of Consolidated Sponsored Investment Funds, for 2016 were $2,831 million, primarily resulting from $1.4 billion of share repurchases, including $1.1 billion in open market-transactions and $274 million of employee tax withholdings related to employee stock transactions and $1.5 billion of cash dividend payments, partially offset by $82 million of excess tax benefits from vested stock-based compensation awards. 48 The Company manages its financial condition and funding to maintain appropriate liquidity for the business. Liquidity resources at December 31, 2016 and 2015 were as follows: (in millions) December 31, 2016 December 31, 2015 Cash and cash equivalents(1) $ 6,091 $ 6,083 Cash and cash equivalents held by consolidated VREs(2) (53 ) (100 ) Subtotal 6,038 5,983 Credit facility — undrawn 4,000 4,000 Total liquidity resources(3) $ 10,038 $ 9,983 (1) The percentage of cash and cash equivalents held by the Company’s U.S. subsidiaries was approximately 50% at both December 31, 2016 and 2015. See Net Capital Requirements herein for more information on net capital requirements in certain regulated subsidiaries. (2) The Company cannot readily access such cash to use in its operating activities. (3) Amounts do not reflect year-end incentive compensation accruals of approximately $1.3 billion and $1.5 billion for 2016 and 2015, respectively, which were paid in the first quarter of the following year. Total liquidity resources increased $55 million during 2016, primarily reflecting cash flows from operating activities, partially offset by cash payments of 2015 year-end incentive awards, share repurchases of $1.4 billion and cash dividend payments of $1.5 billion. A significant portion of the Company’s $2,414 million of Total Investments, as adjusted, is illiquid in nature and, as such, cannot be readily convertible to cash. Share Repurchases. The Company repurchased 3.3 million common shares in open market-transactions under its share repurchase program for $1.1 billion during 2016. At December 31, 2016, there were 3 million shares still authorized to be repurchased. In January 2017, the Board of Directors approved an increase in the shares that may be repurchased under the Company’s existing share repurchase program to allow for the repurchase of an additional 6 million shares for a total up to 9 million shares of BlackRock common stock. Net Capital Requirements. The Company is required to maintain net capital in certain regulated subsidiaries within a number of jurisdictions, which is partially maintained by retaining cash and cash equivalent investments in those subsidiaries or jurisdictions. As a result, such subsidiaries of the Company may be restricted in their ability to transfer cash between different jurisdictions and to their parents. Additionally, transfers of cash between international jurisdictions, including repatriation to the United States, may have adverse tax consequences that could discourage such transfers. BlackRock Institutional Trust Company, N.A. (“BTC”) is chartered as a national bank that does not accept client deposits and whose powers are limited to trust and other fiduciary activities. BTC provides investment management services, including investment advisory and securities lending agency services, to institutional investors and other clients. BTC is subject to regulatory capital and liquid asset requirements administered by the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency. At December 31, 2016 and 2015, the Company was required to maintain approximately $1.4 billion and $1.1 billion, respectively, in net capital in certain regulated subsidiaries, including BTC, entities regulated by the Financial Conduct Authority and Prudential Regulation Authority in the United Kingdom, and the Company’s broker-dealers. The Company was in compliance with all applicable regulatory net capital requirements. Undistributed Earnings of Foreign Subsidiaries. As of December 31, 2016, the Company has not provided for U.S. federal and state income taxes on approximately $5.3 billion of undistributed earnings of its foreign subsidiaries. Such earnings are considered indefinitely reinvested outside the United States. The Company’s current plans do not demonstrate a need to repatriate these funds. Short-Term Borrowings 2016 Revolving Credit Facility. The Company’s credit facility has an aggregate commitment amount of $4.0 billion and was amended in April 2016 to extend the maturity date to March 2021 (the “2016 credit facility”). The 2016 credit facility permits the Company to request up to an additional $1.0 billion of borrowing capacity, subject to lender credit approval, increasing the overall size of the 2016 credit facility to an aggregate principal amount not to exceed $5.0 billion. Interest on borrowings outstanding accrues at a rate based on the applicable London Interbank Offered Rate plus a spread. The 2016 credit facility requires the Company not to exceed a maximum leverage ratio (ratio of net debt to earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, where net debt equals total debt less unrestricted cash) of 3 to 1, which was satisfied with a ratio of less than 1 to 1 at December 31, 2016. The 2016 credit facility provides back-up liquidity to fund ongoing working capital for general corporate purposes and various investment opportunities. At December 31, 2016, the Company had no amount outstanding under the 2016 credit facility. Commercial Paper Program. The Company can issue unsecured commercial paper notes (the “CP Notes”) on a private-placement basis up to a maximum aggregate amount outstanding at any time of $4.0 billion. The commercial paper program is currently supported by the 2016 credit facility. At December 31, 2016, BlackRock had no CP Notes outstanding. 49 Long-Term Borrowings. The carrying value of long-term borrowings at December 31, 2016 included the following: (in millions) Maturity Amount Carrying Value Maturity 6.25% Notes $ 700 $ 700 September 2017 5.00% Notes 1,000 997 December 2019 4.25% Notes 750 746 May 2021 3.375% Notes 750 746 June 2022 3.50% Notes 1,000 994 March 2024 1.25% Notes 738 732 May 2025 Total Long-term Borrowings $ 4,938 $ 4,915 For more information on Company’s borrowings, see Note 12, Borrowings, in the notes to the consolidated financial statements contained in Part II, Item 8 of this filing. Contractual Obligations, Commitments and Contingencies The following table sets forth contractual obligations, commitments and contingencies by year of payment at December 31, 2016: (in millions) 2017 2018 2019 2020 2021 Thereafter Total Contractual obligations and commitments: Long-term borrowings: Principal $ 700 $ — $ 1,000 $ — $ 750 $ 2,488 $ 4,938 Interest 195 151 151 101 85 137 820 Operating leases 142 135 125 120 112 404 1,038 Purchase obligations 108 66 24 2 2 — 202 Investment commitments 192 — — — — — 192 Total contractual obligations and commitments 1,337 352 1,300 223 949 3,029 7,190 Contingent obligations: Contingent payments related to business acquisitions(1) 23 39 27 32 21 — 142 Total contractual obligations, commitments and contingent obligations(2) $ 1,360 $ 391 $ 1,327 $ 255 $ 970 $ 3,029 $ 7,332 (1) The amount of contingent payments reflected for any year represents the expected payments using foreign currency exchange rates as of December 31, 2016. The fair value of the remaining aggregate contingent payments at December 31, 2016 totaled $115 million and is included in other liabilities on the consolidated statement of financial condition. (2) At December 31, 2016, the Company had approximately $321 million of net unrecognized tax benefits. Due to the uncertainty of timing and amounts that will ultimately be paid, this amount has been excluded from the table above. Operating Leases. The Company leases its primary office locations under agreements that expire on varying dates through 2035. In connection with certain lease agreements, the Company is responsible for escalation payments. The contractual obligations table above includes only guaranteed minimum lease payments for such leases and does not project potential escalation or other lease-related payments. These leases are classified as operating leases and, as such, are not recorded as liabilities on the consolidated statements of financial condition. Purchase Obligations. In the ordinary course of business, BlackRock enters into contracts or purchase obligations with third parties whereby the third parties provide services to or on behalf of BlackRock. Purchase obligations included in the contractual obligations table above represent executory contracts, which are either noncancelable or cancelable with a penalty. At December 31, 2016, the Company’s obligations primarily reflected standard service contracts for portfolio services, market data, office-related services and third-party marketing and promotional services, and obligations for equipment. Purchase obligations are recorded on the consolidated financial statements when services are provided and, as such, obligations for services and equipment not received are not included in the consolidated statement of financial condition at December 31, 2016. Investment Commitments. At December 31, 2016, the Company had $192 million of various capital commitments to fund sponsored investment funds, including consolidated VIEs. These funds include private equity funds, real assets and opportunistic funds. This amount excludes additional commitments made by consolidated funds of funds to underlying third-party funds as third-party noncontrolling interest holders have the legal obligation to fund the respective commitments of such funds of funds. In addition to the capital commitments of $192 million, the Company had approximately $12 million of contingent commitments for certain funds which have investment periods that have expired. Generally, the timing of the funding of these commitments is unknown and the commitments are callable on demand at any time prior to the expiration of the commitment. These unfunded commitments are not recorded on the consolidated statements of financial condition. These commitments do not include potential future commitments approved by the Company that are not yet legally binding. The Company intends to make additional capital commitments from time to time to fund additional investment products for, and with, its clients. Contingent Payments Related to Business Acquisitions. In connection with certain acquisitions, BlackRock is required to make contingent payments, subject to achieving specified performance targets, which may include revenue related to acquired contracts or new capital commitments for certain products. The fair value of the remaining aggregate contingent payments at December 31, 2016 totaled $115 million and is included in other liabilities on the consolidated statement of financial condition. The following items have not been included in the contractual obligations, commitments and contingencies table: Carried Interest Clawback. As a general partner in certain investment funds, including private equity partnerships and certain hedge funds, the Company may receive carried interest cash distributions from the partnerships in accordance with distribution provisions of the partnership agreements. The Company may, from time to time, be required to return all or a portion of such distributions to the limited partners in the event the limited partners do not achieve a return as specified in the various partnership agreements. Therefore, BlackRock records carried interest 50 subject to such clawback provisions in Total Investments, or cash/cash of consolidated VIEs to the extent that it is distributed, and as a deferred carried interest liability/other liabilities of consolidated VIEs on its consolidated statements of financial condition. Carried interest is recorded as performance fees on BlackRock’s consolidated statements of income upon the earlier of the termination of the investment fund or when the likelihood of clawback is considered mathematically improbable. Indemnifications. In the ordinary course of business or in connection with certain acquisition agreements, BlackRock enters into contracts pursuant to which it may agree to indemnify third parties in certain circumstances. The terms of these indemnities vary from contract to contract and the amount of indemnification liability, if any, cannot be determined or the likelihood of any liability is considered remote and, therefore, has not been included in the table above or recorded in the consolidated statement of financial condition at December 31, 2016. See further discussion in Note 13, Commitments and Contingencies, in the notes to the consolidated financial statements contained in Part II, Item 8 of this filing. On behalf of certain clients, the Company lends securities to highly rated banks and broker-dealers. In these securities lending transactions, the borrower is required to provide and maintain collateral at or above regulatory minimums. Securities on loan are marked to market daily to determine if the borrower is required to pledge additional collateral. BlackRock has issued certain indemnifications to certain securities lending clients against potential loss resulting from a borrower’s failure to fulfill its obligations under the securities lending agreement should the value of the collateral pledged by the borrower at the time of default be insufficient to cover the borrower’s obligation under the securities lending agreement. At December 31, 2016, the Company indemnified certain of its clients for their securities lending loan balances of approximately $169.3 billion. The Company held, as agent, cash and securities totaling $180.1 billion as collateral for indemnified securities on loan at December 31, 2016. The fair value of these indemnifications was not material at December 31, 2016. While the collateral pledged by a borrower is intended to be sufficient to offset the borrower’s obligations to return securities borrowed and any other amounts owing to the lender under the relevant securities lending agreement, in the event of a borrower default, the Company can give no assurance that the collateral pledged by the borrower will be sufficient to fulfill such obligations. If the amount of such pledged collateral is not sufficient to fulfill such obligations to a client for whom the Company has provided indemnification, BlackRock would be responsible for the amount of the shortfall. These indemnifications cover only the collateral shortfall described above, and do not in any way guarantee, assume or otherwise insure the investment performance or return of any cash collateral vehicle into which securities lending cash collateral is invested. Compensation and Benefit Obligations. The Company has various compensation and benefit obligations, including bonuses, commissions and incentive payments payable, defined contribution plan matching contribution obligations, and deferred compensation arrangements, that are excluded from the contractual obligations and commitments table above. Accrued compensation and benefits at December 31, 2016 totaled $1,880 million and included incentive compensation of $1,325 million, deferred compensation of $304 million and other compensation and benefits related obligations of $251 million. Substantially all of the incentive compensation liability was paid in the first quarter of 2017, while the deferred compensation obligations are generally payable over periods of up to three years. Critical Accounting Policies The preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expense during the reporting periods. Actual results could differ significantly from those estimates. Management considers the following critical accounting policies important to understanding the consolidated financial statements. For a summary of these and additional accounting policies see Note 2, Significant Accounting Policies, in the consolidated financial statements contained in Part II, Item 8 of this filing. Consolidation In the normal course of business, the Company is the manager of various types of sponsored investment vehicles. The Company performs an analysis for investment products to determine if the product is a VIE or a VRE. Assessing whether an entity is a VIE or a VRE involves judgment and analysis. Factors considered in this assessment include the entity’s legal organization, the entity’s capital structure and equity ownership, and any related party or de facto agent implications of the Company’s involvement with the entity. Investments that are determined to be VREs are consolidated if the Company can exert control over the financial and operating policies of the investee, which generally exists if there is greater than 50% voting interest. See Note 4, Consolidated Voting Rights Entities, in the notes to the consolidated financial statements contained in Part II, Item 8 of this filing for more information. Investments that are determined to be VIEs are consolidated if the Company is the primary beneficiary (“PB”) of the entity. At December 31, 2016, BlackRock was determined to be the PB for certain investment funds that were determined to be VIEs, which required BlackRock to consolidate them. BlackRock was deemed to be the PB because it has the power to direct the activities that most significantly impact the entities’ economic performance and has the obligation to absorb losses or the right to receive benefits that potentially could be significant to the VIE. The Company generally consolidates VIEs in which it holds an equity ownership interest of 10% or greater and deconsolidates such VIEs once equity ownership falls below 10%. See Note 5, Variable Interest Entities, in the notes to the consolidated financial statements contained in Part II, Item 8 of this filing for more information. Investments Equity Method Investments. For equity investments where BlackRock does not control the investee, and where it is not the PB of a VIE, but can exert significant influence over the financial and operating policies of the investee, the Company follows the equity method of accounting. The evaluation of whether the Company exerts control or significant influence over the financial and operational policies of its investees requires significant judgment based on the facts and circumstances surrounding each individual investment. Factors considered in these evaluations may include the type of investment, the legal structure of the investee, the terms and structure of the investment agreement, including investor voting or other rights, the terms of BlackRock’s advisory agreement or other agreements with the investee, any influence BlackRock may have on the governing board of the investee, the legal rights of other investors in the entity pursuant to the fund’s operating documents and the relationship between BlackRock and other investors in the entity. 51 BlackRock’s equity method investees that are investment companies record their underlying investments at fair value. Therefore, under the equity method of accounting, BlackRock’s share of the investee’s underlying net income predominantly represents fair value adjustments in the investments held by the equity method investees. BlackRock’s share of the investee’s underlying net income or loss is based upon the most currently available information and is recorded as nonoperating income (expense) for investments in investment companies, or as other revenue for certain strategic investments, which are recorded in other assets, since such investees are considered to be an extension of BlackRock’s core business. At December 31, 2016, the Company had $730 million and $348 million of equity method investments, including equity method investments held for deferred compensation, reflected within investments and other assets, respectively, and at December 31, 2015, the Company had $527 million and $265 million of equity method investees reflected in investments and other assets, respectively. Impairments of Investments. Management periodically assesses equity method, available-for-sale, held-to-maturity and cost investments for other-than-temporary impairment (“OTTI”). If an OTTI exists, an impairment charge is recorded in nonoperating income (expense) on the consolidated statements of the income. For equity method, held-to-maturity and cost method investments, if circumstances indicate that an OTTI may exist, the investments are evaluated using market values, where available, or the expected future cash flows of the investment. If the Company determines an OTTI exists, an impairment charge is recognized for the excess of the carrying amount of the investment over its estimated fair value. For available-for-sale securities, when the fair value is lower than cost, the Company considers, among other factors, the length of time the security has been in a loss position, the extent to which the security’s fair value is less than cost, the financial condition and near-term prospects of the security’s issuer and the Company’s ability and intent to hold the security for a length of time sufficient to allow for recovery of such unrealized losses. For equity securities, if the impairment is considered other-than-temporary, an impairment charge is recognized for the excess of the carrying amount of the investment over its fair value. For debt securities, the Company considers whether: (1) it has the intent to sell the security; (2) it is more likely than not that it will be required to sell the security before recovery; or (3) it expects to recover the entire amortized cost basis of the security. If the Company intends to sell the security or it is more likely than not that it will be required to sell the security, the entire difference between the amortized cost and fair value must be recognized in earnings. If the Company does not intend to sell a security and it is not more likely than not that it will be required to sell the security but the security has suffered an impairment related to credit, the credit loss will be bifurcated from the total decline in value and recorded in earnings with the remaining portion recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income. For the Company’s investments in CLOs, the Company reviews cash flow estimates over the life of each CLO investment. On a quarterly basis, if the present value of the estimated future cash flows is lower than the carrying value of the investment and there is an adverse change in estimated cash flows, an impairment is considered to be other-than-temporary. An impairment charge is recognized for the excess of the carrying amount of the investment over its estimated fair value. Evaluation of impairments involves significant assumptions and management judgments, which could differ from actual results, and these differences could have a material impact on the consolidated statements of income. Fair Value Measurements The Company’s assessment of the significance of a particular input to the fair value measurement according to the fair value hierarchy (i.e., Level 1, 2 and 3 inputs, as defined) in its entirety requires judgment and considers factors specific to the financial instrument. See Note 2, Significant Accounting Policies, in the consolidated financial statements contained in Part II, Item 8 of this filing for more information on fair value measurements. Changes in Valuation. Changes in value on $2,255 million of Total Investments will impact the Company’s nonoperating income (expense), $80 million will impact accumulated other comprehensive income, $142 million are held at cost or amortized cost and the remaining $126 million relates to carried interest, which will not impact nonoperating income (expense). At December 31, 2016, changes in fair value of approximately $1,365 million of such consolidated VIEs/VREs will impact BlackRock’s net income (loss) attributable to noncontrolling interests on the consolidated statements of income. BlackRock’s net exposure to changes in fair value of such consolidated sponsored investment funds was $1,176 million. Goodwill and Intangible Assets The value of advisory contracts acquired in business acquisitions to manage AUM in proprietary open-end investment funds as well as collective trust funds without a specified termination date are classified as indefinite-lived intangible assets. The assignment of indefinite lives to such investment fund contracts is based upon the assumption there is no foreseeable limit on the contract period to manage these funds due to the likelihood of continued renewal at little or no cost. In addition, trade names/trademarks are considered indefinite-lived intangibles as they are expected to generate cash flows indefinitely. Goodwill represents the cost of a business acquisition in excess of the fair value of the net assets acquired. In accordance with current accounting guidance, indefinite-lived intangible assets and goodwill are not amortized. Finite-lived management contracts, which relate to acquired separate accounts and funds with a specified termination date, are amortized over their remaining expected useful lives, which, at December 31, 2016, ranged from 1 to 9 years with a weighted-average remaining estimated useful life of 3.8 years. Goodwill. The Company assesses its goodwill for impairment at least annually, considering such factors as the book value and the market capitalization of the Company. The impairment assessment performed as of July 31, 2016 indicated no impairment charge was required. The Company continues to monitor its book value per share compared with closing prices of its common stock for potential indicators of impairment. At December 31, 2016, the Company’s common stock closed at $380.54, which exceeded its book value of approximately $178.38 per share. Indefinite-lived and finite-lived intangibles. The Company performs assessments to determine if any intangible assets are impaired and whether the indefinite-life and finite-life classifications are still appropriate. 52 In evaluating whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of indefinite-lived intangibles is less than carrying value, BlackRock performed certain quantitative assessments and assessed various significant qualitative factors including AUM, revenue basis points, projected AUM growth rates, operating margins, tax rates and discount rates. In addition, the Company considered other factors including: (i) macroeconomic conditions such as a deterioration in general economic conditions, limitations on accessing capital, fluctuations in foreign exchange rates, or other developments in equity and credit markets; (ii) industry and market considerations such as a deterioration in the environment in which an entity operates, an increased competitive environment, a decline in market-dependent multiples or metrics, a change in the market for an entity’s services, or regulatory, legal or political developments; and (iii) entity-specific events, such as a change in management or key personnel, overall financial performance and litigation that could affect significant inputs used to determine the fair value of the indefinite-lived intangible asset. If an indefinite-lived intangible is determined to be more likely than not impaired, then the fair value of the asset is compared with its carrying value and any excess of the carrying value over the fair value would be recognized as an expense in the period in which the impairment occurs. For finite-lived intangible assets, if potential impairment circumstances are considered to exist, the Company will perform a recoverability test, using an undiscounted cash flow analysis. Actual results could differ from these cash flow estimates, which could materially impact the impairment conclusion. If the carrying value of the asset is determined not to be recoverable based on the undiscounted cash flow test, the difference between the book value of the asset and its current fair value would be recognized as an expense in the period in which the impairment occurs. In addition, management judgment is required to estimate the period over which finite-lived intangible assets will contribute to the Company’s cash flows and the pattern in which these assets will be consumed. A change in the remaining useful life of any of these assets, or the reclassification of an indefinite-lived intangible asset to a finite-lived intangible asset, could have a significant impact on the Company’s amortization expense, which was $99 million, $128 million and $157 million for 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively. In 2016, 2015 and 2014, the Company performed impairment tests, including evaluating various qualitative factors and performing certain quantitative assessments. The Company determined that no impairment charges were required, the classification of indefinite-lived versus finite-lived intangibles was still appropriate and no changes to the expected lives of the finite-lived intangibles were required. The Company continuously monitors various factors, including AUM, for potential indicators of impairment. Income Taxes Deferred income tax assets and liabilities are recognized for future tax consequences attributable to temporary differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases using currently enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to reverse. The effect of a change in tax rates on deferred tax assets and liabilities is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date. Significant management judgment is required in estimating the ranges of possible outcomes and determining the probability of favorable or unfavorable tax outcomes and potential interest and penalties related to such unfavorable outcomes. Actual future tax consequences relating to uncertain tax positions may be materially different than the Company’s current estimates. At December 31, 2016, BlackRock had $410 million of gross unrecognized tax benefits, of which $284 million, if recognized, would affect the effective tax rate. Management is required to estimate the timing of the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities, make assumptions about the future deductibility of deferred income tax assets and assess deferred income tax liabilities based on enacted tax rates for the appropriate tax jurisdictions to determine the amount of such deferred income tax assets and liabilities. At December 31, 2016, the Company had deferred tax assets of $20 million and net deferred tax liabilities of approximately $4,840 million on the consolidated statement of financial condition. Changes in deferred tax assets and liabilities may occur in certain circumstances, including statutory income tax rate changes, statutory tax law changes, changes in the anticipated timing of recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities or changes in the structure or tax status of the Company. The Company assesses whether a valuation allowance should be established against its deferred income tax assets based on consideration of all available evidence, both positive and negative, using a more likely than not standard. The assessment considers, among other matters, the nature, frequency and severity of recent losses, forecast of future profitability, the duration of statutory carry back and carry forward periods, the Company’s experience with tax attributes expiring unused, and tax planning alternatives. The Company records income taxes based upon its estimated income tax liability or benefit. The Company’s actual tax liability or benefit may differ from the estimated income tax liability or benefit. The Company had current income taxes receivables of approximately $247 million and current income taxes payables of $75 million at December 31, 2016. Revenue Recognition Investment advisory and administration fees are recognized as the services are performed. Such fees are primarily based on pre-determined percentages of the market value of AUM or, in the case of certain real asset clients, net operating income generated by the underlying properties. Investment advisory and administration fees are affected by changes in AUM, including market appreciation or depreciation, foreign exchange translation and net inflows or outflows. Investment advisory and administration fees for investment funds are shown net of fees waived pursuant to contractual expense limitations of the funds or voluntary waivers. The Company contracts with third parties and related parties for various fund distribution and shareholder servicing to be performed on behalf of certain funds the Company manages. Such arrangements generally are priced as a portion of the management fee paid by the fund. In certain cases, the fund takes on the primary responsibility for payment for services such that the Company bears no credit risk to the third-party. The Company records its management fees net of retrocessions. Retrocessions for 2016, 2015 and 2014 were $804 million, $870 million and $891 million, respectively. The Company has additional contracts for similar services with third parties, which due to the terms of the contracts, are recorded as distribution and servicing costs and thus not netted on the consolidated statements of income. 53 The Company earns revenue by lending securities on behalf of clients to highly rated banks and broker-dealers. Revenue is accounted for on an accrual basis. The securities loaned are secured by collateral, generally ranging from 102% to 112% of the value of the loaned securities. Generally, the revenue earned is shared between the Company and the funds or accounts managed by the Company from which the securities are borrowed. For 2016, 2015 and 2014, securities lending revenue earned by the Company totaled $579 million, $513 million and $477 million, respectively, and is recorded in investment advisory, administration fees and securities lending revenue on the consolidated statements of income. Investment advisory, administration fees and securities lending revenue are reported together as the fees for these services often are agreed upon with clients as a bundled fee. The Company receives investment advisory performance fees or incentive allocations, from certain actively managed investment funds and certain separately managed accounts. These performance fees are dependent upon exceeding specified relative or absolute investment return thresholds. Such fees are recorded upon completion of the measurement period, which varies by product or account, and could be monthly, quarterly, annually or longer. In addition, the Company is allocated carried interest from certain alternative investment products upon exceeding performance thresholds. BlackRock may be required to reverse/return all, or part, of such carried interest allocations depending upon future performance of these funds. Therefore, BlackRock records carried interest subject to such clawback provisions in Total Investments or cash/cash of consolidated VIEs to the extent that it is distributed, on its consolidated statements of financial condition. Carried interest is recorded as performance fee revenue upon the earlier of the termination of the investment fund or when the likelihood of clawback is considered mathematically improbable. The Company records a deferred carried interest liability to the extent it receives cash or capital allocations related to carried interest prior to meeting the revenue recognition criteria. At December 31, 2016 and 2015, the Company had $152 million and $143 million, respectively, of deferred carried interest recorded in other liabilities/other liabilities of consolidated VIEs on the consolidated statements of financial condition. A portion of the deferred carried interest liability will be paid to certain employees. The ultimate timing of the recognition of performance fee revenue, if any, for these products is unknown. The following table presents changes in the deferred carried interest liability (including the portion related to consolidated VIEs) for 2016 and 2015: (in millions) 2016 2015 Beginning balance $ 143 $ 105 Net increase (decrease) 37 69 Performance fee revenue recognized (28 ) (31 ) Ending balance $ 152 $ 143 For 2016, 2015 and 2014, performance fee revenue totaled $295 million, $621 million and $550 million, respectively. Fees earned for BlackRock Solutions, which include advisory services, are recorded as services are performed or when completed and are determined using some, or all, of the following methods: (i) percentages of various attributes of advisory AUM or value of positions on the Aladdin platform, (ii) fixed-rate fees and (iii) fees billed on a time and materials basis. Revenue earned on advisory assignments was comprised of one-time advisory and portfolio structuring fees and ongoing fees based on AUM of the respective portfolio assignment. For 2016, 2015 and 2014, BlackRock Solutions and advisory revenue totaled $714 million, $646 million and $635 million, respectively. Adjustments to revenue arising from initial estimates recorded historically have been immaterial since the majority of BlackRock’s investment advisory and administration revenue is calculated based on AUM and since the Company does not record performance fee revenue until performance thresholds have been exceeded and the likelihood of clawback is mathematically improbable. Accounting Developments For recent accounting pronouncements not yet adopted, see Note 2, Significant Accounting Policies, in the consolidated financial statements contained in Part II, Item 8 of this filing. Recent Developments In February 2017, the Company announced that it has entered an agreement to acquire the First Reserve Energy Infrastructure business, the equity infrastructure franchise of First Reserve. Consideration for the transaction will include an upfront payment and contingent consideration. The transaction is expected to close in the first half of 2017, subject to customary regulatory approvals and closing conditions. This transaction is not expected to be material to the Company’s consolidated financial condition or results of operations. Item 7a. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk AUM Market Price Risk. BlackRock’s investment advisory and administration fees are primarily comprised of fees based on a percentage of the value of AUM and, in some cases, performance fees expressed as a percentage of the returns realized on AUM. At December 31, 2016, the majority of the Company’s investment advisory and administration fees were based on average or period end AUM of the applicable investment funds or separate accounts. Movements in equity market prices, interest rates/credit spreads, foreign exchange rates or all three could cause the value of AUM to decline, which would result in lower investment advisory and administration fees. Corporate Investments Portfolio Risks. As a leading investment management firm, BlackRock devotes significant resources across all of its operations to identifying, measuring, monitoring, managing and analyzing market and operating risks, including the management and oversight of its own investment portfolio. The Board of Directors of the Company has adopted guidelines for the review of investments to be made by the Company, requiring, among other things, that investments be reviewed by certain senior officers of the Company, and that certain investments may be referred to the Audit Committee or the Board of Directors, depending on the circumstances, for approval. 54 In the normal course of its business, BlackRock is exposed to equity market price risk, interest rate/credit spread risk and foreign exchange rate risk associated with its corporate investments. BlackRock has investments primarily in sponsored investment products that invest in a variety of asset classes, including real assets, private equity and hedge funds. Investments generally are made for co-investment purposes, to establish a performance track record, to hedge exposure to certain deferred compensation plans or for regulatory purposes. Currently, the Company has a seed capital hedging program in which it enters into swaps to hedge market and interest rate exposure to certain investments. At December 31, 2016, the Company had outstanding total return swaps and interest rate swaps with an aggregate notional value of approximately $572 million and $42 million, respectively. At December 31, 2016, approximately $1.5 billion of BlackRock’s Total Investments were maintained in consolidated sponsored investment funds accounted for as VREs and VIEs. Excluding the impact of the Federal Reserve Bank stock, carried interest, investments made to hedge exposure to certain deferred compensation plans and certain investments that are hedged via the seed capital hedging program, the Company’s economic exposure to its investment portfolio is $1,519 million. See Balance Sheet Overview-Investments and Investments of Consolidated VIEs in Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations for further information on the Company’s Total Investments. Equity Market Price Risk. At December 31, 2016, the Company’s net exposure to equity market price risk in its investment portfolio was approximately $475 million of the Company’s total economic investment exposure. Investments subject to market price risk include private equity and real assets investments, hedge funds and funds of funds as well as mutual funds. The Company estimates that a hypothetical 10% adverse change in market prices would result in a decrease of approximately $47.5 million in the carrying value of such investments. Interest-Rate/Credit Spread Risk. At December 31, 2016, the Company was exposed to interest rate risk and credit spread risk as a result of approximately $1,044 million of Total Investments in debt securities and sponsored investment products that invest primarily in debt securities. Management considered a hypothetical 100 basis point fluctuation in interest rates or credit spreads and estimates that the impact of such a fluctuation on these investments, in the aggregate, would result in a decrease, or increase, of approximately $23.4 million in the carrying value of such investments. Foreign Exchange Rate Risk. As discussed above, the Company invests in sponsored investment products that invest in a variety of asset classes. The carrying value of the total economic investment exposure denominated in foreign currencies, primarily the British pound and Euro, was $320 million at December 31, 2016. A 10% adverse change in the applicable foreign exchange rates would result in approximately a $32 million decline in the carrying value of such investments. Other Market Risks. The Company executes forward foreign currency exchange contracts to mitigate the risk of certain foreign exchange risk movements. At December 31, 2016, the Company had outstanding forward foreign currency exchange contracts with an aggregate notional value of approximately $107 million.",2023-12-30 18:58:54.062574

This transaction involves approximately $31 billion in AUM across local fixed income, equity and multi-asset products. The transaction is expected to close in the second half of 2018, subject to customary regulatory approvals and closing conditions. Consideration for the transaction will include an upfront cash payment and contingent consideration. United Kingdom Exit from European Union Following the June 2016 vote to exit the European Union (“EU”), the United Kingdom served notice under Article 50 of the Treaty on European Union on March 29, 2017 to initiate the process of exiting from the EU, commonly referred to as ""Brexit"". The outcome of the negotiations between the United Kingdom and the EU in connection with Brexit is highly uncertain and information regarding the long-term consequences is expected to become clearer over time as negotiations progress. The Company continues to prepare for a range of potential outcomes in connection with Brexit. 33 Business Outlook BlackRock's framework for long-term value creation is predicated on generating differentiated organic growth, leveraging scale to increase operating margins over time, and returning capital to shareholders on a consistent basis. BlackRock's diversified platform, in terms of style, product, client and geography, enables it to generate more stable cash flows through market cycles, positioning BlackRock to invest for the long-term by striking an appropriate balance between investing for future growth and prudent discretionary expense management. BlackRock’s highly diversified multi-product platform was created to meet the needs of its clients in all market environments. BlackRock is positioned to provide alpha-seeking active and index investment solutions across asset classes and geographies.

BlackRock’s technology portfolio includes Aladdin and Aladdin Risk for Wealth Management, FutureAdvisor, Cachematrix, as well as minority investments in Scalable Capital and iCapital. U.S. Tax Reform On December 22, 2017, The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the “2017 Tax Act”) was enacted. The 2017 Tax Act significantly revises the U.S. tax code, including, but not limited to, (1) reducing the U.S. federal corporate tax rate from 35 percent to 21 percent, (2) requiring companies to pay a one-time tax on certain unrepatriated earnings of foreign subsidiaries, (3) generally eliminating U.S. federal income taxes on dividends from foreign subsidiaries, (4) creating new taxes on certain earnings of controlled foreign corporations, and (5) creating a new limitation on deductible net interest expense. BlackRock’s results in 2017 included a $1.2 billion net tax benefit related to the 2017 Tax Act comprised of the following amounts: • $106 million tax expense related to the revaluation of certain deferred income tax assets; • $1,758 million noncash tax benefit related to the revaluation of certain deferred income tax liabilities (which was excluded from as adjusted results); and • $477 million tax expense related to the mandatory deemed repatriation of undistributed foreign earnings and profits (which was excluded from as adjusted results) and is payable over eight years. These amounts may require further adjustments as additional guidance from the U.S. Department of the Treasury is provided, as changes in the Company’s assumptions occur, and as further information and interpretations become available. For further information on the 2017 Tax Act, see Note 21, Income Taxes, in the consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this filing. 34 Executive Summary (in millions, except shares and per share data) 2017 2016 2015 GAAP basis: Total revenue $ 12,491 $ 11,155 $ 11,401 Total expense 7,219 6,585 6,737 Operating income $ 5,272 $ 4,570 $ 4,664 Operating margin 42.2 % 41.0 % 40.9 % Nonoperating income (expense), less net income (loss) attributable to noncontrolling interests (32 ) (108 ) (69 ) Income tax expense (270 ) (1,290 ) (1,250 ) Net income attributable to BlackRock $ 4,970 $ 3,172 $ 3,345 Diluted earnings per common share $ 30.23 $ 19.04 $ 19.79 Effective tax rate 5.2 % 28.9 % 27.2 % As adjusted(1): Operating income $ 5,287 $ 4,674 $ 4,695 Operating margin 44.1 % 43.7 % 42.9 % Nonoperating income (expense), less net income (loss) attributable to noncontrolling interests (32 ) (108 ) (70 ) Net income attributable to BlackRock $ 3,716 $ 3,214 $ 3,313 Diluted earnings per common share $ 22.60 $ 19.29 $ 19.60 Effective tax rate 29.3 % 29.6 % 28.4 % Other: Assets under management (end of period) $ 6,288,195 $ 5,147,852 $ 4,645,412 Diluted weighted-average common shares outstanding(2) 164,415,035 166,579,752 169,038,571 Common and preferred shares outstanding (end of period) 161,046,825 163,121,291 165,596,139 Book value per share(3) $ 197.61 $ 178.38 $ 172.12 Cash dividends declared and paid per share $ 10.00 $ 9.16 $ 8.72 (1) As adjusted items are described in more detail in Non-GAAP Financial Measures. (2) Nonvoting participating preferred shares are considered to be common stock equivalents for purposes of determining basic and diluted earnings per share calculations. (3) Total BlackRock stockholders’ equity, divided by total common and preferred shares outstanding at December 31 of the respective year-end. 2017 Compared with 2016 GAAP. Operating income of $5,272 million increased $702 million and operating margin of 42.2% increased 120 bps from 2016. Operating income and operating margin growth primarily reflected higher base fees, performance fees, and technology and risk management revenue, partially offset by higher compensation and benefits, higher volume-related expense, and higher general and administration expense. Operating income for 2017 also included approximately $22 million of expense associated with the strategic repositioning of the active equity platform. Operating income for 2016 included a restructuring charge of $76 million in connection with a project to streamline and simplify the organization. Nonoperating income (expense), less net income (loss) attributable to noncontrolling interests (“NCI”), increased $76 million from 2016 driven by higher net gains on investments. Income tax expense for 2017 included the previously mentioned $1.2 billion net tax benefit related to the 2017 Tax Act, $173 million of discrete tax benefits, primarily related to stock-based compensation awards, including a $151 million discrete tax benefit reflecting the adoption of new stock-based compensation accounting guidance, and a $16 million noncash tax expense associated with the revaluation of certain deferred income tax liabilities. Income tax expense for 2016 included a $30 million net noncash benefit associated with the revaluation of certain deferred income tax liabilities, including the effect of tax legislation enacted in the United Kingdom, and state and local income tax changes. Income tax expense for 2016 also included nonrecurring tax benefits of $65 million. See Income Tax Expense within Discussion of Financial Results for more information. Diluted earnings per common share increased $11.19, or 59%, compared with 2016, reflecting the net tax benefit from the 2017 Tax Act and higher operating income, partially offset by the benefit of share repurchases. As Adjusted. Operating income of $5,287 million increased $613 million and operating margin of 44.1% increased 40 bps from 2016. The pre-tax restructuring charge of $76 million described above was excluded from as adjusted results for 2016. Income tax expense for 2017 excluded the previously described $1,758 million noncash tax benefit and $477 million deemed repatriation tax expense related to the 2017 Tax Act, and the previously described noncash expense of $16 million. Income tax expense for 2016 excluded the previously mentioned net noncash benefit of $30 million. Diluted earnings per common share increased $3.31, or 17%, from 2016. 2016 Compared with 2015 GAAP. Operating income of $4,570 million decreased $94 million from 2015. Operating income was impacted by lower performance fees, partially offset by expense discipline and growth in technology and risk management revenue. Operating income also reflected a restructuring charge of $76 million recorded in the first quarter of 2016 in connection with a project to streamline and simplify the organization. Operating margin of 41% increased 10 bps from 2015 driven by continued expense discipline. Nonoperating income (expense), less NCI, decreased $39 million from 2015 due to lower net gains on investments, partially offset by higher interest and dividend income during 2016. Net gains on investments in 2015 included a $40 million noncash gain related to the BlackRock Kelso Capital Advisors LLC (“BKCA”) transaction and a $35 million unrealized gain on a private equity investment. 35 Income tax expense for 2016 included a $30 million net noncash tax benefit associated with the revaluation of certain deferred income tax liabilities, including the effect of tax legislation enacted in the United Kingdom, and state and local income tax changes. Income tax expense for 2016 also included nonrecurring tax benefits of $65 million. Income tax expense for 2015 included a $54 million net noncash benefit associated with the revaluation of certain deferred income tax liabilities and nonrecurring tax benefits of $75 million. Diluted earnings per common share decreased $0.75, or 4%, compared with 2015, reflecting lower nonoperating income and a higher tax rate in 2016, partially offset by the benefit of share repurchases. As Adjusted. Operating income of $4,674 million decreased $21 million, and operating margin of 43.7% increased 80 bps, from 2015. The pre-tax restructuring charge of $76 million described above was excluded from as adjusted results. Income tax expense for 2016 and 2015 excluded the previously described net noncash benefits of $30 million and $54 million, respectively. Diluted earnings per common share decreased $0.31, or 2%, from 2015. See Non-GAAP Financial Measures for further information on as adjusted items. For further discussion of BlackRock’s revenue, expense, nonoperating results and income tax expense, see Discussion of Financial Results herein. Non-GAAP Financial Measures BlackRock reports its financial results in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (“GAAP”); however, management believes evaluating the Company’s ongoing operating results may be enhanced if investors have additional non-GAAP financial measures. Management reviews non-GAAP financial measures to assess ongoing operations and considers them to be helpful, for both management and investors, in evaluating BlackRock’s financial performance over time. Management also uses non-GAAP financial measures as a benchmark to compare its performance with other companies and to enhance the comparability of this information for the reporting periods presented. Non-GAAP measures may pose limitations because they do not include all of BlackRock’s revenue and expense. BlackRock’s management does not advocate that investors consider such non-GAAP financial measures in isolation from, or as a substitute for, financial information prepared in accordance with GAAP. Non-GAAP measures may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures of other companies. Management uses both GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures in evaluating BlackRock’s financial performance. Adjustments to GAAP financial measures (“non-GAAP adjustments”) include certain items management deems nonrecurring or that occur infrequently, transactions that ultimately will not impact BlackRock’s book value or certain tax items that do not impact cash flow. Computations for all periods are derived from the consolidated statements of income as follows: (1) Operating income, as adjusted, and operating margin, as adjusted: Management believes operating income, as adjusted, and operating margin, as adjusted, are effective indicators of BlackRock’s financial performance over time and, therefore, provide useful disclosure to investors. (in millions) 2017 2016 2015 Operating income, GAAP basis $ 5,272 $ 4,570 $ 4,664 Non-GAAP expense adjustments: Restructuring charge — 76 — PNC LTIP funding obligation 15 28 30 Compensation expense related to appreciation (depreciation) on deferred compensation plans — — 1 Operating income, as adjusted 5,287 4,674 4,695 Product launch costs and commissions — — 5 Operating income used for operating margin measurement $ 5,287 $ 4,674 $ 4,700 Revenue, GAAP basis $ 12,491 $ 11,155 $ 11,401 Non-GAAP adjustments: Distribution and servicing costs (492 ) (429 ) (409 ) Amortization of deferred sales commissions (17 ) (34 ) (48 ) Revenue used for operating margin measurement $ 11,982 $ 10,692 $ 10,944 Operating margin, GAAP basis 42.2 % 41.0 % 40.9 % Operating margin, as adjusted 44.1 % 43.7 % 42.9 % • Operating income, as adjusted, includes non-GAAP expense adjustments. The portion of compensation expense associated with certain long-term incentive plans (“LTIP”) funded, or to be funded, through share distributions to participants of BlackRock stock held by PNC has been excluded because it ultimately does not impact BlackRock’s book value. In 2016, a restructuring charge primarily comprised of severance and accelerated amortization expense of previously granted deferred compensation awards has been excluded to provide an analysis of BlackRock’s ongoing operations and to ensure comparability among periods presented. In 2015, compensation expense associated with appreciation (depreciation) on investments related to certain BlackRock deferred compensation plans has been excluded, as returns on investments set aside for these plans, which substantially offset this expense, are reported in nonoperating income (expense). • Operating income used for measuring operating margin, as adjusted, is equal to operating income, as adjusted, excluding the impact of product launch costs (e.g. closed-end fund launch costs) and related commissions. Management believes the exclusion of such costs and related commissions is useful because these costs can fluctuate considerably and revenue associated with the expenditure of these costs will not fully impact BlackRock’s results until future periods. 36 Revenue used for operating margin, as adjusted, excludes distribution and servicing costs paid to related parties and other third parties. Management believes such costs represent a benchmark for the amount of revenue passed through to external parties who distribute the Company’s products. In addition, management believes the exclusion of such costs is useful because it creates consistency in the treatment for certain contracts for similar services, which due to the terms of the contracts, are accounted for under GAAP on a net basis within investment advisory, administration fees and securities lending revenue. Amortization of deferred sales commissions is excluded from revenue used for operating margin measurement, as adjusted, because such costs, over time, substantially offset distribution fee revenue the Company earns. For each of these items, BlackRock excludes from revenue used for operating margin, as adjusted, the costs related to each of these items as a proxy for such offsetting revenue. (2) Net income attributable to BlackRock, Inc., as adjusted: (in millions, except per share data) 2017 2016 2015 Net income attributable to BlackRock, Inc., GAAP basis $ 4,970 $ 3,172 $ 3,345 Non-GAAP adjustments: Restructuring charge (including $23 tax benefit) — 53 — PNC LTIP funding obligation, net of tax 11 19 22 The 2017 Tax Act: Deferred tax revaluation (noncash) (1,758 ) — — Deemed repatriation tax 477 — — Other income tax matters 16 (30 ) (54 ) Net income attributable to BlackRock, Inc., as adjusted $ 3,716 $ 3,214 $ 3,313 Diluted weighted-average common shares outstanding(3) 164.4 166.6 169.0 Diluted earnings per common share, GAAP basis(3) $ 30.23 $ 19.04 $ 19.79 Diluted earnings per common share, as adjusted(3) $ 22.60 $ 19.29 $ 19.60 Management believes net income attributable to BlackRock, Inc., as adjusted, and diluted earnings per common share, as adjusted, are useful measures of BlackRock’s profitability and financial performance. Net income attributable to BlackRock, Inc., as adjusted, equals net income attributable to BlackRock, Inc., GAAP basis, adjusted for significant nonrecurring items, charges that ultimately will not impact BlackRock’s book value or certain tax items that do not impact cash flow. See aforementioned discussion regarding operating income, as adjusted, and operating margin, as adjusted, for information on the PNC LTIP funding obligation and the restructuring charge. For each period presented, the non-GAAP adjustment related to the restructuring charge and PNC LTIP funding obligation was tax effected at the respective blended rates applicable to the adjustments. The noncash deferred tax revaluation benefit of $1,758 million and the other income tax matters were primarily associated with the revaluation of certain deferred tax liabilities related to intangible assets and goodwill. These amounts have been excluded from the as adjusted results as these items will not have a cash flow impact and to ensure comparability among periods presented. A deemed repatriation tax expense of $477 million has been excluded from the 2017 as adjusted results due to the one-time nature and to ensure comparability among periods presented. Per share amounts reflect net income attributable to BlackRock, Inc., as adjusted divided by diluted weighted average common shares outstanding. (3) Nonvoting participating preferred stock is considered to be a common stock equivalent for purposes of determining basic and diluted earnings per share calculations. 37 Assets Under Management AUM for reporting purposes generally is based upon how investment advisory and administration fees are calculated for each portfolio. Net asset values, total assets, committed assets or other measures may be used to determine portfolio AUM.

Amount for 2016 represents $80.6 billion of AUM acquired in the BofA Global Capital Management transaction in April 2016. Amounts for 2015 represent $1.3 billion of AUM acquired in the acquisition of certain assets of BKCA in March 2015, $560 million of AUM acquired in the Infraestructura Institucional acquisition in October 2015 and $366 million of AUM acquired in the FutureAdvisor acquisition in October 2015. The FutureAdvisor acquisition amount does not include AUM that was held in iShares holdings. (3) Foreign exchange reflects the impact of translating non-U.S. dollar denominated AUM into U.S. dollars for reporting purposes. 38 BlackRock has historically grown AUM through organic growth and acquisitions. Management believes that the Company will be able to continue to grow AUM organically by focusing on strong investment performance, efficient delivery of beta for index products, client service, developing new products and optimizing distribution capabilities.

Net market appreciation of $628.9 billion was primarily driven by higher U.S. and global equity markets. AUM increased $140.9 billion due to the impact of foreign exchange movements, primarily resulting from the weakening of the U.S. dollar against the Euro and the British pound.

(3) Average AUM is calculated as the average of the month-end spot AUM amounts for the trailing thirteen months. (4) Advisory AUM represents long-term portfolio liquidation assignments. (5) Amounts include commodity iShares ETFs. AUM increased $502.4 billion to $5.1 trillion at December 31, 2016 from $4.6 trillion at December 31, 2015 driven by net market appreciation, positive net inflows and AUM acquired in the BofA Global Capital Management transaction, partially offset by the impact of foreign exchange movements. Net market appreciation of $326.4 billion was driven by $219.0 billion from equity products, $82.8 billion from fixed income products and $22.5 billion from multi-asset products across the majority of strategies. AUM decreased $106.8 billion due to the impact of foreign exchange movements, primarily resulting from the strengthening of the U.S. dollar, largely against the British pound and the Euro. 42 Discussion of Financial Results Introduction BlackRock derives a substantial portion of its revenue from investment advisory and administration fees, which are recognized as the services are performed. Such fees are primarily based on predetermined percentages of the market value of AUM or percentages of committed capital during investment periods of certain alternative products and are affected by changes in AUM, including market appreciation or depreciation, foreign exchange translation and net inflows or outflows. Net inflows or outflows represent the sum of new client assets, additional fundings from existing clients (including dividend reinvestment), withdrawals of assets from, and termination of, client accounts and distributions to investors representing return of capital and return on investments to investors. Market appreciation or depreciation includes current income earned on, and changes in the fair value of, securities held in client accounts. Foreign exchange translation reflects the impact of translating non-U.S. dollar denominated AUM into U.S. dollars for reporting purposes. BlackRock also earns revenue by lending securities on behalf of clients to highly rated banks and broker-dealers. The securities loaned are secured by collateral in the form of cash or securities, with minimum collateral generally ranging from approximately 102% to 112% of the value of the loaned securities. Generally, the revenue earned is shared between BlackRock and the funds or accounts managed by the Company from which the securities are borrowed. Historically, securities lending revenue in the second quarter exceeds revenue in the other quarters during the year driven by higher seasonal demand. Investment advisory agreements for certain separate accounts and investment funds provide for performance fees based upon relative and/or absolute investment performance, in addition to base fees based on AUM. Investment advisory performance fees generally are earned after a given period of time and when investment performance exceeds a contractual threshold. As such, the timing of recognition of performance fees may increase the volatility of BlackRock’s revenue and earnings. The magnitude of performance fees can fluctuate quarterly due to the timing of carried interest recognition on alternative products; however, the third and fourth quarters have a greater number of nonalternative products with performance measurement periods that end on either September 30 or December 31. BlackRock offers investment management technology systems, risk management services, wealth management and digital distribution tools on a fee basis. Clients include banks, insurance companies, official institutions, pension funds, asset managers, retail distributors and other investors. Fees earned for technology and risk management revenue are recorded as services are performed and are generally determined using the value of positions on the Aladdin platform or on a fixed-rate basis. BlackRock advises global financial institutions, regulators, and government entities across a range of risk, regulatory, capital markets and strategic services. Fees earned for advisory services, which are included in advisory and other revenue, are determined using fixed-rate fees and recorded upon delivery. The Company earns fees for transition management services primarily comprised of commissions recognized in connection with buying and selling securities on behalf of its customers. Commissions related to transition management services are recorded on a trade-date basis as securities transactions occur. The Company also earns revenue related to certain strategic investments accounted for as equity method investments. Operating expense reflects employee compensation and benefits, distribution and servicing costs, amortization of deferred sales commissions, direct fund expense, general and administration expense and amortization of finite-lived intangible assets. • Employee compensation and benefits expense includes salaries, commissions, temporary help, deferred and incentive compensation, employer payroll taxes, severance and related benefit costs. • Distribution and servicing costs, which are primarily AUM driven, include payments made to third parties, primarily associated with obtaining and retaining client investments in certain BlackRock products. • Direct fund expense primarily consists of third-party nonadvisory expense incurred by BlackRock related to certain funds for the use of index trademarks, reference data for indices, custodial services, fund administration, fund accounting, transfer agent services, shareholder reporting services, legal expense, and audit and tax services as well as other fund-related expense directly attributable to the nonadvisory operations of the fund. These expenses may vary over time with fluctuations in AUM, number of shareholder accounts, or other attributes directly related to volume of business. General and administration expense includes marketing and promotional, occupancy and office-related costs, portfolio services (including clearing expense related to transition management services), technology, professional services, communications, product launch costs and other general and administration expense, including the impact of foreign currency remeasurement. Foreign currency remeasurement (gains) losses were $5 million, $(6) million and $(8) million for 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively. Approximately 75% of the Company’s revenue is generated in U.S. dollars. The Company’s revenue and expense generated in foreign currencies (primarily the Euro and British pound) are impacted by foreign exchange rates. Any effect of foreign exchange rate change on revenue is partially offset by a change in expense driven by the Company’s considerable non-dollar expense base related to its operations outside the United States. Nonoperating income (expense) includes the effect of changes in the valuations on investments (excluding available-for-sale investments) and earnings on equity method investments as well as interest and dividend income and interest expense. Other comprehensive income includes changes in valuations related to available-for-sale investments. BlackRock primarily holds seed and co-investments in sponsored investment products that invest in a variety of asset classes, including private equity, hedge funds and real assets. Investments generally are made for co-investment purposes, to establish a performance track record or for regulatory purposes, including Federal Reserve Bank stock. BlackRock does not engage in proprietary trading activities that could conflict with the interests of its clients. 43 In addition, nonoperating income (expense) includes the impact of changes in the valuations of consolidated sponsored investment funds. The portion of nonoperating income (expense) not attributable to BlackRock is allocated to NCI on the consolidated statements of income.

Investment advisory, administration fees and securities lending revenue of $10,893 million in 2017 increased $1,013 million from $9,880 million in 2016 reflecting the impact of higher markets and organic growth on average AUM, and the effect of AUM acquired in the BofA Global Capital Management transaction, partially offset by pricing changes to select investment products. Securities lending revenue of $597 million in 2017 compared with $579 million in 2016. Investment advisory performance fees were $594 million in 2017 compared with $295 million in 2016. The increase primarily reflected improved performance in hedge fund and long-only equity products. Technology and risk management revenue of $677 million for 2017 increased $82 million from $595 million in 2016 reflecting ongoing demand for Aladdin. Advisory and other revenue of $303 million decreased $41 million from $344 million in 2016, reflecting lower earnings from a strategic minority investment and lower fees for distributing certain exchange-traded products. 2016 Compared with 2015 Revenue decreased $246 million, or 2%, from 2015, driven by lower performance fees, partially offset by higher technology and risk management revenue. Investment advisory, administration fees and securities lending revenue of $9,880 million for 2016 increased $40 million from $9,840 million in 2015 reflecting the impact of organic growth and higher markets on average AUM, the effect of AUM acquired in the BofA Global Capital Management transaction and lower yield-related fee waivers on certain money market funds, partially offset by the impact of divergent beta and mix shift, and the impact of foreign exchange movements. Securities lending revenue increased $66 million from 2015 to $579 million in 2016, primarily reflecting an increase in average balances of securities on loan and higher spreads. Investment advisory performance fees were $295 million in 2016 compared with $621 million in 2015. The decrease was primarily driven by lower fees from equity and alternative products, including the impact of the strong performance from a single hedge fund with an annual performance measurement period that ended in the third quarter of 2015. Technology and risk management revenue of $595 million for 2016 increased $67 million from $528 million in 2015 reflecting ongoing demand for Aladdin. 45 Expense The following table presents expense for 2017, 2016 and 2015.

Expense increased $634 million, or 10%, from 2016, driven primarily by higher employee compensation and benefits expense, higher volume-related expense, and higher general and administration expense, partially offset by a restructuring charge recorded in 2016. Employee compensation and benefits expense increased $375 million, or 10%, to $4,255 million in 2017 from $3,880 million in 2016, reflecting higher incentive compensation, higher headcount, and approximately $20 million of severance and accelerated compensation expense associated with the repositioning of the active equity platform. Employees at December 31, 2017 totaled approximately 13,900 compared with approximately 13,000 at December 31, 2016. Distribution and servicing costs totaled $492 million in 2017 compared with $429 million in 2016 reflecting higher average AUM and the effect of AUM acquired in the BofA Global Capital Management transaction. Direct fund expense increased $138 million from 2016, reflecting higher iShares ETFs average AUM. General and administration expense increased $161 million from 2016, reflecting higher portfolio services, professional services fees (associated with strategic transactions, MiFID implementation, and tax reform), technology expense, operating errors, contingent consideration fair value adjustments and the impact of foreign exchange remeasurement expense. As Adjusted. Expense, as adjusted, increased $723 million, or 11%, to $7,204 million in 2017 from $6,481 million in 2016. The increase in total expense, as adjusted, is driven primarily by higher employee compensation and benefit expense, higher volume-related expense and higher general and administration expense. The restructuring charge recorded in 2016 has been excluded from the as adjusted results. 46 2016 Compared with 2015 GAAP. Expense decreased $152 million, or 2%, from 2015, reflecting lower compensation and benefits expense, expense discipline and lower amortization of intangible assets, partially offset by a restructuring charge recorded in 2016. Employee compensation and benefits expense decreased $125 million, or 3%, to $3,880 million in 2016 from $4,005 million in 2015, reflecting lower incentive compensation, primarily driven by lower performance fees. Distribution and servicing costs totaled $429 million in 2016 compared with $409 million in 2015. General and administration expense decreased $79 million from 2015, reflecting expense discipline and the impact of higher transaction-related expense recorded in 2015. Restructuring charge of $76 million, primarily comprised of severance and accelerated amortization expense of previously granted deferred compensation awards, was recorded in 2016 in connection with a project to streamline and simplify the organization. Amortization of intangible assets expense decreased $29 million, or 23%, to $99 million in 2016 from $128 million in 2015, primarily reflecting certain finite-lived intangible assets becoming fully amortized. As Adjusted. Expense, as adjusted, decreased $225 million, or 3%, to $6,481 million in 2016 from $6,706 million in 2015. The decrease in total expense, as adjusted, is primarily attributable to lower employee compensation and benefits expense, expense discipline and lower amortization of intangible assets. The restructuring charge has been excluded from the as adjusted results. Nonoperating Results The summary and reconciliation of U.S. GAAP nonoperating income (expense) to nonoperating income (expense), as adjusted for 2017, 2016 and 2015 was as follows: (in millions) 2017 2016 2015 Nonoperating income (expense), GAAP basis(1) $ 5 $ (110 ) $ (62 ) Less: Net income (loss) attributable to NCI 37 (2 ) 7 Nonoperating income (expense)(2) (32 ) (108 ) (69 ) Compensation expense related to (appreciation) depreciation on deferred compensation plans — — (1 ) Nonoperating income (expense), as adjusted(2)(3) $ (32 ) $ (108 ) $ (70 ) (1) Amounts included gains of $118 million, $16 million and $58 million attributable to consolidated variable interest entities (“VIEs”) for 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively. (2) Net of net income (loss) attributable to NCI. (3) Management believes nonoperating income (expense), as adjusted, is an effective measure for reviewing BlackRock’s nonoperating contribution to results. See Non-GAAP Financial Measures for further information on non-GAAP financial measures for 2017, 2016 and 2015. The components of nonoperating income (expense), less net income (loss) attributable to NCI for 2017, 2016 and 2015 were as follows: (in millions) 2017 2016 2015 Net gain (loss) on investments(1)(2) Private equity $ 21 $ 6 $ 71 Real assets 17 8 12 Other alternatives(3) 38 21 (2 ) Other investments(4) 43 22 (18 ) Subtotal 119 57 63 Other gains(5) 5 — 46 Total net gain (loss) on investments(1)(2) 124 57 109 Interest and dividend income 49 40 26 Interest expense (205 ) (205 ) (204 ) Net interest expense (156 ) (165 ) (178 ) Total nonoperating income (expense)(1) (32 ) (108 ) (69 ) Compensation expense related to (appreciation) depreciation on deferred compensation plans — — (1 ) Nonoperating income (expense), as adjusted(1)(2) $ (32 ) $ (108 ) $ (70 ) (1) Net of net income (loss) attributable to NCI.

(5) The amount for 2015 primarily includes a $40 million gain related to the acquisition of certain assets of BKCA. 47 Income Tax Expense GAAP As adjusted (in millions) 2017 2016 2015 2017 2016 2015 Operating income(1) $ 5,272 $ 4,570 $ 4,664 $ 5,287 $ 4,674 $ 4,695 Total nonoperating income (expense)(1)(2) (32 ) (108 ) (69 ) (32 ) (108 ) (70 ) Income before income taxes(2) $ 5,240 $ 4,462 $ 4,595 $ 5,255 $ 4,566 $ 4,625 Income tax expense(3) $ 270 $ 1,290 $ 1,250 $ 1,539 $ 1,352 $ 1,312 Effective tax rate(3) 5.2 % 28.9 % 27.2 % 29.3 % 29.6 % 28.4 % (1) See Non-GAAP Financial Measures for further information on and reconciliation of as adjusted items. (2) Net of net income (loss) attributable to NCI. (3) GAAP income tax expense and effective tax rate for 2017 reflects $1.2 billion of a net tax benefit related to the 2017 Tax Act. The Company’s tax rate is affected by tax rates in foreign jurisdictions and the relative amount of income earned in those jurisdictions, which the Company expects to be fairly consistent in the near term. The significant foreign jurisdictions that have lower statutory tax rates than the U.S. federal statutory rate of 35% include the United Kingdom, Channel Islands, Ireland and Netherlands. 2017. Income tax expense (GAAP) reflected: o the following amounts related to the 2017 Tax Act: o $106 million tax expense related to the revaluation of certain deferred income tax assets; o $1,758 million noncash tax benefit related to the revaluation of certain deferred income tax liabilities; and o $477 million tax expense related to the mandatory deemed repatriation of undistributed foreign earnings and profits. o a noncash expense of $16 million, primarily associated with the revaluation of certain deferred income tax liabilities as a result of domestic state and local tax changes; and o $173 million discrete tax benefits, primarily related to stock-based compensation awards, including $151 million related to the adoption of new accounting guidance related to stock-based compensation awards. See Note 2, Significant Accounting Policies, for further information. The as adjusted effective tax rate of 29.3% for 2017 excluded the noncash deferred tax revaluation benefit of $1,758 million and noncash expense of $16 million mentioned above as it will not have a cash flow impact and to ensure comparability among periods presented. In addition, the deemed repatriation tax expense of $477 million has been excluded from the as adjusted results due to the one-time nature and to ensure comparability among periods presented. 2016. Income tax expense (GAAP) reflected: o a net noncash benefit of $30 million, primarily associated with the revaluation of certain deferred income tax liabilities; and o a benefit from $65 million of nonrecurring items, including the resolution of certain outstanding tax matters. The as adjusted effective tax rate of 29.6% for 2016 excluded the net noncash benefit of $30 million mentioned above as it will not have a cash flow impact and to ensure comparability among periods presented. 2015. Income tax expense (GAAP) reflected: o a net noncash benefit of $54 million, primarily associated with the revaluation of certain deferred income tax liabilities; and o a benefit from $75 million of nonrecurring items, primarily due to the realization of losses from changes in the Company’s organizational tax structure and the resolution of certain outstanding tax matters. The as adjusted effective tax rate of 28.4% for 2015 excluded the net noncash benefit of $54 million mentioned above, as it will not have a cash flow impact and to ensure comparability among periods presented. Balance Sheet Overview As Adjusted Balance Sheet The following table presents a reconciliation of the consolidated statement of financial condition presented on a GAAP basis to the consolidated statement of financial condition, excluding the impact of separate account assets and separate account collateral held under securities lending agreements (directly related to lending separate account securities) and separate account liabilities and separate account collateral liabilities under securities lending agreements and consolidated sponsored investment funds, including consolidated VIEs. The Company presents the as adjusted balance sheet as additional information to enable investors to exclude certain assets that have equal and offsetting liabilities or noncontrolling interests that ultimately do not have an impact on stockholders’ equity or cash flows. Management views the as adjusted balance sheet, which contains non-GAAP financial measures, as an economic presentation of the Company’s total assets and liabilities; however, it does not advocate that investors consider such non-GAAP financial measures in isolation from, or as a substitute for, financial information prepared in accordance with GAAP. 48 Separate Account Assets and Liabilities and Separate Account Collateral Held under Securities Lending Agreements Separate account assets are maintained by BlackRock Life Limited, a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company that is a registered life insurance company in the United Kingdom, and represent segregated assets held for purposes of funding individual and group pension contracts. The Company records equal and offsetting separate account liabilities. The separate account assets are not available to creditors of the Company and the holders of the pension contracts have no recourse to the Company’s assets. The net investment income attributable to separate account assets accrues directly to the contract owners and is not reported on the consolidated statements of income. While BlackRock has no economic interest in these assets or liabilities, BlackRock earns an investment advisory fee for the service of managing these assets on behalf of its clients. In addition, the Company records on its consolidated statements of financial condition the separate account collateral received under BlackRock Life Limited securities lending arrangements as its own asset in addition to an equal and offsetting separate account collateral liability for the obligation to return the collateral. The collateral is not available to creditors of the Company, and the borrowers under the securities lending arrangements have no recourse to the Company’s assets. Consolidated Sponsored Investment Funds The Company consolidates certain sponsored investment funds accounted for as voting rights entities (“VREs”) and VIEs, (collectively, “Consolidated Sponsored Investment Funds”). See Note 2, Significant Accounting Policies, in the notes to the consolidated financial statements contained in Part II, Item 8 of this filing for more information on the Company’s consolidation policy. The Company cannot readily access cash and cash equivalents or other assets held by Consolidated Sponsored Investment Funds to use in its operating activities. In addition, the Company cannot readily sell investments held by Consolidated Sponsored Investment Funds in order to obtain cash for use in the Company’s operations.

(2) Amounts represent the portion of assets and liabilities of Consolidated Sponsored Investment Funds attributable to NCI. (3) Amounts include property and equipment and other assets. (4) Amount includes approximately $3.9 billion of deferred income tax liabilities related to goodwill and intangibles. See Note 21, Income Taxes, in the notes to the consolidated financial statements contained in Part II, Item 8 of this filing for more information. The following discussion summarizes the significant changes in assets and liabilities on a GAAP basis. Please see the consolidated statements of financial condition as of December 31, 2017 and 2016 contained in Part II, Item 8 of this filing. The discussion does not include changes related to assets and liabilities that are equal and offsetting and have no impact on BlackRock’s stockholders’ equity. Assets. Cash and cash equivalents at December 31, 2017 and 2016 included $63 million and $53 million, respectively, of cash held by consolidated VREs (see Liquidity and Capital Resources for details on the change in cash and cash equivalents during 2017). 49 Accounts receivable at December 31, 2017 increased $584 million from December 31, 2016 primarily due to higher BlackRock mutual funds, iShares ETFs and performance fee receivables. Investments were $1,981 million at December 31, 2017 (for more information see Investments herein). Goodwill and intangible assets increased $128 million from December 31, 2016, primarily due to the First Reserve and Cachematrix Transactions, partially offset by $89 million of amortization of intangible assets. Other assets (including property and equipment) increased $345 million from December 31, 2016, primarily related to an increase in unit trust receivables (substantially offset by an increase in unit trust payables recorded within other liabilities), earnings from certain strategic investments, and other assets, partially offset by a decrease in current taxes receivable. Liabilities. Accrued compensation and benefits at December 31, 2017 increased $273 million from December 31, 2016, primarily due to higher 2017 incentive compensation accruals. Accounts payable and accrued liabilities at December 31, 2017 increased $281 million from December 31, 2016 due to higher current income taxes payables and increased accruals. Net deferred income tax liabilities at December 31, 2017 decreased $1.3 billion, primarily as a result of revaluation of deferred income tax liabilities due to the 2017 Tax Act. Other liabilities increased $343 million from December 31, 2016, primarily related to an increase in unit trust payables (substantially offset by an increase in unit trust receivables recorded within other assets) and contingent liabilities related to the First Reserve Transaction and uncertain tax positions, partially offset by a decrease in other operating liabilities. Investments and Investments of Consolidated VIEs The Company’s investments and investments of consolidated VIEs (collectively, “Total Investments”) were $1,981 million and $1,493 million, respectively, at December 31, 2017. Total Investments include consolidated investments held by sponsored investment funds accounted for as VREs and VIEs. Management reviews BlackRock’s Total Investments on an “economic” basis, which eliminates the portion of Total Investments that does not impact BlackRock’s book value or net income attributable to BlackRock. BlackRock’s management does not advocate that investors consider such non-GAAP financial measures in isolation from, or as a substitute for, financial information prepared in accordance with GAAP. The Company presents Total Investments, as adjusted, to enable investors to understand the portion of Total Investments that is owned by the Company, net of NCI, as a gauge to measure the impact of changes in net nonoperating income (expense) on investments to net income (loss) attributable to BlackRock. The Company further presents net “economic” investment exposure, net of deferred compensation investments and hedged investments, to reflect another helpful measure for investors. The economic impact of Total Investments held pursuant to deferred compensation arrangements is offset by a change in compensation expense. The impact of certain investments is substantially mitigated by swap hedges. Carried interest capital allocations are excluded as there is no impact to BlackRock’s stockholders’ equity until such amounts are realized as performance fees. Finally, the Company’s regulatory investment in Federal Reserve Bank stock, which is not subject to market or interest rate risk, is excluded from the Company’s net economic investment exposure. (in millions) December 31, 2017 December 31, 2016 Investments, GAAP $ 1,981 $ 1,595 Investments held by consolidated VIEs, GAAP 1,493 1,008 Total Investments 3,474 2,603 Investments held by consolidated VIEs (1,493 ) (1,008 ) Investments held by consolidated VREs (512 ) (465 ) Net interest in consolidated VREs 460 444 Net interest in consolidated VIEs(1) 1,225 840 Total Investments, as adjusted 3,154 2,414 Federal Reserve Bank stock (91 ) (89 ) Deferred compensation investments (56 ) (66 ) Hedged investments (587 ) (614 ) Carried interest (VIEs/VREs) (298 ) (126 ) Total “economic” investment exposure $ 2,122 $ 1,519 (1) Amount includes $266 million and $108 million of carried interest (VIEs) as of December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively, which has no impact on the Company’s “economic” investment exposure. The following table represents the carrying value of the Company’s economic investment exposure, by asset type, at December 31, 2017 and 2016: (in millions) December 31, 2017 December 31, 2016 Private equity $ 331 $ 334 Real assets 313 94 Other alternatives(1) 236 245 Other investments(2) 1,242 846 Total “economic” investment exposure $ 2,122 $ 1,519 (1) Other alternatives primarily include hedge funds/funds of hedge funds. (2) Other investments primarily include seed investments in fixed income, equity and multi-asset mutual funds/strategies as well as U.K. government securities, primarily held for regulatory purposes. 50 As adjusted investment activity for 2017 and 2016 was as follows: (in millions) 2017 2016 Total Investments, as adjusted, beginning balance $ 2,414 $ 2,227 Purchases/capital contributions 1,082 1,234 Sales/maturities (696 ) (976 ) Distributions (1) (102 ) (134 ) Market appreciation(depreciation)/earnings from equity method investments 240 82 Carried interest capital allocations/(distributions)/acquired 172 26 Other 44 (45 ) Total Investments, as adjusted, ending balance $ 3,154 $ 2,414 (1) Amount includes distributions representing return of capital and return on investments. LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES BlackRock Cash Flows Excluding the Impact of Consolidated Sponsored Investment Funds The consolidated statements of cash flows include the cash flows of the Consolidated Sponsored Investment Funds. The Company uses an adjusted cash flow statement, which excludes the impact of Consolidated Sponsored Investment Funds, as a supplemental non-GAAP measure to assess liquidity and capital requirements. The Company believes that its cash flows, excluding the impact of the Consolidated Sponsored Investment Funds, provide investors with useful information on the cash flows of BlackRock relating to its ability to fund additional operating, investing and financing activities. BlackRock’s management does not advocate that investors consider such non-GAAP measures in isolation from, or as a substitute for, its cash flows presented in accordance with GAAP. The following table presents a reconciliation of the consolidated statements of cash flows presented on a GAAP basis to the consolidated statements of cash flows, excluding the impact of the cash flows of Consolidated Sponsored Investment Funds: (in millions) GAAP Basis Impact on Cash Flows of Consolidated Sponsored Investment Funds Cash Flows Excluding Impact of Consolidated Sponsored Investment Funds Cash and cash equivalents, December 31, 2015 $ 6,083 $ 100 $ 5,983 Cash flows from operating activities 2,154 (1,063 ) 3,217 Cash flows from investing activities (188 ) (130 ) (58 ) Cash flows from financing activities (1,685 ) 1,146 (2,831 ) Effect of exchange rate changes on cash and cash equivalents (273 ) — (273 ) Net change in cash and cash equivalents 8 (47 ) 55 Cash and cash equivalents, December 31, 2016 $ 6,091 $ 53 $ 6,038 Cash flows from operating activities 3,828 (384 ) 4,212 Cash flows from investing activities (587 ) (70 ) (517 ) Cash flows from financing activities (2,630 ) 464 (3,094 ) Effect of exchange rate changes on cash and cash equivalents 192 — 192 Net change in cash and cash equivalents 803 10 793 Cash and cash equivalents, December 31, 2017 $ 6,894 $ 63 $ 6,831 Sources of BlackRock’s operating cash primarily include investment advisory, administration fees and securities lending revenue, performance fees, revenue from technology and risk management services, advisory and other revenue and distribution fees. BlackRock uses its cash to pay all operating expense, interest and principal on borrowings, income taxes, dividends on BlackRock’s capital stock, repurchases of the Company’s stock, capital expenditures and purchases of co-investments and seed investments. For details of the Company’s GAAP cash flows from operating, investing and financing activities, see the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows contained in Part II, Item 8 of this filing. Cash flows from operating activities, excluding the impact of Consolidated Sponsored Investment Funds, primarily include the receipt of investment advisory and administration fees, securities lending revenue and performance fees offset by the payment of operating expenses incurred in the normal course of business, including year-end incentive compensation accrued for in the prior year. Cash outflows from investing activities, excluding the impact of Consolidated Sponsored Investment Funds, for 2017 were $517 million and primarily reflected $497 million of investment purchases, $155 million of purchases of property and equipment, $73 million related to the First Reserve Transaction and $29 million related to the Cachematrix Transaction, partially offset by $205 million of net proceeds from sales and maturities of certain investments. Cash outflows from financing activities, excluding the impact of Consolidated Sponsored Investment Funds, for 2017 were $3,094 million, primarily resulting from $1.4 billion of share repurchases, including $1.1 billion in open market-transactions and $321 million of employee tax withholdings related to employee stock transactions, $1.7 billion of cash dividend payments and $700 million of repayments of long-term borrowings, partially offset by $697 million of proceeds from issuance of long-term borrowings. 51 The Company manages its financial condition and funding to maintain appropriate liquidity for the business. Liquidity resources at December 31, 2017 and 2016 were as follows: (in millions) December 31, 2017 December 31, 2016 Cash and cash equivalents(1) $ 6,894 $ 6,091 Cash and cash equivalents held by consolidated VREs(2) (63 ) (53 ) Subtotal 6,831 6,038 Credit facility — undrawn 4,000 4,000 Total liquidity resources(3) $ 10,831 $ 10,038 (1) The percentage of cash and cash equivalents held by the Company’s U.S. subsidiaries was approximately 40% and 50% at December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively. See Net Capital Requirements herein for more information on net capital requirements in certain regulated subsidiaries. (2) The Company cannot readily access such cash to use in its operating activities. (3) Amounts do not reflect a reduction for year-end incentive compensation accruals of approximately $1.5 billion and $1.3 billion for 2017 and 2016, respectively, which are paid in the first quarter of the following year. Total liquidity resources increased $793 million during 2017, primarily reflecting cash flows from operating activities, partially offset by cash payments of 2016 year-end incentive awards, share repurchases of $1.4 billion and cash dividend payments of $1.7 billion. A significant portion of the Company’s $3,154 million of Total Investments, as adjusted, is illiquid in nature and, as such, cannot be readily convertible to cash. Share Repurchases. The Company repurchased 2.6 million common shares in open market transactions under the share repurchase program for approximately $1.1 billion during 2017. At December 31, 2017, there were 6.4 million shares still authorized to be repurchased. Net Capital Requirements. The Company is required to maintain net capital in certain regulated subsidiaries within a number of jurisdictions, which is partially maintained by retaining cash and cash equivalent investments in those subsidiaries or jurisdictions. As a result, such subsidiaries of the Company may be restricted in their ability to transfer cash between different jurisdictions and to their parents. Additionally, transfers of cash between international jurisdictions may have adverse tax consequences that could discourage such transfers. BlackRock Institutional Trust Company, N.A. (“BTC”) is chartered as a national bank that does not accept client deposits and whose powers are limited to trust and other fiduciary activities. BTC provides investment management services, including investment advisory and securities lending agency services, to institutional clients. BTC is subject to regulatory capital and liquid asset requirements administered by the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency. At December 31, 2017 and 2016, the Company was required to maintain approximately $1.8 billion and $1.4 billion, respectively, in net capital in certain regulated subsidiaries, including BTC, entities regulated by the Financial Conduct Authority and Prudential Regulation Authority in the United Kingdom, and the Company’s broker-dealers. The Company was in compliance with all applicable regulatory net capital requirements. Undistributed Earnings of Foreign Subsidiaries. As a result of the 2017 Tax Act and the one-time mandatory deemed repatriation tax on untaxed accumulated foreign earnings, a provisional amount of U.S. income taxes was provided on the undistributed foreign earnings. The financial statement basis in excess of tax basis of its foreign subsidiaries remains indefinitely reinvested in foreign operations. The Company will continue to evaluate its capital management plans throughout 2018. Short-Term Borrowings 2017 Revolving Credit Facility. The Company’s credit facility has an aggregate commitment amount of $4.0 billion and was amended in April 2017 to extend the maturity date to April 2022 (the “2017 credit facility”). The 2017 credit facility permits the Company to request up to an additional $1.0 billion of borrowing capacity, subject to lender credit approval, increasing the overall size of the 2017 credit facility to an aggregate principal amount not to exceed $5.0 billion. Interest on borrowings outstanding accrues at a rate based on the applicable London Interbank Offered Rate plus a spread. The 2017 credit facility requires the Company not to exceed a maximum leverage ratio (ratio of net debt to earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, where net debt equals total debt less unrestricted cash) of 3 to 1, which was satisfied with a ratio of less than 1 to 1 at December 31, 2017. The 2017 credit facility provides back-up liquidity to fund ongoing working capital for general corporate purposes and various investment opportunities. At December 31, 2017, the Company had no amount outstanding under the 2017 credit facility. Commercial Paper Program. The Company can issue unsecured commercial paper notes (the “CP Notes”) on a private-placement basis up to a maximum aggregate amount outstanding at any time of $4.0 billion. The commercial paper program is currently supported by the 2017 credit facility. At December 31, 2017, BlackRock had no CP Notes outstanding. 52 Long-Term Borrowings The carrying value of long-term borrowings at December 31, 2017 included the following: (in millions) Maturity Amount Carrying Value Maturity 5.00% Notes $ 1,000 $ 999 December 2019 4.25% Notes 750 747 May 2021 3.375% Notes 750 746 June 2022 3.50% Notes 1,000 994 March 2024 1.25% Notes(1) 841 835 May 2025 3.20% Notes 700 693 March 2027 Total Long-term Borrowings $ 5,041 $ 5,014 (1) The carrying value of the 1.25% Notes estimated using foreign exchange rate as of December 31, 2017. For more information on Company’s borrowings, see Note 12, Borrowings, in the notes to the consolidated financial statements contained in Part II, Item 8 of this filing. Contractual Obligations, Commitments and Contingencies The following table sets forth contractual obligations, commitments and contingencies by year of payment at December 31, 2017: (in millions) 2018 2019 2020 2021 2022 Thereafter(1) Total Contractual obligations and commitments(1): Long-term borrowings(2): Principal $ — $ 1,000 $ — $ 750 $ 750 $ 2,541 $ 5,041 Interest 175 175 125 109 81 185 850 Operating leases 141 132 126 118 109 1,580 2,206 Purchase obligations 128 101 29 22 19 28 327 Investment commitments 298 — — — — — 298 Total contractual obligations and commitments 742 1,408 280 999 959 4,334 8,722 Contingent obligations: Contingent payments related to business acquisitions(3) 33 179 39 34 — — 285 Total contractual obligations, commitments and contingent obligations(4) $ 775 $ 1,587 $ 319 $ 1,033 $ 959 $ 4,334 $ 9,007 (1) Amounts do not include $350 million of cash payment consideration and contingent consideration related to the Company’s agreement to acquire the asset management business of Citibanamex. (2) The amount of principal and interest payments for the 2025 Notes (issued in Euros) represents the expected payment amounts using foreign exchange rates as of December 31, 2017. (3) The amount of contingent payments reflected for any year represents the expected payments using foreign currency exchange rates as of December 31, 2017. The fair value of the remaining aggregate contingent payments at December 31, 2017 totaled $236 million and is included in other liabilities on the consolidated statements of financial condition. (4) At December 31, 2017, the Company had approximately $365 million of net unrecognized tax benefits. Due to the uncertainty of timing and amounts that will ultimately be paid, this amount has been excluded from the table above. Operating Leases. The Company leases its primary office locations under agreements that expire on varying dates through 2043. In connection with certain lease agreements, the Company is responsible for escalation payments. The contractual obligations table above includes only guaranteed minimum lease payments for such leases and does not project potential escalation or other lease-related payments. These leases are classified as operating leases and, as such, are not recorded as liabilities on the consolidated statements of financial condition. In May 2017, the Company entered into an agreement with 50 HYMC Owner LLC, for the lease of approximately 847,000 square feet of office space located at 50 Hudson Yards, New York, New York. The term of the lease is twenty years from the date that rental payments begin, expected to occur in May 2023, with the option to renew for a specified term. The lease requires annual base rental payments of approximately $51 million per year during the first five years of the lease term, increasing every five years to $58 million, $66 million and $74 million per year (or approximately $1.2 billion in base rent over its twenty-year term). This lease is classified as an operating lease and, as such, is not recorded as a liability on the consolidated statements of financial condition. Purchase Obligations. In the ordinary course of business, BlackRock enters into contracts or purchase obligations with third parties whereby the third parties provide services to or on behalf of BlackRock. Purchase obligations included in the contractual obligations table above represent executory contracts, which are either noncancelable or cancelable with a penalty. At December 31, 2017, the Company’s obligations primarily reflected standard service contracts for portfolio services, market data, office-related services and third-party marketing and promotional services, and obligations for equipment. Purchase obligations are recorded on the consolidated financial statements when services are provided and, as such, obligations for services and equipment not received are not included in the consolidated statement of financial condition at December 31, 2017. Investment Commitments. At December 31, 2017, the Company had $298 million of various capital commitments to fund sponsored investment funds, including consolidated VIEs. These funds include private equity funds, real assets funds and opportunistic funds. This amount excludes additional commitments made by consolidated funds of funds to underlying third-party funds as third-party noncontrolling interest holders have the legal obligation to fund the respective commitments of such funds of funds. Generally, the timing of the funding of these commitments is unknown and the commitments are callable on demand at any time prior to the expiration of the commitment. These unfunded commitments are not recorded on the consolidated statements of financial condition. These commitments do not include potential future commitments 53 approved by the Company that are not yet legally binding. The Company intends to make additional capital commitments from time to time to fund additional investment products for, and with, its clients. Contingent Payments Related to Business Acquisitions. In connection with certain acquisitions, BlackRock is required to make contingent payments, subject to achieving specified performance targets, which may include revenue related to acquired contracts or new capital commitments for certain products. The fair value of the remaining aggregate contingent payments at December 31, 2017 totaled $236 million, including $128 million related to the First Reserve Transaction, and is included in other liabilities on the consolidated statements of financial condition. The following items have not been included in the contractual obligations, commitments and contingencies table: Carried Interest Clawback. As a general partner in certain investment funds, including private equity partnerships and certain hedge funds, the Company may receive carried interest cash distributions from the partnerships in accordance with distribution provisions of the partnership agreements. The Company may, from time to time, be required to return all or a portion of such distributions to the limited partners in the event the limited partners do not achieve a return as specified in the various partnership agreements. Therefore, BlackRock records carried interest subject to such clawback provisions in Total Investments, or cash/cash of consolidated VIEs to the extent that it is distributed, and as a deferred carried interest liability/other liabilities of consolidated VIEs on its consolidated statements of financial condition. Carried interest is recorded as performance fees on consolidated statements of income upon the earlier of the termination of the investment fund or when the likelihood of clawback is considered mathematically improbable. Indemnifications. In the ordinary course of business or in connection with certain acquisition agreements, BlackRock enters into contracts pursuant to which it may agree to indemnify third parties in certain circumstances. The terms of these indemnities vary from contract to contract and the amount of indemnification liability, if any, cannot be determined or the likelihood of any liability is considered remote and, therefore, has not been included in the table above or recorded in the consolidated statement of financial condition at December 31, 2017. See further discussion in Note 13, Commitments and Contingencies, in the notes to the consolidated financial statements contained in Part II, Item 8 of this filing. On behalf of certain clients, the Company lends securities to highly rated banks and broker-dealers. In these securities lending transactions, the borrower is required to provide and maintain collateral at or above regulatory minimums. Securities on loan are marked to market daily to determine if the borrower is required to pledge additional collateral. BlackRock has issued certain indemnifications to certain securities lending clients against potential loss resulting from a borrower’s failure to fulfill its obligations under the securities lending agreement should the value of the collateral pledged by the borrower at the time of default be insufficient to cover the borrower’s obligation under the securities lending agreement. At December 31, 2017, the Company indemnified certain of its clients for their securities lending loan balances of approximately $200 billion. The Company held, as agent, cash and securities totaling $214 billion as collateral for indemnified securities on loan at December 31, 2017. The fair value of these indemnifications was not material at December 31, 2017. While the collateral pledged by a borrower is intended to be sufficient to offset the borrower’s obligations to return securities borrowed and any other amounts owing to the lender under the relevant securities lending agreement, in the event of a borrower default, the Company can give no assurance that the collateral pledged by the borrower will be sufficient to fulfill such obligations. If the amount of such pledged collateral is not sufficient to fulfill such obligations to a client for whom the Company has provided indemnification, BlackRock would be responsible for the amount of the shortfall. These indemnifications cover only the collateral shortfall described above, and do not in any way guarantee, assume or otherwise insure the investment performance or return of any cash collateral vehicle into which securities lending cash collateral is invested. Compensation and Benefit Obligations. The Company has various compensation and benefit obligations, including bonuses, commissions and incentive payments payable, defined contribution plan matching contribution obligations, and deferred compensation arrangements, that are excluded from the contractual obligations and commitments table above. Accrued compensation and benefits at December 31, 2017 totaled $2,153 million and included incentive compensation of $1,499 million, deferred compensation of $350 million and other compensation and benefits related obligations of $304 million. Substantially all of the incentive compensation liability was paid in the first quarter of 2018, while the deferred compensation obligations are generally payable over periods of up to three years. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES The preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expense during the reporting periods. Actual results could differ significantly from those estimates. Management considers the following critical accounting policies important to understanding the consolidated financial statements. For a summary of these and additional accounting policies see Note 2, Significant Accounting Policies, in the consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this filing. Consolidation In the normal course of business, the Company is the manager of various types of sponsored investment vehicles. The Company performs an analysis for investment products to determine if the product is a VIE or a VRE. Assessing whether an entity is a VIE or a VRE involves judgment and analysis. Factors considered in this assessment include the entity’s legal organization, the entity’s capital structure and equity ownership, and any related party or de facto agent implications of the Company’s involvement with the entity. Investments that are determined to be VREs are consolidated if the Company can exert control over the financial and operating policies of the investee, which generally exists if there is greater than 50% voting interest. See Note 4, Consolidated Voting Rights Entities, in the notes to the consolidated financial statements contained in Part II, Item 8 of this filing for more information. Investments that are determined to be VIEs are consolidated if the Company is the primary beneficiary (“PB”) of the entity. At December 31, 2017, BlackRock was determined to be the PB for certain investment funds that were determined to be VIEs, which required BlackRock to consolidate them. BlackRock was deemed to be the PB because it has the power to direct the activities that most significantly impact the entities’ economic performance and has the obligation to absorb losses or the right to receive benefits that potentially could be significant to the VIE. The Company generally consolidates VIEs in which it holds an equity ownership interest of 10% or greater and 54 deconsolidates such VIEs once equity ownership falls below 10%. See Note 5, Variable Interest Entities, in the notes to the consolidated financial statements contained in Part II, Item 8 of this filing for more information. Investments Equity Method Investments. For equity investments where BlackRock does not control the investee, and where it is not the PB of a VIE, but can exert significant influence over the financial and operating policies of the investee, the Company follows the equity method of accounting. The evaluation of whether the Company exerts control or significant influence over the financial and operational policies of its investees requires significant judgment based on the facts and circumstances surrounding each individual investment. Factors considered in these evaluations may include the type of investment, the legal structure of the investee, the terms and structure of the investment agreement, including investor voting or other rights, the terms of BlackRock’s advisory agreement or other agreements with the investee, any influence BlackRock may have on the governing board of the investee, the legal rights of other investors in the entity pursuant to the fund’s operating documents and the relationship between BlackRock and other investors in the entity. BlackRock’s equity method investees that are investment companies record their underlying investments at fair value. Therefore, under the equity method of accounting, BlackRock’s share of the investee’s underlying net income predominantly represents fair value adjustments in the investments held by the equity method investees. BlackRock’s share of the investee’s underlying net income or loss is based upon the most currently available information and is recorded as nonoperating income (expense) for investments in investment companies, or as advisory and other revenue for certain strategic investments, which are recorded in other assets, since such investees are considered to be an extension of BlackRock’s core business. At December 31, 2017, the Company had $816 million and $468 million of equity method investments, included in investments and other assets, respectively, and at December 31, 2016, the Company had $730 million and $348 million of equity method investments included in investments and other assets, respectively. Impairments of Investments. Management periodically assesses equity method, available-for-sale, held-to-maturity and cost investments for other-than-temporary impairment (“OTTI”). If an OTTI exists, an impairment charge is recorded in nonoperating income (expense) on the consolidated statements of income. For equity method, held-to-maturity and cost method investments, if circumstances indicate that an OTTI may exist, the investments are evaluated using market values, where available, or the expected future cash flows of the investment. If the Company determines an OTTI exists, an impairment charge is recognized for the excess of the carrying amount of the investment over its estimated fair value. For available-for-sale securities, when the fair value is lower than cost, the Company considers, among other factors, the length of time the security has been in a loss position, the extent to which the security’s fair value is less than cost, the financial condition and near-term prospects of the security’s issuer and the Company’s ability and intent to hold the security for a length of time sufficient to allow for recovery of such unrealized losses. For equity securities, if the impairment is considered other-than-temporary, an impairment charge is recognized for the excess of the carrying amount of the investment over its fair value. For debt securities, the Company considers whether: (1) it has the intent to sell the security; (2) it is more likely than not that it will be required to sell the security before recovery; or (3) it expects to recover the entire amortized cost basis of the security. If the Company intends to sell the security or it is more likely than not that it will be required to sell the security, the entire difference between the amortized cost and fair value must be recognized in earnings. If the Company does not intend to sell a security and it is not more likely than not that it will be required to sell the security but the security has suffered an impairment related to credit, the credit loss will be bifurcated from the total decline in value and recorded in earnings with the remaining portion recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income. For the Company’s investments in CLOs, the Company reviews cash flow estimates over the life of each CLO investment. On a quarterly basis, if the present value of the estimated future cash flows is lower than the carrying value of the investment and there is an adverse change in estimated cash flows, an impairment is considered to be other-than-temporary. An impairment charge is recognized for the excess of the carrying amount of the investment over its estimated fair value. Evaluation of impairments involves significant assumptions and management judgments, which could differ from actual results, and these differences could have a material impact on the consolidated statements of income. Fair Value Measurements The Company’s assessment of the significance of a particular input to the fair value measurement according to the fair value hierarchy (i.e., Level 1, 2 and 3 inputs, as defined) in its entirety requires judgment and considers factors specific to the financial instrument. See Note 2, Significant Accounting Policies, in the consolidated financial statements contained in Part II, Item 8 of this filing for more information on fair value measurements. Changes in Valuation. Changes in value on $2,878 million of Total Investments will impact the Company’s nonoperating income (expense), $103 million will impact accumulated other comprehensive income, $195 million are held at cost or amortized cost and the remaining $298 million relates to carried interest, which will not impact nonoperating income (expense). At December 31, 2017, changes in fair value of approximately $1,739 million of consolidated VIEs/VREs will impact BlackRock’s net income (loss) attributable to noncontrolling interests on the consolidated statements of income. BlackRock’s net exposure to changes in fair value of consolidated VIEs/VREs was $1,419 million. 55 Goodwill and Intangible Assets The value of advisory contracts acquired in business acquisitions to manage AUM in proprietary open-end investment funds as well as collective trust funds without a specified termination date are classified as indefinite-lived intangible assets. The assignment of indefinite lives to such investment fund contracts is based upon the assumption there is no foreseeable limit on the contract period to manage these funds due to the likelihood of continued renewal at little or no cost. In addition, trade names/trademarks are considered indefinite-lived intangibles as they are expected to generate cash flows indefinitely. Goodwill represents the cost of a business acquisition in excess of the fair value of the net assets acquired. Indefinite-lived intangible assets and goodwill are not amortized. Finite-lived management contracts and investor/customer relationships, which relate to acquired separate accounts and funds with a specified termination date, are amortized over their remaining expected useful lives, which, at December 31, 2017, ranged from 1 to 11 years with a weighted-average remaining estimated useful life of 6.5 years. Goodwill. The Company assesses its goodwill for impairment at least annually, considering such factors as the book value and the market capitalization of the Company. The impairment assessment performed as of July 31, 2017 indicated no impairment charge was required. The Company continues to monitor its book value per share compared with closing prices of its common stock for potential indicators of impairment. At December 31, 2017, the Company’s common stock closed at $513.71, which exceeded its book value of approximately $197.61 per share. Indefinite-lived and finite-lived intangibles. The Company performs assessments to determine if any intangible assets are impaired and whether the indefinite-life and finite-life classifications are still appropriate. In evaluating whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of indefinite-lived intangibles is less than carrying value, BlackRock performed certain quantitative assessments and assessed various significant qualitative factors including AUM, revenue basis points, projected AUM growth rates, operating margins, tax rates and discount rates. In addition, the Company considered other factors including: (i) macroeconomic conditions such as a deterioration in general economic conditions, limitations on accessing capital, fluctuations in foreign exchange rates, or other developments in equity and credit markets; (ii) industry and market considerations such as a deterioration in the environment in which an entity operates, an increased competitive environment, a decline in market-dependent multiples or metrics, a change in the market for an entity’s services, or regulatory, legal or political developments; and (iii) entity-specific events, such as a change in management or key personnel, overall financial performance and litigation that could affect significant inputs used to determine the fair value of the indefinite-lived intangible asset. If an indefinite-lived intangible is determined to be more likely than not impaired, then the fair value of the asset is compared with its carrying value and any excess of the carrying value over the fair value would be recognized as an expense in the period in which the impairment occurs. For finite-lived intangible assets, if potential impairment circumstances are considered to exist, the Company will perform a recoverability test, using an undiscounted cash flow analysis. Actual results could differ from these cash flow estimates, which could materially impact the impairment conclusion. If the carrying value of the asset is determined not to be recoverable based on the undiscounted cash flow test, the difference between the book value of the asset and its current fair value would be recognized as an expense in the period in which the impairment occurs. In addition, management judgment is required to estimate the period over which finite-lived intangible assets will contribute to the Company’s cash flows and the pattern in which these assets will be consumed. A change in the remaining useful life of any of these assets, or the reclassification of an indefinite-lived intangible asset to a finite-lived intangible asset, could have a significant impact on the Company’s amortization expense, which was $89 million, $99 million and $128 million for 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively. In 2017, 2016 and 2015, the Company performed impairment tests, including evaluating various qualitative factors and performing certain quantitative assessments. The Company determined that no impairment charges were required, the classification of indefinite-lived versus finite-lived intangibles was still appropriate and no changes to the expected lives of the finite-lived intangibles were required. The Company continuously monitors various factors, including AUM, for potential indicators of impairment. Income Taxes Deferred income tax assets and liabilities are recognized for future tax consequences attributable to temporary differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases using currently enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to reverse. The effect of a change in tax rates on deferred tax assets and liabilities is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date. Significant management judgment is required in estimating the ranges of possible outcomes and determining the probability of favorable or unfavorable tax outcomes and potential interest and penalties related to such unfavorable outcomes. Actual future tax consequences relating to uncertain tax positions may be materially different than the Company’s current estimates. At December 31, 2017, BlackRock had $629 million of gross unrecognized tax benefits, of which $316 million, if recognized, would affect the effective tax rate. Management is required to estimate the timing of the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities, make assumptions about the future deductibility of deferred income tax assets and assess deferred income tax liabilities based on enacted tax rates for the appropriate tax jurisdictions to determine the amount of such deferred income tax assets and liabilities. At December 31, 2017, the Company had deferred tax assets of $19 million and net deferred tax liabilities of approximately $3,538 million on the consolidated statement of financial condition. Changes in deferred tax assets and liabilities may occur in certain circumstances, including statutory income tax rate changes, statutory tax law changes, changes in the anticipated timing of recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities or changes in the structure or tax status of the Company. The Company assesses whether a valuation allowance should be established against its deferred income tax assets based on consideration of all available evidence, both positive and negative, using a more likely than not standard. The assessment considers, among other matters, the nature, frequency and severity of recent losses, forecast of future profitability, the duration of statutory carry back and carry forward periods, the Company’s experience with tax attributes expiring unused, and tax planning alternatives. 56 The Company records income taxes based upon its estimated income tax liability or benefit. The Company’s actual tax liability or benefit may differ from the estimated income tax liability or benefit. The Company had current income taxes receivables of approximately $142 million and current income taxes payables of $256 million at December 31, 2017. For further information on the 2017 Tax Act, see Note 21, Income Taxes, in the consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this filing. Revenue Recognition Investment advisory and administration fees are recognized as the services are performed. Such fees are primarily based on agreed-upon percentages of the net asset value of AUM or committed capital. Investment advisory and administration fees are affected by changes in AUM, including market appreciation or depreciation, foreign exchange translation and net inflows or outflows. Investment advisory and administration fees for investment funds are shown net of fees waived pursuant to contractual expense limitations of the funds or voluntary waivers. The Company contracts with third parties and related parties for various fund distribution and shareholder servicing to be performed on behalf of certain funds the Company manages. Such arrangements generally are priced as a portion of the fee paid by the fund. In certain cases, the fund (primarily international funds) takes on the primary responsibility for payment for services such that the Company bears no credit risk to the third-party. The Company currently records its management fees net of retrocessions. The Company has additional contracts for similar services with third parties, which due to the terms of the contracts, are recorded as distribution and servicing costs and thus not netted on the consolidated statements of income. The Company earns revenue by lending securities as an agent on behalf of clients, primarily to brokerage institutions. Revenue is accounted for on an accrual basis. The securities loaned are secured by collateral, generally ranging from 102% to 112% of the value of the loaned securities. Generally, the revenue earned is shared between the Company and the funds or other third-party accounts managed by the Company from which the securities are borrowed. For 2017, 2016 and 2015, securities lending revenue earned by the Company totaled $597 million, $579 million and $513 million, respectively, and is recorded in investment advisory, administration fees and securities lending revenue on the consolidated statements of income. Investment advisory, administration fees and securities lending revenue are reported together as the fees for these services often are agreed upon with clients as a bundled fee. The Company receives investment advisory performance fees or incentive allocations, from certain actively managed investment funds and certain separately managed accounts. These performance fees are dependent upon exceeding specified relative or absolute investment return thresholds. Such fees are recorded upon completion of the measurement period, which varies by product or account, and could be monthly, quarterly, annually or longer. In addition, the Company is allocated carried interest from certain alternative investment products upon exceeding performance thresholds. BlackRock may be required to reverse/return all, or part, of such carried interest allocations depending upon future performance of these funds. Therefore, BlackRock records carried interest subject to such clawback provisions in Total Investments or cash/cash of consolidated VIEs to the extent that it is distributed, on its consolidated statements of financial condition. Carried interest is recorded as performance fee revenue upon the earlier of the termination of the investment fund or when the likelihood of clawback is considered mathematically improbable. The Company records a deferred carried interest liability to the extent it receives cash or capital allocations related to carried interest prior to meeting the revenue recognition criteria. At December 31, 2017 and 2016, the Company had $219 million and $152 million, respectively, of deferred carried interest recorded in other liabilities/other liabilities of consolidated VIEs on the consolidated statements of financial condition. A portion of the deferred carried interest liability will be paid to certain employees. The ultimate timing of the recognition of performance fee revenue, if any, for these products is unknown. The following table presents changes in the deferred carried interest liability (including the portion related to consolidated VIEs) for 2017 and 2016: (in millions) 2017 2016 Beginning balance $ 152 $ 143 Net increase (decrease) in unrealized allocations 75 37 Performance fee revenue recognized (21 ) (28 ) Acquisition 13 — Ending balance $ 219 $ 152 For 2017, 2016 and 2015, performance fee revenue (which included recognized carried interest) totaled $594 million, $295 million and $621 million, respectively. Fees earned for technology and risk management revenue are recorded as services are performed and are generally determined using the value of positions on the Aladdin platform or on a fixed-rate basis. For 2017, 2016 and 2016, technology and risk management revenue totaled $677 million, $595 million and $528 million, respectively. Adjustments to revenue arising from initial estimates recorded historically have been immaterial since the majority of BlackRock’s investment advisory and administration revenue is calculated based on AUM and since the Company does not record performance fee revenue until performance thresholds have been exceeded and the likelihood of clawback is mathematically improbable. 57 Accounting Developments Recent Accounting Pronouncements Not Yet Adopted. Revenue from Contracts with Customers. In May 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) issued Accounting Standards Update (“ASU”) 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (“ASU 2014-09”). ASU 2014-09 outlines a single comprehensive model for entities to use in accounting for revenue arising from contracts with customers and supersedes most current revenue recognition guidance, including industry-specific guidance. The guidance also changes the accounting for certain contract costs and revises the criteria for determining if an entity is acting as a principal or agent in certain arrangements. The key changes in the standard that impact the Company’s revenue recognition relate to the presentation of certain revenue contracts and associated contract costs. The most significant of these changes relates to the presentation of certain distribution costs, which are currently presented net against revenues (contra-revenue) and will be presented as an expense on a gross basis. The Company adopted ASU 2014-09 effective January 1, 2018 on a full retrospective basis, which will require 2016 and 2017 to be restated in future filings. The cumulative effect adjustment to the 2016 opening retained earnings was not material. The Company currently expects the net gross up to revenue to be approximately $1 billion with a corresponding gross up to expense for both 2016 and 2017. Consequently, the Company expects its GAAP operating margin to decline upon adoption due to the gross up of revenue. However, no material impact is expected on the Company’s as adjusted operating margin. For accounting pronouncements that the Company adopted during the year ended December 31, 2017 and for additional recent accounting pronouncements not yet adopted, see Note 2, Significant Accounting Policies, in the consolidated financial statements contained in Part II, Item 8 of this filing. Item 7a. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk AUM Market Price Risk. BlackRock’s investment advisory and administration fees are primarily comprised of fees based on a percentage of the value of AUM and, in some cases, performance fees expressed as a percentage of the returns realized on AUM. At December 31, 2017, the majority of the Company’s investment advisory and administration fees were based on average or period end AUM of the applicable investment funds or separate accounts. Movements in equity market prices, interest rates/credit spreads, foreign exchange rates or all three could cause the value of AUM to decline, which would result in lower investment advisory and administration fees. Corporate Investments Portfolio Risks. As a leading investment management firm, BlackRock devotes significant resources across all of its operations to identifying, measuring, monitoring, managing and analyzing market and operating risks, including the management and oversight of its own investment portfolio. The Board of Directors of the Company has adopted guidelines for the review of investments to be made by the Company, requiring, among other things, that investments be reviewed by certain senior officers of the Company, and that certain investments may be referred to the Audit Committee or the Board of Directors, depending on the circumstances, for approval. In the normal course of its business, BlackRock is exposed to equity market price risk, interest rate/credit spread risk and foreign exchange rate risk associated with its corporate investments. BlackRock has investments primarily in sponsored investment products that invest in a variety of asset classes, including real assets, private equity and hedge funds. Investments generally are made for co-investment purposes, to establish a performance track record, to hedge exposure to certain deferred compensation plans or for regulatory purposes. Currently, the Company has a seed capital hedging program in which it enters into swaps to hedge market and interest rate exposure to certain investments. At December 31, 2017, the Company had outstanding total return swaps with an aggregate notional value of approximately $587 million. At December 31, 2017, there were no outstanding interest rate swaps. At December 31, 2017, approximately $2.0 billion of BlackRock’s Total Investments were maintained in consolidated sponsored investment funds accounted for as VREs and VIEs. Excluding the impact of the Federal Reserve Bank stock, carried interest, investments made to hedge exposure to certain deferred compensation plans and certain investments that are hedged via the seed capital hedging program, the Company’s economic exposure to its investment portfolio is $2.1 billion. See Balance Sheet Overview-Investments and Investments of Consolidated VIEs in Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations for further information on the Company’s Total Investments. Equity Market Price Risk. At December 31, 2017, the Company’s net exposure to equity market price risk in its investment portfolio was approximately $946 million of the Company’s total economic investment exposure. Investments subject to market price risk include private equity and real assets investments, hedge funds and funds of funds as well as mutual funds. The Company estimates that a hypothetical 10% adverse change in market prices would result in a decrease of approximately $94.6 million in the carrying value of such investments. Interest-Rate/Credit Spread Risk. At December 31, 2017, the Company was exposed to interest rate risk and credit spread risk as a result of approximately $1,176 million of Total Investments in debt securities and sponsored investment products that invest primarily in debt securities. Management considered a hypothetical 100 basis point fluctuation in interest rates or credit spreads and estimates that the impact of such a fluctuation on these investments, in the aggregate, would result in a decrease, or increase, of approximately $19 million in the carrying value of such investments. Foreign Exchange Rate Risk. As discussed above, the Company invests in sponsored investment products that invest in a variety of asset classes. The carrying value of the total economic investment exposure denominated in foreign currencies, primarily the British pound and Euro, was $483 million at December 31, 2017. A 10% adverse change in the applicable foreign exchange rates would result in approximately a $48.3 million decline in the carrying value of such investments. Other Market Risks. The Company executes forward foreign currency exchange contracts to mitigate the risk of certain foreign exchange risk movements. At December 31, 2017, the Company had outstanding forward foreign currency exchange contracts with an aggregate notional value of approximately $1.5 billion. 58",2023-12-30 18:58:53.118306

Overview BlackRock, Inc. (together, with its subsidiaries, unless the context otherwise indicates, “BlackRock” or the “Company”) is a leading publicly traded investment management firm with $7.43 trillion of AUM at December 31, 2019. With approximately 16,200 employees in more than 30 countries, BlackRock provides a broad range of investment and technology services to institutional and retail clients in more than 100 countries across the globe. For further information see Note 1, Business Overview, and Note 27, Segment Information, in the notes to the consolidated financial statements contained in Part II, Item 8. The following discussion includes a comparison of BlackRock’s results for 2019 and 2018. For a discussion of BlackRock’s results for 2017, see “Item 7 - Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” of the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2018, which was filed with the SEC on February 28, 2019. Certain prior period presentations and disclosures, while not required to be recast, were reclassified to ensure comparability with current period classifications. United Kingdom Exit from European Union Following the June 2016 vote to exit the European Union (“EU”), commonly referred to as Brexit, the United Kingdom (“UK”) left the EU on January 31, 2020 and entered an eleven-month transition period during which the UK, and UK-based entities, will retain the rights and obligations of EU membership. Substantial uncertainty remains surrounding the future relationship between the UK and EU, but the UK government has indicated its preference for negotiating a trade deal with the EU before the end of the transition period rather than continuing Single Market or Customs Union membership. BlackRock is implementing a number of steps to prepare for various outcomes, including there being no agreement in place when the transition period expires. These steps, many of which are time consuming and costly, include effecting organizational, governance and operational changes, applying for and receiving licenses and permissions in the EU, and engaging in client communications, and are expected to add complexity to BlackRock’s European operations. In addition, depending on the terms of the future relationship between the UK and the EU, BlackRock may experience further organizational and operational challenges and incur additional costs in connection with its European operations during the transition period and post-Brexit, which may impede the Company’s growth or impact its financial performance. 34 Acquisition On May 10, 2019, the Company acquired 100% of the equity interests of eFront Holding SAS (“eFront Transaction” or “eFront”), a leading alternative investment management software and solutions provider for approximately $1.3 billion, excluding the settlement of eFront’s outstanding debt. The acquisition of eFront expands Aladdin’s illiquid alternative capabilities and enables BlackRock to provide individual alternative or whole-portfolio technology solutions to clients. Business Outlook BlackRock's framework for long-term value creation is predicated on generating differentiated organic growth, leveraging scale to increase operating margins over time, and returning capital to shareholders on a consistent basis. BlackRock's diversified platform, in terms of style, product, client and geography, enables it to generate more stable cash flows through market cycles, positioning BlackRock to invest for the long-term by striking an appropriate balance between investing for future growth and prudent discretionary expense management. BlackRock’s investment management revenue is primarily comprised of fees earned as a percentage of AUM and, in some cases, performance fees, which are normally expressed as a percentage of fund returns to the client. Numerous factors, including price movements in the equity, debt or currency markets, or in the price of real assets, commodities or alternative investments in which BlackRock invests on behalf of clients, could impact BlackRock’s AUM, revenue and earnings. BlackRock manages $3.8 trillion of equity assets across markets globally. Beta divergence between equity markets, where certain markets perform differently than others, may lead to an increase in the proportion of BlackRock AUM weighted toward lower fee equity products, resulting in a decline in BlackRock’s effective fee rate. Divergent market factors may also erode the correlation between the growth rates of AUM and base fees. BlackRock’s highly diversified multi-product platform was created to meet client needs in all market environments. BlackRock is positioned to provide alpha-seeking active, index and cash management investment strategies across asset classes and geographies. In addition, BlackRock leverages its world-class risk management, analytics and technology capabilities, including the Aladdin platform, on behalf of clients. BlackRock serves a diverse mix of institutional and retail clients across the globe, including investors in iShares ETFs, maintaining differentiated client relationships and a fiduciary focus. The diversity of BlackRock’s platform facilitates the generation of organic growth in various market environments, and as client preferences evolve. Client demand continues for ETFs and illiquid alternatives, which are two areas of focus for BlackRock. The index investing industry has been growing rapidly – with ETFs as a major beneficiary – driven by structural tailwinds including the migration from commission-based to fee-based wealth management, clients’ focus on value for money, the use of ETFs as alpha tools and the growth of all-to-all networked trading. iShares ETFs’ growth strategy is centered on increasing scale and pursuing global growth themes in client and product segments, including Core, Strategic, which includes Fixed Income, Factors, Sustainable and Megatrends ETFs, and Precision Exposures. As the wealth management landscape shifts globally from individual product selection to a whole-portfolio approach, BlackRock’s retail strategy is focused on creating outcome-oriented client solutions. This includes having a diverse platform of alpha-seeking active, index and alternative products, as well as enhanced distribution and portfolio construction technology offerings. Digital wealth tools are an important component of BlackRock’s retail strategy, as BlackRock scales and customizes model portfolios, extends Aladdin Wealth and digital wealth partnerships globally, and helps advisors build better portfolios through portfolio construction and risk management, powered by Aladdin. BlackRock continues to invest in technology services offerings, which enhance the ability to manage portfolios and risk, effectively serve clients and operate efficiently. Anticipated industry consolidation and regulatory requirements should continue to drive demand for holistic and flexible technology solutions. In 2019, BlackRock completed the acquisition of eFront, a leading end-to-end alternative investment management software and solutions provider. eFront, in combination with Aladdin, will provide clients with an ability to manage portfolios and risk across public and private asset classes on a single platform. Across BlackRock, more clients are focusing on the impact of sustainability on their portfolios. This shift has been driven by an increased understanding of how sustainability-related factors can affect economic growth, asset values, and financial markets as a whole. As a fiduciary, BlackRock is committed to helping clients build more resilient portfolios. Since sustainable investment options have the potential to offer clients better outcomes, we are making sustainability integral to the way BlackRock manages risk, constructs portfolios, designs products, and engages with companies. Over the past several years, BlackRock has been deepening the integration of sustainability into technology, risk management, and product choice across BlackRock, and plans to accelerate those efforts. 35 Executive Summary (in millions, except shares and per share data) 2019 2018 GAAP basis: Total revenue $ 14,539 $ 14,198 Total expense 8,988 8,741 Operating income $ 5,551 $ 5,457 Operating margin 38.2 % 38.4 % Nonoperating income (expense), less net income (loss) attributable to noncontrolling interests 186 (76 ) Income tax expense (1,261 ) (1,076 ) Net income attributable to BlackRock $ 4,476 $ 4,305 Diluted earnings per common share $ 28.43 $ 26.58 Effective tax rate 22.0 % 20.0 % As adjusted(1): Operating income $ 5,551 $ 5,531 Operating margin 43.7 % 44.3 % Nonoperating income (expense), less net income (loss) attributable to noncontrolling interests $ 186 $ (76 ) Net income attributable to BlackRock $ 4,484 $ 4,361 Diluted earnings per common share $ 28.48 $ 26.93 Effective tax rate 21.9 % 20.0 % Other: Assets under management (end of period) $ 7,429,633 $ 5,975,818 Diluted weighted-average common shares outstanding(2) 157,459,546 161,948,732 Common and preferred shares outstanding (end of period) 155,198,968 158,520,147 Book value per share(3) $ 216.15 $ 204.23 Cash dividends declared and paid per share $ 13.20 $ 12.02 (1) As adjusted items are described in more detail in Non-GAAP Financial Measures. (2) Nonvoting participating preferred shares are considered to be common stock equivalents for purposes of determining basic and diluted earnings per share calculations. (3) Total BlackRock stockholders’ equity, divided by total common and preferred shares outstanding at December 31 of the respective year-end. 2019 Compared with 2018 GAAP. Operating income of $5,551 million increased $94 million from 2018. Operating income growth reflected higher base fees and technology services revenue, partially offset by higher compensation and benefits expense and higher general and administration expense. Operating income for 2019 also included $61 million of product launch costs associated with the close of the $1.4 billion BlackRock Science and Technology Trust II, a closed-end active equity fund. Operating income for 2018 included a restructuring charge of $60 million from an initiative to modify the size and shape of the workforce. Nonoperating income (expense), less net income (loss) attributable to noncontrolling interests (“NCI”), increased $262 million from 2018 driven by higher marks on unhedged seed capital investments and the revaluation of certain minority investments. Nonoperating results for 2018 included a $40 million pre-tax gain related to the sale of the Company’s minority interest in DSP BlackRock Investment Managers Pvt. Ltd. to The DSP Group (“DSP Transaction”). Income tax expense for 2019 included $28 million of discrete tax benefits, primarily related to stock-based compensation awards. Income tax expense for 2018 included $145 million of discrete tax benefits, primarily related to changes in the Company’s organizational entity structure and stock-based compensation awards. See Income Tax Expense within Discussion of Financial Results for more information. Diluted earnings per common share increased $1.85, or 7%, from 2018, reflecting higher operating and nonoperating income, and a lower diluted share count, partially offset by a higher effective tax rate in the current year. As Adjusted. Operating income of $5,551 million increased $20 million from 2018. In 2018, the pre-tax restructuring charge of $60 million described above has been excluded from as adjusted results. Diluted earnings per common share increased $1.55, or 6%, from 2018, driven primarily by higher nonoperating income and a lower diluted share count, partially offset by a higher effective tax rate. See Non-GAAP Financial Measures for further information on as adjusted items. For further discussion of BlackRock’s revenue, expense, nonoperating results and income tax expense, see Discussion of Financial Results herein. 36 Non-GAAP Financial Measures BlackRock reports its financial results in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (“GAAP”); however, management believes evaluating the Company’s ongoing operating results may be enhanced if investors have additional non-GAAP financial measures. Management reviews non-GAAP financial measures to assess ongoing operations and considers them to be helpful, for both management and investors, in evaluating BlackRock’s financial performance over time. Management also uses non-GAAP financial measures as a benchmark to compare its performance with other companies and to enhance the comparability of this information for the reporting periods presented. Non-GAAP measures may pose limitations because they do not include all of BlackRock’s revenue and expense. BlackRock’s management does not advocate that investors consider such non-GAAP financial measures in isolation from, or as a substitute for, financial information prepared in accordance with GAAP. Non-GAAP measures may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures of other companies. Management uses both GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures in evaluating BlackRock’s financial performance. Adjustments to GAAP financial measures (“non-GAAP adjustments”) include certain items management deems nonrecurring or that occur infrequently, transactions that ultimately will not impact BlackRock’s book value or certain tax items that do not impact cash flow. Computations for all periods are derived from the consolidated statements of income as follows: (1) Operating income, as adjusted, and operating margin, as adjusted: Management believes operating income, as adjusted, and operating margin, as adjusted, are effective indicators of BlackRock’s financial performance over time and, therefore, provide useful disclosure to investors. Management believes that operating margin, as adjusted, reflects the Company’s long-term ability to manage ongoing costs in relation to its revenues. The Company uses operating margin, as adjusted, to assess the Company’s financial performance and to determine the long-term and annual compensation of the Company’s senior-level employees. Furthermore, this metric is used to evaluate the Company’s relative performance against industry peers, as it eliminates margin variability arising from the accounting of revenues and expenses related to distributing different product structures in multiple distribution channels utilized by asset managers. (in millions) 2019 2018 Operating income, GAAP basis $ 5,551 $ 5,457 Non-GAAP expense adjustments: Restructuring charge — 60 PNC LTIP funding obligation — 14 Operating income, as adjusted 5,551 5,531 Product launch costs and commissions 61 13 Operating income used for operating margin measurement $ 5,612 $ 5,544 Revenue, GAAP basis $ 14,539 $ 14,198 Non-GAAP adjustments: Distribution fees (1,069 ) (1,155 ) Investment advisory fees (616 ) (520 ) Revenue used for operating margin measurement $ 12,854 $ 12,523 Operating margin, GAAP basis 38.2 % 38.4 % Operating margin, as adjusted 43.7 % 44.3 % • Operating income, as adjusted, includes non-GAAP expense adjustments. In 2018, a restructuring charge, primarily comprised of severance and accelerated amortization expense of previously granted deferred compensation awards, has been excluded to provide more meaningful analysis of BlackRock’s ongoing operations and to ensure comparability among periods presented. In 2018, the portion of compensation expense associated with certain long-term incentive plans (“LTIP”) funded, or to be funded, through share distributions to participants of BlackRock stock held by PNC has been excluded because it ultimately does not impact BlackRock’s book value. • Operating income used for measuring operating margin, as adjusted, is equal to operating income, as adjusted, excluding the impact of product launch costs (e.g. closed-end fund launch costs) and related commissions. Management believes the exclusion of such costs and related commissions is useful because these costs can fluctuate considerably and revenue associated with the expenditure of these costs will not fully impact BlackRock’s results until future periods. • Revenue used for calculating operating margin, as adjusted, is reduced to exclude all of the Company’s distribution fees, which are recorded as a separate line item on the consolidated statements of income, as well as a portion of investment advisory fees received that is used to pay distribution and servicing costs. For certain products, based on distinct arrangements, distribution fees are collected by the Company and then passed-through to third-party client intermediaries. For other products, investment advisory fees are collected by the Company and a portion is passed-through to third-party client intermediaries. However, in both structures, the third-party client intermediary similarly owns the relationship with the retail client and is responsible for distributing the product and servicing the client. The amount of distribution and investment advisory fees fluctuates each period primarily based on a predetermined percentage of the value of AUM during the period. These fees also vary based on the type of investment product sold and the geographic location where it is sold. In addition, the Company may waive fees on certain products that could result in the reduction of payments to the third-party intermediaries. 37 (2) Net income attributable to BlackRock, Inc., as adjusted: (in millions, except per share data) 2019 2018 Net income attributable to BlackRock, Inc., GAAP basis $ 4,476 $ 4,305 Non-GAAP adjustments: Restructuring charge, net of tax — 47 PNC LTIP funding obligation, net of tax — 12 Other income tax matters 8 (3 ) Net income attributable to BlackRock, Inc., as adjusted $ 4,484 $ 4,361 Diluted weighted-average common shares outstanding (3) 157.5 161.9 Diluted earnings per common share, GAAP basis (3) $ 28.43 $ 26.58 Diluted earnings per common share, as adjusted (3) $ 28.48 $ 26.93 Management believes net income attributable to BlackRock, Inc., as adjusted, and diluted earnings per common share, as adjusted, are useful measures of BlackRock’s profitability and financial performance. Net income attributable to BlackRock, Inc., as adjusted, equals net income attributable to BlackRock, Inc., GAAP basis, adjusted for significant nonrecurring items, charges that ultimately will not impact BlackRock’s book value or certain tax items that do not impact cash flow. See aforementioned discussion regarding operating income, as adjusted, and operating margin, as adjusted, for information on the PNC LTIP funding obligation and restructuring charge. For each period presented, the non-GAAP adjustment related to the restructuring charge and PNC LTIP funding obligation was tax effected at the respective blended rates applicable to the adjustments. Amounts for income tax matters represent net noncash (benefits) expense primarily associated with the revaluation of certain deferred tax liabilities related to intangible assets and goodwill as a result of tax rate changes. Amounts have been excluded from the as adjusted results as these items will not have a cash flow impact and to ensure comparability among periods presented. Per share amounts reflect net income attributable to BlackRock, Inc., as adjusted divided by diluted weighted average common shares outstanding. (3) Nonvoting participating preferred stock is considered to be a common stock equivalent for purposes of determining basic and diluted earnings per share calculations. 38 Assets Under Management AUM for reporting purposes generally is based upon how investment advisory and administration fees are calculated for each portfolio. Net asset values, total assets, committed assets or other measures may be used to determine portfolio AUM.

(2) Amount for 2018 represents $5.4 billion and $25.6 billion of net AUM from the acquisitions of Tennenbaum Capital Partners in August 2018 (“TCP Transaction”) and the asset management business of Citibanamex in September 2018 (“Citibanamex Transaction”), respectively. In addition, amounts include $18.6 billion and $2.3 billion of AUM reclassifications and net dispositions, respectively, related to the transfer of BlackRock’s UK Defined Contribution Administration and Platform business to Aegon N.V. in July 2018 (“Aegon Transaction”) and $1.2 billion of net AUM dispositions related to the DSP Transaction. (3) Foreign exchange reflects the impact of translating non-US dollar denominated AUM into US dollars for reporting purposes. BlackRock has historically grown AUM through organic growth and acquisitions. Management believes that the Company will be able to continue to grow AUM organically by focusing on strong investment performance, efficient delivery of beta for index products, client service, developing new products and optimizing distribution capabilities.

AUM increased $1.5 trillion to $7.43 trillion at December 31, 2019 from $5.98 trillion at December 31, 2018 driven by net market appreciation and positive net flows across all investment styles and product types. Net market appreciation of $994.1 billion was driven primarily by higher global equity and fixed income markets. AUM increased $31 billion due to the impact of foreign exchange movements, primarily due to the weakening of the US dollar, largely against the British pound.

(3) Average AUM is calculated as the average of the month-end spot AUM amounts for the trailing thirteen months. (4) Advisory AUM represents long-term portfolio liquidation assignments. (5) Amounts include commodity iShares ETFs. AUM decreased $312.4 billion to $5.98 trillion at December 31, 2018 from $6.29 trillion at December 31, 2017 driven by net market depreciation and the impact of foreign exchange movements, partially offset by positive long-term net flows, led by iShares ETFs, active multi-asset and illiquid alternatives, and net AUM added from strategic transactions. Net market depreciation of $384.1 billion was driven by lower global equity markets. AUM decreased $79.4 billion due to the impact of foreign exchange movements, primarily due to the strengthening of the US dollar, largely against the British pound and Euro. 43 Discussion of Financial Results Introduction The Company derives a substantial portion of its revenue from investment advisory and administration fees, which are recognized as the services are performed over time because the customer is receiving and consuming the benefits as they are provided by the Company. Fees are primarily based on agreed-upon percentages of AUM and recognized for services provided during the period, which are distinct from services provided in other periods. Such fees are affected by changes in AUM, including market appreciation or depreciation, foreign exchange translation and net inflows or outflows. Net inflows or outflows represent the sum of new client assets, additional fundings from existing clients (including dividend reinvestment), withdrawals of assets from, and termination of, client accounts and distributions to investors representing return of capital and return on investments to investors. Market appreciation or depreciation includes current income earned on, and changes in the fair value of, securities held in client accounts. Foreign exchange translation reflects the impact of translating non-US dollar denominated AUM into US dollars for reporting purposes. The Company also earns revenue by lending securities on behalf of clients, primarily to highly rated banks and broker-dealers. The securities loaned are secured by collateral in the form of cash or securities, with minimum collateral generally ranging from approximately 102% to 112% of the value of the loaned securities. Generally, the revenue earned is shared between the Company and the funds or accounts managed by the Company from which the securities are borrowed. Historically, securities lending revenue in the second quarter exceeds revenue in the other quarters during the year driven by higher seasonal demand. Investment advisory agreements for certain separate accounts and investment funds provide for performance fees based upon relative and/or absolute investment performance, in addition to base fees based on AUM. Investment advisory performance fees generally are earned after a given period of time and when investment performance exceeds a contractual threshold. As such, the timing of recognition of performance fees may increase the volatility of the Company’s revenue and earnings. The magnitude of performance fees can fluctuate quarterly due to the timing of carried interest recognition on alternative products; however, the third and fourth quarters have a greater number of nonalternative products with performance measurement periods that end on either September 30 or December 31. The Company offers investment management technology systems, risk management services, wealth management and digital distribution tools, all on a fee basis. Clients include banks, insurance companies, official institutions, pension funds, asset managers, retail distributors and other investors. Fees earned for technology services are primarily recorded as services are performed over time and are generally determined using the value of positions on the Aladdin platform, or on a fixed-rate basis. Revenue derived from the sale of software licenses is recognized upon the granting of access rights. The Company earns distribution and service fees for distributing investment products and providing support services to investments portfolios. The fees are based on AUM and are recognized when the amount of fees is known. The Company advises global financial institutions, regulators, and government entities across a range of risk, regulatory, capital markets and strategic services. Fees earned for advisory services, which are included in advisory and other revenue, are determined using fixed-rate fees and are recognized over time as the related services are completed. The Company earns fees for transition management services primarily comprised of commissions recognized in connection with buying and selling securities on behalf of its customers. Commissions related to transition management services, which are included in advisory and other revenue, are recorded on a trade-date basis as transactions occur. The Company also earns revenue related to certain minority investments accounted for as equity method investments. Operating expense reflects employee compensation and benefits, distribution and servicing costs, direct fund expense, general and administration expense and amortization of finite-lived intangible assets. • Employee compensation and benefits expense includes salaries, commissions, temporary help, deferred and incentive compensation, employer payroll taxes, severance and related benefit costs. • Distribution and servicing costs, which are primarily AUM driven, include payments to third parties, primarily associated with distribution and servicing of client investments in certain Company products. • Direct fund expense primarily consists of third-party nonadvisory expenses incurred by the Company related to certain funds for the use of index trademarks, reference data for indices, custodial services, fund administration, fund accounting, transfer agent services, shareholder reporting services, legal expense, and audit and tax services as well as other fund-related expenses directly attributable to the nonadvisory operations of the fund. These expenses may vary over time with fluctuations in AUM, number of shareholder accounts, or other attributes directly related to volume of business. • General and administration expense includes marketing and promotional, occupancy and office-related costs, portfolio services (including clearing expense related to transition management services), technology, professional services, communications, contingent consideration fair value adjustments, product launch costs, the impact of foreign currency remeasurement, and other general and administration expense. Foreign currency remeasurement losses were $31 million and $16 million for 2019 and 2018, respectively. Approximately 75% of the Company’s revenue is generated in US dollars. The Company’s revenue and expense generated in foreign currencies (primarily the Euro and British pound) are impacted by foreign exchange rates. Any effect of foreign exchange rate change on revenue is partially offset by a change in expense driven by the Company’s considerable non-dollar expense base related to its operations outside the United States. Nonoperating income (expense) includes the effect of changes in the valuations on investments and earnings on equity method investments as well as interest and dividend income and interest expense. The Company primarily holds seed and co-investments in sponsored investment products that invest in a variety of asset classes, including private equity, hedge funds and real assets. Investments generally are made for co-investment purposes, to establish a performance track record or for regulatory purposes, including Federal Reserve Bank stock. The Company does not engage in proprietary trading activities that could conflict with the interests of its clients. In addition, nonoperating income (expense) includes the impact of changes in the valuations of consolidated sponsored investment funds. The portion of nonoperating income (expense) not attributable to the Company is allocated to NCI on the consolidated statements of income. 44 Revenue The following table presents detail of revenue for 2019 and 2018 and includes the product type mix of investment advisory, administration fees and securities lending revenue (collectively “base fees”) and performance fees.

(2) Amounts include commodity iShares ETFs. 45 2019 Compared with 2018 Revenue increased $341 million, or 2%, from 2018, primarily driven by higher base fees and 24% growth in technology services revenue. Investment advisory, administration fees and securities lending revenue of $11,777 million in 2019 increased $224 million from $11,553 million in 2018, reflecting the positive impact of market beta and foreign exchange movements, organic growth and acquisitions, partially offset by the negative impact of strategic price changes to certain products. Securities lending revenue of $617 million in 2019 compared with $627 million in 2018. Investment advisory performance fees of $450 million in 2019 increased $38 million from $412 million in 2018, primarily reflecting higher revenue from illiquid and liquid alternative products, partially offset by lower revenue from long-only equity products. Technology services revenue of $974 million for 2019 increased $189 million from $785 million in 2018, primarily reflecting the impact of the eFront Transaction and higher revenue from Aladdin. Advisory and other revenue of $269 million in 2019 decreased $24 million from $293 million in 2018, primarily reflecting lower fees from advisory assignments. Expense The following table presents expense for 2019 and 2018. (in millions) 2019 2018 Expense, GAAP: Employee compensation and benefits $ 4,470 $ 4,320 Distribution and servicing costs: Retrocessions 658 709 12b-1 costs 354 399 Other 673 567 Total distribution and servicing costs 1,685 1,675 Direct fund expense 978 998 General and administration: Marketing and promotional 350 361 Occupancy and office related 307 293 Portfolio services 261 271 Technology 289 234 Professional services 161 158 Communications 39 37 Foreign exchange remeasurement 31 16 Contingent consideration fair value adjustments 53 65 Product launch costs 59 12 Other general and administration 208 191 Total general and administration expense 1,758 1,638 Restructuring charge — 60 Amortization of intangible assets 97 50 Total expense, GAAP $ 8,988 $ 8,741 2019 Compared with 2018 GAAP. Expense increased $247 million, or 3%, from 2018, primarily driven by higher employee compensation and benefits expense, higher general and administration expense and expense linked to the eFront Transaction. Employee compensation and benefits expense increased $150 million, or 3%, to $4,470 million in 2019 from $4,320 million in 2018, primarily reflecting higher headcount, higher performance fees and higher deferred compensation expense. Employees at December 31, 2019 totaled approximately 16,200 compared with approximately 14,900 at December 31, 2018. General and administration expense increased $120 million from 2018, reflecting higher technology expense, higher product launch costs, the impact of the eFront Transaction and the impact of foreign exchange remeasurement expense, partially offset by lower contingent consideration fair value adjustments related to prior acquisitions and lower marketing and promotional, and portfolio services expense. Amortization of intangible assets expense increased $47 million, or 94%, to $97 million in 2019, primarily reflecting amortization of intangible assets associated with the eFront Transaction. 46 Nonoperating Results The summary and reconciliation of GAAP nonoperating income (expense) to nonoperating income (expense), as adjusted for 2019 and 2018 was as follows: (in millions) 2019 2018 Nonoperating income (expense), GAAP basis(1) $ 236 $ (79 ) Less: Net income (loss) attributable to NCI 50 (3 ) Nonoperating income (expense), as adjusted, net of NCI(2)(3) $ 186 $ (76 ) (1) Amounts included gains of $210 million and losses of $105 million attributable to consolidated variable interest entities (“VIEs”) for 2019 and 2018, respectively. (2) Net of net income (loss) attributable to NCI.

See Non-GAAP Financial Measures for further information on non-GAAP financial measures for 2019 and 2018. The components of nonoperating income (expense), less net income (loss) attributable to NCI for 2019 and 2018 were as follows: (in millions) 2019 2018 Net gain (loss) on investments(1)(2) Private equity $ 47 $ (5 ) Real assets 21 26 Other alternatives(3) 19 2 Other investments(4) 144 (70 ) Subtotal 231 (47 ) Other gains (losses) (5) 61 51 Total net gain (loss) on investments(1)(2) 292 4 Interest and dividend income 97 104 Interest expense (203 ) (184 ) Net interest expense (106 ) (80 ) Nonoperating income (expense), as adjusted(1)(2) $ 186 $ (76 ) (1) Net of net income (loss) attributable to NCI.

See Non-GAAP Financial Measures for further information on non-GAAP financial measures for 2019 and 2018. (3) Amounts primarily include net gains (losses) related to direct hedge fund strategies and hedge fund solutions. (4) Amounts primarily include net gains (losses) related to equity and fixed income investments. (5) 2019 primarily include noncash pre-tax gains (losses) related to the revaluation of certain minority investments. 2018 primarily includes a $40 million pre-tax gain related to the DSP Transaction and a $10 million noncash pre-tax gain related to the revaluation of another minority investment. Income Tax Expense GAAP As adjusted (in millions) 2019 2018 2019 2018 Operating income(1) $ 5,551 $ 5,457 $ 5,551 $ 5,531 Total nonoperating income (expense)(1)(2) $ 186 $ (76 ) $ 186 $ (76 ) Income before income taxes(2) $ 5,737 $ 5,381 $ 5,737 $ 5,455 Income tax expense $ 1,261 $ 1,076 $ 1,253 $ 1,094 Effective tax rate 22.0 % 20.0 % 21.9 % 20.0 % (1) Management believes nonoperating income (expense), as adjusted, is an effective measure for reviewing the Company’s nonoperating results, which ultimately impact BlackRock’s book value. See Non-GAAP Financial Measures for further information on non-GAAP financial measures for 2019 and 2018. (2) Net of net income (loss) attributable to NCI. The Company’s tax rate is affected by tax rates in foreign jurisdictions and the relative amount of income earned in those jurisdictions, which the Company expects to be fairly consistent in the near term. The significant foreign jurisdictions that have different statutory tax rates than the US federal statutory rate of 21% include the United Kingdom, Ireland, Canada and Netherlands. 2019 Income tax expense (GAAP) reflected: o a discrete tax benefit of $28 million primarily related to stock-based compensation awards that vested in 2019. 2018 Income tax expense (GAAP) reflected: o $81 million discrete tax benefits, primarily related to changes in the Company’s organization entity structure; and o a $64 million discrete tax benefit related to stock-based compensation awards that vested in 2018. 47 Balance Sheet Overview The following table presents a reconciliation of the consolidated statement of financial condition presented on a GAAP basis to the consolidated statement of financial condition, excluding the impact of separate account assets and separate account collateral held under securities lending agreements (directly related to lending separate account securities) and separate account liabilities and separate account collateral liabilities under securities lending agreements and consolidated sponsored investment products. The Company presents the as adjusted balance sheet as additional information to enable investors to exclude certain assets that have equal and offsetting liabilities or noncontrolling interests that ultimately do not have an impact on stockholders’ equity or cash flows. Management views the as adjusted balance sheet, which contains non-GAAP financial measures, as an economic presentation of the Company’s total assets and liabilities; however, it does not advocate that investors consider such non-GAAP financial measures in isolation from, or as a substitute for, financial information prepared in accordance with GAAP. Separate Account Assets and Liabilities and Separate Account Collateral Held under Securities Lending Agreements Separate account assets are maintained by BlackRock Life Limited, a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company that is a registered life insurance company in the United Kingdom, and represent segregated assets held for purposes of funding individual and group pension contracts. The Company records equal and offsetting separate account liabilities. The separate account assets are not available to creditors of the Company and the holders of the pension contracts have no recourse to the Company’s assets. The net investment income attributable to separate account assets accrues directly to the contract owners and is not reported on the consolidated statements of income. While BlackRock has no economic interest in these assets or liabilities, BlackRock earns an investment advisory fee for the service of managing these assets on behalf of its clients. In addition, the Company records on its consolidated statements of financial condition the separate account collateral received under BlackRock Life Limited securities lending arrangements as its own asset in addition to an equal and offsetting separate account collateral liability for the obligation to return the collateral. The collateral is not available to creditors of the Company, and the borrowers under the securities lending arrangements have no recourse to the Company’s assets. Consolidated Sponsored Investment Products The Company consolidates certain sponsored investment products accounted for as VIEs and voting rights entities (“VREs”), (collectively, “consolidated sponsored investment products”). See Note 2, Significant Accounting Policies, in the notes to the consolidated financial statements contained in Part II, Item 8 of this filing for more information on the Company’s consolidation policy. The Company cannot readily access cash and cash equivalents or other assets held by consolidated sponsored investment products to use in its operating activities. In addition, the Company cannot readily sell investments held by consolidated sponsored investment products in order to obtain cash for use in the Company’s operations.

BlackRock has no economic interest in these assets or liabilities. BlackRock earns an investment advisory fee for the service of managing these assets on behalf of its clients. (2) Amounts represent the portion of assets and liabilities of Consolidated Sponsored Investment Products attributable to NCI. (3) Amount includes property and equipment and other assets. (4) Amount includes approximately $4.2 billion of deferred income tax liabilities related to goodwill and intangibles. See Note 25, Income Taxes, in the notes to the consolidated financial statements contained in Part II, Item 8 of this filing for more information. The following discussion summarizes the significant changes in assets and liabilities on a GAAP basis. Please see the consolidated statements of financial condition as of December 31, 2019 and 2018 contained in Part II, Item 8 of this filing. The discussion does not include changes related to assets and liabilities that are equal and offsetting and have no impact on BlackRock’s stockholders’ equity. 48 Assets. Cash and cash equivalents at December 31, 2019 and 2018 included $141 million and $245 million, respectively, of cash held by consolidated sponsored investment products (see Liquidity and Capital Resources for details on the change in cash and cash equivalents during 2019). Accounts receivable at December 31, 2019 increased $522 million from December 31, 2018, primarily due to higher base fees, technology services and performance fee receivables. Investments were $5,489 million at December 31, 2019 (for more information see Investments herein). Goodwill and intangible assets increased $1,566 million from December 31, 2018, primarily due to the eFront Transaction, partially offset by amortization of intangible assets. Other assets (including operating lease right-of-use (“ROU”) assets and property and equipment) increased $237 million from December 31, 2018, primarily due to the initial recognition of the operating lease ROU assets related to the adoption of the new lease accounting guidance and an increase in certain corporate minority investments, property and equipment, and unit trust receivables (substantially offset by an increase in unit trust payables recorded within other liabilities), partially offset by a decrease in other assets of consolidated sponsored investment products. Liabilities. Accrued compensation and benefits at December 31, 2019 increased $69 million from December 31, 2018, primarily due to higher 2019 deferred compensation accruals. Other liabilities increased $207 million from December 31, 2018, primarily due to the initial recognition of the operating lease liabilities related to the adoption of the new lease accounting guidance and higher unit trust payables (substantially offset by an increase in unit trust receivables recorded within other assets), partially offset by a decrease in contingent liability in connection with certain prior acquisitions, and restructuring liability payments and a decrease in other liabilities of consolidated sponsored investment products. Net deferred income tax liabilities at December 31, 2019 increased $163 million from December 31, 2018, primarily due to the effects of temporary differences associated with the eFront Transaction and investment income. Investments The Company’s investments were $5,489 million and $4,476 million at December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively. Investments include consolidated investments held by sponsored investment products accounted for as VIEs and VREs. Management reviews BlackRock’s investments on an “economic” basis, which eliminates the portion of investments that does not impact BlackRock’s book value or net income attributable to BlackRock. BlackRock’s management does not advocate that investors consider such non-GAAP financial measures in isolation from, or as a substitute for, financial information prepared in accordance with GAAP. The Company presents investments, as adjusted, to enable investors to understand the portion of investments that is owned by the Company, net of NCI, as a gauge to measure the impact of changes in net nonoperating income (expense) on investments to net income (loss) attributable to BlackRock. The Company further presents net “economic” investment exposure, net of deferred compensation investments and hedged investments, to reflect another helpful measure for investors. The economic impact of investments held pursuant to deferred compensation arrangements is offset by a change in compensation expense. The impact of certain investments is substantially mitigated by swap hedges. Carried interest capital allocations are excluded as there is no impact to BlackRock’s stockholders’ equity until such amounts are realized as performance fees. Finally, the Company’s regulatory investment in Federal Reserve Bank stock, which is not subject to market or interest rate risk, is excluded from the Company’s net economic investment exposure. (in millions) December 31, 2019 December 31, 2018 Investments, GAAP $ 5,489 $ 4,476 Investments held by consolidated sponsored investment products (3,784 ) (3,204 ) Net interest in consolidated sponsored investment products(1) 2,290 2,109 Investments, as adjusted 3,995 3,381 Federal Reserve Bank stock (93 ) (92 ) Deferred compensation investments (23 ) (34 ) Hedged investments (644 ) (483 ) Carried interest (528 ) (387 ) Total “economic” investment exposure $ 2,707 $ 2,385 (1) Amount included $514 million and $369 million of carried interest (VIEs) as of December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively, which has no impact on the Company’s “economic” investment exposure. The following table represents the carrying value of the Company’s economic investment exposure, by asset type, at December 31, 2019 and 2018: (in millions) December 31, 2019 December 31, 2018 Private equity $ 355 $ 305 Real assets 322 377 Other alternatives(1) 235 199 Other investments(2) 1,795 1,504 Total “economic” investment exposure $ 2,707 $ 2,385 (1) Other alternatives primarily include hedge funds/funds of hedge funds. (2) Other investments primarily include seed investments in fixed income, equity and multi-asset mutual funds/strategies as well as UK government securities, primarily held for regulatory purposes. 49 As adjusted investment activity for 2019 and 2018 was as follows: (in millions) 2019 2018 Investments, as adjusted, beginning balance $ 3,381 $ 3,154 Purchases/capital contributions/acquisitions 975 1,494 Sales/maturities (617 ) (1,124 ) Distributions (1) (226 ) (95 ) Market appreciation(depreciation)/earnings from equity method investments 333 (107 ) Carried interest capital allocations/(distributions)/acquired 141 89 Other 8 (30 ) Investments, as adjusted, ending balance $ 3,995 $ 3,381 (1) Amount includes distributions representing return of capital and return on investments. LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES BlackRock Cash Flows Excluding the Impact of Consolidated Sponsored Investment Products The consolidated statements of cash flows include the cash flows of the consolidated sponsored investment products. The Company uses an adjusted cash flow statement, which excludes the impact of Consolidated Sponsored Investment Products, as a supplemental non-GAAP measure to assess liquidity and capital requirements. The Company believes that its cash flows, excluding the impact of the consolidated sponsored investment products, provide investors with useful information on the cash flows of BlackRock relating to its ability to fund additional operating, investing and financing activities. BlackRock’s management does not advocate that investors consider such non-GAAP measures in isolation from, or as a substitute for, its cash flows presented in accordance with GAAP. The following table presents a reconciliation of the consolidated statements of cash flows presented on a GAAP basis to the consolidated statements of cash flows, excluding the impact of the cash flows of consolidated sponsored investment products: (in millions) GAAP Basis Impact on Cash Flows of Consolidated Sponsored Investment Products Cash Flows Excluding Impact of Consolidated Sponsored Investment Products Cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash, December 31, 2017 $ 7,096 $ 207 $ 6,889 Net cash provided by/(used in) operating activities 3,075 (1,181 ) 4,256 Net cash provided by/(used in) investing activities (808 ) (84 ) (724 ) Net cash provided by/(used in) financing activities (2,765 ) 1,303 (4,068 ) Effect of exchange rate changes on cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash (93 ) — (93 ) Net increase/(decrease) in cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash (591 ) 38 (629 ) Cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash, December 31, 2018 $ 6,505 $ 245 $ 6,260 Net cash provided by/(used in) operating activities 2,884 (1,563 ) 4,447 Net cash provided by/(used in) investing activities (2,014 ) (110 ) (1,904 ) Net cash provided by/(used in) financing activities (2,583 ) 1,569 (4,152 ) Effect of exchange rate changes on cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash 54 — 54 Net increase/(decrease) in cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash (1,659 ) (104 ) (1,555 ) Cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash, December 31, 2019 $ 4,846 $ 141 $ 4,705 Sources of BlackRock’s operating cash primarily include investment advisory, administration fees and securities lending revenue, performance fees, technology services revenue, advisory revenue and distribution fees. BlackRock uses its cash to pay for all operating expense, interest and principal on borrowings, income taxes, dividends on BlackRock’s capital stock, repurchases of the Company’s stock, acquisitions, capital expenditures and purchases of co-investments and seed investments. For details of the Company’s GAAP cash flows from operating, investing and financing activities, see the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows contained in Part II, Item 8 of this filing. Cash flows provided by operating activities, excluding the impact of consolidated sponsored investment products, primarily include the receipt of investment advisory and administration fees, securities lending revenue and performance fees offset by the payment of operating expenses incurred in the normal course of business, including year-end incentive compensation accrued for in the prior year. Cash flows used in investing activities, excluding the impact of consolidated sponsored investment products, for 2019 were $1,904 million and primarily reflected $1.5 billion of cash outflow related to the eFront Transaction, $693 million of investment purchases and $254 million of purchases of property and equipment, partially offset by $417 million of net proceeds from sales and maturities of certain investments. Cash flows used in financing activities, excluding the impact of consolidated sponsored investment products, for 2019 were $4,152 million, primarily resulting from $1.9 billion of share repurchases, including $400 million in open market transactions, a $1.3 billion private transaction and $245 million of employee tax withholdings related to employee stock transactions, $2.1 billion of cash dividend payments, and $1 billion of repayments of long-term borrowings, partially offset by $992 million of proceeds from long-term borrowings. 50 The Company manages its financial condition and funding to maintain appropriate liquidity for the business. Liquidity resources at December 31, 2019 and 2018 were as follows: (in millions) December 31, 2019 December 31, 2018 Cash and cash equivalents(1) $ 4,829 $ 6,488 Cash and cash equivalents held by consolidated sponsored investment products(2) (141 ) (245 ) Subtotal 4,688 6,243 Credit facility — undrawn 4,000 4,000 Total liquidity resources(3) $ 8,688 $ 10,243 (1) The percentage of cash and cash equivalents held by the Company’s US subsidiaries was approximately 45% and 50% at December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively. See Net Capital Requirements herein for more information on net capital requirements in certain regulated subsidiaries. (2) The Company cannot readily access such cash to use in its operating activities. (3) Amounts do not reflect a reduction for year-end incentive compensation accruals of approximately $1.4 billion for both 2019 and 2018, which are paid in the first quarter of the following year. Total liquidity resources decreased $1,555 million during 2019, primarily reflecting cash dividend payments of $2.1 billion, share repurchases of $1.9 billion, reflecting the impact of a $1.3 billion private transaction, and approximately $1.5 billion of cash outflow related to the eFront Transaction, partially offset by cash flows from operating activities. A significant portion of the Company’s $3,995 million of investments, as adjusted, is illiquid in nature and, as such, cannot be readily convertible to cash. Share Repurchases. In January 2019, the Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of an additional seven million shares under the Company’s existing share repurchase program for a total up to approximately 9.9 million shares of BlackRock common stock. During 2019, the Company repurchased 4.0 million common shares under the share repurchase program for approximately $1.7 billion, including a $1.3 billion private transaction that closed on March 25, 2019. At December 31, 2019, there were 5.9 million shares still authorized to be repurchased. Net Capital Requirements. The Company is required to maintain net capital in certain regulated subsidiaries within a number of jurisdictions, which is partially maintained by retaining cash and cash equivalent investments in those subsidiaries or jurisdictions. As a result, such subsidiaries of the Company may be restricted in their ability to transfer cash between different jurisdictions and to their parents. Additionally, transfers of cash between international jurisdictions may have adverse tax consequences that could discourage such transfers. BlackRock Institutional Trust Company, N.A. (“BTC”) is chartered as a national bank that does not accept deposits or make commercial loans and whose powers are limited to trust and other fiduciary activities. BTC provides investment management and other fiduciary services, including investment advisory and securities lending agency services, to institutional clients. BTC is subject to regulatory capital and liquid asset requirements administered by the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency. At December 31, 2019 and 2018, the Company was required to maintain approximately $1.9 billion and $1.8 billion, respectively, in net capital in certain regulated subsidiaries, including BTC, entities regulated by the Financial Conduct Authority and Prudential Regulation Authority in the United Kingdom, and the Company’s broker-dealers. The Company was in compliance with all applicable regulatory net capital requirements. Undistributed Earnings of Foreign Subsidiaries. As a result of The 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act and the one-time mandatory deemed repatriation tax on untaxed accumulated foreign earnings, US income taxes were provided on the Company’s undistributed foreign earnings. The financial statement basis in excess of tax basis of its foreign subsidiaries remains indefinitely reinvested in foreign operations. The Company will continue to evaluate its capital management plans throughout 2020. Short-Term Borrowings 2019 Revolving Credit Facility. The Company’s credit facility has an aggregate commitment amount of $4 billion and was amended in March 2019 to extend the maturity date to March 2024 (the “2019 credit facility”). The 2019 credit facility permits the Company to request up to an additional $1 billion of borrowing capacity, subject to lender credit approval, increasing the overall size of the 2019 credit facility to an aggregate principal amount not to exceed $5 billion. Interest on borrowings outstanding accrues at a rate based on the applicable London Interbank Offered Rate plus a spread. The 2019 credit facility requires the Company not to exceed a maximum leverage ratio (ratio of net debt to earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, where net debt equals total debt less unrestricted cash) of 3 to 1, which was satisfied with a ratio of less than 1 to 1 at December 31, 2019. The 2019 credit facility provides back-up liquidity to fund ongoing working capital for general corporate purposes and various investment opportunities. At December 31, 2019, the Company had no amount outstanding under the credit facility. Commercial Paper Program. The Company can issue unsecured commercial paper notes (the “CP Notes”) on a private-placement basis up to a maximum aggregate amount outstanding at any time of $4 billion. The commercial paper program is currently supported by the 2019 credit facility. At December 31, 2019, BlackRock had no CP Notes outstanding. 51 Long-Term Borrowings The carrying value of long-term borrowings at December 31, 2019 included the following: (in millions) Maturity Amount Carrying Value Maturity 4.25% Notes $ 750 $ 749 May 2021 3.375% Notes 750 748 June 2022 3.50% Notes 1,000 996 March 2024 1.25% Notes(1) 786 781 May 2025 3.20% Notes 700 695 March 2027 3.25% Notes 1,000 986 April 2029 Total Long-term Borrowings $ 4,986 $ 4,955 (1) The carrying value of the 1.25% Notes is calculated using the EUR/USD foreign exchange rate as of December 31, 2019. In April 2019, the Company issued $1 billion in aggregate principal amount of 3.25% senior unsecured and unsubordinated notes maturing on April 30, 2029 (the “2029 Notes”). The net proceeds of the 2029 Notes were used for general corporate purposes, which included a portion of the purchase price of the eFront Transaction, repayment of a portion of the $1 billion 5.00% notes in December 2019 and repayment of borrowings under its commercial paper program. Interest is payable semi-annually on April 30 and October 30 of each year, which commenced on October 30, 2019, and is approximately $33 million per year. The 2029 Notes may be redeemed prior to January 30, 2029 in whole or in part at any time, at the option of the Company, at a “make-whole” redemption price or at par thereafter. The unamortized discount and debt issuance costs are being amortized over the remaining term of the 2029 Notes. In December 2019, the Company fully repaid $1 billion of 5.00% notes at maturity. In January 2020, the Company issued $1 billion in aggregate principal amount of 2.40% senior unsecured and unsubordinated notes maturing on April 30, 2030 (the “2030 Notes”). The net proceeds of the 2030 Notes will be used for general corporate purposes. Interest of approximately $24 million per year will be payable semi-annually on April 30 and October 30 of each year, commencing April 30, 2020. The 2030 Notes may be redeemed prior to January 30, 2030 in whole or in part at any time, at the option of the Company, at a “make-whole” redemption price or at 100% of the principal amount of the 2030 Notes thereafter. The discount and debt issuance costs will be amortized over the term of the 2030 Notes. For more information on Company’s borrowings, see Note 15, Borrowings, in the notes to the consolidated financial statements contained in Part II, Item 8 of this filing. Contractual Obligations, Commitments and Contingencies The following table sets forth contractual obligations, commitments and contingencies by year of payment at December 31, 2019: (in millions) 2020 2021 2022 2023 2024 Thereafter Total Contractual obligations and commitments: Long-term borrowings(1): Principal $ — $ 750 $ 750 $ — $ 1,000 $ 2,486 $ 4,986 Interest 157 141 112 100 82 213 805 Operating leases 158 152 141 125 110 1,682 2,368 Purchase obligations 149 98 37 20 12 — 316 Investment commitments 553 — — — — — 553 Total contractual obligations and commitments 1,017 1,141 1,040 245 1,204 4,381 9,028 Contingent obligations: Contingent payments related to business acquisitions(2) 189 19 — — — — 208 Total contractual obligations, commitments and contingent obligations(3) $ 1,206 $ 1,160 $ 1,040 $ 245 $ 1,204 $ 4,381 $ 9,236 (1) The amount of principal and interest payments for the 1.25% Notes (issued in Euros) represents the expected payment amounts using the EUR/USD foreign exchange rate as of December 31, 2019. (2) The amount of contingent payments reflected for any year represents the expected payments using foreign currency exchange rates as of December 31, 2019. The fair value of the remaining aggregate contingent payments at December 31, 2019 totaled $193 million and is included in other liabilities on the consolidated statements of financial condition. (3) At December 31, 2019, the Company had approximately $618 million of net unrecognized tax benefits. Due to the uncertainty of timing and amounts that will ultimately be paid, this amount has been excluded from the table above. Operating Leases. The Company leases its primary office locations under agreements that expire on varying dates through 2043. In connection with certain lease agreements, the Company is responsible for escalation payments. The contractual obligations table above includes only guaranteed minimum lease payments for such leases and does not project potential escalation or other lease-related payments. In May 2017, the Company entered into an agreement with 50 HYMC Owner LLC, for the lease of approximately 847,000 square feet of office space located at 50 Hudson Yards, New York, New York. The term of the lease is twenty years from the date that rental payments begin, expected to occur in May 2023, with the option to renew for a specified term. The lease requires annual base rental payments of approximately $51 million per year during the first five years of the lease term, increasing every five years to $58 million, $66 million and $74 million per year (or approximately $1.2 billion in base rent over its twenty-year term). In November 2019, the Company exercised its initial expansion option with respect to two additional floors of approximately 122,000 square feet of office space. The additional space requires approximately $185 million in base rent over its twenty-year term. For more information on the Company’s operating leases, see Note 13, Leases, in the notes to the consolidated financial statements contained in Part II, Item 8 of this filing. 52 Purchase Obligations. In the ordinary course of business, BlackRock enters into contracts or purchase obligations with third parties whereby the third parties provide services to or on behalf of BlackRock. Purchase obligations included in the contractual obligations table above represent executory contracts, which are either noncancelable or cancelable with a penalty. At December 31, 2019, the Company’s obligations primarily reflected standard service contracts for portfolio services, market data, office-related services and third-party marketing and promotional services, and obligations for equipment. Purchase obligations are recorded on the consolidated financial statements when services are provided and, as such, obligations for services and equipment not received are not included in the consolidated statement of financial condition at December 31, 2019. Investment Commitments. At December 31, 2019, the Company had $553 million of various capital commitments to fund sponsored investment products, including consolidated sponsored investment products. These products include private equity funds, real assets funds and opportunistic funds. This amount excludes additional commitments made by consolidated funds of funds to underlying third-party funds as third-party noncontrolling interest holders have the legal obligation to fund the respective commitments of such funds of funds. Generally, the timing of the funding of these commitments is unknown and the commitments are callable on demand at any time prior to the expiration of the commitment. These unfunded commitments are not recorded on the consolidated statements of financial condition. These commitments do not include potential future commitments approved by the Company that are not yet legally binding. The Company intends to make additional capital commitments from time to time to fund additional investment products for, and with, its clients. Contingent Payments Related to Business Acquisitions. In connection with certain acquisitions, BlackRock is required to make contingent payments, subject to achieving specified performance targets, which may include revenue related to acquired contracts or new capital commitments for certain products. The fair value of the remaining aggregate contingent payments at December 31, 2019 totaled $193 million, and is included in other liabilities on the consolidated statements of financial condition. The following items have not been included in the contractual obligations, commitments and contingencies table: Carried Interest Clawback. As a general partner in certain investment products, including private equity partnerships and certain hedge funds, the Company may receive carried interest cash distributions from the partnerships in accordance with distribution provisions of the partnership agreements. The Company may, from time to time, be required to return all or a portion of such distributions to the limited partners in the event the limited partners do not achieve a return as specified in the various partnership agreements. Therefore, BlackRock records carried interest subject to such clawback provisions in investments, or cash and cash equivalents to the extent that it is distributed, and as a deferred carried interest liability on its consolidated statements of financial condition. Carried interest is recorded as performance fees on BlackRock’s consolidated statements of income when fees are no longer probable of significant reversal. Indemnifications. In the ordinary course of business or in connection with certain acquisition agreements, BlackRock enters into contracts pursuant to which it may agree to indemnify third parties in certain circumstances. The terms of these indemnities vary from contract to contract and the amount of indemnification liability, if any, cannot be determined or the likelihood of any liability is considered remote and, therefore, has not been included in the table above or recorded in the consolidated statement of financial condition at December 31, 2019. See further discussion in Note 16, Commitments and Contingencies, in the notes to the consolidated financial statements contained in Part II, Item 8 of this filing. On behalf of certain clients, the Company lends securities to highly rated banks and broker-dealers. In these securities lending transactions, the borrower is required to provide and maintain collateral at or above regulatory minimums. Securities on loan are marked to market daily to determine if the borrower is required to pledge additional collateral. In connection with securities lending transactions, BlackRock has agreed to indemnify certain securities lending clients against potential loss resulting from a borrower’s failure to fulfill its obligations under the securities lending agreement should the value of the collateral pledged by the borrower at the time of default be insufficient to cover the borrower’s obligation under the securities lending agreement. The amount of securities on loan as of December 31, 2019 and subject to this type of indemnification was $210 billion. In the Company’s capacity as lending agent, cash and securities totaling $226 billion was held as collateral for indemnified securities on loan at December 31, 2019. The fair value of these indemnifications was not material at December 31, 2019. While the collateral pledged by a borrower is intended to be sufficient to offset the borrower’s obligations to return securities borrowed and any other amounts owing to the lender under the relevant securities lending agreement, in the event of a borrower default, the Company can give no assurance that the collateral pledged by the borrower will be sufficient to fulfill such obligations. If the amount of such pledged collateral is not sufficient to fulfill such obligations to a client for whom the Company has provided indemnification, BlackRock would be responsible for the amount of the shortfall. These indemnifications cover only the collateral shortfall described above, and do not in any way guarantee, assume or otherwise insure the investment performance or return of any cash collateral vehicle into which securities lending cash collateral is invested. Compensation and Benefit Obligations. The Company has various compensation and benefit obligations, including bonuses, commissions and incentive payments payable, defined contribution plan matching contribution obligations, and deferred compensation arrangements, that are excluded from the contractual obligations and commitments table above. Accrued compensation and benefits at December 31, 2019 totaled $2,057 million and included annual incentive compensation of $1,372 million, deferred compensation of $399 million and other compensation and benefits related obligations of $286 million. Substantially all of the incentive compensation liability was paid in the first quarter of 2020, while the deferred compensation obligations are payable over various periods, with the majority payable over periods of up to three years. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES The preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expense during the reporting periods. Actual results could differ significantly from those estimates. Management considers the following critical accounting policies important to understanding the consolidated financial statements. For a summary of these and additional accounting policies see Note 2, Significant Accounting Policies, in the consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this filing, including information regarding the adoption of Accounting Standards Update 2016-02, Leases. 53 Consolidation In the normal course of business, the Company is the manager of various types of sponsored investment vehicles. The Company performs an analysis for investment products to determine if the product is a VIE or a VRE. Assessing whether an entity is a VIE or a VRE involves judgment and analysis. Factors considered in this assessment include the entity’s legal organization, the entity’s capital structure and equity ownership, and any related party or de facto agent implications of the Company’s involvement with the entity. Investments that are determined to be VREs are consolidated if the Company can exert control over the financial and operating policies of the investee, which generally exists if there is greater than 50% voting interest. Investments that are determined to be VIEs are consolidated if the Company is the primary beneficiary (“PB”) of the entity. BlackRock is deemed to be the PB of a VIE if it has the power to direct the activities that most significantly impact the entities’ economic performance and has the obligation to absorb losses or the right to receive benefits that potentially could be significant to the VIE. The Company generally consolidates VIEs in which it holds an economic interest of 10% or greater and deconsolidates such VIEs once equity ownership falls below 10%. See Note 6, Consolidated Sponsored Investment Products, in the notes to the consolidated financial statements contained in Part II, Item 8 of this filing for more information. Investments Equity Method Investments. For equity investments where BlackRock does not control the investee, and where it is not the PB of a VIE, but can exert significant influence over the financial and operating policies of the investee, the Company follows the equity method of accounting. The evaluation of whether the Company exerts control or significant influence over the financial and operational policies of its investees requires significant judgment based on the facts and circumstances surrounding each individual investment. Factors considered in these evaluations may include the type of investment, the legal structure of the investee, the terms and structure of the investment agreement, including investor voting or other rights, the terms of BlackRock’s advisory agreement or other agreements with the investee, any influence BlackRock may have on the governing board of the investee, the legal rights of other investors in the entity pursuant to the fund’s operating documents and the relationship between BlackRock and other investors in the entity. BlackRock’s equity method investees that are investment companies record their underlying investments at fair value. Therefore, under the equity method of accounting, BlackRock’s share of the investee’s underlying net income predominantly represents fair value adjustments in the investments held by the equity method investees. BlackRock’s share of the investee’s underlying net income or loss is based upon the most currently available information and is recorded as nonoperating income (expense) for investments in investment companies, or as advisory and other revenue for certain corporate minority investments, which are recorded in other assets, since such investees are considered to be an extension of BlackRock’s core business. At December 31, 2019, the Company had $943 million and $531 million of equity method investments, included in investments and other assets, respectively, and at December 31, 2018, the Company had $781 million and $459 million of equity method investments included in investments and other assets, respectively. Other nonequity method corporate minority investments. Other nonequity method corporate minority investments are recorded within other assets on the consolidated statements of financial condition. At December 31, 2019 and 2018, these investments totaled $282 million and $199 million, respectively, and included investments in equity securities, which are generally measured at fair value or under the measurement alternative to fair value for nonmarketable securities. Changes in value of these securities are recorded in nonoperating income (expense) on the consolidated statements of income. See Note 2, Significant Accounting Policies, in the consolidated financial statements contained in Part II, Item 8 of this filing for more information. Impairments of Investments. Evaluation of impairments involves significant assumptions and management judgments, which could differ from actual results, and these differences could have a material impact on the consolidated statements of income. See Note 2, Significant Accounting Policies, in the consolidated financial statements contained in Part II, Item 8 of this filing for more information. Fair Value Measurements The Company’s assessment of the significance of a particular input to the fair value measurement according to the fair value hierarchy (i.e., Level 1, 2 and 3 inputs, as defined) in its entirety requires judgment and considers factors specific to the financial instrument. See Note 2, Significant Accounting Policies, in the consolidated financial statements contained in Part II, Item 8 of this filing for more information on fair value measurements. Changes in Valuation. Changes in value on $5,489 million of investments will impact the Company’s nonoperating income (expense), $342 million are held at cost or amortized cost and the remaining $528 million relates to carried interest, which will not impact nonoperating income (expense). At December 31, 2019, changes in fair value of $3,270 million of consolidated sponsored investment products will impact BlackRock’s net income (loss) attributable to NCI on the consolidated statements of income. BlackRock’s net exposure to changes in fair value of consolidated sponsored investment products was $1,776 million. Leases The Company determines if a contract is a lease or contains a lease at inception. The identification of whether a contract contains a lease requires judgment, including determining whether there are identified assets in the contract that the Company has control over for a specified period of time in exchange for consideration. Fixed lease payments are included in the measurement of ROU assets and lease liabilities on the consolidated statement of financial condition. The Company recognizes ROU assets and lease liabilities based on the present value of these future lease payments over the lease term at the commencement date discounted using the Company’s incremental borrowing rate (“IBR”). Management judgment is required in determining the Company’s IBR, including assessing the Company’s credit rating using various financial metrics, such as revenue, operating margin and revenue growth, and, as appropriate, performing market analysis of yields on publicly traded bonds (secured or unsecured) of comparable companies. See Note 2, Significant Accounting Policies, in the consolidated financial statements contained in Part II, Item 8 of this filing for more information on leases. 54 Goodwill and Intangible Assets The value of advisory contracts acquired in business acquisitions to manage AUM in proprietary open-end investment funds as well as collective trust funds without a specified termination date are classified as indefinite-lived intangible assets. The assignment of indefinite lives to such investment fund contracts is based upon the assumption that there is no foreseeable limit on the contract period to manage these funds due to the likelihood of continued renewal at little or no cost. In addition, trade names/trademarks are considered indefinite-lived intangibles if they are expected to generate cash flows indefinitely. Goodwill represents the cost of a business acquisition in excess of the fair value of the net assets acquired. Indefinite-lived intangible assets and goodwill are not amortized. Finite-lived management contracts, which relate to acquired separate accounts and funds, investor/customer relationships, and technology related assets that are expected to contribute to the future cash flows of the Company for a specified period of time are amortized over their remaining expected useful lives, which, at December 31, 2019 ranged from 1 to 11 years with a weighted-average remaining estimated useful life of 7.8 years. Goodwill. The Company assesses its goodwill for impairment at least annually, considering such factors as the book value and the market capitalization of the Company. The impairment assessment performed as of July 31, 2019 indicated no impairment charge was required. The Company continues to monitor its book value per share compared with closing prices of its common stock for potential indicators of impairment. At December 31, 2019, the Company’s common stock closed at $502.70, which exceeded its book value of approximately $216.15 per share. Indefinite-lived and finite-lived intangibles. The Company performs assessments to determine if any intangible assets are impaired and whether the indefinite-life and finite-life classifications are still appropriate. In evaluating whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of indefinite-lived intangibles is less than carrying value, BlackRock performed certain quantitative assessments and assessed various significant qualitative factors including AUM, revenue basis points, projected AUM growth rates, operating margins, tax rates and discount rates. In addition, the Company considered other factors including: (i) macroeconomic conditions such as a deterioration in general economic conditions, limitations on accessing capital, fluctuations in foreign exchange rates, or other developments in equity and credit markets; (ii) industry and market considerations such as a deterioration in the environment in which the Company operates, an increased competitive environment, a decline in market-dependent multiples or metrics, a change in the market for an entity’s services, or regulatory, legal or political developments; and (iii) the Company-specific events, such as a change in management or key personnel, overall financial performance and litigation that could affect significant inputs used to determine the fair value of the indefinite-lived intangible asset. If an indefinite-lived intangible is determined to be more likely than not impaired, then the fair value of the asset is compared with its carrying value and any excess of the carrying value over the fair value would be recognized as an expense in the period in which the impairment occurs. For finite-lived intangible assets, if potential impairment circumstances are considered to exist, the Company will perform a recoverability test, using an undiscounted cash flow analysis. Actual results could differ from these cash flow estimates, which could materially impact the impairment conclusion. If the carrying value of the asset is determined not to be recoverable based on the undiscounted cash flow test, the difference between the book value of the asset and its current fair value would be recognized as an expense in the period in which the impairment occurs. In addition, management judgment is required to estimate the period over which finite-lived intangible assets will contribute to the Company’s cash flows and the pattern in which these assets will be consumed. A change in the remaining useful life of any of these assets, or the reclassification of an indefinite-lived intangible asset to a finite-lived intangible asset, could have a significant impact on the Company’s amortization expense, which was $97 million, $50 million and $89 million for 2019, 2018 and 2017, respectively. In 2019, 2018 and 2017, the Company performed impairment tests, including evaluating various qualitative factors and performing certain quantitative assessments. The Company determined that no impairment charges were required and that the classification of indefinite-lived versus finite-lived intangibles was still appropriate and no changes were required to the expected lives of the finite-lived intangibles. The Company continuously monitors various factors, including AUM, for potential indicators of impairment. Contingent Consideration Liabilities In connection with certain acquisitions, BlackRock is required to make contingent payments, subject to achieving specified performance targets. The fair value of this contingent consideration is estimated at the time of acquisition closing and is included in other liabilities on the consolidated statements of financial condition. As the fair value of the expected payments amount subsequently changes, the contingent consideration liability is adjusted, resulting in contingent consideration fair value adjustments recorded within general and administration expense of the consolidated statements of income. Cash payments up to the acquisition date fair value amount of the contingent consideration liability are reflected as financing activities with excess (if any) cash payments classified in operating activities. Any cash payments made soon after the acquisition date will be classified in investing activities. Revenue Recognition Revenue is recognized upon transfer of control of promised services to customers in an amount to which the Company expects to be entitled in exchange for those services. The Company enters into contracts that can include multiple services, which are accounted for separately if they are determined to be distinct. Management judgment is required to identify distinct services and involves assessing such factors as whether the promised services significantly modify or customize one another or are highly interdependent or interrelated. Management judgment may be also required when determining the following: when variable consideration is no longer probable of significant reversal (and hence can be included in revenue); whether certain revenue should be presented gross or net of certain related costs; when a promised service transfers to the customer; and the applicable method of measuring progress for services transferred to the customer over time. Many of BlackRock's promised services represent a series of distinct services (e.g., investment advisory services) in which the associated variable consideration (e.g., management fees) is allocated to specific days of service as opposed to over the entire contract term. 55 Investment advisory and administration fees are recognized as the services are performed over time because the customer is receiving and consuming the benefits as they are provided by the Company. Fees are primarily based on agreed-upon percentages of AUM and recognized for services provided during the period, which are distinct from services provided in other periods. Such fees are affected by changes in AUM, including market appreciation or depreciation, foreign exchange translation and net inflows or outflows. AUM represents the broad range of financial assets the Company manages for clients on a discretionary basis pursuant to investment management and trust agreements that are expected to continue for at least 12 months. In general, reported AUM reflects the valuation methodology that corresponds to the basis used for determining revenue (for example, net asset values). The Company earns revenue by lending securities on behalf of clients, primarily to highly rated banks and broker-dealers. The securities loaned are secured by collateral, generally ranging from 102% to 112% of the value of the loaned securities. For 2019, 2018 and 2017, securities lending revenue earned by the Company totaled $617 million, $627 million and $597 million, respectively, and is recorded in investment advisory, administration and securities lending revenue on the consolidated statements of income. Investment advisory, administration fees and securities lending revenue are reported together as the fees for these services often are agreed upon with clients as a bundled fee. The Company receives investment advisory performance fees, including incentive allocations (carried interest) from certain actively managed investment funds and certain separately managed accounts. These performance fees are dependent upon exceeding specified relative or absolute investment return thresholds, which may vary by product or account, and include monthly, quarterly, annual or longer measurement periods. Performance fees, including carried interest, are recognized when it is determined that they are no longer probable of significant reversal (such as upon the sale of a fund’s investment or when the amount of AUM becomes known as of the end of a specified measurement period). Given the unique nature of each fee arrangement, contracts with customers are evaluated on an individual basis to determine the timing of revenue recognition. Significant judgement is involved in making such determination. Performance fees typically arise from investment management services that began in prior reporting periods. Consequently, a portion of the fees the Company recognizes may be partially related to the services performed in prior periods that meet the recognition criteria in the current period. At each reporting date, the Company considers various factors in estimating performance fees to be recognized, including carried interest. These factors include but are not limited to whether: (1) the fees are dependent on the market and thus are highly susceptible to factors outside the Company’s influence; (2) the fees have a large number and a broad range of possible amounts; and (3) the funds or separately managed accounts have the ability to invest or reinvest their sales proceeds. The Company is allocated carried interest from certain alternative investment products upon exceeding performance thresholds. The Company may be required to reverse/return all, or part, of such carried interest allocations/distributions depending upon future performance of these funds. Carried interest subject to such clawback provisions is recorded in investments or cash and cash equivalents to the extent that it is distributed, on its consolidated statements of financial condition. The Company records a liability for deferred carried interest to the extent it receives cash or capital allocations related to carried interest prior to meeting the revenue recognition criteria. At December 31, 2019 and 2018, the Company had $483 million and $293 million, respectively, of deferred carried interest recorded in other liabilities on the consolidated statements of financial condition. A portion of the deferred carried interest may also be paid to certain employees. The ultimate timing of the recognition of performance fee revenue and related compensation expense, if any, for these products is unknown. See Note 17, Revenue, in the notes to the consolidated financial statements for detailed changes in the deferred carried interest liability balance for 2019 and 2018. Fees earned for technology services are primarily recorded as services are performed and are generally determined using the value of positions on the Aladdin platform or on a fixed-rate basis. Revenue derived from the sale of software licenses is recognized upon the granting of access rights. Distribution and service fees earned for distributing investment products and providing support services to investment portfolios, are based on AUM, and are recognized when the amount of fees is known. Adjustments to revenue arising from initial estimates recorded historically have been immaterial since the majority of BlackRock’s investment advisory and administration revenue is calculated based on AUM and since the Company does not record performance fee revenue until: (1) performance thresholds have been exceeded and (2) management determines the fees are no longer probable of significant reversal. Income Taxes Deferred income tax assets and liabilities are recognized for future tax consequences attributable to temporary differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases using currently enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to reverse. The effect of a change in tax rates on deferred tax assets and liabilities is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date. Significant management judgment is required in estimating the ranges of possible outcomes and determining the probability of favorable or unfavorable tax outcomes and potential interest and penalties related to such unfavorable outcomes. Actual future tax consequences relating to uncertain tax positions may be materially different than the Company’s current estimates. At December 31, 2019, BlackRock had $900 million of gross unrecognized tax benefits, of which $513 million, if recognized, would affect the effective tax rate. Management is required to estimate the timing of the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities, make assumptions about the future deductibility of deferred income tax assets and assess deferred income tax liabilities based on enacted tax rates for the appropriate tax jurisdictions to determine the amount of such deferred income tax assets and liabilities. At December 31, 2019, the Company had deferred income tax assets of $175 million and deferred income tax liabilities of $3,734 million on the consolidated statement of financial condition. Changes in deferred tax assets and liabilities may occur in certain circumstances, including statutory income tax rate changes, statutory tax law changes, changes in the anticipated timing of recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities or changes in the structure or tax status of the Company. 56 The Company assesses whether a valuation allowance should be established against its deferred income tax assets based on consideration of all available evidence, both positive and negative, using a more likely than not standard. The assessment considers, among other matters, the nature, frequency and severity of recent losses, forecast of future profitability, the duration of statutory carry back and carry forward periods, the Company’s experience with tax attributes expiring unused, and tax planning alternatives. The Company records income taxes based upon its estimated income tax liability or benefit. The Company’s actual tax liability or benefit may differ from the estimated income tax liability or benefit. The Company had current income taxes receivables of approximately $282 million and current income taxes payables of $293 million at December 31, 2019. Accounting Developments For accounting pronouncements that the Company adopted during the year ended December 31, 2019 and for recent accounting pronouncements not yet adopted, see Note 2, Significant Accounting Policies, in the consolidated financial statements contained in Part II, Item 8 of this filing. 57 Item 7a. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk AUM Market Price Risk. BlackRock’s investment advisory and administration fees are primarily comprised of fees based on a percentage of the value of AUM and, in some cases, performance fees expressed as a percentage of the returns realized on AUM. At December 31, 2019, the majority of the Company’s investment advisory and administration fees were based on average or period end AUM of the applicable investment funds or separate accounts. Movements in equity market prices, interest rates/credit spreads, foreign exchange rates or all three could cause the value of AUM to decline, which would result in lower investment advisory and administration fees. Corporate Investments Portfolio Risks. As a leading investment management firm, BlackRock devotes significant resources across all of its operations to identifying, measuring, monitoring, managing and analyzing market and operating risks, including the management and oversight of its own investment portfolio. The Board of Directors of the Company has adopted guidelines for the review of investments to be made by the Company, requiring, among other things, that investments be reviewed by certain senior officers of the Company, and that certain investments may be referred to the Audit Committee or the Board of Directors, depending on the circumstances, for approval. In the normal course of its business, BlackRock is exposed to equity market price risk, interest rate/credit spread risk and foreign exchange rate risk associated with its corporate investments. BlackRock has investments primarily in sponsored investment products that invest in a variety of asset classes, including real assets, private equity and hedge funds. Investments generally are made for co-investment purposes, to establish a performance track record, to hedge exposure to certain deferred compensation plans or for regulatory purposes. Currently, the Company has a seed capital hedging program in which it enters into swaps to hedge market and interest rate exposure to certain investments. At December 31, 2019, the Company had outstanding total return swaps with an aggregate notional value of approximately $644 million. At December 31, 2019, there were no outstanding interest rate swaps. At December 31, 2019, approximately $3.8 billion of BlackRock’s investments were maintained in consolidated sponsored investment products accounted for as VIEs and VREs. Excluding the impact of the Federal Reserve Bank stock, carried interest, investments made to hedge exposure to certain deferred compensation plans and certain investments that are hedged via the seed capital hedging program, the Company’s economic exposure to its investment portfolio is $2.7 billion. See Item 7, Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations-Balance Sheet Overview-Investments for further information on the Company’s investments. Equity Market Price Risk. At December 31, 2019, the Company’s net exposure to equity market price risk in its investment portfolio was approximately $763 million of the Company’s total economic investment exposure. Investments subject to market price risk include private equity and real assets investments, hedge funds and funds of funds as well as mutual funds. The Company estimates that a hypothetical 10% adverse change in market prices would result in a decrease of approximately $76.3 million in the carrying value of such investments. Interest-Rate/Credit Spread Risk. At December 31, 2019, the Company was exposed to interest rate risk and credit spread risk as a result of approximately $1,944 million of investments in debt securities and sponsored investment products that invest primarily in debt securities. Management considered a hypothetical 100 basis point fluctuation in interest rates or credit spreads and estimates that the impact of such a fluctuation on these investments, in the aggregate, would result in a decrease, or increase, of approximately $40 million in the carrying value of such investments. Foreign Exchange Rate Risk. As discussed above, the Company invests in sponsored investment products that invest in a variety of asset classes. The carrying value of the total economic investment exposure denominated in foreign currencies, primarily the British pound and Euro, was $753 million at December 31, 2019. A 10% adverse change in the applicable foreign exchange rates would result in approximately a $75.3 million decline in the carrying value of such investments. Other Market Risks. The Company executes forward foreign currency exchange contracts to mitigate the risk of certain foreign exchange risk movements. At December 31, 2019, the Company had outstanding forward foreign currency exchange contracts with an aggregate notional value of approximately $3.4 billion. 58",2023-12-30 18:58:59.925762
