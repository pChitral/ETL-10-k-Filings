62709,MMC,"MARSH & MCLENNAN COMPANIES, INC.",2012,"Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.GeneralMarsh & McLennan Companies, Inc. and Subsidiaries (the “Company”) is a global professional services firm providing advice and solutions in the areas of risk, strategy and human capital. It is the parent company of a number of the world’s leading risk experts and specialty consultants, including: Marsh, the insurance broker, intermediary and risk advisor; Guy Carpenter, the risk and reinsurance specialist; Mercer, the provider of HR and related financial advice and services; and Oliver Wyman Group, the management and economic consultancy. With over 52,000 employees worldwide and annual revenue exceeding $11.5 billion, the Company provides analysis, advice and transactional capabilities to clients in more than 100 countries.The Company conducts business through two segments:•Risk and Insurance Services includes risk management activities (risk advice, risk transfer and risk control and mitigation solutions) as well as insurance and reinsurance broking and services. We conduct business in this segment through Marsh and Guy Carpenter.•Consulting includes human resource consulting and related outsourcing and investment services, and specialized management and economic consulting services. We conduct business in this segment through Mercer and Oliver Wyman Group.The Company completed the sale of Kroll in August 2010, and along with other dispositions between 2008 and 2010, has divested its entire Risk Consulting and Technology Segment. Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements describes the Company's “continuing involvement” in certain Corporate Advisory and Restructuring businesses (“CARG”) that were disposed of in 2008. The runoff of the CARG businesses is being managed by the Company's corporate departments and financial results of these entities are included in “Corporate” for segment reporting purposes.We describe the primary sources of revenue and categories of expense for each segment below, in our discussion of segment financial results. A reconciliation of segment operating income to total operating income is included in Note 17 to the consolidated financial statements included in Part II Item 8 in this report. The accounting policies used for each segment are the same as those used for the consolidated financial statements.This MD&A contains forward-looking statements as that term is defined in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. See “Information Concerning Forward-Looking Statements” at the outset of this report. 26 Consolidated Results of OperationsFor the Years Ended December 31,(In millions, except per share figures)2011 2010 2009Revenue$11,526 $10,550 $9,831Expense Compensation and benefits6,969 6,465 6,182Other operating expenses2,919 3,146 2,871Operating expenses9,888 9,611 9,053Operating Income$1,638 $939 $778Income from Continuing Operations$982 $565 $531Discontinued Operations, net of tax33 306 (290)Net Income$1,015 $871 $241Net Income Attributable to the Company$993 $855 $227Net Income from Continuing Operations Per Share: Basic$1.76 $1.01 $0.97Diluted$1.73 $1.00 $0.96Net Income Per Share Attributable to the Company: Basic$1.82 $1.56 $0.43Diluted$1.79 $1.55 $0.42Average number of shares outstanding: Basic542 540 522Diluted551 544 524Shares outstanding at December 31,539 541 530Consolidated operating income was $1.6 billion in 2011 compared with $939 million in 2010. The 2010 results include a $400 million charge, net of insurance recoveries, for the resolution of the litigation brought by the Alaska Retirement Management Board (""ARMB"") and restructuring and other noteworthy items of $139 million. Excluding these charges, consolidated operating income was $1.5 billion in 2010.Risk and Insurance Services operating income increased $257 million or 26% to $1.2 billion in 2011 compared with 2010, resulting from revenue growth at both Marsh and Guy Carpenter, continued expense discipline and a decrease of $132 million in restructuring and other noteworthy items.Consulting operating income increased $459 million to $588 million in 2011 primarily due to the $400 million net charge related to the ARMB litigation settlement in 2010. Excluding these items, Consulting operating income increased $59 million, or 11%.Discontinued operations in 2011 includes a net credit resulting from the resolution of certain legal matters and related insurance recoveries as well as the settlement of certain tax audits and the expiration of the statute of limitations related to certain indemnified matters in connection with the disposal of Putnam and Kroll. These credits are partly offset by the write-off, net of tax, of capitalized software related to Marsh's plan to sell the Marsh Business Processing Outsourcing (""BPO"") business. Discontinued operations includes the operating results of Kroll in 2010 and 2009, including a goodwill impairment charge of $315 million in 2009, gains on the sales of Kroll and KLS in 2010 totaling $282 million, insurance recoveries of $16 million related to Putnam market-timing related matters in 2010 and the loss on the sale of KGS in 2009. Discontinued operations also includes the accretion of interest related to an indemnity for uncertain tax positions provided as part of the purchase by Great-West Life Co. Inc., of Putnam Investments Trust from the Company in August 2007. 27 28 Consolidated net income attributable to the Company was $993 million in 2011, compared with $855 million in 2010 and $227 million in 2009.Consolidated Revenues and ExpensesThe Company conducts business in many countries, as a result of which the impact of foreign exchange rate movements may impact period-to-period comparisons of revenue. Similarly, the revenue impact of acquisitions and dispositions may impact period-to-period comparisons of revenue. Underlying revenue measures the change in revenue from one period to another by isolating these impacts. The impact of foreign currency exchange fluctuations, acquisitions and dispositions including transfers among businesses, on the Company’s operating revenues is as follows: Year EndedDecember 31, Components of Revenue Change*(In millions, except percentage figures)2011 2010 % ChangeRevenue CurrencyImpact Acquisitions/DispositionsImpact UnderlyingRevenueRisk and Insurance Services Marsh$5,213 $4,744 10% 2% 4% 4%Guy Carpenter1,041 975 7% 1% 1% 5%Subtotal6,254 5,719 9% 2% 3% 5%Fiduciary Interest Income47 45 Total Risk and Insurance Services6,301 5,764 9% 2% 3% 5%Consulting Mercer3,782 3,478 9% 3% 2% 4%Oliver Wyman Group1,483 1,357 9% 2% — 7%Total Consulting5,265 4,835 9% 3% 1% 5%Corporate and Other/Eliminations(40) (49) Total Revenue$11,526 $10,550 9% 2% 2% 5%*Components of revenue change may not add due to rounding. 29 Revenue DetailsThe following table provides more detailed revenue information for certain of the components presented above: Year EndedDecember 31, Components of Revenue Change*(In millions, except percentage figures)2011 2010 % ChangeRevenue CurrencyImpact Acquisitions/DispositionsImpact UnderlyingRevenueMarsh: EMEA$1,796 $1,674 7% 2 % 2 % 4 %Asia Pacific612 503 22% 8 % 4 % 9 %Latin America334 298 12% (1)% — 14 %Total International2,742 2,475 11% 3 % 2 % 6 %U.S. / Canada2,471 2,269 9% — 6 % 3 %Total Marsh$5,213 $4,744 10% 2 % 4 % 4 %Mercer: Retirement$1,071 $1,053 2% 3 % — (1)%Health and Benefits940 900 4% 2 % (3)% 6 %Talent, Rewards & Communications576 488 18% 3 % 5 % 11 %Total Mercer Consulting2,587 2,441 6% 2 % — 4 %Outsourcing733 671 9% 5 % 5 % —Investments462 366 26% 6 % 9 % 11 %Total Mercer$3,782 $3,478 9% 3 % 2 % 4 %*Components of revenue change may not add due to rounding. 30 Year EndedDecember 31, Components of RevenueChange*(In millions, except percentage figures)2010 2009 % ChangeRevenue CurrencyImpact Acquisitions/DispositionsImpact UnderlyingRevenueRisk and Insurance Services Marsh$4,744 $4,319 10% 1 % 6% 2%Guy Carpenter975 911 7% 1 % 4% 2%Subtotal5,719 5,230 9% 1 % 6% 2%Fiduciary Interest Income45 54 Total Risk and Insurance Services5,764 5,284 9% 1 % 6% 2%Consulting Mercer3,478 3,327 5% 2 % 1% 2%Oliver Wyman Group1,357 1,282 6% (1)% — 7%Total Consulting4,835 4,609 5% 1 % — 3%Corporate and Other /Eliminations(49) (62) Total Revenue$10,550 $9,831 7% 1 % 3% 3%*Components of revenue change may not add due to rounding.Revenue DetailsThe following table provides more detailed revenue information for certain of the components presented above: Year EndedDecember 31, Components of RevenueChange*(In millions, except percentage figures) 2010 2009 % ChangeRevenue CurrencyImpact Acquisitions/DispositionsImpact UnderlyingRevenueMarsh: EMEA $1,674 $1,555 8 % — 5% 3 %Asia Pacific 503 419 20 % 8% 5% 7 %Latin America 298 267 11 % 4% — 8 %Total International 2,475 2,241 10 % 2% 5% 4 %U.S. / Canada 2,269 2,078 9 % 1% 7% 1 %Total Marsh $4,744 $4,319 10 % 1% 6% 2 %Mercer: Retirement $1,053 $1,091 (4)% 1% — (4)%Health and Benefits 900 857 5 % — — 5 %Talent, Rewards & Communications 488 456 7 % 1% 4% 2 %Total Mercer Consulting 2,441 2,404 2 % 1% 1% —Outsourcing 671 620 8 % 4% 1% 3 %Investments 366 303 21 % 4% — 16 %Total Mercer $3,478 $3,327 5 % 2% 1% 2 %*Components of revenue change may not add due to rounding. 31 RevenueConsolidated revenue for 2011 increased 9% to $11.5 billion compared with $10.6 billion in 2010, reflecting a 5% increase in underlying revenue, a 2% increase due to acquisitions and a 2% positive impact of foreign currency translation. Revenue in the Risk and Insurance Services segment increased 9% in 2011 compared with 2010 or 5% on an underlying basis, reflecting increases of 4% in Marsh and 5% in Guy Carpenter. Consulting segment revenue increased 9%, resulting from 9% increases in both Mercer and the Oliver Wyman Group. On an underlying basis, revenue increased 5%, reflecting a 4% increase in Mercer and a 7% increase in the Oliver Wyman Group.Consolidated revenue for 2010 increased 7% to $10.6 billion compared with $9.8 billion in 2009, reflecting a 3% increase in underlying revenue, a 3% increase due to acquisitions and a 1% positive impact of foreign currency translation. Revenue in the Risk and Insurance Services segment increased 9% in 2010 compared with 2009. Underlying revenue increased 2% for the total Risk and Insurance Services segment, reflecting 2% increases in both Marsh and Guy Carpenter, partly offset by a 21% decrease in fiduciary interest income. Consulting segment revenue increased 5%, resulting from a 5% increase in Mercer and a 6% increase in the Oliver Wyman Group. On an underlying basis, revenue increased 3% reflecting a 2% increase in Mercer and a 7% increase in the Oliver Wyman Group.ExpensesConsolidated operating expenses increased 3% in 2011 compared with the same period in 2010. Expenses in 2010 include the $400 million ARMB settlement at Mercer. Restructuring and other noteworthy charges, which include legal fees, net of insurance recoveries arising from regulatory actions and credits related to the CARG business divested in 2008, decreased $116 million to $23 million in 2011 as compared to $139 million in 2010. Excluding these charges, expenses were $9.9 billion in 2011 compared with $9.1 billion in 2010, an increase of 9%. The increase reflects a 3% increase due to the impact of foreign currency exchange, a 2% increase due to the impact of acquisitions and a 4% increase in underlying expenses. The increase in underlying expenses primarily reflects higher compensation and benefits costs, including increased pension costs, higher consulting costs, asset-based fees and expenses reimbursable from clients.Consolidated operating expenses increased 6% in 2010 compared with the same period in 2009. Expenses in 2010 include the $400 million ARMB settlement at Mercer. In 2009, the Company recorded a $230 million charge, net of insurance recoveries, for the settlement of the securities and ERISA class action lawsuits filed in 2004. Restructuring and other noteworthy charges in 2010 of $139 million decreased $155 million from charges of $294 million in 2009. Excluding these charges, expenses were $9.1 billion in 2010 compared with $8.5 billion in 2009, an increase of 6%. The increase reflects a 1% increase due to the impact of foreign currency exchange, a 3% increase due to the impact of acquisitions and a 2% increase in underlying expenses. The increase in underlying expenses is due to higher pension, travel and entertainment, outsourcing and other outside services costs.RestructuringIn 2011, the Company implemented restructuring actions which resulted in costs totaling $51 million, primarily related to severance and benefits, and costs for future rent and other real estate costs. Approximately $5 million of these costs related to cost reduction activities for acquisitions made in 2011 and 2010. These costs were incurred as follows: Risk and Insurance Services—$1 million; Consulting—$31 million (acquisition related—$8 million); and Corporate—$19 million. These activities resulted in the elimination of approximately 400 positions at Mercer and 40 positions at Corporate. The annualized cost savings from these actions are expected to be approximately $45 million.Businesses ExitedMarsh's BPO business, one of seven units within the Marsh Consumer business, provides policy, claims, call center and accounting operations on an outsourced basis to life insurance carriers. Marsh invested in a technology platform that was designed to make the BPO business scalable and more efficient. During 2011, Marsh decided that it would cease investing in the technology platform and instead exit the business via a sale. In the fourth quarter of 2011, management initiated a plan to sell the Marsh BPO business. The company wrote off capitalized software of the BPO business of $17 million, net of tax, which is included in discontinued operations. 32 In February 2010, Kroll sold KLS, its substance abuse testing business for $110 million. On August 3, 2010, the Company completed the sale of Kroll to Altegrity for $1.13 billion. The account balances and activities of Kroll and KLS have been segregated and reported as discontinued operations in the accompanying financial statements for 2010 and 2009. The gain on the sale of Kroll and related tax benefits and the after- tax loss on the disposal of KLS, along with Kroll’s and KLS’s 2010 and comparative results of operations are included in discontinued operations.During the second quarter of 2009, Kroll sold Kroll Government Services (""KGS""). The results of operations and the loss on sale of KGS are included in discontinued operations for that year.During the fourth quarter of 2008, the Company sold its U.S. and U.K. restructuring businesses to their respective management teams in separate leveraged buyouts. Based on the terms and conditions of the disposals, the Company determined it has “continuing involvement” in these businesses, as that term is used in SEC Staff Accounting Bulletin Topic 5e. Therefore, classification of CARG as discontinued operations is not appropriate, and their financial results in the current and prior periods are included in continuing operations. The Company will earn royalties on future revenue of these businesses through 2012. The royalties will be recognized when earned under the terms of the contract and when collectibility is reasonably assured. Through December 31, 2011, the Company has recognized $20 million of royalty payments related to the U.K. businesses ($9 million in 2011, $10 million in 2010 and $1 million in 2009). The transfer of the U.S. restructuring business was financed with a seller note. If the Company receives interest and principal payments as scheduled for the U.S. business, it will recover the value of the net assets transferred to the new owners and recognize a gain on the disposal of $18 million.In March 2010, the Company agreed to suspend collections of interest and principal payments on the seller financed note related to the U.S. restructuring business. The payments received prior to March 2010 were sufficient to allow the Company to recover the value of net assets transferred and recognize $1 million of gain. Although it is uncertain whether future payments will be received under the revised terms of the note, the Company has no remaining net investment in the U.S. restructuring business. Any future collections will be recognized as income, if and when received.Risk and Insurance ServicesIn the Risk and Insurance Services segment, the Company’s subsidiaries and other affiliated entities act as brokers, agents or consultants for insureds, insurance underwriters and other brokers in the areas of risk management, insurance broking and insurance program management services, primarily under the name of Marsh; and engage in reinsurance broking, catastrophe and financial modeling services and related advisory functions, primarily under the name of Guy Carpenter.Marsh and Guy Carpenter are compensated for brokerage and consulting services primarily through fees paid by clients and/or commissions paid out of premiums charged by insurance and reinsurance companies. Commission rates vary in amount depending upon the type of insurance or reinsurance coverage provided, the particular insurer or reinsurer, the capacity in which the broker acts and negotiations with clients. Revenues are affected by premium rate levels in the insurance/reinsurance markets, the amount of risk retained by insurance and reinsurance clients themselves and by the value of the risks that have been insured since commission based compensation is frequently related to the premiums paid by insureds/reinsureds. In many cases, fee compensation may be negotiated in advance, based on the types and amounts of risks to be analyzed by the Company and ultimately placed into the insurance market or retained by the client. The trends and comparisons of revenue from one period to the next will therefore be affected by changes in premium rate levels, fluctuations in client risk retention, and increases or decreases in the value of risks that have been insured, as well as new and lost business, and the volume of business from new and existing clients.In March 2010, Marsh announced its approach to market remuneration and contingent commissions in the U.S. As previously announced, Marsh and McLennan Agency and Marsh’s affinity, sponsored program and personal lines businesses accept contingent commissions. Marsh does not accept contingent commissions on any placement for any U.S. clients served by the firm’s core brokerage operation. Marsh will continue to collect enhanced commissions with respect to its core brokerage operations, which are fixed in advance of insurance transactions and are not related to volume, retention, growth or profitability. 33 Marsh and Guy Carpenter receive interest income on certain funds (such as premiums and claims proceeds) held in a fiduciary capacity for others. The investment of fiduciary funds is regulated by state and other insurance authorities. These regulations typically provide for segregation of fiduciary funds and limit the types of investments that may be made with them. Interest income from these investments varies depending on the amount of funds invested and applicable interest rates, both of which vary from time to time. For presentation purposes, fiduciary interest is segregated from the other revenues of Marsh and Guy Carpenter and separately presented within the segment, as shown in the revenue by segments charts earlier in this MD&A.The results of operations for the Risk and Insurance Services segment are presented below: (In millions of dollars)2011 2010 2009Revenue$6,301 $5,764 $5,284Compensation and Benefits3,482 3,261 3,023Other Operating Expenses1,590 1,531 1,465Expense5,072 4,792 4,488Operating Income$1,229 $972 $796Operating Income Margin19.5% 16.9% 15.1%RevenueRevenue in Risk and Insurance Services increased 9% in 2011 compared with 2010 reflecting a 5% increase on an underlying basis, a 3% increase from acquisitions, and a 2% increase from the impact of foreign currency exchange translation.In Marsh, revenue in 2011 was $5.2 billion, an increase of 10% from the prior year, reflecting 4% growth in underlying revenue, a 4% increase from acquisitions and a 2% increase resulting from the impact of foreign currency translation. The underlying revenue increase of 4% reflects growth in all major geographies, driven by higher retention rates and new business development. Underlying revenue increased 14% in Latin America, 9% in Asia Pacific, 3% in U.S. / Canada and 4% in EMEA.In January 2011, Marsh acquired RJF Agencies, an independent insurance agency in the upper Midwest. In February 2011, Marsh acquired Hampton Roads Bonding, a surety bonding agency for commercial, road, utility, maritime and government contractors in the state of Virginia, and the Boston office of Kinloch Consulting Group, Inc. In July 2011, Marsh acquired Prescott Pailet Benefits, an employee benefits broker based in Texas. In October 2011, Marsh acquired the employee benefits division of Kaeding, Ernst & Co, a Massachusetts based employee benefits, life insurance and financial planning consulting firm. In November 2011, Marsh acquired Seitlin Insurance, a property and casualty insurance and employee benefits firm located in South Florida.In the first quarter of 2010, Marsh acquired Haake Companies, Inc., an insurance broking firm in the Midwest region and Thomas Rutherfoord, Inc., an insurance broking firm in the Southeast and mid-Atlantic regions of the U.S. In the second quarter of 2010, Marsh acquired HSBC Insurance Brokers Ltd. (""HIBL""), an international provider of risk intermediary and risk advisory services and the Bostonian Group Insurance Agency, Inc. and Bostonian Solutions, Inc. (collectively the “Bostonian Group”), a regional insurance brokerage in New England. In the fourth quarter of 2010, Marsh acquired Trion, a U.S. private benefits specialist and SBS, a Georgia-based benefits brokerage and consulting firm.All of the acquisitions noted above, except HIBL, relate to the Marsh & McLennan Agency. In January 2012, Marsh announced it had completed its acquisition of the brokerage operations of Alexander Forbes in South Africa, Botswana and Namibia.Guy Carpenter’s revenue increased 7% to $1.0 billion in 2011 compared with 2010, or 5% on an underlying basis. The increase in underlying revenue was driven by strong new business development and high retention rates. Fiduciary interest income was $47 million in 2011 compared to $45 million in 2010 due to higher average invested funds partly offset by lower interest rates. 34 Revenue in Risk and Insurance Services increased 9% in 2010 compared with 2009 reflecting a 2% increase on an underlying basis, a 6% increase from acquisitions, and a 1% increase from the impact of foreign currency exchange translation.In Marsh, revenue in 2010 was $4.7 billion, an increase of 10% from the same quarter of the prior year, reflecting 2% growth in underlying revenue, a 6% increase from acquisitions and a 1% increase resulting from the impact of foreign currency translation. Marsh increased revenues in all its geographies, reflecting new business growth of 8%. Underlying revenue increased 8% in Latin America, 7% in Asia Pacific, 1% in U.S. / Canada and 3% in EMEA.Guy Carpenter’s revenue increased 7% to $975 million in 2010 compared with 2009, or 2% on an underlying basis. The increase in underlying revenue was due to continued strong new business and high client retention.Fiduciary interest income for the Risk and Insurance Services segment was $45 million in 2010, a decrease of 16% compared with the same period of 2009, driven by lower interest rates.ExpenseExpenses in the Risk and Insurance Services segment increased 6% in 2011 compared with 2010, reflecting a 3% increase from acquisitions and a 2% increase due to the impact of foreign currency translation. Expenses on an underlying basis increased 1% as the segment continued to effectively monitor and control its expenses. The increase in underlying expenses is primarily due to higher base salaries and incentive compensation costs, non-restructuring related severance costs and facilities and equipment costs, partly offset by lower restructuring expenses and a credit of $31 million for insurance recoveries on previously expensed legal fees.Expenses in the Risk and Insurance Services segment increased 7% in 2010 compared with 2009, reflecting a 6% increase from acquisitions and a 1% increase due to the impact of foreign currency translation. Expenses on an underlying basis were flat, as higher pension related expenses, travel and entertainment, and outsourcing costs were offset by a $77 million decrease in restructuring and related charges.ConsultingThe Company conducts business in its Consulting segment through two main business groups. Mercer provides consulting expertise, advice, services and solutions in the areas of retirement, health & benefits, talent, rewards & communications, outsourcing, and investments. Oliver Wyman Group provides specialized management and economic and brand consulting services.The major component of revenue in the Consulting segment business is fees paid by clients for advice and services. Mercer, principally through its health & benefits line of business, also earns revenue in the form of commissions received from insurance companies for the placement of group (and occasionally individual) insurance contracts, primarily life, health and accident coverages. Revenue for Mercer’s investment management business and certain of Mercer’s outsourcing businesses consists principally of fees based on assets under management or administration.Revenue in the Consulting segment is affected by, among other things, global economic conditions, including changes in clients’ particular industries and markets. Revenue is also affected by competition due to the introduction of new products and services, broad trends in employee demographics, including levels of employment, the effect of government policies and regulations, and fluctuations in interest and foreign exchange rates. Revenues from the provision of investment management services and retirement trust and administrative services are significantly affected by securities market performance. 35 The results of operations for the Consulting segment are presented below: (In millions of dollars)2011 2010 2009Revenue$5,265 $4,835 $4,609Compensation and Benefits3,233 2,974 2,917Other Operating Expenses1,444 1,732 1,287Expense4,677 4,706 4,204Operating Income$588 $129 $405Operating Income Margin11.2% 2.7% 8.8%RevenueConsulting revenue in 2011 increased 9% compared with 2010, or 5% on an underlying basis. Mercer’s revenue was $3.8 billion in 2011, an increase of 9% or 4% on an underlying basis. Within Mercer’s consulting lines, revenue on an underlying basis increased 4% in 2011 compared with 2010, reflecting increases of 6% in health and benefits and 11% in talent, rewards & communications, offset by a 1% decline in retirement. Outsourcing revenue grew 9% and was flat on an underlying basis. Investments revenue increased 26% or 11% on an underlying basis. Oliver Wyman’s revenue increased 9% to $1.5 billion in 2011, or 7% on an underlying basis. Consulting revenue in 2010 increased 5% compared with 2009, or 3% on an underlying basis. Mercer’s revenue was $3.5 billion in 2010, an increase of 5%. On an underlying basis, Mercer’s revenue increased 2%. Within Mercer’s consulting lines, revenue on an underlying basis in 2010 was flat compared with 2009, reflecting increases of 5% in health and benefits and 2% in talent, rewards & communications, offset by a 4% decline in retirement. The growth in health and benefits was driven by increases in all geographies. The increase in talent, rewards & communications was driven by a resurgence of demand for compensation surveys partially offset by lower talent, rewards & communications consulting assignments concentrated in the first half of the year. Outsourcing revenue increased 3% on an underlying basis, driven by new client wins primarily in Australia. Investment consulting & management revenue increased 16% on an underlying basis, due to strong growth in all geographies. Oliver Wyman’s revenue increased 6% to $1.4 billion in 2010, or 7% on an underlying basis, driven by double-digit revenue growth within its financial services practice. Other areas, including the healthcare, transportation and consumer sectors also generated double-digit revenue growth.ExpenseConsulting segment expenses in 2011 decreased 1% to $4.7 billion, or 4% on an underlying basis. Mercer recorded a $400 million net charge related to the ARMB settlement in 2010. Excluding this charge, expenses increased 4% on an underlying basis. This increase reflects the impact of higher base-salaries and incentive compensation and benefits costs, including higher pension costs, and higher asset-based fees and recoverable expenses from clients. Consulting expenses in 2010 increased 12% to $4.7 billion, or 10% on an underlying basis. Mercer recorded a $400 million net charge related to the ARMB settlement in 2010 and in 2009 recorded incremental costs of $30 million related to a professional liability settlement. Excluding these charges, expenses increased 3% on an underlying basis. This increase reflects the impact of higher pension related costs, meeting and training costs, recruitment and asset based fees partly offset by lower severance, restructuring and recoverable expenses from clients.Corporate and OtherAs discussed earlier in this document, the run-off of the Company’s involvement in the CARG businesses is now managed by the Company’s corporate departments, and consequently, the financial results of these businesses are included in “Corporate” for segment reporting purposes. 36 37 The following results of Corporate and Other includes the Corporate Advisory and Restructuring operations:(In millions of dollars)2011 2010 2009Corporate and Other: Corporate Advisory and Restructuring Operating Income$9 $10 $(3)Corporate Expense(188) (172) (420)Total Corporate and Other$(179) $(162) $(423)Corporate expenses in 2011 were $188 million compared to $172 million in 2010. The increase in Corporate expense reflects higher compensation and pension costs primarily due to executive positions added in corporate and higher outside services costs related to corporate initiatives, such as branding. The CARG amounts reflect payments received related to the CARG businesses divested in 2008.Corporate expenses in 2010 were $172 million compared to $420 million in 2009. The decrease is due, largely to the impact of a $230 million net charge incurred in 2009 related to the settlement of the securities and ERISA class action lawsuits. The decrease in Corporate expense in 2010 compared to 2009 also reflects the impact of lower restructuring charges partly offset by higher consulting fees. The increase in Corporate Advisory and Restructuring in 2010 is due to the impact of $10 million of payments received in 2010 related to the disposal of this unit in 2008 compared with $1 million in 2009. These payments are classified as a recovery of expenses previously incurred as a result of the disposal transaction.Discontinued OperationsAs part of the disposal transactions for Putnam and Kroll, the Company provided certain indemnities, primarily related to pre-transaction tax uncertainties and legal contingencies. In accordance with applicable accounting guidance, liabilities were established related to these indemnities at the time of the sales and reflected as a reduction of the gain on disposal. Discontinued operations includes charges or credits resulting from the settlement or resolution of the indemnified matters, as well as adjustments to the liabilities related to such matters. Discontinued operations in 2011 includes credits of $50 million from the resolution of certain legal matters and insurance recoveries, as well as the settlement of tax audits and the expiration of the statutes of limitations related to certain of the indemnified matters, primarily with respect to Putnam.Marsh's Business Process Outsourcing (""BPO"") business, one of seven units within the Marsh Consumer business, provides policy, claims, call center and accounting operations on an outsourced basis to life insurance carriers. Marsh invested in a technology platform that was designed to make the BPO business scalable and more efficient. During 2011, Marsh decided that it would cease investing in the technology platform and instead exit the business via a sale. In the fourth quarter of 2011, management initiated a plan to sell the Marsh BPO business. The company wrote off capitalized software of the BPO business of $17 million, net of tax, which is included in discontinued operations. On August 3, 2010, the Company completed its sale of Kroll to Altegrity for cash proceeds of $1.13 billion. In the first quarter of 2010, Kroll completed the sale of KLS. The gain on the sale of Kroll and related tax benefits and the after-tax loss on the sale of KLS, along with Kroll’s and KLS’s 2010 and comparative results of operations are included in discontinued operations in 2010 and 2009.Discontinued operations in 2011, 2010 and 2009 includes the accretion of interest related to an indemnity for uncertain tax positions provided as part of the purchase by Great-West Lifeco, Inc. of Putnam Investments Trust from the Company in August 2007. Discontinued operations in 2010 includes $16 million for insurance recoveries for costs incurred in prior years related to Putnam. 38 In the second quarter of 2009 Kroll completed the sale of KGS. The loss on the sale of KGS and comparative results of operations are included in discontinued operations in 2009.Summarized Statements of Income data for discontinued operations is as follows: For the Years Ended December 31,(In millions of dollars)2011 2010 2009Kroll Operations Revenue$— $381 $699Expense (a)— 345 958Net operating income— 36 (259)Income tax— 16 24Income from Kroll operations, net of tax— 20 (283)Other discontinued operations, net of tax(17) (7) —Income (loss) from discontinued operations, net of tax(17) 13 (283)Disposals of discontinued operations (b)25 58 8Income tax (credit) expense (c)(25) (235) 15Disposals of discontinued operations, net of tax50 293 (7)Discontinued operations, net of tax$33 $306 $(290)Discontinued operations, net of tax per share —Basic$0.06 $0.55 $(0.54)—Diluted$0.06 $0.55 $(0.54)(a)Includes goodwill impairment charges of $315 million for 2009.(b)Includes gain on sale of Kroll and the gain on the sale of KLS in 2010 and a loss on the sale of KGS in 2009.(c)The income tax credit related to the disposal of discontinued operations for 2010 primarily represents the recognition of tax benefits related to the sale of Kroll, partly offset by a tax provision of $36 million related to the sale of KGS.Other Corporate ItemsInterestInterest income earned on corporate funds amounted to $28 million in 2011 compared with $20 million in 2010. The increase in interest income is due to the combined effect of higher average invested funds in 2011 and slightly higher average interest rates compared with the prior year. Interest expense was $199 million in 2011 compared with $233 million in 2010. The decrease is primarily due to the maturity of $550 million of senior notes in the third quarter of 2010, the early extinguishment of a portion of the Company's outstanding notes during the third quarter of 2011 and a lower net interest rate on the Company's debt subject to interest rate swaps. These decreases are partly offset by interest on new senior notes issued during the third quarter of 2011.Interest income earned on corporate funds amounted to $20 million in 2010 compared with $17 million in 2009. The increase was primarily due to higher non-U.S. interest rate yields in 2010 compared to 2009. Interest expense was $233 million in 2010 compared with $241 million in 2009. The decrease in interest expense was primarily due to the maturity of $550 million of senior notes in the third quarter of 2010.Early Extinguishment of DebtOn July 15, 2011 the Company purchased $600 million of outstanding notes, comprised of $330 million of its 2014 Notes and $270 million of its 2015 Notes (collectively, the ""Notes""). The Company acquired the Notes at market value plus a tender premium, which exceeded its carrying value and resulted in a charge of approximately $72 million in the third quarter of 2011.Investment Income (Loss) 39 In 2011, investment income was $9 million compared with $43 million in 2010. This decrease primarily 40 reflects the impact of lower private equity gains recorded in 2011 as compared to 2010, the effects of recording an impairment loss in 2011 and a gain on the sale of equity securities in 2010. In 2010, investment income was $43 million compared with a loss of $2 million in 2009. The increase reflects the impact of mark-to-market gains in 2010 on Risk Capital Holdings’ private equity investments compared to losses in 2009, and gains realized from the sale of equity securities in 2010.Income TaxesThe Company's consolidated effective tax rate in 2011 was 30.1% and in 2010 was 26.5%. The tax rate in each year reflects foreign operations, which are taxed at rates lower than the U.S. statutory tax rate. The Company's consolidated effective tax rate in 2009 was 3.8%. The tax rate reflects reductions relating to a decrease in the liability for unrecognized tax benefits and the impact of foreign operations, which are taxed at rates lower than the U.S. statutory tax rate. The decrease in the liability for unrecognized tax benefits resulted from expiring statutes of limitations, audit settlements and changes in estimates.The lower effective tax rate attributed to the Company's foreign operations primarily reflects lower corporate tax rates that prevail outside of the U.S., net of the U.S. tax impact from repatriating foreign earnings. In 2011 pre-tax income in the U.K., Canada, Australia and Bermuda accounted for approximately 60% of the Company's total non-U.S. pre-tax income, with effective rates in those countries of 25%, 29%, 31% and 0%, respectively. Under current U.S. tax law, the Company anticipates its non-U.S. operations will continue to incur taxes at rates under the U.S. federal tax rate of 35%. The Company's non-U.S. revenue over the past three years has been approximately 55% of total revenue, while the pre-tax income from non-U.S. locations varied from 91% to 179% of total pre-tax income. Although revenue in the United States has been approximately 45% of total revenue, while the Company had gains in its U.S. operations in 2011, the Company incurred pre-tax losses in the United States during 2010 and 2009 because significant charges from restructuring activities and certain litigation matters were disproportionately incurred there. Litigation related charges, including legal fees, resulted from the settlement of shareholder and ERISA class actions in 2009, and the resolution of the Alaska matter in 2010, all of which are discussed in Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. The Company incurred gains in its U.S. operations in 2011.In addition, as a U.S. domiciled parent holding company, Marsh & McLennan Companies, Inc., is the issuer for essentially all of the Company's external indebtedness, and incurs the related interest expense in the U.S. Finally, most senior executive and oversight functions are conducted in the U.S. Therefore, the associated costs are incurred primarily in the United States.The effective tax rate is expected to remain significantly variable for the foreseeable future. It is sensitive to the geographic mix and repatriation of the Company's earnings, which may result in higher or lower tax rates. A proportional increase in U.S. pre-tax income will tend to increase the effective tax rate because U.S. federal and state corporate tax rates substantially exceed tax rates applicable outside the U.S. Losses in certain jurisdictions cannot be offset by earnings from other operations, and may require valuation allowances that affect the rate, depending on estimates of the realizability of associated deferred tax assets. The tax rate is also sensitive to changes in unrecognized tax benefits, including the impact of settled tax audits and expired statutes of limitation.The realization of deferred tax assets depends on generating future taxable income during the periods in which the tax benefits are deductible or creditable. The Company and Marsh have been profitable globally. However, tax liabilities are determined and assessed on a legal entity and jurisdictional basis. Certain taxing jurisdictions allow or require combined or consolidated tax filings. In the United States, certain groups within the Company, which file on a combined basis, were profitable in 2011, but incurred losses in 2009 and 2010, and an entity within Marsh's operations, which files on a separate entity basis, incurred a loss in 2009. The Company assessed the realizability of its domestic deferred tax assets, particularly state deferred tax assets of Marsh relating to jurisdictions in which it files separate tax returns, state deferred tax assets of all of the Company domestic operations related to jurisdictions in which the Company files a unitary or combined state tax return, and foreign tax credit carryforwards in the Company's consolidated U.S. federal tax return. When making its assessment about the realization of its domestic deferred tax assets at December 31, 2011, the Company considered all available evidence, placing particular weight on evidence that could be objectively verified. The evidence considered included 41 (i) the profitability of the Company's U.S. operations in 2011 (ii) the nature, frequency, and severity of current and cumulative financial reporting losses, (iii) actions completed that are designed to reduce capacity and adjust to lower demand in the current economic environment, (iv) profit trends evidenced by continued improvements in the Company's and Marsh's operating performance, (v) the non-recurring nature of some of the items that contributed to the losses, (vi) the carryforward periods for the net operating losses (""NOLs"") and foreign tax credit carryforwards, (vii) the sources and timing of future taxable income, giving weight to sources according to the extent to which they can be objectively verified, and (viii) tax planning strategies that would be implemented, if necessary, to accelerate utilization of NOLs. Based on its assessment, the Company concluded that it is more likely than not that a substantial portion of these deferred tax assets are realizable and a valuation allowance was recorded to reduce the domestic tax assets to the amount that the Company believes is more likely than not to be realized. In the event sufficient taxable income is not generated in future periods, additional valuation allowances of up to approximately $240 million could be required relating to these domestic deferred tax assets. The realization of the remaining U.S. federal deferred tax assets is not as sensitive to U.S. profits because it is supported by anticipated repatriation of future annual earnings from the Company's profitable global operations, consistent with the Company's historical practice. In addition, when making its assessment about the realization of its domestic deferred tax assets at December 31, 2011, the Company continued to assess the realizability of deferred tax assets of certain other entities with a history of recent losses, including other U.S. entities that file separate state tax returns and foreign subsidiaries, and recorded valuation allowances as appropriate.Changes in tax laws or tax rulings may have a significant adverse impact on our effective tax rate. For example, proposals for fundamental U.S. international tax reform, if enacted, could have a significant adverse impact on the effective tax rate.Liquidity and Capital ResourcesThe Company is organized as a holding company, a legal entity separate and distinct from its operating subsidiaries. As a holding company without significant operations of its own, the Company is dependent upon dividends and other payments from its operating subsidiaries to meet its obligations for paying principal and interest on outstanding debt obligations, for paying dividends to stockholders and for corporate expenses. Other sources of liquidity include borrowing facilities discussed below in financing cash flows.The Company derives a significant portion of its revenue and operating profit from operating subsidiaries located outside of the United States. Funds from the Company’s operating subsidiaries located outside of the United States are regularly repatriated to the United States out of annual earnings. At December 31, 2011, the Company had approximately $1.5 billion of cash and cash equivalents in its foreign operations of which all but approximately $82 million is considered to be permanently invested in those operations to fund foreign investments and working capital needs. The Company expects to continue its practice of repatriating foreign funds out of annual earnings. While management does not foresee a need to repatriate the funds which are currently deemed permanently invested, if facts or circumstances change management could elect to repatriate them, if necessary, which could result in higher effective tax rates in the future.Cash on our consolidated balance sheets includes funds available for general corporate purposes. Funds held on behalf of clients in a fiduciary capacity are segregated and shown separately in the consolidated balance sheets as an offset to fiduciary liabilities. Fiduciary funds cannot be used for general corporate purposes, and should not be considered as a source of liquidity for the Company.Operating Cash FlowsThe Company generated $1.7 billion of cash from operations in 2011 compared with $722 million in 2010. These amounts reflect the net income reported by the Company during those periods, excluding gains or losses from investments and the disposition of businesses, adjusted for non-cash charges and changes in working capital which relate, primarily, to the timing of payments for accrued liabilities or receipts of assets. Cash generated from the disposition of businesses is included in investing cash flows. The Company received $322 million in cash refunds of U.S. federal income taxes during the second quarter of 2011, comprising $212 million from carrying back the net capital loss incurred in 2010 from the 42 sale of Kroll and various other assets, and $110 million from the cash settlement of the IRS audit for the periods 2006 through 2008. The audit settlement primarily reflected the allowance of carry back claims for net operating losses and excess foreign tax credits arising in 2008. The impact on the tax provision of these events was reflected in prior periods and did not impact income tax expense reported in 2011.On June 11, 2010, the Company resolved the litigation brought by the ARMB on behalf of two Alaska benefit plans against Mercer, relating to work in the period 1992 to 2004. Under the terms of the settlement agreement, Mercer paid $500 million, of which $100 million was covered by insurance. Pension Related ItemsDuring 2011, the Company contributed $24 million to its U.S. pension plans and $320 million to non-U.S. pension plans, compared with $221 million for U.S. plans and $237 million for non-U.S. plans in 2010.On January 3, 2012, the Company contributed $100 million to its U.S. qualified plan. The Company’s expected funding for its U.S. and non-U.S. pension plans for the remainder of 2012 is approximately $24 million and $395 million, respectively. The Company’s policy for funding its tax-qualified defined benefit retirement plans is to contribute amounts at least sufficient to meet the funding requirements set forth in U.S. and applicable laws of other jurisdictions. There currently is no ERISA funding requirement for the U.S. qualified plan for 2011 or 2012. Funding requirements for non-U.S. plans vary by country. Contribution rates are determined by the local actuaries based on local funding practices and statutory requirements, which may differ from measurements under U.S. GAAP. Funding amounts may be influenced by future asset performance, the level of discount rates and other variables impacting the assets and/or liabilities of the plan. In addition, amounts funded in the future, to the extent not due under regulatory requirements, may be affected by alternative uses of the Company’s cash flows, including dividends, investments and share repurchases.Pension liabilities are impacted by, among other things, the discount rate set as of year-end. In addition, the year-over-year change in the funded status of the plans is impacted by the variance between actual and assumed results, particularly with regard to return on assets and changes in the discount rate, as well as the amount of Company contributions, if any. Unrecognized actuarial losses were approximately $1.7 billion and $3.0 billion at December 31, 2011 for the U.S. plans and non-U.S. plans, respectively, compared with $1.3 billion and $2.3 billion at December 31, 2010. The increase is primarily due to the impact of decreases in the discount rates as well as actual returns in 2011 that were lower than the estimated long-term rate of return on plan assets. In the past several years, the amount of actuarial losses has been significantly impacted, both positively and negatively, by actual asset performance and changes in discount rates. The discount rate used to measure plan liabilities declined in both the U.S. and the U.K. (our two largest plans) in each of the three years for 2009 to 2011. At the end of 2009, the weighted average discount rate for all plans was 6.0%, declining to 5.6% and 4.9% at the end of 2010 and 2011, respectively. A decline in the discount rate increases the measured plan liability, resulting in actuarial losses. During 2011, the Company's defined benefit pension plan assets had actual returns of 5.8%, and 4.8% in the U.S. and U.K., respectively. During 2010, the actual returns were 14.4% in the U.S. and 13.5% in the U.K., and in 2009 were 12.6% and 14.8% in the U.S and U.K., respectively. In 2011, both the decline in the discount rate and actual asset returns that were lower than the assumed rates of return contributed to the actuarial losses. In 2010 and 2009, actuarial losses resulting from declines in the discount rate were partly offset by actual asset returns which exceeded the assumed rates of return in each year. Overall, the Company’s pension expense is expected to increase in 2012 by approximately $30 million before the partly-offsetting impacts on bonuses and other incentive compensation and possible movements in foreign exchange rates. The increase in the expected pension expense in 2012 results primarily from a decline in the discount rates used to measure plan liabilities, which has the effect of increasing pension expense, and the impact of a lower assumed rate of return on assets in the U.K., partly offset by lower amortization of actuarial losses, reflecting the fact that substantially all the participants in a U.K. plan which has been closed to new entrants for more than ten years are now inactive. 43 The Company’s accounting policies for its defined benefit pension plans, including the selection of and sensitivity to assumptions, are discussed below under Management’s Discussion of Critical Accounting Policies. For additional information regarding the Company’s retirement plans, see Note 8 to the consolidated financial statements.Financing Cash FlowsNet cash used for financing activities was $1.0 billion in 2011 compared with $1.1 billion of net cash used for financing activities in 2010. The Company reduced outstanding debt by approximately $100 million, $550 million and $10 million in 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively.DebtOn July 15, 2011, the Company purchased $600 million of outstanding notes comprised of $330 million of its 2014 Notes and $270 million of its 2015 Notes (collectively, the ""Notes""). The Company acquired the Notes at fair value plus a tender premium, which exceeded its carrying value. A charge of approximately $72 million was recorded in the Consolidated Statement of Income in the third quarter of 2011 related to the extinguishment of this debt.The Company used proceeds from the issuance of 4.80% ten-year $500 million senior notes in the third quarter of 2011 and cash on hand to purchase the Notes.During 2010, the Company’s 5.15% ten-year fixed rate $550 million senior notes matured. The Company used a portion of the cash received from the Kroll disposition to fund the maturity of those notes.AcquisitionsIn the second quarter of 2011, the Company acquired the remaining minority interest of a previously majority-owned entity for total cash consideration of $8 million.In the first quarter of 2011 and 2010, the Company paid deferred purchase consideration of $13 million and $15 million, respectively, related to the purchase in 2009 of the minority interest of a previously controlled entity.Credit FacilitiesOn October 13, 2011, the Company and certain of its subsidiaries entered into a new $1.0 billion multi-currency five-year unsecured revolving credit facility, which replaced the $1.0 billion facility discussed below. The interest rate on this facility is based on LIBOR plus a fixed margin which varies with the Company's credit ratings. This facility requires the Company to maintain certain coverage and leverage ratios which are tested quarterly. There were no borrowings under this facility at December 31, 2011.The Company and certain of its subsidiaries previously maintained a $1.0 billion multi-currency three-year unsecured revolving credit facility. This facility was due to expire in October 2012. The Company’s senior debt is currently rated Baa2 by Moody’s and BBB- by Standard & Poor’s. The Company’s short-term debt is currently rated P-2 by Moody’s and A-3 by Standard & Poor’s. The Company carries a stable outlook from Moody’s and Standard & Poor’s.The Company also maintains other credit facilities, guarantees and letters of credit with various banks, primarily related to operations located outside the United States, aggregating $248 million at December 31, 2011 and $272 million at December 31, 2010. There were no outstanding borrowings under these facilities.Share RepurchasesDuring 2011, the Company repurchased approximately 12.3 million shares of its common stock for total consideration of approximately $361 million at an average price per share of $29.44. During the third quarter of 2011 the Company received authorization to increase the share repurchase program to $1 billion from $500 million. The Company remains authorized to repurchase additional shares of its common stock up to a value of $553 million. There is no time limit on this authorization. 44 On September 15, 2010, the Company’s Board of Directors authorized a $500 million share repurchase program. During the fourth quarter of 2010, the Company repurchased 3.4 million of its common stock for total consideration of $85.5 million. DividendsThe Company paid total dividends of $480 million in 2011 ($0.86 per share), $452 million in 2010 ($0.81 per share) and $431 million in 2009 ($0.80 per share).Investing Cash FlowsNet cash used for investing activities amounted to $457 million in 2011 compared with $535 million of net cash provided by investing activities in 2010. The Company made 12 acquisitions in 2011. Cash used for these acquisitions, net of cash acquired, was $160 million compared with $427 million used for acquisitions in 2010. In addition, the Company recorded a liability of $33 million for estimated contingent purchase consideration related to the acquisitions completed in 2011. In 2011, the Company also paid $11 million for deferred purchase consideration, $62 million into escrow for future acquisitions and $4 million for the purchase of other intangible assets. In 2010, in addition to the cash paid, the Company issued approximately 7.6 million shares of common stock with an acquisition date value of $183 million, and also paid $60 million of deferred purchase consideration, $3 million for other intangible assets and $2 million of contingent purchase consideration related to acquisitions made in prior years. Remaining deferred cash payments of $201 million for acquisitions completed in 2011 and in prior years are recorded in accounts payable and accrued liabilities or other liabilities in the consolidated balance sheet at December 31, 2011.Cash provided by the sale of securities was $6 million and $32 million in 2011 and 2010, respectively.During 2010, the Company received $1.13 billion from its disposition of Kroll, which closed on August 3, 2010 and $110 million from the disposition of KLS which closed in the second quarter of 2010. The Company’s additions to fixed assets and capitalized software, which amounted to $280 million in 2011 and $271 million in 2010, primarily relate to computer equipment purchases, the refurbishing and modernizing of office facilities and software development costs. In 2010, the additions to fixed assets and capitalized software include $13 million related to Kroll, which is classified in discontinued operations.The Company has committed to potential future investments of approximately $80 million in connection with its investments in Trident II, and other funds managed by Stone Point Capital, LLC, and approximately $60 million in two private equity funds that invest primarily in financial services companies managed by companies unrelated to Stone Point Capital. The majority of the Company’s investment commitments for funds managed by Stone Point Capital, LLC are related to Trident II, the investment period for which is now closed for new investments. No significant future capital calls related to Trident II are expected.Commitments and ObligationsThe following sets forth the Company’s future contractual obligations by the types identified in the table below as of December 31, 2011: Payment due by PeriodContractual Obligations(In millions of dollars)Total Within1 Year 1-3Years 4-5Years After 5YearsCurrent portion of long-term debt$259 $259 $— $— $—Long-term debt2,673 — 590 501 1,582Interest on long-term debt1,245 167 300 230 548Net operating leases2,383 363 596 433 991Service agreements349 101 106 80 62Other long-term obligations201 77 123 1 —Total$7,110 $967 $1,715 $1,245 $3,183 45 The above does not include the liability for unrecognized tax benefits of $143 million as the Company is unable to reasonably predict the timing of settlement of these liabilities, other than approximately $12 million that may become payable during 2012. The above does not include the indemnified liabilities discussed in Note 16 as the Company is unable to reasonably predict the timing of settlement of these liabilities. The above does not include pension liabilities of approximately $1.5 billion because the timing and amount of ultimate payment of such liability is dependent upon future events, including, but not limited to, future returns on plan assets, and changes in the discount rate used to measure the liabilities. The amounts of estimated future benefits payments to be made from plan assets are disclosed in Note 8 to the consolidated financial statements. The Company expects to contribute approximately $124 million and $395 million in 2012 to its U.S. and non-U.S. pension plans, respectively.Management’s Discussion of Critical Accounting PoliciesThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (“GAAP”) requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue and expenses, and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. Management considers the policies discussed below to be critical to understanding the Company’s financial statements because their application places the most significant demands on management’s judgment, and requires management to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain. Actual results may differ from those estimates.Legal and Other Loss ContingenciesThe Company and its subsidiaries are subject to numerous claims, lawsuits and proceedings including claims for errors and omissions. GAAP requires that a liability be recorded when a loss is both probable and reasonably estimable. Significant management judgement is required to apply this guidance. The Company utilizes case level reviews by inside and outside counsel, an internal actuarial analysis and other analysis to estimate potential losses. The liability is reviewed quarterly and adjusted as developments warrant. In many cases, the Company has not recorded a liability, other than for legal fees to defend the claim, because we are unable, at the present time, to make a determination that a loss is both probable and reasonably estimable. Given the unpredictability of E&O claims and of litigation that could flow from them, it is possible that an adverse outcome in a particular matter could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s businesses, results of operations, financial condition or cash flow in a given quarterly or annual period.In addition, to the extent that insurance coverage is available, significant management judgment is required to determine the amount of recoveries that are probable of collection under the Company’s various insurance programs.Retirement BenefitsThe Company maintains qualified and non-qualified defined benefit pension and defined contribution plans for its eligible U.S. employees and a variety of defined benefit and defined contribution plans for its eligible non-U.S. employees. The Company’s policy for funding its tax qualified defined benefit retirement plans is to contribute amounts at least sufficient to meet the funding requirements set forth in U.S. and applicable foreign laws.The Company recognizes the funded status of its overfunded defined benefit pension and retiree medical plans as a net benefit plan asset and its unfunded and underfunded plans as a net benefit plan liability. The gains or losses and prior service costs or credits that have not been recognized as components of net periodic costs are recorded as a component of Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income (“AOCI”), net of tax, in the Company’s consolidated balance sheets. These gains and losses are amortized prospectively out of AOCI over a period that approximates the average remaining service period of active employees, or for plans in which substantially all the participants are inactive, over the remaining life expectancy of the inactive employees. The determination of net periodic pension cost is based on a number of actuarial assumptions, including an expected long-term rate of return on plan assets, the discount rate and assumed rate of salary increase. Significant assumptions used in the calculation of net periodic pension costs and pension liabilities are disclosed in Note 8 to the consolidated financial statements. The Company believes the assumptions for each plan are reasonable and appropriate and will continue to evaluate actuarial 46 assumptions at least annually and adjust them as appropriate. Based on its current assumptions, the Company expects pension expense in 2012 to increase approximately $30 million compared with 2011 before partly-offsetting impacts of bonuses and other incentive compensation and possible movements in foreign exchange rates.Future pension expense or credits will depend on plan provisions, future investment performance, future assumptions and various other factors related to the populations participating in the pension plans. Holding all other assumptions constant, a half-percentage point change in the rate of return on plan assets and discount rate assumptions would affect net periodic pension cost for the U.S. and U.K. plans, which together comprise approximately 87% of total pension plan liabilities, as follows: 0.5 PercentagePoint Increase 0.5 PercentagePoint Decrease(In millions of dollars)U.S. U.K. U.S. U.K.Assumed Rate of Return on Plan Assets$(18) $(31) $18 $31Discount Rate$(34) $(31) $35 $31Changing the discount rate and leaving the other assumptions constant may not be representative of the impact on expense, because the long-term rates of inflation and salary increases are often correlated with the discount rate. Changes in these assumptions will not necessarily have a linear impact on the net periodic pension cost.The Company contributes to certain health care and life insurance benefits provided to its retired employees. The cost of these postretirement benefits for employees in the U.S. is accrued during the period up to the date employees are eligible to retire, but is funded by the Company as incurred. The key assumptions and sensitivity to changes in the assumed health care cost trend rate are discussed in Note 8 to the consolidated financial statements.Income TaxesThe Company tax rate reflects its income, statutory tax rates and tax planning in the various jurisdictions in which it operates. Significant judgment is required in determining the annual tax rate and in evaluating uncertain tax positions. The Company reports a liability for unrecognized tax benefits resulting from uncertain tax positions taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. The evaluation of a tax position is a two-step process. The first step involves recognition. We determine whether it is more likely than not that a tax position will be sustained upon tax examination, including resolution of any related appeals or litigation, based on only the technical merits of the position. The technical merits of a tax position derive from both statutory and judicial authority (legislation and statutes, legislative intent, regulations, rulings, and case law) and their applicability to the facts and circumstances of the tax position. If a tax position does not meet the more likely than not recognition threshold, the benefit of that position is not recognized in the financial statements. The second step is measurement. A tax position that meets the more likely than not recognition threshold is measured to determine the amount of benefit to recognize in the financial statements. The tax position is measured as the largest amount of benefit that is greater than 50 percent likely of being realized upon ultimate resolution with a taxing authority.Uncertain tax positions are evaluated based upon the facts and circumstances that exist at each reporting period and involve significant management judgment. Subsequent changes in judgment based upon new information may lead to changes in recognition, derecognition, and measurement. Adjustments may result, for example, upon resolution of an issue with the taxing authorities, or expiration of a statute of limitations barring an assessment for an issue.Tax law requires items be included in the Company's tax returns at different times than the items are reflected in the financial statements. As a result, the annual tax expense reflected in the consolidated statements of income is different than that reported in the tax returns. Some of these differences are permanent, such as expenses that are not deductible in the returns, and some differences are temporary and reverse over time, such as depreciation expense. Temporary differences create deferred tax assets and liabilities. Deferred tax liabilities generally represent tax expense recognized in the financial statements for which payment has been deferred, or expense for which a deduction has been taken 47 already in the tax return but the expense has not yet been recognized in the financial statements. Deferred tax assets generally represent items that can be used as a tax deduction or credit in tax returns in future years for which a benefit has already been recorded in the financial statements. In assessing the need for and amount of a valuation allowance for deferred tax assets, the Company considers whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized and adjusts the valuation allowance accordingly. The Company evaluates all significant available positive and negative evidence, including the existence of losses in recent years and its forecast of future taxable income by jurisdiction, in assessing the need for a valuation allowance. The Company also considers tax-planning strategies that would result in realization of deferred tax assets, and the presence of taxable income in prior carryback years if carryback is permitted under the appropriate tax law. The underlying assumptions the Company uses in forecasting future taxable income require significant judgment and take into account the Company's recent performance. The ultimate realization of deferred tax assets is dependent on the generation of future taxable income during the periods in which temporary differences or carryforwards are deductible or creditable. Valuation allowances are established for deferred tax assets when it is estimated that it is more likely than not that future taxable income will be insufficient to fully use a deduction or credit in that jurisdiction.Fair Value DeterminationsInvestment Valuation—The Company holds investments in private companies as well as certain private equity funds. Certain investments, primarily investments in private equity funds, are accounted for using the equity method. Although not directly recorded in the Company’s consolidated balance sheets, the Company defined benefit pension plans hold investments of approximately $10.7 billion. The fair value of these investments determines, in part, the over-or under-funded status of those plans, which is included in the Company’s consolidated balance sheets. The Company periodically reviews the carrying value of its investments to determine if any valuation adjustments are appropriate under the applicable accounting pronouncements. The Company bases its review on the facts and circumstances as they relate to each investment. Fair value of investments in private equity funds is determined by the funds’ investment managers. Factors considered in determining the fair value of private equity investments include: implied valuation of recently completed financing rounds that included sophisticated outside investors; performance multiples of comparable public companies; restrictions on the sale or disposal of the investments; trading characteristics of the securities; and the relative size of the holdings in comparison to other private investors and the public market float. In those instances where quoted market prices are not available, particularly for equity holdings in private companies, or formal restrictions limit the sale of securities, significant management judgment is required to determine the appropriate value of the Company’s investments. The Company reviews with the fund manager the appropriateness of valuation results for significant private equity investments.Goodwill Impairment Testing—The Company is required to assess goodwill and any indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment annually, or more frequently if circumstances indicate impairment may have occurred. The Company performs the annual goodwill impairment test for each of its reporting units during the third quarter of each year. The Company adopted new accounting guidance in the third quarter of 2011. Under this guidance, a company may first assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is necessary to perform the goodwill impairment test. If, as a result of this qualitative assessment, a company determines the fair value of a reporting unit is more likely than not lower than its carrying value, a step 1 impairment assessment must be performed. The Company considered the totality of numerous factors, which included that the fair value of each reporting unit exceeded its carrying value by a substantial margin in its most recent estimate of reporting unit fair values, whether significant acquisitions or dispositions occurred which might alter the fair values of its reporting units, macroeconomic conditions and their potential impact on reporting unit fair values, actual performance compared with budget and prior projections used in its estimation of reporting unit fair values, industry and market conditions, and the year over year change in the Company's share price.Based on its qualitative evaluation, the Company concluded that a two-step goodwill impairment test was not required.Share-based PaymentThe guidance for accounting for share-based payments requires, among other things, that the estimated 48 fair value of stock options be charged to earnings. Significant management judgment is required to determine the appropriate assumptions for inputs such as volatility and expected term necessary to estimate option values. In addition, management judgment is required to analyze the terms of the plans and awards granted thereunder to determine if awards will be treated as equity awards or liability awards, as defined by the accounting guidance.As of December 31, 2011, there was $21.0 million of unrecognized compensation cost related to stock option awards. The weighted-average periods over which the costs are expected to be recognized is 1.6 years. Also as of December 31, 2011, there was $191 million of unrecognized compensation cost related to the Company’s restricted stock, restricted stock unit and deferred stock unit awards.See Note 9 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding accounting for share-based payments.New Accounting PronouncementsNote 1 contains a summary of the Company’s significant accounting policies, including a discussion of recently issued accounting pronouncements and their impact or potential future impact on the Company’s financial results, if determinable. 49 Item 7A. Qualitative and Quantitative Disclosures About Market RiskMarket Risk and Credit RiskCertain of the Company’s revenues, expenses, assets and liabilities are exposed to the impact of interest rate changes and fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates and equity markets.Interest Rate Risk and Credit RiskThe Company has historically managed its net exposure to interest rate changes by utilizing a mixture of variable and fixed rate borrowings to finance the Company’s asset base. In February 2011, the Company entered into two 3.5-year interest rate swaps to hedge changes in the fair value of the first $250 million of its 5.375% senior notes due in 2014. Under the terms of the swaps, the counter-parties will pay the Company a fixed rate of 5.375% and the Company will pay interest at a floating rate of three-month LIBOR plus a fixed spread of 3.726%. The swaps are designated as fair value hedging instruments and are deemed to be perfectly effective in accordance with applicable accounting guidance.Interest income generated from the Company’s cash investments as well as invested fiduciary funds will vary with the general level of interest rates.The Company had the following investments subject to variable interest rates: (In millions of dollars)December 31, 2011Cash and cash equivalents invested in money market funds, certificates of deposit and time deposits$2,113Fiduciary cash and investments$4,082Based on the above balances, if short-term interest rates increased or decreased by 10%, or 12 basis points, over the course of the year, annual interest income, including interest earned on fiduciary funds, would increase or decrease by approximately $5 million.In addition to interest rate risk, our cash investments and fiduciary fund investments are subject to potential loss of value due to counterparty credit risk. To minimize this risk, the Company and its subsidiaries invest pursuant to a Board approved investment policy. The policy mandates the preservation of principal and liquidity and requires broad diversification with counterparty limits assigned based primarily on credit rating and type of investment. The Company carefully monitors its cash and fiduciary fund investments and will further restrict the portfolio as appropriate to market conditions. The majority of cash and fiduciary fund investments are invested in short-term bank deposits and liquid money market funds.Foreign Currency RiskThe translated values of revenue and expense from the Company’s international operations are subject to fluctuations due to changes in currency exchange rates. The non-U.S. based revenue that is exposed to foreign exchange fluctuations is approximately 55% of total revenue. We periodically use forward contracts and options to limit foreign currency exchange rate exposure on net income and cash flows for specific, clearly defined transactions arising in the ordinary course of business. Although the Company has significant revenue generated in foreign locations which is subject to foreign exchange rate fluctuations, in most cases both the foreign currency revenue and expenses are in the functional currency of the foreign location. As such, the U.S. dollar translation of both the revenues and expenses, as well as the potentially offsetting movements of various currencies against the U.S. dollar, generally tends to mitigate the impact on net operating income of foreign currency risk. The Company estimates that a 10% movement of major foreign currencies (Euro, Sterling, Australian dollar and Canadian dollar) in the same direction against the U.S. dollar that held constant over the course of the year would increase or decrease full year net operating income by approximately $50 million. 50 Equity Price RiskThe Company holds investments in both public and private companies, certain private equity funds managed by Stone Point Capital, as well as two private equity funds managed by companies unrelated to Stone Point Capital that invests primarily in financial services companies. Publicly traded investments of $20 million are classified as available for sale. Non-publicly traded investments of $37 million are accounted for using the cost method and $119 million are accounted for using the equity method. The investments that are classified as available for sale or that are not publicly traded are subject to risk of changes in market value, which if determined to be other than temporary, could result in realized impairment losses. The Company periodically reviews the carrying value of such investments to determine if any valuation adjustments are appropriate under the applicable accounting pronouncements.OtherA number of lawsuits and regulatory proceedings are pending.

It is the parent company of a number of the world’s leading risk experts and specialty consultants, including: Marsh, the insurance broker, intermediary and risk advisor; Guy Carpenter, the risk and reinsurance specialist; Mercer, the provider of HR and related financial advice and services; and Oliver Wyman Group, the management, economic and brand consultancy. With approximately 54,000 employees worldwide and annual revenue of nearly $12 billion, the Company provides analysis, advice and transactional capabilities to clients in more than 100 countries.The Company conducts business through two segments:•Risk and Insurance Services includes risk management activities (risk advice, risk transfer and risk control and mitigation solutions) as well as insurance and reinsurance broking and services. We conduct business in this segment through Marsh and Guy Carpenter.•Consulting includes Retirement, Health, Talent and Investments consulting and services, and specialized management and economic consulting services. We conduct business in this segment through Mercer and Oliver Wyman Group.The Company completed the sale of Kroll in August 2010, and along with other dispositions between 2008 and 2010, has divested its entire Risk Consulting and Technology Segment. The Company has “continuing involvement” in certain Corporate Advisory and Restructuring businesses (“CARG”) that were disposed of in 2008. The runoff of the CARG businesses is being managed by the Company's corporate departments and financial results of these entities are included in “Corporate” for segment reporting purposes.We describe the primary sources of revenue and categories of expense for each segment below, in our discussion of segment financial results. A reconciliation of segment operating income to total operating income is included in Note 16 to the consolidated financial statements included in Part II Item 8 in this report. The accounting policies used for each segment are the same as those used for the consolidated financial statements.This Management's Discussion & Analysis (""MD&A"") contains forward-looking statements as that term is defined in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.

Revenue in 2012 increased 3% compared to 2011, or 4% on an underlying basis, with growth in each operating company, while expenses increased 2%, or 3% on an underlying basis. This reflects the Company's improved operating efficiency as it continues to monitor and control its expenses in each of its operations. Risk and Insurance Services operating income increased $145 million or 12% to $1.4 billion in 2012 compared with 2011, resulting from revenue growth at both Marsh and Guy Carpenter.Consulting operating income increased $64 million or 11% to $652 million in 2012 compared with 2011 primarily due to increased revenue at Mercer and improved operating efficiency.Consolidated operating income was $1.6 billion in 2011 compared with $939 million in 2010. The 2010 results include a $400 million charge, net of insurance recoveries, for the resolution of the litigation brought by the Alaska Retirement Management Board (""ARMB"") and restructuring and other noteworthy items of $139 million. Excluding these charges, consolidated operating income was $1.5 billion in 2010.Risk and Insurance Services operating income increased $257 million or 26% to $1.2 billion in 2011 compared with 2010, resulting from revenue growth at both Marsh and Guy Carpenter, continued expense discipline and a decrease of $132 million in restructuring and other noteworthy items.Consulting operating income increased $459 million to $588 million in 2011 primarily due to the $400 million net charge related to the ARMB litigation settlement in 2010. Excluding that item, Consulting operating income increased $59 million, or 11%.Discontinued operations in 2011 includes a net credit resulting from the resolution of certain legal matters and related insurance recoveries as well as the settlement of certain tax audits and the expiration of the statute of limitations related to certain indemnified matters in connection with the disposals of Putnam and Kroll. These credits are partly offset by the write-off, net of tax, of capitalized software related to the disposal of the Marsh Business Processing Outsourcing (""BPO"") business. Discontinued operations in 2010 includes the operating results of Kroll, gains on the sales of Kroll and Kroll Laboratory Specialists 26 (""KLS"") totaling $282 million, and insurance recoveries of $16 million related to Putnam market-timing related matters. Discontinued operations also includes the accretion of interest related to an indemnity for uncertain tax positions provided as part of the purchase by Great-West Life Co. Inc., of Putnam Investments Trust from the Company in August 2007.Consolidated net income attributable to the Company was $1.2 billion in 2012, compared with $993 million in 2011 and $855 million in 2010.Consolidated Revenue and ExpenseThe Company conducts business in many countries, as a result of which the impact of foreign exchange rate movements may impact period-to-period comparisons of revenue. Similarly, the revenue impact of acquisitions and dispositions may impact period-to-period comparisons of revenue. Underlying revenue measures the change in revenue from one period to another by isolating these impacts. The impact of foreign currency exchange fluctuations, acquisitions and dispositions including transfers among businesses, on the Company’s operating revenues is as follows: Year EndedDecember 31, Components of Revenue Change*(In millions, except percentage figures)2012 2011 % Change GAAPRevenue CurrencyImpact Acquisitions/DispositionsImpact UnderlyingRevenueRisk and Insurance Services Marsh$5,463 $5,213 5 % (2)% 2 % 5%Guy Carpenter1,079 1,041 4 %—(1)%—(1)%—6%Subtotal6,542 6,254 5 %—(2)%—2 %—5%Fiduciary Interest Income39 47 Total Risk and Insurance Services6,581 6,301 4 %—(2)%—2 %—5%Consulting Mercer3,916 3,782 4 %—(2)%—1 %—4%Oliver Wyman Group1,466 1,483 (1)%—(2)%—(2)%—3%Total Consulting5,382 5,265 2 %—(2)%—— %—4%Corporate/Eliminations(39) (40) Total Revenue$11,924 $11,526 3 %—(2)%—1 %—4%*Components of revenue change may not add due to rounding. 27 The following table provides more detailed revenue information for certain of the components presented above: Year EndedDecember 31, Components of Revenue Change*(In millions, except percentage figures)2012 2011 % Change GAAPRevenue CurrencyImpact Acquisitions/DispositionsImpact UnderlyingRevenueMarsh: EMEA$1,860 $1,796 4 % (5)%—3 %—5%Asia Pacific656 612 7 % (1)%—— %—7%Latin America353 334 6 % (7)%—— %—13%Total International2,869 2,742 5 % (4)%—2 %—6%U.S. / Canada2,594 2,471 5 % — %—2 %—3%Total Marsh$5,463 $5,213 5 % (2)%—2 %—5%Mercer: Retirement$1,066 $1,071 — % (2)%—1 %—1%Health and Benefits1,011 940 8 % (2)%—2 %—7%Talent, Rewards & Communications604 576 5 % (2)%—5 %—1%Outsourcing721 733 (2)% — %—(5)%—4%Investments514 462 11 % (1)%—4 %—8%Total Mercer$3,916 $3,782 4 % (2)%—1 %—4%Underlying revenue measures the change in revenue using consistent currency exchange rates, excluding the impact of certain items such as: acquisitions, dispositions and transfers among businesses.*Components of revenue change may not add due to rounding. 28 Year EndedDecember 31, Components of Revenue Change*(In millions, except percentage figures)2011 2010 % Change GAAPRevenue CurrencyImpact Acquisitions/DispositionsImpact UnderlyingRevenueRisk and Insurance Services Marsh$5,213 $4,744 10% 2%—4%—4%Guy Carpenter1,041 975 7% 1%—1%—5%Subtotal6,254 5,719 9% 2%—3%—5%Fiduciary Interest Income47 45 Total Risk and Insurance Services6,301 5,764 9% 2%—3%—5%Consulting Mercer3,782 3,478 9% 3%—2%—4%Oliver Wyman Group1,483 1,357 9% 2%———7%Total Consulting5,265 4,835 9% 3%—1%—5%Corporate /Eliminations(40) (49) Total Revenue$11,526 $10,550 9% 2%—2%—5%The following table provides more detailed revenue information for certain of the components presented above: Year EndedDecember 31, Components of Revenue Change*(In millions, except percentage figures) 2011 2010 % Change GAAPRevenue CurrencyImpact Acquisitions/DispositionsImpact UnderlyingRevenueMarsh: EMEA $1,796 $1,674 7% 2 %—2 %—4 %Asia Pacific 612 503 22% 8 %—4 %—9 %Latin America 334 298 12% (1)%———14 %Total International 2,742 2,475 11% 3 %—2 %—6 %U.S. / Canada 2,471 2,269 9% ——6 %—3 %Total Marsh $5,213 $4,744 10% 2 %—4 %—4 %Mercer: Retirement $1,071 $1,053 2% 3 %———(1)%Health and Benefits 940 900 4% 2 %—(3)%—6 %Talent, Rewards & Communications 576 488 18% 3 %—5 %—11 %Outsourcing 733 671 9% 5 %—5 %——Investments 462 366 26% 6 %—9 %—11 %Total Mercer $3,782 $3,478 9% 3 %—2 %—4 %Underlying revenue measures the change in revenue using consistent currency exchange rates, excluding the impact of certain items such as: acquisitions, dispositions and transfers among businesses.*Components of revenue change may not add due to rounding. 29 RevenueConsolidated revenue for 2012 increased 3% to $11.9 billion compared with $11.5 billion in 2011, reflecting a 4% increase in underlying revenue, a 1% increase due to acquisitions and a 2% negative impact of foreign currency translation. Revenue in the Risk and Insurance Services segment increased 4% in 2012 compared with 2011 or 5% on an underlying basis, reflecting increases of 5% in Marsh and 6% in Guy Carpenter. Consulting segment revenue increased 2%, resulting from a 4% increase in Mercer partly offset by a 1% decrease in the Oliver Wyman Group. On an underlying basis, Consulting segment revenue increased 4%, reflecting a 4% increase in Mercer and a 3% increase in the Oliver Wyman Group.Consolidated revenue for 2011 increased 9% to $11.5 billion compared with $10.6 billion in 2010, reflecting a 5% increase in underlying revenue, a 2% increase due to acquisitions and a 2% positive impact of foreign currency translation. Revenue in the Risk and Insurance Services segment increased 9% in 2011 compared with 2010 or 5% on an underlying basis, reflecting increases of 4% in Marsh and 5% in Guy Carpenter. Consulting segment revenue increased 9%, resulting from 9% increases in both Mercer and the Oliver Wyman Group. On an underlying basis, revenue increased 5%, reflecting a 4% increase in Mercer and a 7% increase in the Oliver Wyman Group.Operating ExpenseConsolidated operating expenses increased 2% in 2012 compared with the same period in 2011. The increase reflects a 3% increase in underlying expenses, a 1% increase due to the impact of acquisitions, offset by a 2% decrease due to the impact of foreign currency exchange translation. The increase in underlying expenses primarily reflects higher incentive compensation and benefits costs and restructuring costs at Mercer, which include exit costs related to a portion of Mercer's Canadian outsourcing business. These increases are partly offset by credits related to the adjustment of acquisition related contingent consideration liabilities.Consolidated operating expenses increased 3% in 2011 compared with the same period in 2010. Expenses in 2010 include the $400 million ARMB settlement at Mercer. Restructuring and other noteworthy charges, which include legal fees arising from regulatory actions, net of insurance recoveries and credits related to the CARG business divested in 2008, decreased $116 million to $23 million in 2011 as compared to $139 million in 2010. Excluding these charges, expenses were $9.9 billion in 2011 compared with $9.1 billion in 2010, an increase of 9%. The increase reflects a 3% increase due to the impact of foreign currency exchange, a 2% increase due to the impact of acquisitions and a 4% increase in underlying expenses. The increase in underlying expenses primarily reflects higher compensation and benefits costs, including increased pension costs, higher consulting costs, asset-based fees and expenses reimbursable from clients.RestructuringIn 2012, the Company implemented restructuring actions which resulted in costs totaling $78 million. Approximately $58 million of the restructuring charges related to Mercer, with approximately $51 million in expenses recorded in the fourth quarter of 2012 relating to senior management's operations review, including costs of approximately $16 million related to the disposal of a portion of Mercer's Canadian outsourcing business. The restructuring costs consist primarily of severance and benefits, costs for future rent and other real estate costs. These costs were incurred as follows: Risk and Insurance Services—$8 million (all acquisition related—$ 8 million); Consulting—$58 million (acquisition related—$1 million); and Corporate—$12 million. Businesses ExitedMarsh's BPO business, previously part of the Marsh U.S. Consumer business, provided policy, claims, call center and accounting operations on an outsourced basis to life insurance carriers. Marsh invested in a technology platform that was designed to make the BPO business scalable and more efficient. During 2011, Marsh decided that it would cease investing in the technology platform and instead exit the business via a sale. In the fourth quarter of 2011, management initiated a plan to sell the Marsh BPO business, which was completed in August 2012. The Company wrote off capitalized software of the BPO business of $17 million, net of tax, which is included in discontinued operations in 2011. 30 In February 2010, Kroll sold KLS, its substance abuse testing business for $110 million. On August 3, 2010, the Company completed the sale of Kroll to Altegrity for $1.13 billion. The account balances and activities of Kroll and KLS have been segregated and reported as discontinued operations in the accompanying financial statements for 2010. The gain on the sale of Kroll and related tax benefits and the after- tax loss on the disposal of KLS, along with Kroll’s and KLS’s 2010 results of operations are included in discontinued operations.Risk and Insurance ServicesIn the Risk and Insurance Services segment, the Company’s subsidiaries and other affiliated entities act as brokers, agents or consultants for insureds, insurance underwriters and other brokers in the areas of risk management, insurance broking and insurance program management services, primarily under the name of Marsh; and engage in reinsurance broking, catastrophe and financial modeling services and related advisory functions, primarily under the name of Guy Carpenter.Marsh and Guy Carpenter are compensated for brokerage and consulting services primarily through fees paid by clients and/or commissions paid out of premiums charged by insurance and reinsurance companies. Commission rates vary in amount depending upon the type of insurance or reinsurance coverage provided, the particular insurer or reinsurer, the capacity in which the broker acts and negotiations with clients. Revenues can be affected by premium rate levels in the insurance/reinsurance markets, the amount of risk retained by insurance and reinsurance clients themselves and by the value of the risks that have been insured since commission based compensation is frequently related to the premiums paid by insureds/reinsureds. In many cases, fee compensation may be negotiated in advance, based on the type of risk, coverage required, and service provided by the Company and ultimately placed into the insurance market or retained by the client. The trends and comparisons of revenue from one period to the next can be affected by changes in premium rate levels, fluctuations in client risk retention, and increases or decreases in the value of risks that have been insured, as well as new and lost business, and the volume of business from new and existing clients. In certain countries, Marsh and Guy Carpenter receive interest income on certain funds (such as premiums and claims proceeds) held in a fiduciary capacity for others. The investment of fiduciary funds is regulated by state and other insurance authorities. These regulations typically provide for segregation of fiduciary funds and limit the types of investments that may be made with them. Interest income from these investments varies depending on the amount of funds invested and applicable interest rates, both of which vary from time to time. For presentation purposes, fiduciary interest is segregated from the other revenues of Marsh and Guy Carpenter and separately presented within the segment, as shown in the revenue by segments charts earlier in this MD&A. In certain countries, Marsh is compensated for insurer consulting services in the form of a fee or as a percentage of premium (or a combination of both).The results of operations for the Risk and Insurance Services segment are presented below: (In millions of dollars)2012 2011 2010Revenue$6,581 $6,301 $5,764Compensation and Benefits3,579 3,482 3,261Other Operating Expenses1,628 1,590 1,531Operating Expenses5,207 5,072 4,792Operating Income$1,374 $1,229 $972Operating Income Margin20.9% 19.5% 16.9%RevenueRevenue in Risk and Insurance Services increased 4% in 2012 compared with 2011 reflecting a 5% increase on an underlying basis, a 2% increase from acquisitions, partly offset by a 2% decrease from the impact of foreign currency exchange translation.In Marsh, revenue in 2012 was $5.5 billion, an increase of 5% from the prior year, reflecting 5% growth in underlying revenue, a 2% increase from acquisitions partly offset by a 2% decrease resulting from the impact of foreign currency translation. The underlying revenue increase of 5% reflects growth in all major 31 geographies, driven by new business. Underlying revenue increased 13% in Latin America, 7% in Asia Pacific, 3% in U.S. / Canada and 5% in EMEA.During 2012, Marsh completed the following twelve acquisitions: •January - Marsh acquired Alexander Forbes' South African brokerage operations, including Alexander Forbes Risk Services and related ancillary operations and insurance broking operations in Botswana and Namibia to expand Marsh's presence in Africa. Marsh subsequently closed the acquisitions of the Alexander Forbes operations in Uganda, Malawi and Zambia.•March - Marsh & McLennan Agency (""MMA"") acquired KSPH, LLC, a middle-market employee benefits agency based in Virginia, and Marsh acquired Cosmos Services (America) Inc., the U.S. insurance brokerage subsidiary of ITOCHU Corp., which specializes in commercial property/casualty, personal lines, and employee benefits brokerage services to U.S. subsidiaries of Japanese companies. •June - MMA acquired Progressive Benefits Solutions, an employee benefits agency based in North Carolina, and Security Insurance Services, Inc., a Wisconsin-based insurance agency which offers property/casualty and employee benefits products and services to individuals and businesses. •August - MMA acquired Rosenfeld-Einstein, a South Carolina-based employee benefits service provider, and Eidson Insurance, a property/casualty and employee benefits services firm located in Florida. •October - MMA acquired Howalt+McDowell, a South Dakota-based agency which offers property casualty, surety, personal protection and employee benefits insurance to individuals and businesses, and The Protector Group Insurance Agency, a Massachusetts-based agency which provides property casualty, employee benefits services, personal insurance and individual financial services. •November - MMA acquired Brower Insurance, an Ohio-based company providing employee benefits, property casualty and consulting services.•December - MMA acquired McGraw Wentworth, a Michigan-based company providing consulting services to mid-sized organizations, and Liscomb Hood Mason, a Minnesota-based company providing property casualty and employee benefits products and services.The MMA acquisitions were made to expand Marsh's presence in the U.S. middle-market business.In January 2011, Marsh acquired RJF Agencies, an independent insurance agency in the upper Midwest. In February 2011, Marsh acquired Hampton Roads Bonding, a surety bonding agency for commercial, road, utility, maritime and government contractors in the state of Virginia, and the Boston office of Kinloch Consulting Group, Inc. In July 2011, Marsh acquired Prescott Pailet Benefits, an employee benefits broker based in Texas. In October 2011, Marsh acquired the employee benefits division of Kaeding, Ernst & Co, a Massachusetts based employee benefits, life insurance and financial planning consulting firm. In November 2011, Marsh acquired Seitlin Insurance, a property and casualty insurance and employee benefits firm located in South Florida.Guy Carpenter’s revenue increased 4% to $1.1 billion in 2012 compared with 2011, or 6% on an underlying basis driven by Carpenter's International operations, particularly Global Specialties, Asia Pacific, EMEA, Latin America, and Global Facultative. Fiduciary interest income was $39 million in 2012 compared to $47 million in 2011 due to slightly lower average invested funds combined with lower interest rates.Revenue in Risk and Insurance Services increased 9% in 2011 compared with 2010 reflecting a 5% increase on an underlying basis, a 3% increase from acquisitions, and a 2% increase from the impact of foreign currency exchange translation.In Marsh, revenue in 2011 was $5.2 billion, an increase of 10% from the prior year, reflecting 4% growth in underlying revenue, a 4% increase from acquisitions and a 2% increase resulting from the impact of foreign currency translation. The underlying revenue increase of 4% reflected growth in all major 32 geographies, driven by higher retention rates and new business development. Underlying revenue increased 14% in Latin America, 9% in Asia Pacific, 3% in U.S. / Canada and 4% in EMEA.Guy Carpenter’s revenue increased 7% to $1.0 billion in 2011 compared with 2010, or 5% on an underlying basis. The increase in underlying revenue was driven by strong new business development and high retention rates. Fiduciary interest income was $47 million in 2011 compared to $45 million in 2010 due to higher average invested funds partly offset by lower interest rates.ExpenseExpenses in the Risk and Insurance Services segment increased 3% in 2012 compared with 2011, reflecting a 2% increase from acquisitions and a 2% decrease due to the impact of foreign currency translation. Expenses on an underlying basis increased 3% primarily due to higher base salaries and incentive compensation and benefits costs partly offset by credits related to adjustments to acquisition related contingent consideration liabilities.Expenses in the Risk and Insurance Services segment increased 6% in 2011 compared with 2010, reflecting a 3% increase from acquisitions and a 2% increase due to the impact of foreign currency translation. Expenses on an underlying basis increased 1%. The increase in underlying expenses is primarily due to higher base salaries and incentive compensation costs, non-restructuring related severance costs and facilities and equipment costs, partly offset by lower restructuring expenses and a credit of $31 million for insurance recoveries on previously expensed legal fees.ConsultingThe Company conducts business in its Consulting segment through two main business groups. Mercer provides consulting expertise, advice, services and solutions in the areas of talent, health, retirement and investments. Oliver Wyman Group provides specialized management, economic and brand consulting services.The major component of revenue in the Consulting segment business is fees paid by clients for advice and services. Mercer, principally through its health & benefits line of business, also earns revenue in the form of commissions received from insurance companies for the placement of group (and occasionally individual) insurance contracts, primarily life, health and accident coverages. Revenue for Mercer’s investment management business and certain of Mercer’s outsourcing businesses consists principally of fees based on assets under management or administration.Revenue in the Consulting segment is affected by, among other things, global economic conditions, including changes in clients’ particular industries and markets. Revenue is also affected by competition due to the introduction of new products and services, broad trends in employee demographics, including levels of employment, the effect of government policies and regulations, and fluctuations in interest and foreign exchange rates. Revenues from the provision of investment management services and retirement trust and administrative services are significantly affected by securities market performance.The results of operations for the Consulting segment are presented below: (In millions of dollars)2012 2011 2010Revenue$5,382 $5,265 $4,835Compensation and Benefits3,221 3,233 2,974Other Operating Expenses1,509 1,444 1,732Operating Expenses4,730 4,677 4,706Operating Income$652 $588 $129Operating Income Margin12.1% 11.2% 2.7%RevenueConsulting revenue in 2012 increased 2% compared with 2011, or 4% on an underlying basis. Mercer’s revenue was $3.9 billion in 2012, an increase of 4% on both a reported and underlying basis as 33 compared to 2011, with growth in each of its businesses. The underlying revenue growth was primarily driven by a 7% increase in health and benefits and an 8% increase in investments. Oliver Wyman’s revenue decreased 1% in 2012 compared to 2011, but increased 3% on an underlying basis. During 2012, Mercer completed the following three acquisitions: •February - Mercer acquired the remaining 49% of Yokogawa-ORC, a global mobility firm based in Japan, which was previously accounted for under the equity method, and Pensjon & Finans, a leading Norway-based financial investment and pension consulting firm. •March - Mercer acquired REPCA, a France-based broking and advisory firm for employer health and benefits plans. Consulting revenue in 2011 increased 9% compared with 2010, or 5% on an underlying basis. Mercer’s revenue was $3.8 billion in 2011, an increase of 9% or 4% on an underlying basis. Within Mercer’s consulting lines, revenue on an underlying basis increased 4% in 2011 compared with 2010, reflecting increases of 6% in health and benefits and 11% in talent, rewards & communications, partly offset by a 1% decline in retirement. Outsourcing revenue grew 9% and was flat on an underlying basis. Investments revenue increased 26% or 11% on an underlying basis. Oliver Wyman’s revenue increased 9% to $1.5 billion in 2011, or 7% on an underlying basis. ExpenseConsulting expenses in 2012 increased 1%, or 3% on an underlying basis. This increase reflects the impact of higher benefits and restructuring costs, including charges of $16 million for the exit activities related to a portion of Mercer's Canadian outsourcing business.Consulting expenses in 2011 decreased 1% to $4.7 billion, or 4% on an underlying basis. Mercer recorded a $400 million net charge related to the ARMB settlement in 2010. Excluding this charge, expenses increased 4% on an underlying basis. This increase reflected the impact of higher base-salaries and incentive compensation and benefits costs, including higher pension costs, and higher asset-based fees and recoverable expenses from clients. Corporate and OtherThe following results of Corporate and Other includes the run-off of CARG operations:(In millions of dollars)2012 2011 2010Corporate Advisory and Restructuring Operating Income$6 $9 $10Corporate Expense(203) (188) (172)Total Corporate and Other$(197) $(179) $(162)Corporate expenses in 2012 were $203 million compared to $188 million in 2011. The increase is primarily due to accelerated amortization of equity awards for retirement eligible senior executives and higher consulting costs associated with corporate initiatives. Corporate expenses in 2011 were $188 million compared to $172 million in 2010. The increase in Corporate expense reflects higher compensation and pension costs primarily due to executive positions added in corporate and higher outside services costs related to corporate initiatives, such as branding. The CARG amounts reflect payments received related to the CARG businesses divested in 2008.Discontinued OperationsAs part of the disposal transactions for Putnam and Kroll, the Company provided certain indemnities, primarily related to pre-transaction tax uncertainties and legal contingencies. In accordance with applicable accounting guidance, liabilities were established related to these indemnities at the time of the sales and reflected as a reduction of the gain on disposal. Discontinued operations includes charges or credits resulting from the settlement or resolution of the indemnified matters, as well as adjustments to the 34 liabilities related to such matters. Discontinued operations in 2011 includes credits of $50 million from the resolution of certain legal matters and insurance recoveries, as well as the settlement of tax audits and the expiration of the statutes of limitations related to certain of the indemnified matters, primarily with respect to Putnam.Marsh's BPO business, previously part of Marsh U.S. Consumer business, provided policy, claims, call center and accounting operations on an outsourced basis to life insurance carriers. Marsh invested in a technology platform that was designed to make the BPO business scalable and more efficient. During 2011, Marsh decided that it would cease investing in the technology platform and instead exit the business via a sale. In the fourth quarter of 2011, management initiated a plan to sell the Marsh BPO business which was completed in August 2012. The Company wrote off capitalized software of the BPO business of $17 million, net of tax, which is included in discontinued operations in 2011. In the first quarter of 2010, Kroll completed the sale of KLS and on August 3, 2010, the Company completed the sale of Kroll to Altegrity.Kroll’s results of operations are reported as discontinued operations in the Company’s consolidated statement of income for the portion of 2010 prior to Kroll's disposal. The year ended 2010 also includes the gain on the sale of Kroll and related tax benefits and the loss on the sale of KLS, which includes the tax provision of $36 million on the sale. The Company’s tax basis in its investment in the stock of Kroll at the time of sale exceeded the recorded amount primarily as a result of prior impairments of goodwill recognized for financial reporting, but not tax. A $265 million deferred tax benefit was recorded in discontinued operations in 2010 as a result of the sale of Kroll.Summarized Statements of Income data for discontinued operations is as follows: For the Years Ended December 31,(In millions of dollars, except per share figures)2012 2011 2010Kroll Operations Revenue$— $— $381Operating expenses — — 345Operating income— — 36Income tax expense— — 16Income from Kroll operations, net of tax— — 20Other discontinued operations, net of tax— (17) (7)Income (loss) from discontinued operations, net of tax— (17) 13Disposals of discontinued operations (a)(2) 25 58Income tax expense (credit) (b)1 (25) (235)Disposals of discontinued operations, net of tax(3) 50 293Discontinued operations, net of tax$(3) $33 $306Discontinued operations, net of tax per share —Basic$— $0.06 $0.55—Diluted$— $0.06 $0.55(a)Includes gain on sale of Kroll and the gain on the sale of KLS in 2010.(b)The income tax credit related to the disposal of discontinued operations for 2010 primarily represents the recognition of tax benefits related to the sale of Kroll, partly offset by a tax provision of $36 million related to the sale of KLS. 35 Other Corporate ItemsInterestInterest income earned on corporate funds amounted to $24 million in 2012 compared with $28 million in 2011. The decrease in interest income is due to lower average interest rates compared with the prior year. Interest expense was $181 million in 2012 compared with $199 million in 2011. The decrease is primarily due to lower interest rates on senior notes issued during the second half of 2011 and the first quarter of 2012, compared to the interest rate on notes that matured.Interest income earned on corporate funds was $28 million in 2011 compared with $20 million in 2010. The increase in interest income was due to the combined effect of higher average invested funds in 2011 and slightly higher average interest rates compared with the prior year. Interest expense was $199 million in 2011 compared with $233 million in 2010. The decrease was primarily due to the maturity of senior notes in the third quarter of 2010, the early extinguishment of a portion of the Company's outstanding notes during the third quarter of 2011 and a lower net interest rate on the Company's debt subject to interest rate swaps. These decreases were partly offset by interest on new senior notes issued during the third quarter of 2011.Early Extinguishment of DebtOn July 15, 2011 the Company purchased $600 million of the Outstanding Notes, comprised of $330 million of its 2014 Notes and $270 million of its 2015 Notes (collectively, the ""Notes""). The Company acquired the Notes at market value plus a tender premium, which exceeded its carrying value and resulted in a charge of approximately $72 million in the third quarter of 2011.Investment Income (Loss)In 2012, investment income was $24 million compared with $9 million in 2011. This increase is primarily due to higher mark-to-market gains on private equity fund investments, partly offset by an impairment loss on a debt security of $8 million.In 2011, investment income was $9 million compared with $43 million in 2010. This decrease primarily reflects the impact of lower private equity gains recorded in 2011 as compared to 2010, the effects of recording an impairment loss in 2011 and a gain on the sale of equity securities in 2010. Income TaxesThe Company's consolidated effective tax rate was 29.0%, 30.1% and 26.5% in 2012, 2011 and 2010, respectively. The tax rate in each year reflects foreign operations which are taxed at rates lower than the U.S. statutory tax rate. The lower effective tax rate attributed to the Company's foreign operations primarily reflects lower corporate tax rates that prevail outside of the U.S., net of the U.S. tax impact from repatriating foreign earnings. In 2012, pre-tax income in the U.K., Canada, Australia and Bermuda accounted for approximately 60% of the Company's total non-U.S. pre-tax income, with effective rates in those countries of 24% (excluding the non-cash deferred tax impact of UK tax legislation enacted in 2012), 27%, 30% and 0%, respectively. Under current U.S. tax law, the Company anticipates its non-U.S. operations will continue to incur taxes at rates below the U.S. federal tax rate of 35%. The Company's non-U.S. revenue over the past three years has been approximately 55% of total revenue, while the pre-tax income from non-U.S. locations varied from 77% to 138% of total pre-tax income. Although revenue in the United States has been approximately 45% of total revenue, while the Company had gains in its U.S. operations in 2011 and 2012, the Company incurred pre-tax losses in the United States during 2010 as a result of a significant charge from the resolution of the ARMB matter, which is discussed in Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. The Company had pre-tax income in its U.S. operations in 2011 and 2012.In addition, as a U.S. domiciled parent holding company, Marsh & McLennan Companies, Inc., is the issuer for essentially all of the Company's external indebtedness, and incurs the related interest expense in the U.S. Finally, most senior executive and oversight functions are conducted in the U.S. and the associated costs are incurred primarily in the United States. 36 The effective tax rate may vary significantly from period to period for the foreseeable future. It is sensitive to the geographic mix and repatriation of the Company's earnings, which may result in higher or lower tax rates. A proportional increase in U.S. pre-tax income will tend to increase the effective tax rate because U.S. federal and state corporate tax rates often exceed tax rates applicable outside the U.S. Losses in certain jurisdictions cannot be offset by earnings from other operations, and may require valuation allowances that affect the rate, depending on estimates of the realizability of associated deferred tax assets. The effective tax rate is also sensitive to changes in unrecognized tax benefits, including the impact of settled tax audits and expired statutes of limitation.The realization of deferred tax assets depends on generating future taxable income during the periods in which the tax benefits are deductible or creditable. The Company and Marsh have been profitable globally. However, tax liabilities are determined and assessed on a legal entity and jurisdictional basis. Certain taxing jurisdictions allow or require combined or consolidated tax filings. In the United States, certain groups within the Company, which file on a combined basis, were profitable in 2011 and 2012, but incurred a loss in 2010 as a result of the resolution of the ARMB matter. The Company assessed the realizability of its domestic deferred tax assets, particularly state deferred tax assets of Marsh relating to jurisdictions in which it files separate tax returns, state deferred tax assets of all of the Company's domestic operations related to jurisdictions in which the Company files a unitary or combined state tax return, and foreign tax credit carry-forwards in the Company's consolidated U.S. federal tax return. When making its assessment about the realization of its domestic deferred tax assets at December 31, 2012, the Company considered all available evidence, placing particular weight on evidence that could be objectively verified. The evidence considered included (i) the profitability of the Company's U.S. operations in 2011 and 2012 and the cumulative period from 2010 through 2012, (ii) the nature, frequency, and severity of losses incurred before 2011, (iii) profit trends evidenced by continued improvements in the Company's and Marsh's operating performance, (iv) the non-recurring nature of some of the items that contributed to losses before 2011, (v) the carry-forward periods for the net operating losses (""NOLs"") and foreign tax credit carry-forwards, (vi) the sources and timing of future taxable income, giving weight to sources according to the extent to which they can be objectively verified, and (vii) tax planning strategies that would be implemented, if necessary, to accelerate utilization of NOLs. Based on its assessment, the Company concluded that it is more likely than not that a substantial portion of these deferred tax assets are realizable and a valuation allowance was recorded to reduce the domestic deferred tax assets to the amount that the Company believes is more likely than not to be realized. In the event sufficient taxable income is not generated in future periods, additional valuation allowances of up to approximately $270 million could be required relating to these domestic deferred tax assets. The realization of the remaining U.S. federal deferred tax assets is not as sensitive to U.S. profits because it is supported by anticipated repatriation of future annual earnings from the Company's profitable global operations, consistent with the Company's historical practice. In addition, when making its assessment about the realization of its domestic deferred tax assets at December 31, 2012, the Company continued to assess the realizability of deferred tax assets of certain other entities with a history of recent losses, including other U.S. entities that file separate state tax returns and foreign subsidiaries, and recorded valuation allowances as appropriate.Changes in tax laws or tax rulings may have a significant adverse impact on our effective tax rate. For example, proposals for fundamental U.S. international tax reform, if enacted, could have a significant adverse impact on the effective tax rate.Liquidity and Capital ResourcesThe Company is organized as a holding company, a legal entity separate and distinct from its operating subsidiaries. As a holding company without significant operations of its own, the Company is dependent upon dividends and other payments from its operating subsidiaries to meet its obligations for paying principal and interest on outstanding debt obligations, for paying dividends to stockholders and for corporate expenses. Other sources of liquidity include borrowing facilities discussed below in financing cash flows.The Company derives a significant portion of its revenue and operating profit from operating subsidiaries located outside of the United States. Funds from the Company’s operating subsidiaries located outside of the United States are regularly repatriated to the United States out of annual earnings. At December 31, 2012, the Company had approximately $1.3 billion of cash and cash equivalents in its foreign operations, 37 of which all but approximately $80 million is considered to be permanently invested in those operations to fund foreign investments and working capital needs. The non-U.S. cash and cash equivalents considered permanently reinvested includes approximately $250 million of operating funds required to be maintained for regulatory requirements or as collateral under certain captive insurance arrangements. The Company expects to continue its practice of repatriating foreign funds out of current annual earnings. While management does not foresee a need to repatriate the funds which are currently deemed permanently invested, if facts or circumstances change management could elect to repatriate them, if necessary, which could result in higher effective tax rates in the future.Cash on our consolidated balance sheets includes funds available for general corporate purposes. Funds held on behalf of clients in a fiduciary capacity are segregated and shown separately in the consolidated balance sheets as an offset to fiduciary liabilities. Fiduciary funds cannot be used for general corporate purposes, and should not be considered as a source of liquidity for the Company.Operating Cash FlowsThe Company generated $1.3 billion of cash from operations in 2012 compared with $1.7 billion in 2011. These amounts reflect the net income reported by the Company during those periods, excluding gains or losses from investments and the disposition of businesses, adjusted for non-cash charges and changes in working capital which relate, primarily, to the timing of payments for accrued liabilities or receipts of assets. The reduction in cash generated from operations is primarily due to the cash refunds of U.S. federal income taxes received in 2011, discussed below. Cash generated from the disposition of businesses is included in investing cash flows. The Company received $322 million in cash refunds of U.S. federal income taxes during the second quarter of 2011, comprising $212 million from carrying back the net capital loss incurred in 2010 from the sale of Kroll and various other assets, and $110 million from the cash settlement of the IRS audit for the periods 2006 through 2008. The audit settlement primarily reflected the allowance of carry back claims for net operating losses and excess foreign tax credits arising in 2008. The impact on the tax provision of these events was reflected in prior periods and did not impact income tax expense reported in 2011.On June 11, 2010, the Company resolved the litigation brought by the ARMB on behalf of two Alaska benefit plans against Mercer, relating to work in the period 1992 to 2004. Under the terms of the settlement agreement, Mercer paid $500 million, of which $100 million was covered by insurance. Pension Related ItemsDuring 2012, the Company contributed $124 million to its U.S. pension plans and $389 million to non-U.S. pension plans, which includes discretionary contributions of $100 million to each of the U.S. and the U.K. plans, compared with $24 million for U.S. plans and $320 million for non-U.S. plans in 2011.In the U.S., contributions to the tax-qualified defined benefit plans are based on ERISA guidelines and the company generally expects to maintain a funded status of 80% or more of the liability determined under the ERISA guidelines. The pension stabilization provisions included in the ""Moving Ahead for Progress in the 21st Century Act"", enacted on July 6, 2012, changed the methodology for determining the discount rate used for calculating plan liabilities under ERISA, which determines, in part, the funding requirements. After considering the impact of the pension funding stabilization provisions discussed above, the Company does not expect any contributions will be required to its U.S. tax-qualified plan through the end of 2014. The Company expects to fund approximately $25 million to its non-qualified U.S. pension plans in 2013.The Company has a large number of non-U.S. defined benefit pension plans, the largest of which are in the U.K., which comprise approximately 82% of non-U.S. plan assets. Contribution rates for non-US plans are generally based on local funding practices and statutory requirements, which may differ significantly from measurements under U.S. GAAP. In the U.K., contributions to defined benefit pension plans are determined through a negotiation process between the Company and the plans' Trustee that typically occurs every three years in conjunction with the actuarial valuation of the plans. This process is governed by U.K. pension regulations. The assumptions that result from the funding negotiations are different from those used for U.S. GAAP and currently result in a lower funded status than under U.S. GAAP. The current funding plan was based on assumptions (including interest rates, inflation, salary increases and 38 mortality) that reflected market conditions as of year-end 2009, was agreed to in early 2011 and forms the basis for the Company's aggregate contributions to the U.K. plans for 2011 through 2013. In 2012, the Company made required contributions of $289 million to its non-U.S. defined benefit pension plans, including amounts called for under the U.K. funding plan. Additionally, the Company made a $100 million discretionary contribution to the U.K. plans. The valuation of the U.K. pension plan at December 31, 2012 that results from the negotiation process described above will determine funding that is expected to become applicable in 2014. Contributions to the U.K. plans typically comprised of a portion related to the current service cost, that is, the benefits earned by employees in the current year, plus an amount intended to reduce, over time, any deficit determined through the Company's negotiations with the Trustee. The Company anticipates contributing approximately $250 million in March 2013 to pre-fund all or a substantial portion of any deficit funding contributions that may be required from 2014 through 2016 as a result of the negotiations with the Trustee. In the aggregate, the Company expects to fund $623 million to its non-U.S. plans in 2013, comprising $171 million to plans outside of the U.K. (including a $70 million discretionary contribution to a Canadian plan in January 2013) and $452 million to the U.K. plans. Funding amounts may be influenced by future asset performance, the level of discount rates and other variables impacting the assets and/or liabilities of the plan. The year-over-year change in the funded status of the Company's pension plans is impacted by the variance between actual and assumed results, particularly with regard to return on assets and changes in the discount rate, as well as the amount of Company contributions, if any. Unrecognized actuarial losses were approximately $1.9 billion and $3.3 billion at December 31, 2012 for the U.S. plans and non-U.S. plans, respectively, compared with $1.7 billion and $3.0 billion at December 31, 2011. The increase is primarily due to the impact of decreases in the discount rates partly offset by actual returns on plan assets in 2012 that were higher than the estimated long-term rate of return on plan assets. In the past several years, the amount of actuarial losses has been significantly impacted, both positively and negatively, by actual asset performance and changes in discount rates. The discount rate used to measure plan liabilities declined in both the U.S. and the U.K. (the Company's two largest plans) in each of the four years for 2009 to 2012. At the end of 2009, the weighted average discount rate for all plans was 6.0%, declining to 5.6%, 4.9% and 4.4% at the end of 2010, 2011 and 2012, respectively. A decline in the discount rate increases the measured plan liability, resulting in actuarial losses. During 2012, the Company's defined benefit pension plan assets had actual returns of 14.1% and 9.9% in the U.S. and U.K., respectively. During 2011, the Company's defined benefit pension plan assets had actual returns of 5.8%, and 4.8% in the U.S. and U.K., respectively; and in 2010, the actual returns were 14.4% in the U.S. and 13.5% in the U.K. In 2012 and 2010, actuarial losses resulting from declines in the discount rate were partly offset by actual asset returns which exceeded the assumed rates of return in each year. In 2011, both the decline in the discount rate and actual asset returns that were lower than the assumed rates of return contributed to the actuarial losses.Overall, the Company’s pension expense is expected to increase in 2013 by approximately $30 million before the partly-offsetting impacts on bonuses and other incentive compensation and possible movements in foreign exchange rates. The increase in the expected pension expense in 2013 results primarily from a decline in the discount rates used to measure plan liabilities. Partly offsetting this increase is the impact of an increase in plan assets resulting from both investment returns and contributions.The impact of these higher asset levels is partly offset by a reduction in the weighted average assumed rate of return related to the non-U.S. plans.The Company’s accounting policies for its defined benefit pension plans, including the selection of and sensitivity to assumptions, are discussed below under Management’s Discussion of Critical Accounting Policies. For additional information regarding the Company’s retirement plans, see Note 8 to the consolidated financial statements.Financing Cash FlowsNet cash used for financing activities was $633 million in 2012 compared with $1.0 billion of net cash used for financing activities in 2011. The Company reduced outstanding debt by approximately $10 million, $100 million and $550 million in 2012, 2011 and 2010, respectively. 39 DebtDuring the first quarter of 2012, the Company repaid its 6.25% fixed rate $250 million senior notes that matured. The Company used proceeds from the issuance of 2.3% five-year $250 million senior notes in the first quarter to fund the maturing notes.On July 15, 2011, the Company purchased $600 million of outstanding notes comprised of $330 million of its 2014 Notes and $270 million of its 2015 Notes (collectively, the ""Notes""). The Company acquired the Notes at fair value plus a tender premium, which exceeded its carrying value. A charge of approximately $72 million was recorded in the Consolidated Statement of Income in the third quarter of 2011 related to the extinguishment of this debt.The Company used proceeds from the issuance of 4.80% ten-year $500 million senior notes in the third quarter of 2011 and cash on hand to purchase the Notes.In February 2013, the Company repaid $250 million of maturing senior notes.AcquisitionsDuring 2012, the Company paid $30 million of contingent payments related to acquisitions made in prior periods. Remaining estimated future contingent consideration payments of $63 million for acquisitions completed in 2012 and in prior years are recorded in accounts payable and accrued liabilities or other liabilities in the consolidated balance sheet at December 31, 2012. In the second quarter of 2011, the Company acquired the remaining minority interest of a previously majority-owned entity for total cash consideration of $8 million.In the first quarter of 2011, the Company paid deferred purchase consideration of $13 million related to the purchase in 2009 of the minority interest of a previously controlled entity.Credit FacilitiesThe Company and certain of its subsidiaries maintain a $1.0 billion multi-currency five-year unsecured revolving credit facility. The interest rate on this facility is based on LIBOR plus a fixed margin which varies with the Company's credit ratings. This facility requires the Company to maintain certain coverage and leverage ratios which are tested quarterly. There were no borrowings under this facility at December 31, 2012.In December 2012 the Company closed on a $50 million, 3-year delayed draw term loan facility. The interest rate on this facility is based on LIBOR plus a fixed margin which varies with the Company's credit ratings. The facility requires the Company to maintain coverage ratios and leverage ratios consistent with the revolving credit facility discussed above. There were no borrowings under this facility at December 31, 2012. The Company’s senior debt is currently rated Baa2 by Moody’s and BBB by Standard & Poor’s. The Company’s short-term debt is currently rated P-2 by Moody’s and A-2 by Standard & Poor’s. The Company carries a stable outlook from Moody’s and Standard & Poor’s.The Company also maintains other credit facilities, guarantees and letters of credit with various banks, primarily related to operations located outside the United States, aggregating $247 million at December 31, 2012 and $248 million at December 31, 2011. There were no outstanding borrowings under these facilities.Share RepurchasesDuring 2012, the Company repurchased approximately 6.9 million shares of its common stock for total consideration of approximately $230 million at an average price per share of $33.36. The Company remains authorized to repurchase additional shares of its common stock up to a value of $323 million. There is no time limit on this authorization. During 2011, the Company repurchased approximately 12.3 million shares of its common stock for total consideration of approximately $361 million at an average price per share of $29.44. 40 DividendsThe Company paid total dividends of $497 million in 2012 ($0.90 per share), $480 million in 2011 ($0.86 per share) and $452 million in 2010 ($0.81 per share).Investing Cash FlowsNet cash used for investing activities amounted to $583 million in 2012 compared with $457 million used for investing activities in 2011. The Company made 15 acquisitions in 2012. Cash used for these acquisitions, net of cash acquired was $230 million. In addition, in 2012, the Company paid $59 million of deferred purchase consideration related to acquisitions made in prior years and $3 million for the purchase of other intangible assets. Remaining deferred cash payments of approximately $42 million for acquisitions completed in 2012 and in prior years are recorded in accounts payable and accrued liabilities or other liabilities in the consolidated balance sheet at December 31, 2012. The Company made 12 acquisitions in 2011. Cash used for these acquisitions, net of cash acquired, was $160 million compared with $427 million used for acquisitions in 2010. In addition, the Company recorded a liability of $33 million for estimated contingent purchase consideration related to the acquisitions completed in 2011. In 2011, the Company also paid $11 million for deferred purchase consideration, $62 million into escrow for future acquisitions and $4 million for the purchase of other intangible assets. In 2010, in addition to the cash paid, the Company issued approximately 7.6 million shares of common stock with an acquisition date value of $183 million, and also paid $60 million of deferred purchase consideration, $3 million for other intangible assets and $2 million of contingent purchase consideration related to acquisitions made in prior years. Cash provided by the sale of securities was $6 million for the periods ended December 31, 2012 and 2011, respectively.The Company’s additions to fixed assets and capitalized software, which amounted to $320 million in 2012 and $280 million in 2011, primarily relate to computer equipment purchases, the refurbishing and modernizing of office facilities and software development costs. The Company has committed to potential future investments of approximately $40 million in private equity funds that invest primarily in financial services companies. Substantially all invested assets in Trident II were harvested in the first quarter of 2013 and the fund is expected to wind down. The Company expects to receive approximately $100 million related to its Trident II investment in 2013. Commitments and ObligationsThe following sets forth the Company’s future contractual obligations by the types identified in the table below as of December 31, 2012: Payment due by PeriodContractual Obligations(In millions of dollars)Total Within1 Year 1-3Years 4-5Years After 5YearsCurrent portion of long-term debt$260 $260 $— $— $—Long-term debt2,664 — 821 273 1,570Interest on long-term debt1,309 159 287 209 654Net operating leases2,489 355 583 433 1,118Service agreements374 136 120 78 40Other long-term obligations144 32 103 7 2Purchase commitments47 32 15 — —Total$7,287 $974 $1,929 $1,000 $3,384The above does not include the liability for unrecognized tax benefits of $117 million as the Company is unable to reasonably predict the timing of settlement of these liabilities, other than approximately $12 million that may become payable during 2013. The above does not include the indemnified liabilities discussed in Note 15 as the Company is unable to reasonably predict the timing of settlement of these liabilities. The above does not include net pension liabilities of approximately $1.8 billion because the 41 timing and amount of ultimate payment of such liability is dependent upon future events, including, but not limited to, future returns on plan assets, and changes in the discount rate used to measure the liabilities. The amounts of estimated future benefits payments to be made from plan assets are disclosed in Note 8 to the consolidated financial statements. In 2013, the Company expects to contribute approximately $25 million and $623 million to its U.S. and non-U.S. pension plans, respectively. Management’s Discussion of Critical Accounting PoliciesThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (“GAAP”) requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue and expenses, and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. Management considers the policies discussed below to be critical to understanding the Company’s financial statements because their application places the most significant demands on management’s judgment, and requires management to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain. Actual results may differ from those estimates.Legal and Other Loss ContingenciesThe Company and its subsidiaries are subject to numerous claims, lawsuits and proceedings including claims for errors and omissions. GAAP requires that a liability be recorded when a loss is both probable and reasonably estimable. Significant management judgment is required to apply this guidance. The Company utilizes case level reviews by inside and outside counsel, an internal actuarial analysis and other analyses to estimate potential losses. The liability is reviewed quarterly and adjusted as developments warrant. In many cases, the Company has not recorded a liability, other than for legal fees to defend the claim, because we are unable, at the present time, to make a determination that a loss is both probable and reasonably estimable. Given the unpredictability of E&O claims and of litigation that could flow from them, it is possible that an adverse outcome in a particular matter could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s businesses, results of operations, financial condition or cash flow in a given quarterly or annual period.In addition, to the extent that insurance coverage is available, significant management judgment is required to determine the amount of recoveries that are probable of collection under the Company’s various insurance programs.Retirement BenefitsThe Company maintains qualified and non-qualified defined benefit pension and defined contribution plans for its eligible U.S. employees and a variety of defined benefit and defined contribution plans for its eligible non-U.S. employees. The Company’s policy for funding its tax qualified defined benefit retirement plans is to contribute amounts at least sufficient to meet the funding requirements set forth in U.S. and applicable foreign laws.The Company recognizes the funded status of its over-funded defined benefit pension and retiree medical plans as a net benefit plan asset and its unfunded and underfunded plans as a net benefit plan liability. The gains or losses and prior service costs or credits that have not been recognized as components of net periodic costs are recorded as a component of Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income (“AOCI”), net of tax, in the Company’s consolidated balance sheets. The gains and losses that exceed specified corridors are amortized prospectively out of AOCI over a period that approximates the average remaining service period of active employees, or for plans in which substantially all the participants are inactive, over the remaining life expectancy of the inactive employees. The determination of net periodic pension cost is based on a number of assumptions, including an expected long-term rate of return on plan assets, the discount rate, mortality and assumed rate of salary increase. Significant assumptions used in the calculation of net periodic pension costs and pension liabilities are disclosed in Note 8 to the consolidated financial statements. The Company believes the assumptions for each plan are reasonable and appropriate and will continue to evaluate assumptions at least annually and adjust them as appropriate. Based on its current assumptions, the Company expects pension expense in 2013 to increase approximately $30 million compared with 2012 before partly-offsetting impacts of bonuses and other incentive compensation and possible movements in foreign exchange rates. 42 Future pension expense or credits will depend on plan provisions, future investment performance, future assumptions and various other factors related to the populations participating in the pension plans. Holding all other assumptions constant, a half-percentage point change in the rate of return on plan assets and discount rate assumptions would affect net periodic pension cost for the U.S. and U.K. plans, which together comprise approximately 88% of total pension plan liabilities, as follows: 0.5 PercentagePoint Increase 0.5 PercentagePoint Decrease(In millions of dollars)U.S. U.K. U.S. U.K.Assumed Rate of Return on Plan Assets$(18) $(35) $18 $35Discount Rate$(20) $(25) $20 $25Changing the discount rate and leaving the other assumptions constant may not be representative of the impact on expense, because the long-term rates of inflation and salary increases are often correlated with the discount rate. Changes in these assumptions will not necessarily have a linear impact on the net periodic pension cost.The Company contributes to certain health care and life insurance benefits provided to its retired employees. The cost of these post-retirement benefits for employees in the U.S. is accrued during the period up to the date employees are eligible to retire, but is funded by the Company as incurred. The key assumptions and sensitivity to changes in the assumed health care cost trend rate are discussed in Note 8 to the consolidated financial statements.Income TaxesThe Company's tax rate reflects its income, statutory tax rates and tax planning in the various jurisdictions in which it operates. Significant judgment is required in determining the annual effective tax rate and in evaluating uncertain tax positions. The Company reports a liability for unrecognized tax benefits resulting from uncertain tax positions taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. The evaluation of a tax position is a two-step process. The first step involves recognition. The Company determines whether it is more likely than not that a tax position will be sustained upon tax examination, including resolution of any related appeals or litigation, based on only the technical merits of the position. The technical merits of a tax position derive from both statutory and judicial authority (legislation and statutes, legislative intent, regulations, rulings, and case law) and their applicability to the facts and circumstances of the tax position. If a tax position does not meet the more likely than not recognition threshold, the benefit of that position is not recognized in the financial statements. The second step is measurement. A tax position that meets the more likely than not recognition threshold is measured to determine the amount of benefit to recognize in the financial statements. The tax position is measured as the largest amount of benefit that is greater than 50 percent likely of being realized upon ultimate resolution with a taxing authority.Uncertain tax positions are evaluated based upon the facts and circumstances that exist at each reporting period and involve significant management judgment. Subsequent changes in judgment based upon new information may lead to changes in recognition, derecognition, and measurement. Adjustments may result, for example, upon resolution of an issue with the taxing authorities, or expiration of a statute of limitations barring an assessment for an issue.Tax law requires items be included in the Company's tax returns at different times than the items are reflected in the financial statements. As a result, the annual tax expense reflected in the consolidated statements of income is different than that reported in the tax returns. Some of these differences are permanent, such as expenses that are not deductible in the returns, and some differences are temporary and reverse over time, such as depreciation expense. Temporary differences create deferred tax assets and liabilities. Deferred tax liabilities generally represent tax expense recognized in the financial statements for which payment has been deferred, or expense for which a deduction has been taken already in the tax return but the expense has not yet been recognized in the financial statements. Deferred tax assets generally represent items that can be used as a tax deduction or credit in tax returns in future years for which a benefit has already been recorded in the financial statements. In assessing the need for and amount of a valuation allowance for deferred tax assets, the Company considers whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized and adjusts the valuation allowance accordingly. The Company evaluates all significant available positive and 43 negative evidence, including the existence of losses in recent years and its forecast of future taxable income by jurisdiction, in assessing the need for a valuation allowance. The Company also considers tax-planning strategies that would result in realization of deferred tax assets, and the presence of taxable income in prior period tax filings in jurisdictions that allow for the carryback of tax attributes pursuant to the applicable tax law. The underlying assumptions the Company uses in forecasting future taxable income require significant judgment and take into account the Company's recent performance. The ultimate realization of deferred tax assets is dependent on the generation of future taxable income during the periods in which temporary differences or carry-forwards are deductible or creditable. Valuation allowances are established for deferred tax assets when it is estimated that it is more likely than not that future taxable income will be insufficient to fully use a deduction or credit in that jurisdiction.Fair Value DeterminationsInvestment Valuation—The Company holds investments in private companies as well as certain private equity funds. Certain investments, primarily investments in private equity funds, are accounted for using the equity method. Although not directly recorded in the Company’s consolidated balance sheets, the Company defined benefit pension plans hold investments of approximately $12.2 billion. The fair value of these investments determines, in part, the over-or under-funded status of those plans, which is included in the Company’s consolidated balance sheets. The Company periodically reviews the carrying value of its investments to determine if any valuation adjustments are appropriate under the applicable accounting pronouncements. The Company bases its review on the facts and circumstances as they relate to each investment. Fair value of investments in private equity funds is determined by the funds’ investment managers. Factors considered in determining the fair value of private equity investments include: implied valuation of recently completed financing rounds that included sophisticated outside investors; performance multiples of comparable public companies; restrictions on the sale or disposal of the investments; trading characteristics of the securities; and the relative size of the holdings in comparison to other private investors and the public market float. In those instances where quoted market prices are not available, particularly for equity holdings in private companies, or formal restrictions limit the sale of securities, significant management judgment is required to determine the appropriate value of the Company’s investments. The Company reviews with the fund manager the appropriateness of valuation results for significant private equity investments.Goodwill Impairment Testing—The Company is required to assess goodwill and any indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment annually, or more frequently if circumstances indicate impairment may have occurred. The Company performs the annual goodwill impairment test for each of its reporting units during the third quarter of each year. The Company adopted new accounting guidance in the third quarter of 2011. Under this guidance, a company may first assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is necessary to perform the goodwill impairment test. If, as a result of this qualitative assessment, a company determines the fair value of a reporting unit is more likely than not lower than its carrying value, a step 1 impairment assessment must be performed. The Company considered the totality of numerous factors, which included that the fair value of each reporting unit exceeded its carrying value by a substantial margin in its most recent estimate of reporting unit fair values, whether significant acquisitions or dispositions occurred which might alter the fair values of its reporting units, macroeconomic conditions and their potential impact on reporting unit fair values, actual performance compared with budget and prior projections used in its estimation of reporting unit fair values, industry and market conditions, and the year over year change in the Company's share price.Based on its qualitative evaluation, the Company concluded that a two-step goodwill impairment test was not required in 2012.Share-based PaymentThe guidance for accounting for share-based payments requires, among other things, that the estimated fair value of stock options be charged to earnings. Significant management judgment is required to determine the appropriate assumptions for inputs such as volatility and expected term necessary to estimate option values. In addition, management judgment is required to analyze the terms of the plans and awards granted thereunder to determine if awards will be treated as equity awards or liability awards, as defined by the accounting guidance. 44 As of December 31, 2012, there was $18 million of unrecognized compensation cost related to stock option awards. The weighted-average periods over which the costs are expected to be recognized is 1.3 years. Also as of December 31, 2012, there was $135 million of unrecognized compensation cost related to the Company’s restricted stock, restricted stock unit and deferred stock unit awards.See Note 9 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding accounting for share-based payments.New Accounting PronouncementsNote 1 to the consolidated financial statements contains a summary of the Company’s significant accounting policies, including a discussion of recently issued accounting pronouncements and their impact or potential future impact on the Company’s financial results, if determinable, under the sub-heading ""New Accounting Pronouncements"" . 45 Item 7A. Qualitative and Quantitative Disclosures About Market RiskMarket Risk and Credit RiskCertain of the Company’s revenues, expenses, assets and liabilities are exposed to the impact of interest rate changes and fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates and equity markets.Interest Rate Risk and Credit RiskThe Company has historically managed its net exposure to interest rate changes by utilizing a mixture of variable and fixed rate borrowings to finance the Company’s asset base. In February 2011, the Company entered into two 3.5-year interest rate swaps to hedge changes in the fair value of the first $250 million of its 5.375% senior notes due in 2014. Under the terms of the swaps, the counter-parties will pay the Company a fixed rate of 5.375% and the Company will pay interest at a floating rate of three-month LIBOR plus a fixed spread of 3.726%. The swaps are designated as fair value hedging instruments and are deemed to be perfectly effective in accordance with applicable accounting guidance.Interest income generated from the Company’s cash investments as well as invested fiduciary funds will vary with the general level of interest rates.The Company had the following investments subject to variable interest rates: (In millions of dollars)December 31, 2012Cash and cash equivalents invested in money market funds, certificates of deposit and time deposits$2,301Fiduciary cash and investments$3,992Based on the above balances, if short-term interest rates increased or decreased by 10%, or 10 basis points, over the course of the year, annual interest income, including interest earned on fiduciary funds, would increase or decrease by approximately $4 million.In addition to interest rate risk, our cash investments and fiduciary fund investments are subject to potential loss of value due to counter-party credit risk. To minimize this risk, the Company and its subsidiaries invest pursuant to a Board approved investment policy. The policy mandates the preservation of principal and liquidity and requires broad diversification with counter-party limits assigned based primarily on credit rating and type of investment. The Company carefully monitors its cash and fiduciary fund investments and will further restrict the portfolio as appropriate to market conditions. The majority of cash and fiduciary fund investments are invested in short-term bank deposits and liquid money market funds.Foreign Currency RiskThe translated values of revenue and expense from the Company’s international operations are subject to fluctuations due to changes in currency exchange rates. The non-U.S. based revenue that is exposed to foreign exchange fluctuations is approximately 56% of total revenue. We periodically use forward contracts and options to limit foreign currency exchange rate exposure on net income and cash flows for specific, clearly defined transactions arising in the ordinary course of business. Although the Company has significant revenue generated in foreign locations which is subject to foreign exchange rate fluctuations, in most cases both the foreign currency revenue and expenses are in the functional currency of the foreign location. As such, the U.S. dollar translation of both the revenues and expenses, as well as the potentially offsetting movements of various currencies against the U.S. dollar, generally tends to mitigate the impact on net operating income of foreign currency risk. The Company estimates that a 10% movement of major foreign currencies (Euro, Sterling, Australian dollar and Canadian dollar) in the same direction against the U.S. dollar that held constant over the course of the year would increase or decrease full year operating income by approximately $45 million. 46 Equity Price RiskThe Company holds investments in both public and private companies, and certain private equity funds that invest primarily in financial services companies. Non-publicly traded investments of $16 million are accounted for using the cost method and $131 million are accounted for using the equity method. The investments that are classified as available for sale or that are not publicly traded are subject to risk of changes in market value, which if determined to be other than temporary, could result in realized impairment losses. The Company periodically reviews the carrying value of such investments to determine if any valuation adjustments are appropriate under the applicable accounting pronouncements.OtherA number of lawsuits and regulatory proceedings are pending.

Expenses increased 1% on both a reported and underlying basis as the Company continues its efforts to manage expenses and improve operating efficiency. Risk and Insurance Services operating income increased $87 million or 7% in 2013 compared with 2012. Revenue increased 4%, or 3% on an underlying basis, to $6.6 billion in 2013 reflecting underlying revenue growth of 3% at Marsh and 5% at Guy Carpenter. Consulting operating income increased $153 million or 22% to $845 million in 2013 compared with 2012 due to the combined effects of increased revenue at Mercer and lower expenses in the segment.Consolidated operating income in 2012 was $1.8 billion compared with $1.6 billion in 2011. Risk and Insurance Services operating income in 2012 increased $134 million or 11% to $1.3 billion compared with 2011, resulting from revenue growth at both Marsh and Guy Carpenter.Consulting operating income in 2012 increased $75 million or 12% to $692 million compared with 2011, primarily due to increased revenue at Mercer and improved operating efficiency.Discontinued operations in 2011 includes a net credit resulting from the resolution of certain legal matters and related insurance recoveries as well as the settlement of certain tax audits and the expiration of the statute of limitations related to certain indemnified matters in connection with the disposals of Putnam and Kroll. These credits are partly offset by the write-off, net of tax, of capitalized software related to the disposal of the Marsh Business Processing Outsourcing (""BPO"") business.Consolidated net income attributable to the Company was $1.4 billion in 2013, compared with $1.2 billion in 2012 and $993 million in 2011.Consolidated Revenue and ExpenseThe Company conducts business in many countries, as a result of which the impact of foreign exchange rate movements may impact period-to-period comparisons of revenue. Similarly, the revenue impact of 26acquisitions and dispositions may impact period-to-period comparisons of revenue. Underlying revenue measures the change in revenue from one period to another by isolating these impacts. The impact of foreign currency exchange fluctuations, acquisitions and dispositions, including transfers among businesses, on the Company’s operating revenues is as follows: Year EndedDecember 31, Components of Revenue Change*(In millions, except percentage figures)2013 2012 % Change GAAPRevenue CurrencyImpact Acquisitions/DispositionsImpact UnderlyingRevenueRisk and Insurance Services Marsh$5,438 $5,232 4% (1)% 2% 3 %Guy Carpenter1,131 1,079 5% (1)% 1% 5 %Subtotal6,569 6,311 4% (1)% 2% 4 %Fiduciary Interest Income27 39 Total Risk and Insurance Services6,596 6,350 4% (1)% 2% 3 %Consulting Mercer4,241 4,147 2% (1)% — 4 %Oliver Wyman Group1,460 1,466 — 1 % — (1)%Total Consulting5,701 5,613 2% (1)% — 2 %Corporate/Eliminations(36) (39) Total Revenue$12,261 $11,924 3% (1)% 1% 3 %*Components of revenue change may not add due to rounding.The following table provides more detailed revenue information for certain of the components presented above: Year EndedDecember 31, Components of Revenue Change*(In millions, except percentage figures)2013 2012 % Change GAAPRevenue CurrencyImpact Acquisitions/DispositionsImpact UnderlyingRevenueMarsh: EMEA$1,902 $1,860 2 % — — 3 %Asia Pacific659 656 — (5)% — 5 %Latin America392 353 11 % (9)% 7 % 13 %Total International2,953 2,869 3 % (2)% 1 % 4 %U.S. / Canada2,485 2,363 5 % — 4 % 2 %Total Marsh$5,438 $5,232 4 % (1)% 2 % 3 %Mercer: Health$1,511 $1,412 7 % — 1 % 6 %Retirement1,344 1,396 (4)% — (4)% 1 %Talent606 604 — (2)% 4 % (1)%Investments780 735 6 % (3)% 1 % 9 %Total Mercer$4,241 $4,147 2 % (1)% — 4 %Underlying revenue measures the change in revenue using consistent currency exchange rates, excluding the impact of certain items such as: acquisitions, dispositions and transfers among businesses.*Components of revenue change may not add due to rounding.27 Year EndedDecember 31, Components of Revenue Change*(In millions, except percentage figures)2012 2011 % Change GAAPRevenue CurrencyImpact Acquisitions/DispositionsImpact UnderlyingRevenueRisk and Insurance Services Marsh$5,232 $4,991 5 % (2)% 2 % 5%Guy Carpenter1,079 1,041 4 % (1)% (1)% 6%Subtotal6,311 6,032 5 % (2)% 2 % 5%Fiduciary Interest Income39 47 Total Risk and Insurance Services6,350 6,079 4 % (2)% 2 % 5%Consulting Mercer4,147 4,004 4 % (1)% 1 % 4%Oliver Wyman Group1,466 1,483 (1)% (2)% (2)% 3%Total Consulting5,613 5,487 2 % (2)% — 4%Corporate /Eliminations(39) (40) Total Revenue$11,924 $11,526 3 % (2)% 1 % 4%The following table provides more detailed revenue information for certain of the components presented above: Year EndedDecember 31, Components of Revenue Change*(In millions, except percentage figures) 2012 2011 % Change GAAPRevenue CurrencyImpact Acquisitions/DispositionsImpact UnderlyingRevenueMarsh: EMEA $1,860 $1,796 4 % (5)% 3 % 5%Asia Pacific 656 612 7 % (1)% — 7%Latin America 353 334 6 % (7)% — 13%Total International 2,869 2,742 5 % (4)% 2 % 6%U.S. / Canada 2,363 2,249 5 % — 2 % 3%Total Marsh $5,232 $4,991 5 % (2)% 2 % 5%Mercer: Health $1,412 $1,320 7 % (1)% 2 % 7%Retirement 1,396 1,423 (2)% (2)% (1)% 1%Talent 604 576 5 % (2)% 4 % 2%Investments 735 685 7 % (1)% 2 % 7%Total Mercer $4,147 $4,004 4 % (1)% 1 % 4%Underlying revenue measures the change in revenue using consistent currency exchange rates, excluding the impact of certain items such as: acquisitions, dispositions and transfers among businesses.*Components of revenue change may not add due to rounding.28RevenueConsolidated revenue for 2013 increased 3% on both a reported and underlying basis to $12.3 billion compared with $11.9 billion in 2012. Revenue in the Risk and Insurance Services segment increased 4% in 2013 compared with 2012, or 3% on an underlying basis, with underlying revenue growth of 3% at Marsh and 5% at Guy Carpenter. The Consulting segment's revenue increased 2% on both a reported and underlying basis. On an underlying basis, Mercer's revenue was up 4% in 2013 compared with 2012, while the Oliver Wyman Group decreased 1%. Consolidated revenue for 2012 increased 3% to $11.9 billion compared with $11.5 billion in 2011, reflecting a 4% increase in underlying revenue, a 1% increase due to acquisitions and a 2% negative impact of foreign currency translation. Revenue in the Risk and Insurance Services segment increased 4% in 2012 compared with 2011 or 5% on an underlying basis, reflecting increases of 5% in Marsh and 6% in Guy Carpenter. Consulting segment revenue increased 2%, resulting from a 4% increase in Mercer partly offset by a 1% decrease in the Oliver Wyman Group. On an underlying basis, Consulting segment revenue increased 4%, reflecting a 4% increase in Mercer and a 3% increase in the Oliver Wyman Group.Operating ExpenseConsolidated operating expenses increased 1% in 2013 compared with the same period in 2012 on both a reported and underlying basis. The increase in underlying expenses primarily reflects higher incentive compensation and pension costs, partly offset by lower costs related to professional indemnity claims. Consolidated operating expenses increased 2% in 2012 compared with the same period in 2011. The increase reflects a 3% increase in underlying expenses, a 1% increase due to the impact of acquisitions, offset by a 2% decrease due to the impact of foreign currency exchange translation. The increase in underlying expenses primarily reflects higher incentive compensation and benefits costs as well as restructuring costs at Mercer, which include exit costs related to a portion of Mercer's Canadian outsourcing business. These increases were partly offset by credits related to the adjustment of acquisition related contingent consideration liabilities.RestructuringIn 2013, the Company implemented restructuring actions which resulted in costs totaling $22 million. The restructuring costs consist primarily of severance and benefits, costs for future rent and other real estate costs. These costs were incurred as follows: Risk and Insurance Services—$7 million; Consulting—$2 million; and Corporate—$13 million. Businesses ExitedIn the fourth quarter of 2011, management initiated a plan to sell the Marsh BPO business, which was completed in August 2012. Marsh's BPO business was previously part of the Marsh U.S. Consumer business and provided policy, claims, call center and accounting operations on an outsourced basis to life insurance carriers. Marsh invested in a technology platform that was designed to make the BPO business scalable and more efficient. During 2011, Marsh decided that it would cease investing in the technology platform and instead exit the business via a sale. The Company wrote off capitalized software of the BPO business of $17 million, net of tax, which is included in discontinued operations in 2011. Risk and Insurance ServicesIn the Risk and Insurance Services segment, the Company’s subsidiaries and other affiliated entities act as brokers, agents or consultants for insureds, insurance underwriters and other brokers in the areas of risk management, insurance broking and insurance program management services, primarily under the name of Marsh; and engage in reinsurance broking, catastrophe and financial modeling services and related advisory functions, primarily under the name of Guy Carpenter.Marsh and Guy Carpenter are compensated for brokerage and consulting services primarily through fees paid by clients and/or commissions paid out of premiums charged by insurance and reinsurance companies. Commission rates vary in amount depending upon the type of insurance or reinsurance coverage provided, the particular insurer or reinsurer, the capacity in which the broker acts and negotiations with clients. Revenues can be affected by premium rate levels in the insurance/reinsurance markets, the amount of risk retained by insurance and reinsurance clients themselves and by the value of 29the risks that have been insured since commission based compensation is frequently related to the premiums paid by insureds/reinsureds. In many cases, fee compensation may be negotiated in advance, based on the type of risk, coverage required, and service provided by the Company and ultimately placed into the insurance market or retained by the client. The trends and comparisons of revenue from one period to the next can be affected by changes in premium rate levels, fluctuations in client risk retention, and increases or decreases in the value of risks that have been insured, as well as new and lost business, and the volume of business from new and existing clients. Marsh also receives compensation from insurance companies. This compensation includes, among other things, payment for consulting and analytics services provided to insurers; administrative and other services provided to or on behalf of insurers (including services relating to the administration and management of quota shares, panels and other facilities in which insurers participate); and contingent commissions in parts of its operations. Marsh and Guy Carpenter receive interest income on certain funds (such as premiums and claims proceeds) held in a fiduciary capacity for others. The investment of fiduciary funds is regulated by state and other insurance authorities. These regulations typically provide for segregation of fiduciary funds and limit the types of investments that may be made with them. Interest income from these investments varies depending on the amount of funds invested and applicable interest rates, both of which vary from time to time. For presentation purposes, fiduciary interest is segregated from the other revenues of Marsh and Guy Carpenter and separately presented within the segment, as shown in the revenue by segments charts earlier in this MD&A.

The increase in expenses on an underlying basis is primarily due to higher base salaries, pension costs and adjustments to acquisition-related contingent consideration liabilities, partly offset by lower costs related to professional indemnity claims.Expenses in the Risk and Insurance Services segment increased 3% in 2012 compared with 2011, reflecting a 2% increase from acquisitions and a 2% decrease due to the impact of foreign currency translation. Expenses on an underlying basis increased 3% primarily due to higher base salaries, incentive compensation and benefits costs partly offset by credits related to adjustments to acquisition- related contingent consideration liabilities.ConsultingThe Company conducts business in its Consulting segment through two main business groups. Mercer provides consulting expertise, advice, services and solutions in the areas of health, retirement, talent and investments. Oliver Wyman Group provides specialized management, economic and brand consulting services.The major component of revenue in the Consulting segment business is fees paid by clients for advice and services. Mercer, principally through its health line of business, also earns revenue in the form of commissions received from insurance companies for the placement of group (and occasionally individual) insurance contracts, primarily life, health and accident coverages. Revenue for Mercer’s delegated investment management business and certain of Mercer’s defined contribution administration services consists principally of fees based on assets under management and/or administration.Revenue in the Consulting segment is affected by, among other things, global economic conditions, including changes in clients’ particular industries and markets. Revenue is also affected by competition due to the introduction of new products and services, broad trends in employee demographics, including levels of employment, the effect of government policies and regulations, and fluctuations in interest and foreign exchange rates. Revenues from the provision of investment management services and retirement trust and administrative services are significantly affected by securities market performance. Reimbursable expenses incurred by professional staff in the generation of revenue and sub-advisory fees related to investment management are included in revenue and the related expenses are included in other operating expenses.The results of operations for the Consulting segment are presented below: (In millions of dollars)2013 2012 2011Revenue$5,701 $5,613 $5,487Compensation and Benefits3,269 3,298 3,315Other Operating Expenses1,587 1,623 1,555Operating Expenses4,856 4,921 4,870Operating Income$845 $692 $617Operating Income Margin14.8% 12.3% 11.2%RevenueConsulting revenue in 2013 increased 2% compared with 2012 on both a reported and underlying basis. Mercer’s revenue was $4.2 billion in 2013, an increase of 2% reflecting a 4% increase in underlying revenue, partly offset by a 1% decrease due to the impact of foreign currency. The underlying revenue growth was primarily driven by Health and Investments, which increased 6% and 9%, respectively. Oliver Wyman’s revenue was flat in 2013 compared to 2012, as a 1% decrease in underlying revenue was offset by a 1% increase due to the impact of foreign currency. 32The Consulting segment completed two acquisitions during 2013.•July - Oliver Wyman acquired Corven, a U.K.-based management consultancy firm.•August - Mercer acquired Global Remuneration Solutions, a market leading compensation consulting firm based in South Africa.Consulting revenue in 2012 increased 2% compared with 2011, or 4% on an underlying basis. Mercer’s revenue was $4.1 billion in 2012, an increase of 4% on both a reported and underlying basis compared with 2011, with growth in each of its businesses. The underlying revenue growth was primarily driven by 7% increases in both health and investments. Oliver Wyman’s revenue decreased 1% in 2012 compared to 2011, but increased 3% on an underlying basis. During 2012, Mercer completed the following three acquisitions: •February - Mercer acquired the remaining 49% of Yokogawa-ORC, a global mobility firm based in Japan, which was previously accounted for under the equity method, and Pensjon & Finans, a leading Norway-based financial investment and pension consulting firm. •March - Mercer acquired REPCA, a France-based broking and advisory firm for employer health and benefits plans. ExpenseConsulting expenses in 2013 decreased 1% on both a reported and underlying basis compared to 2012. This decrease reflects the impact of lower restructuring costs and continued strong expense control.Consulting expenses in 2012 increased 1%, or 2% on an underlying basis. This increase reflects the impact of higher benefits and restructuring costs, including charges of $16 million for the exit activities related to a portion of Mercer's Canadian outsourcing business.Corporate and OtherThe following results of Corporate and Other includes the run-off of Corporate Advisory and Restructuring Group (""CARG"") operations:(In millions of dollars)2013 2012 2011Corporate Advisory and Restructuring Operating Income$1 $6 $9Corporate Expense(190) (203) (188)Total Corporate and Other$(189) $(197) $(179)Corporate expenses in 2013 were $190 million compared to $203 million in 2012. The decrease is primarily due to lower amortization of equity awards and lower severance, partially offset by higher pension expense. Corporate expenses in 2012 were $203 million compared to $188 million in 2011. The increase was primarily due to accelerated amortization of equity awards for retirement eligible senior executives and higher consulting costs associated with corporate initiatives. The CARG amounts reflect payments received related to the CARG businesses divested in 2008.Discontinued OperationsAs part of the disposal transactions for Putnam and Kroll, the Company provided certain indemnities, primarily related to pre-transaction tax uncertainties and legal contingencies. In accordance with applicable accounting guidance, liabilities were established related to these indemnities at the time of the sales and reflected as a reduction of the gain on disposal. Discontinued operations includes charges or credits resulting from the settlement or resolution of the indemnified matters, as well as adjustments to the liabilities related to such matters. Discontinued operations in 2013 includes estimated costs covered under the indemnity related to the Kroll sale as well as tax indemnities related to the Putnam sale. Discontinued operations in 2011 includes credits of $50 million from the resolution of certain legal matters 33and insurance recoveries, as well as the settlement of tax audits and the expiration of the statutes of limitations related to certain of the indemnified matters, primarily with respect to Putnam.In the fourth quarter of 2011, management initiated a plan to sell the Marsh BPO business which was completed in August 2012. Marsh's BPO business, previously part of Marsh U.S. Consumer business, provided policy, claims, call center and accounting operations on an outsourced basis to life insurance carriers. Marsh invested in a technology platform that was designed to make the BPO business scalable and more efficient. During 2011, Marsh decided that it would cease investing in the technology platform and instead exit the business via a sale. The Company wrote off capitalized software of the BPO business of $17 million, net of tax, which is included in discontinued operations in 2011. Summarized Statements of Income data for discontinued operations is as follows: For the Years Ended December 31,(In millions of dollars, except per share figures)2013 2012 2011Income (loss) from discontinued operations, net of tax$— $— $(17)Disposals of discontinued operations (4) (2) 25Income tax (credit) expense (10) 1 (25)Disposals of discontinued operations, net of tax6 (3) 50Discontinued operations, net of tax$6 $(3) $33Discontinued operations, net of tax per share —Basic$0.01 $— $0.06—Diluted$0.01 $— $0.06Other Corporate ItemsInterestInterest income earned on corporate funds amounted to $18 million in 2013 compared with $24 million in 2012. The decrease in interest income is due to lower average interest rates compared with the prior year. Interest expense was $167 million in 2013 compared with $181 million in 2012. The decrease is due to lower average debt balances in 2013 and lower interest rates on senior notes issued in 2013 compared with the interest rates on senior notes that matured or were extinguished during 2013.Interest income earned on corporate funds amounted to $24 million in 2012 compared with $28 million in 2011. The decrease in interest income was due to lower average interest rates compared with the prior year. Interest expense was $181 million in 2012 compared with $199 million in 2011. The decrease was primarily due to lower interest rates on senior notes issued during the second half of 2011 and the first quarter of 2012, compared with the interest rate on notes that matured.Cost of Extinguishment of DebtOn October 24, 2013, the Company purchased $250 million of its 2015 Notes. The Company acquired the Notes at market value plus a make whole premium based on the terms of the original indenture, which exceeded its carrying value and resulted in a cost of approximately $24 million in the fourth quarter of 2013.On July 15, 2011, the Company purchased $600 million of outstanding notes, comprising $330 million of its 2014 Notes and $270 million of its 2015 Notes. The Company acquired the Notes at market value plus a tender premium, which exceeded the carrying value and resulted in a charge of approximately $72 million in the third quarter of 2011.Investment Income (Loss)The caption “Investment income” in the consolidated statements of income comprises realized and unrealized gains and losses from investments recognized in current earnings. It includes, when applicable, other than temporary declines in the value of debt and available for sale securities and the change in value of the Company's holdings in certain private equity funds, including equity method gains 34(losses) on its investment in the Trident funds. The Company's investments may include direct investments in insurance or consulting companies and investments in private equity funds. The Company recorded gains on its investment in Trident II of $22 million and $35 million in 2013 and 2012, respectively, including $15 million of deferred performance fees recognized in the first quarter of 2013. Trident II has now fully harvested all its portfolio investments and made final distributions to its partners during the fourth quarter of 2013. The Company has now recognized all of the performance fees related to its general partnership interest in Trident II. Investment income for 2013 includes performance fees of $40 million related to the Company's general partnership interest in Trident III which had been deferred, but are no longer subject to claw back. Trident III is a private equity fund created in 2003. Prior to 2013, no Trident III-related investment income had been recognized since 2006, when MMC contributed its limited partnership investment interest to its U.K. pension plan. At December 31, 2013, the Company had deferred performance fees of approximately $38 million related to Trident III. Recognition of these deferred performance fees will only occur as investments are harvested and the performance fees are no longer subject to claw back. Timing of this is unknown and is not controlled by the Company.In 2012, investment income was $24 million compared with $9 million in 2011. This increase was primarily due to higher mark-to-market gains on private equity fund investments, partly offset by an impairment loss on a debt security of $8 million.Income TaxesThe Company's consolidated effective tax rate was 30.1%, 29.0% and 30.1% in 2013, 2012 and 2011, respectively. The tax rate in each year reflects foreign operations which are taxed at rates lower than the U.S. statutory tax rate. The lower effective tax rate attributed to the Company's foreign operations primarily reflects lower corporate tax rates that prevail outside of the U.S., net of the U.S. tax impact from repatriating foreign earnings. In 2013, pre-tax income in the U.K., Canada, Australia, France and Bermuda accounted for approximately 60% of the Company's total non-U.S. pre-tax income, with effective rates in those countries of 21% (excluding the non-cash deferred tax impact of U.K. tax legislation enacted in 2013), 27%, 31%, 42% and 0%, respectively. Under current U.S. tax law, the Company anticipates its non-U.S. operations will continue to incur taxes at rates below the U.S. federal tax rate of 35%. The Company's U.S. revenue over the past three years has been approximately 45% of total revenue, while over that period the pre-tax income from U.S. locations varied from 9% to 21% of total pre-tax income. As a U.S. domiciled parent holding company, Marsh & McLennan Companies, Inc. is the issuer of essentially all of the Company's external indebtedness, and incurs the related interest expense in the U.S. Further, most senior executive and oversight functions are conducted in the U.S. and the associated costs are incurred primarily in the United States.The effective tax rate may vary significantly from period to period for the foreseeable future. It is sensitive to the geographic mix and repatriation of the Company's earnings, which may result in higher or lower tax rates. A proportional increase in U.S. pre-tax income will tend to increase the effective tax rate because U.S. federal and state corporate tax rates exceed tax rates applicable outside the U.S. Losses in certain jurisdictions cannot be offset by earnings from other operations, and may require valuation allowances that affect the rate, depending on estimates of the realizability of associated deferred tax assets. The effective tax rate is also sensitive to changes in unrecognized tax benefits, including the impact of settled tax audits and expired statutes of limitation.The realization of deferred tax assets depends on generating future taxable income during the periods in which the tax benefits are deductible or creditable. The Company and Marsh have been profitable in the U.S. and globally. Tax liabilities are determined and assessed on a legal entity and jurisdictional basis. Certain taxing jurisdictions allow or require combined or consolidated tax filings. The Company assessed the realizability of its domestic deferred tax assets, particularly state deferred tax assets of Marsh relating to jurisdictions in which it files separate tax returns, state deferred tax assets of all of the Company's domestic operations related to jurisdictions in which the Company files a unitary or combined state tax return, and foreign tax credit carry-forwards in the Company's consolidated U.S. federal tax return. When making its assessment about the realization of its domestic deferred tax assets at December 31, 2013, 35the Company considered all available evidence, placing particular weight on evidence that could be objectively verified. The evidence considered included (i) the profitability of the Company's U.S. operations throughout the period 2011 to 2013, (ii) the nature, frequency, and severity of losses incurred before 2011, (iii) profit trends evidenced by continued improvements in the Company's and Marsh's operating performance, (iv) the non-recurring nature of some of the items that contributed to losses before 2011, (v) the carry-forward periods for the net operating losses (""NOLs"") and foreign tax credit carry-forwards, (vi) the sources and timing of future taxable income, giving weight to sources according to the extent to which they can be objectively verified, and (vii) tax planning strategies that would be implemented, if necessary, to accelerate utilization of NOLs. Based on its assessment, the Company concluded that most of these deferred tax assets are realizable and a valuation allowance was recorded to reduce the domestic deferred tax assets to the amount that the Company believes is more likely than not to be realized. In the event sufficient taxable income is not generated in future periods, additional valuation allowances of up to approximately $195 million could be required relating to these domestic deferred tax assets. The realization of the remaining U.S. federal deferred tax assets is not as sensitive to U.S. profits because it is supported by anticipated repatriation of future annual earnings from the Company's profitable global operations, consistent with the Company's historical practice. In addition, when making its assessment about the realization of its domestic deferred tax assets at December 31, 2013, the Company continued to assess the realizability of deferred tax assets of certain other entities with a history of recent losses, including other U.S. entities that file separate state tax returns and foreign subsidiaries, and recorded valuation allowances as appropriate.Changes in tax laws or tax rulings may have a significant adverse impact on our effective tax rate. For example, proposals for fundamental U.S. international tax reform, if enacted, could have a significant adverse impact on the effective tax rate.Liquidity and Capital ResourcesThe Company is organized as a holding company, a legal entity separate and distinct from its operating subsidiaries. As a holding company without significant operations of its own, the Company is dependent upon dividends and other payments from its operating subsidiaries to meet its obligations for paying principal and interest on outstanding debt obligations, for paying dividends to stockholders, for share repurchases and for corporate expenses. Other sources of liquidity include borrowing facilities discussed below in financing cash flows.The Company derives a significant portion of its revenue and operating profit from operating subsidiaries located outside of the United States. Funds from the Company’s operating subsidiaries located outside of the United States are regularly repatriated to the United States out of annual earnings. At December 31, 2013, the Company had approximately $1.4 billion of cash and cash equivalents in its foreign operations, substantially all of which is considered to be permanently invested in those operations to fund foreign investments and working capital needs. At the current time, the Company does not intend to repatriate any of this cash. The non-U.S. cash and cash equivalents considered permanently reinvested includes approximately $190 million of operating funds required to be maintained for regulatory requirements or as collateral under certain captive insurance arrangements. The Company expects to continue its practice of repatriating foreign funds out of current annual earnings. While management does not foresee a need to repatriate the funds which are currently deemed permanently invested, if facts or circumstances change, management could elect to repatriate them, if necessary, which could result in higher effective tax rates in the future.Cash on our consolidated balance sheets includes funds available for general corporate purposes. Funds held on behalf of clients in a fiduciary capacity are segregated and shown separately in the consolidated balance sheets as an offset to fiduciary liabilities. Fiduciary funds cannot be used for general corporate purposes, and should not be considered as a source of liquidity for the Company.Operating Cash FlowsThe Company generated $1.3 billion of cash from operations in both 2013 and 2012. These amounts reflect the net income reported by the Company during those periods, excluding gains or losses from investments, cost of extinguishment of debt and the disposition of businesses, adjusted for non-cash 36charges and changes in working capital which relate, primarily, to the timing of payments for accrued liabilities or receipts of assets. Pension Related ItemsDuring 2013, the Company contributed $26 million to its U.S. pension plans and $620 million to non-U.S. pension plans, which included contributions of $250 million to pre-fund all of the 2014 and a substantial portion of the 2015 deficit funding contributions for the U.K. plans and a discretionary contribution of $70 million to the Canadian plans. In 2012, the Company contributed $124 million to U.S. plans and $389 million to non-U.S. plans, which included $100 million of discretionary contributions to each of the U.S. and the U.K. plans.In the U.S., contributions to the tax-qualified defined benefit plans are based on ERISA guidelines and the Company generally expects to maintain a funded status of 80% or more of the liability determined under the ERISA guidelines. The pension stabilization provisions included in the ""Moving Ahead for Progress in the 21st Century Act"", enacted on July 6, 2012, changed the methodology for determining the discount rate used for calculating plan liabilities under ERISA, which determines, in part, the funding requirements. After considering the impact of the pension funding stabilization provisions discussed above, the Company expects less than $1 million of contributions will be required for its U.S. tax-qualified plan through the end of 2014. The Company also expects to fund approximately $24 million to its non-qualified U.S. pension plans in 2014.The Company has a large number of non-U.S. defined benefit pension plans, the largest of which are in the U.K., which comprise approximately 82% of non-U.S. plan assets. Contribution rates for non-US plans are generally based on local funding practices and statutory requirements, which may differ significantly from measurements under U.S. GAAP. In the U.K., contributions to defined benefit pension plans are determined through a negotiation process between the Company and the plans' Trustee that typically occurs every three years in conjunction with the actuarial valuation of the plans. This process is governed by U.K. pension regulations. The assumptions that result from the funding negotiations are different from those used for U.S. GAAP and currently result in a lower funded status than under U.S. GAAP. The current funding plan was based on assumptions (including interest rates, inflation, salary increases and mortality) that reflected market conditions as of year-end 2009, was agreed to in early 2011 and formed the basis for the Company's aggregate contributions to the U.K. plans for 2011 through 2013. In 2013, the Company made required contributions of $300 million to its non-U.S. defined benefit pension plans, including amounts called for under the U.K. funding plan. Additionally, the Company made a $250 million contribution to pre-fund certain deficit funding contributions for the U.K. plans, described above, and a $70 million discretionary contribution to its Canadian plans. The valuation of the U.K. pension plan at December 31, 2012 that results from the negotiation process described above will determine funding that is expected to become applicable in 2014. Contributions to the U.K. plans typically comprised of a portion related to the current service cost, that is, the benefits earned by employees in the current year, plus an amount intended to reduce, over time, any deficit determined through the Company's negotiations with the Trustee. In the aggregate, the Company expects to fund approximately $160 million to its non-U.S. defined benefit plans in 2014, comprising approximately $90 million to plans outside of the U.K. and $70 million to the U.K. plans. Funding amounts may be influenced by future asset performance, the level of discount rates and other variables impacting the assets and/or liabilities of the plan.After completion of a consultation period with affected colleagues, in January 2014, the Company amended its U.K. defined benefit pension plans, to close those plans to future benefit accruals effective August 1, 2014 and will replace those plans, along with its existing defined contribution plans, with a new, comprehensive defined contribution arrangement. As required under GAAP, the Company re-measured the defined benefit plans’ assets and liabilities at the amendment date, based on assumptions and market conditions at that date. As a result of the re-measurement, the Projected Benefit Obligation (""PBO"") increased by approximately $147 million and the funded status decreased by approximately $137 million. The change in the PBO and in the funded status relates primarily to a decrease in the discount rate at the re-measurement date. The net periodic benefit costs recognized in 2014 will be the weighted average resulting from the December 31, 2013 measurement and the January 2014 re-measurement. The Company will recognize a curtailment gain of $63 million in the first quarter of 2014, primarily resulting 37from the recognition of the remaining prior service credit related to a plan amendment made in December 2012. This gain will be mostly offset by a transition benefit to certain employees most impacted by the amendment. As a result of the amendments to the U.K. plans, the Company expects an increase in contributions to its defined contribution plans of approximately $30 million related to the transfer of colleagues from defined benefit to defined contribution plans, and funding of a portion of the transition benefit.The year-over-year change in the funded status of the Company's pension plans is impacted by the variance between actual and assumed results, particularly with regard to return on assets and changes in the discount rate, as well as the amount of Company contributions, if any. Unrecognized actuarial losses were approximately $1.0 billion and $3.0 billion at December 31, 2013 for the U.S. plans and non-U.S. plans, respectively, compared with $1.9 billion and $3.3 billion at December 31, 2012. The decrease is primarily due to the impact of increases in the discount rates, actual returns on plan assets in 2013 that were higher than the estimated long-term rate of return on plan assets and discretionary contributions to the plans, discussed above. In the past several years, the amount of actuarial losses has been significantly impacted, both positively and negatively, by actual asset performance and changes in discount rates. The discount rate used to measure plan liabilities increased in both the U.S. and the U.K. (the Company's two largest plans) in 2013 after decreasing in each of the four years from 2009 to 2012. At the end of 2009, the weighted average discount rate for all plans was 6.0%, declining to 5.6%, 4.9% and 4.4% at the end of 2010, 2011 and 2012, respectively. In 2013 the weighted average discount rate increased to 4.8%. An increase in the discount rate decreases the measured plan liability, resulting in actuarial gains, while a decrease in the discount rate increases the measured plan liability, resulting in actuarial losses. During 2013, the Company's defined benefit pension plan assets had actual returns of 12.6% and 8.6% in the U.S. and U.K., respectively. During 2012, the Company's defined benefit pension plan assets had actual returns of 14.1%, and 9.8% in the U.S. and U.K., respectively; and in 2011, the actual returns were 5.8% in the U.S. and 4.8% in the U.K. In 2012 and 2010, actuarial losses resulting from declines in the discount rate were partly offset by actual asset returns which exceeded the assumed rates of return in each year. In 2011, both the decline in the discount rate and actual asset returns that were lower than the assumed rates of return contributed to the actuarial losses.Overall, based on the measurement at December 31, 2013, the Company’s pension expense was expected to decrease in 2014 by approximately $128 million, partly offset by compensation considerations. Approximately 85% of this decrease relates to the U.S. plans. The decrease in the expected U.S. pension expense results primarily from an increase in the discount rates used to measure U.S. plan liabilities along with the impact of an increase in plan assets at the end of 2013 resulting from investment returns. The remainder of the decrease relates to plans outside of the U.S. resulting from a modest increase in the discount rate and an increase in plan assets resulting from both asset performance and contributions. As a result of the plan remeasurement to reflect the amendments to the U.K. plans, described above, an incremental decrease of approximately $31 million for defined benefit pension expense is expected for 2014, primarily resulting from the elimination of the service cost component, effective August 1, 2014. However, the decrease in the defined benefit pension cost resulting from the amendment will be largely offset by increased cost for the new defined contribution plan which will replace the existing defined benefit plans in the U.K.The Company’s accounting policies for its defined benefit pension plans, including the selection of and sensitivity to assumptions, are discussed below under Management’s Discussion of Critical Accounting Policies. For additional information regarding the Company’s retirement plans, see Note 8 to the consolidated financial statements.OtherThe Company received $322 million in cash refunds of U.S. federal income taxes during the second quarter of 2011, comprising $212 million from carrying back the net capital loss incurred in 2010 from the sale of Kroll and various other assets, and $110 million from the cash settlement of the IRS audit for the periods 2006 through 2008. The audit settlement primarily reflected the allowance of carry back claims 38for net operating losses and excess foreign tax credits arising in 2008. The impact on the tax provision of these events was reflected in prior periods and did not impact income tax expense reported in 2011.Financing Cash FlowsNet cash used for financing activities was $834 million in 2013 compared with $633 million of net cash used for financing activities in 2012. The Company increased outstanding debt by approximately $37 million in 2013 while outstanding debt decreased by $10 million and $100 million in 2012 and 2011, respectively.DebtIn September 2013, the Company issued $250 million of 2.55% five-year senior notes and $250 million of 4.05% ten-year senior notes. The net proceeds of this offering were used for general corporate purposes, which included a partial redemption of $250 million of the outstanding principal amount of the existing 5.75% senior notes due 2015. The redemption settled in October 2013 with a total cash outflow of approximately $275 million, including a $24 million cost for early redemption based on the terms of the original indenture.During the first quarter of 2013, the Company used cash to repay its 4.85% fixed rate $250 million senior notes that matured. During the first quarter of 2012, the Company repaid its 6.25% fixed rate $250 million senior notes that matured. The Company used proceeds from the issuance of 2.3% five-year $250 million senior notes in the first quarter to repay the maturing notes.On July 15, 2011, the Company purchased $600 million of outstanding notes comprising $330 million of its 2014 Notes and $270 million of its 2015 Notes (collectively, the ""Notes""). The Company acquired the Notes at fair value plus a tender premium, which exceeded its carrying value. A cost of approximately $72 million was recorded in the Consolidated Statements of Income in the third quarter of 2011 related to the extinguishment of this debt.The Company used proceeds from the issuance of 4.80% ten-year $500 million senior notes in the third quarter of 2011 and cash on hand to purchase the Notes.AcquisitionsDuring 2013, the Company paid $17 million of contingent payments related to acquisitions made in prior years. These payments are split between financing and operating cash flows in the consolidated statements of cash flows. The portion of these payments that are reflected as a financing activity is $9 million, which represents payments related to the contingent consideration liability that was recorded on the date of acquisition. Any payments made related to increases in the contingent consideration liability subsequent to the date of acquisition are reflected as operating cash flows, which in 2013 was $8 million. Remaining estimated future contingent consideration payments of $104 million for acquisitions completed in 2013 and in prior years are recorded in accounts payable and accrued liabilities or other liabilities in the consolidated balance sheet at December 31, 2013. During 2012, the Company paid $30 million of contingent payments related to acquisitions made in prior periods.In the second quarter of 2011, the Company acquired the remaining minority interest of a previously majority-owned entity for total cash consideration of $8 million.In the first quarter of 2011, the Company paid deferred purchase consideration of $13 million related to the purchase in 2009 of the minority interest of a previously controlled entity. 39Credit FacilitiesThe Company and certain of its subsidiaries maintain a $1.0 billion multi-currency five-year unsecured revolving credit facility. The interest rate on this facility is based on LIBOR plus an agreed fixed margin which varies with the Company's credit ratings. This facility requires the Company to maintain certain coverage and leverage ratios which are tested quarterly. There were no borrowings under this facility at December 31, 2013.In December 2012, the Company closed on a $50 million, 3-year delayed draw term loan facility. The interest rate on this facility is based on LIBOR plus an agreed fixed margin which varies with the Company's credit ratings. The facility requires the Company to maintain coverage ratios and leverage ratios consistent with the revolving credit facility discussed above. The Company had $50 million of borrowings under this facility at December 31, 2013. The Company’s senior debt is currently rated Baa2 by Moody’s and A- by Standard & Poor’s. The Company’s short-term debt is currently rated P-2 by Moody’s and A-2 by Standard & Poor’s. The Company carries a positive outlook from Moody’s and a stable outlook from Standard & Poor’s.The Company also maintains other credit facilities, guarantees and letters of credit with various banks, primarily related to operations located outside the United States, aggregating $282 million at December 31, 2013 and $247 million at December 31, 2012. There was $1 million outstanding borrowings under these facilities at December 31, 2013 and no outstanding borrowings under these facilities at December 31, 2012.Share RepurchasesIn May 2013, the Board of Directors of the Company authorized share repurchases of up to $1 billion of the Company's common stock. During 2013, the Company repurchased 13.2 million shares of its common stock for total consideration of $550 million at an average price per share of $41.76. The Company remains authorized to purchase additional shares of its common stock up to a value of approximately $563 million. There is no time limit on this authorization. During 2012, the Company repurchased approximately 6.9 million shares of its common stock for total consideration of $230 million at an average price per share of $33.36.DividendsThe Company paid total dividends of $533 million in 2013 ($0.96 per share), $497 million in 2012 ($0.90 per share) and $480 million in 2011 ($0.86 per share).Investing Cash FlowsNet cash used for investing activities amounted to $446 million in 2013 compared with $583 million used for investing activities in 2012. The Company made eight acquisitions in 2013. Cash used for these acquisitions, net of cash acquired was $125 million. In addition, in 2013, the Company paid $15 million of deferred purchase consideration related to acquisitions made in prior years and $2 million for the purchase of other intangible assets. Remaining deferred cash payments of approximately $44 million for acquisitions completed in 2013 and in prior years are recorded in accounts payable and accrued liabilities or other liabilities in the consolidated balance sheet at December 31, 2013. The Company made 15 acquisitions in 2012. Cash used for these acquisitions, net of cash acquired was $230 million. In addition, in 2012, the Company paid $59 million of deferred purchase consideration related to acquisitions made in prior years and $3 million for the purchase of other intangible assets. The Company received proceeds from distributions on its Investment in Trident II of $100 million, $35 million and $61 million in 2013, 2012 and 2011, respectively. Trident II has now fully harvested all its portfolio investments and final distributions were made to partners during the fourth quarter of 2013. The Company’s additions to fixed assets and capitalized software, which amounted to $401 million in 2013 and $320 million in 2012, primarily relate to computer equipment purchases, the refurbishing and modernizing of office facilities and software development costs. The Company has commitments for potential future investments of approximately $25 million in two private equity funds that invest primarily in financial services companies. 40Commitments and ObligationsThe following sets forth the Company’s future contractual obligations by the types identified in the table below as of December 31, 2013: Payment due by PeriodContractual Obligations(In millions of dollars)Total Within1 Year 1-3Years 4-5Years After 5YearsCurrent portion of long-term debt$331 $331 $— $— $—Long-term debt2,634 — 302 524 1,808Interest on long-term debt1,257 156 261 235 605Net operating leases2,380 346 584 435 1,015Service agreements676 285 221 140 30Other long-term obligations190 83 97 8 2Purchase commitments35 20 15 — —Total$7,503 $1,221 $1,480 $1,342 $3,460The above does not include the liability for unrecognized tax benefits of $128 million as the Company is unable to reasonably predict the timing of settlement of these liabilities, other than approximately $7 million that may become payable during 2014. The above does not include the indemnified liabilities discussed in Note 15 as the Company is unable to reasonably predict the timing of settlement of these liabilities. The above does not include net pension liabilities of approximately $900 million because the timing and amount of ultimate payment of such liability is dependent upon future events, including, but not limited to, future returns on plan assets, and changes in the discount rate used to measure the liabilities. The amounts of estimated future benefits payments to be made from plan assets are disclosed in Note 8 to the consolidated financial statements. In 2014, the Company expects to contribute approximately $25 million and $160 million to its U.S. and non-U.S. pension plans, respectively. Management’s Discussion of Critical Accounting PoliciesThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (“GAAP”) requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue and expenses, and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. Management considers the policies discussed below to be critical to understanding the Company’s financial statements because their application places the most significant demands on management’s judgment, and requires management to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain. Actual results may differ from those estimates.Legal and Other Loss ContingenciesThe Company and its subsidiaries are subject to numerous claims, lawsuits and proceedings including claims for errors and omissions. GAAP requires that a liability be recorded when a loss is both probable and reasonably estimable. Significant management judgment is required to apply this guidance. The Company utilizes case level reviews by inside and outside counsel, an internal actuarial analysis and other analyses to estimate potential losses. The liability is reviewed quarterly and adjusted as developments warrant. In many cases, the Company has not recorded a liability, other than for legal fees to defend the claim, because we are unable, at the present time, to make a determination that a loss is both probable and reasonably estimable. Given the unpredictability of E&O claims and of litigation that could flow from them, it is possible that an adverse outcome in a particular matter could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s businesses, results of operations, financial condition or cash flow in a given quarterly or annual period.In addition, to the extent that insurance coverage is available, significant management judgment is required to determine the amount of recoveries that are probable of collection under the Company’s various insurance programs.41Retirement BenefitsThe Company maintains qualified and non-qualified defined benefit pension and defined contribution plans for its eligible U.S. employees and a variety of defined benefit and defined contribution plans for its eligible non-U.S. employees. The Company’s policy for funding its tax qualified defined benefit retirement plans is to contribute amounts at least sufficient to meet the funding requirements set forth in U.S. and applicable foreign laws.The Company recognizes the funded status of its over-funded defined benefit pension and retiree medical plans as a net benefit plan asset and its unfunded and underfunded plans as a net benefit plan liability. The gains or losses and prior service costs or credits that have not been recognized as components of net periodic costs are recorded as a component of Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income (“AOCI”), net of tax, in the Company’s consolidated balance sheets. The gains and losses that exceed specified corridors are amortized prospectively out of AOCI over a period that approximates the average remaining service period of active employees, or for plans in which substantially all the participants are inactive, over the remaining life expectancy of the inactive employees. The determination of net periodic pension cost is based on a number of assumptions, including an expected long-term rate of return on plan assets, the discount rate, mortality and assumed rate of salary increase. Significant assumptions used in the calculation of net periodic pension costs and pension liabilities are disclosed in Note 8 to the consolidated financial statements. The Company believes the assumptions for each plan are reasonable and appropriate and will continue to evaluate assumptions at least annually and adjust them as appropriate. Based on its current assumptions, the Company expects pension expense in 2014 to decrease approximately $128 million compared with 2013, partly offset by compensation considerations.Future pension expense or credits will depend on plan provisions, future investment performance, future assumptions and various other factors related to the populations participating in the pension plans. Holding all other assumptions constant, a half-percentage point change in the rate of return on plan assets and discount rate assumptions would affect net periodic pension cost for the U.S. and U.K. plans, which together comprise approximately 86% of total pension plan liabilities, as follows: 0.5 PercentagePoint Increase 0.5 PercentagePoint Decrease(In millions of dollars)U.S. U.K. U.S. U.K.Assumed Rate of Return on Plan Assets$(19) $(37) $19 $37Discount Rate$(38) $(28) $39 $29Changing the discount rate and leaving the other assumptions constant may not be representative of the impact on expense, because the long-term rates of inflation and salary increases are often correlated with the discount rate. Changes in these assumptions will not necessarily have a linear impact on the net periodic pension cost.The Company contributes to certain health care and life insurance benefits provided to its retired employees. The cost of these post-retirement benefits for employees in the U.S. is accrued during the period up to the date employees are eligible to retire, but is funded by the Company as incurred. The key assumptions and sensitivity to changes in the assumed health care cost trend rate are discussed in Note 8 to the consolidated financial statements.Income TaxesThe Company's tax rate reflects its income, statutory tax rates and tax planning in the various jurisdictions in which it operates. Significant judgment is required in determining the annual effective tax rate and in evaluating uncertain tax positions. The Company reports a liability for unrecognized tax benefits resulting from uncertain tax positions taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. The evaluation of a tax position is a two-step process. The first step involves recognition. The Company determines whether it is more likely than not that a tax position will be sustained upon tax examination, including resolution of any related appeals or litigation, based on only the technical merits of the position. The technical merits of a tax position derive from both statutory and judicial authority (legislation and statutes, legislative intent, 42regulations, rulings, and case law) and their applicability to the facts and circumstances of the tax position. If a tax position does not meet the more likely than not recognition threshold, the benefit of that position is not recognized in the financial statements. The second step is measurement. A tax position that meets the more likely than not recognition threshold is measured to determine the amount of benefit to recognize in the financial statements. The tax position is measured as the largest amount of benefit that is greater than 50 percent likely of being realized upon ultimate resolution with a taxing authority.Uncertain tax positions are evaluated based upon the facts and circumstances that exist at each reporting period and involve significant management judgment. Subsequent changes in judgment based upon new information may lead to changes in recognition, derecognition, and measurement. Adjustments may result, for example, upon resolution of an issue with the taxing authorities, or expiration of a statute of limitations barring an assessment for an issue.Tax law requires items be included in the Company's tax returns at different times than the items are reflected in the financial statements. As a result, the annual tax expense reflected in the consolidated statements of income is different than that reported in the tax returns. Some of these differences are permanent, such as expenses that are not deductible in the returns, and some differences are temporary and reverse over time, such as depreciation expense. Temporary differences create deferred tax assets and liabilities. Deferred tax liabilities generally represent tax expense recognized in the financial statements for which payment has been deferred, or expense for which a deduction has been taken already in the tax return but the expense has not yet been recognized in the financial statements. Deferred tax assets generally represent items that can be used as a tax deduction or credit in tax returns in future years for which a benefit has already been recorded in the financial statements. In assessing the need for and amount of a valuation allowance for deferred tax assets, the Company considers whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized and adjusts the valuation allowance accordingly. The Company evaluates all significant available positive and negative evidence, including the existence of losses in recent years and its forecast of future taxable income by jurisdiction, in assessing the need for a valuation allowance. The Company also considers tax-planning strategies that would result in realization of deferred tax assets, and the presence of taxable income in prior period tax filings in jurisdictions that allow for the carryback of tax attributes pursuant to the applicable tax law. The underlying assumptions the Company uses in forecasting future taxable income require significant judgment and take into account the Company's recent performance. The ultimate realization of deferred tax assets is dependent on the generation of future taxable income during the periods in which temporary differences or carry-forwards are deductible or creditable. Valuation allowances are established for deferred tax assets when it is estimated that it is more likely than not that future taxable income will be insufficient to fully use a deduction or credit in that jurisdiction.Fair Value DeterminationsGoodwill Impairment Testing—The Company is required to assess goodwill and any indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment annually, or more frequently if circumstances indicate impairment may have occurred. The Company performs the annual impairment test for each of its reporting units during the third quarter of each year. In 2013, the Company elected to not use the option to perform a qualitative assessment to determine if a step 1 impairment test was necessary and instead elected to perform a step 1 impairment test. Fair values of the reporting units are estimated using either a market approach or discounted cash flow model. This fair value determination was categorized as Level 3 in the fair value hierarchy. Carrying values for the reporting units are based on balances at the prior quarter end and include directly identified assets and liabilities as well as an allocation of those assets and liabilities not recorded at the reporting unit level. The Company completed its 2013 annual review in the third quarter and concluded goodwill was not impaired, as the fair value of each reporting unit exceeded its carrying value by a substantial margin.Share-based PaymentThe guidance for accounting for share-based payments requires, among other things, that the estimated fair value of stock options be charged to earnings. Significant management judgment is required to determine the appropriate assumptions for inputs such as volatility and expected term necessary to estimate option values. In addition, management judgment is required to analyze the terms of the plans 43and awards granted thereunder to determine if awards will be treated as equity awards or liability awards, as defined by the accounting guidance.As of December 31, 2013, there was $17 million of unrecognized compensation cost related to stock option awards. The weighted-average periods over which the costs are expected to be recognized is 1.2 years. Also as of December 31, 2013, there was $74 million of unrecognized compensation cost related to the Company’s restricted stock, restricted stock unit and deferred stock unit awards. The weighted-average period over which that cost is expected to be recognized is approximately one year.See Note 9 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding accounting for share-based payments.New Accounting PronouncementsNote 1 to the consolidated financial statements contains a summary of the Company’s significant accounting policies, including a discussion of recently issued accounting pronouncements and their impact or potential future impact on the Company’s financial results, if determinable, under the sub-heading ""New Accounting Pronouncements"".44Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market RiskMarket Risk and Credit RiskCertain of the Company’s revenues, expenses, assets and liabilities are exposed to the impact of interest rate changes and fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates and equity markets.Interest Rate Risk and Credit RiskThe Company has historically managed its net exposure to interest rate changes by utilizing a mixture of variable and fixed rate borrowings to finance the Company’s asset base. In February 2011, the Company entered into two 3.5-year interest rate swaps to hedge changes in the fair value of the first $250 million of its 5.375% senior notes due in 2014. Under the terms of the swaps, the counter-parties will pay the Company a fixed rate of 5.375% and the Company will pay interest at a floating rate of three-month LIBOR plus a fixed spread of 3.726%. The swaps are designated as fair value hedging instruments and are deemed to be perfectly effective in accordance with applicable accounting guidance.Interest income generated from the Company’s cash investments as well as invested fiduciary funds will vary with the general level of interest rates.The Company had the following investments subject to variable interest rates: (In millions of dollars)December 31, 2013Cash and cash equivalents invested in money market funds, certificates of deposit and time deposits$2,303Fiduciary cash and investments$4,234Based on the above balances, if short-term interest rates increased or decreased by 10%, or 8 basis points, over the course of the year, annual interest income, including interest earned on fiduciary funds, would increase or decrease by approximately $3 million.In addition to interest rate risk, our cash investments and fiduciary fund investments are subject to potential loss of value due to counter-party credit risk. To minimize this risk, the Company and its subsidiaries invest pursuant to a Board approved investment policy. The policy mandates the preservation of principal and liquidity and requires broad diversification with counter-party limits assigned based primarily on credit rating and type of investment. The Company carefully monitors its cash and fiduciary fund investments and will further restrict the portfolio as appropriate to market conditions. The majority of cash and fiduciary fund investments are invested in short-term bank deposits and liquid money market funds.Foreign Currency RiskThe translated values of revenue and expense from the Company’s international operations are subject to fluctuations due to changes in currency exchange rates. The non-U.S. based revenue that is exposed to foreign exchange fluctuations is approximately 55% of total revenue. We periodically use forward contracts and options to limit foreign currency exchange rate exposure on net income and cash flows for specific, clearly defined transactions arising in the ordinary course of business. Although the Company has significant revenue generated in foreign locations which is subject to foreign exchange rate fluctuations, in most cases both the foreign currency revenue and expenses are in the functional currency of the foreign location. As such, the U.S. dollar translation of both the revenues and expenses, as well as the potentially offsetting movements of various currencies against the U.S. dollar, generally tends to mitigate the impact on net operating income of foreign currency risk. The Company estimates that a 10% movement of major foreign currencies (Euro, Sterling, Australian dollar and Canadian dollar) in the same direction against the U.S. dollar that held constant over the course of the year would increase or decrease full year operating income by approximately $47 million.45Equity Price RiskThe Company holds investments in both public and private companies as well as private equity funds that invest primarily in financial services companies. Publicly traded investments of $18 million are classified as available for sale. Non-publicly traded investments of $14 million are accounted for using the cost method and $89 million are accounted for using the equity method. The investments that are classified as available for sale or that are not publicly traded are subject to risk of changes in market value, which if determined to be other than temporary, could result in realized impairment losses. The Company periodically reviews the carrying value of such investments to determine if any valuation adjustments are appropriate under the applicable accounting pronouncements.OtherA number of lawsuits and regulatory proceedings are pending.

Similarly, the revenue impact of acquisitions and dispositions may impact period-to-period comparisons of revenue. Underlying revenue measures the change in revenue from one period to another by isolating these impacts. The impact of foreign currency exchange fluctuations, acquisitions and dispositions, including transfers among businesses, on the Company’s operating revenues is as follows: Year EndedDecember 31, Components of Revenue Change*(In millions, except percentage figures)2014 2013 % Change GAAPRevenue CurrencyImpact Acquisitions/DispositionsImpact UnderlyingRevenueRisk and Insurance Services Marsh$5,753 $5,438 6% (1)% 3% 4%Guy Carpenter1,154 1,131 2% — 1% 2%Subtotal6,907 6,569 5% (1)% 3% 4%Fiduciary Interest Income24 27 Total Risk and Insurance Services6,931 6,596 5% (1)% 3% 3%Consulting Mercer4,350 4,241 3% (1)% — 3%Oliver Wyman Group1,709 1,460 17% — 2% 15%Total Consulting6,059 5,701 6% (1)% — 6%Corporate/Eliminations(39) (36) Total Revenue$12,951 $12,261 6% (1)% 2% 5%*Components of revenue change may not add due to rounding.The following table provides more detailed revenue information for certain of the components presented above: Year EndedDecember 31, Components of Revenue Change*(In millions, except percentage figures)2014 2013 % Change GAAPRevenue CurrencyImpact Acquisitions/DispositionsImpact UnderlyingRevenueMarsh: EMEA$1,980 $1,902 4 % — 1% 3 %Asia Pacific683 659 4 % (4)% — 7 %Latin America413 392 5 % (10)% 6% 10 %Total International3,076 2,953 4 % (2)% 1% 5 %U.S. / Canada2,677 2,485 8 % (1)% 6% 3 %Total Marsh$5,753 $5,438 6 % (1)% 3% 4 %Mercer: Health$1,553 $1,511 3 % (1)% — 3 %Retirement1,375 1,344 2 % — — 2 %Investments836 780 7 % (3)% 1% 9 %Talent586 606 (3)% (2)% — (1)%Total Mercer$4,350 $4,241 3 % (1)% — 3 %Underlying revenue measures the change in revenue using consistent currency exchange rates, excluding the impact of certain items that affect comparability such as: acquisitions, dispositions and transfers among businesses.*Components of revenue change may not add due to rounding.28 Year EndedDecember 31, Components of Revenue Change*(In millions, except percentage figures)2013 2012 % Change GAAPRevenue CurrencyImpact Acquisitions/DispositionsImpact UnderlyingRevenueRisk and Insurance Services Marsh$5,438 $5,232 4% (1)% 2% 3 %Guy Carpenter1,131 1,079 5% (1)% 1% 5 %Subtotal6,569 6,311 4% (1)% 2% 4 %Fiduciary Interest Income27 39 Total Risk and Insurance Services6,596 6,350 4% (1)% 2% 3 %Consulting Mercer4,241 4,147 2% (1)% — 4 %Oliver Wyman Group1,460 1,466 — 1 % — (1)%Total Consulting5,701 5,613 2% (1)% — 2 %Corporate /Eliminations(36) (39) Total Revenue$12,261 $11,924 3% (1)% 1% 3 %The following table provides more detailed revenue information for certain of the components presented above: Year EndedDecember 31, Components of Revenue Change*(In millions, except percentage figures) 2013 2012 % Change GAAPRevenue CurrencyImpact Acquisitions/DispositionsImpact UnderlyingRevenueMarsh: EMEA $1,902 $1,860 2 % — — 3 %Asia Pacific 659 656 — (5)% — 5 %Latin America 392 353 11 % (9)% 7 % 13 %Total International 2,953 2,869 3 % (2)% 1 % 4 %U.S. / Canada 2,485 2,363 5 % — 4 % 2 %Total Marsh $5,438 $5,232 4 % (1)% 2 % 3 %Mercer: Health $1,511 $1,412 7 % — 1 % 6 %Retirement 1,344 1,396 (4)% — (4)% 1 %Investments 780 735 6 % (3)% 1 % 9 %Talent 606 604 — (2)% 4 % (1)%Total Mercer $4,241 $4,147 2 % (1)% — 4 %Underlying revenue measures the change in revenue using consistent currency exchange rates, excluding the impact of certain items that affect comparability such as: acquisitions, dispositions and transfers among businesses.*Components of revenue change may not add due to rounding.RevenueConsolidated revenue of $13 billion in 2014 increased 6%, or 5% on an underlying basis, compared with $12.3 billion in 2013. Revenue in the Risk and Insurance Services segment increased 5% in 2014 compared with 2013, or 3% on an underlying basis, with underlying revenue growth of 4% at Marsh and 2% at Guy Carpenter. The Consulting segment's revenue increased 6% on both a reported and underlying basis. On an underlying basis, Mercer's revenue was up 3% in 2014 compared with 2013, while revenue of the Oliver Wyman Group increased 15%. 29Consolidated revenue for 2013 increased 3% on both a reported and underlying basis to $12.3 billion compared with $11.9 billion in 2012. Revenue in the Risk and Insurance Services segment increased 4% in 2013 compared with 2012, or 3% on an underlying basis, with underlying revenue growth of 3% at Marsh and 5% at Guy Carpenter. The Consulting segment's revenue increased 2% on both a reported and underlying basis. On an underlying basis, Mercer's revenue was up 4% in 2013 compared with 2012, while the Oliver Wyman Group decreased 1%. Operating ExpenseConsolidated operating expenses increased 5% in 2014 compared with the same period in 2013 on a reported basis and 4% on an underlying basis. The increase in underlying expenses primarily reflects higher incentive compensation, facilities and software amortization costs, partly offset by lower pension costs. Consolidated operating expenses increased 1% in 2013 compared with the same period in 2012 on both a reported and underlying basis. The increase in underlying expenses primarily reflects higher incentive compensation and pension costs, partly offset by lower costs related to professional indemnity claims.Risk and Insurance ServicesIn the Risk and Insurance Services segment, the Company’s subsidiaries and other affiliated entities act as brokers, agents or consultants for insureds, insurance underwriters and other brokers in the areas of risk management, insurance broking and insurance program management services, primarily under the name of Marsh; and engage in reinsurance broking, catastrophe and financial modeling services and related advisory functions, primarily under the name of Guy Carpenter.Marsh and Guy Carpenter are compensated for brokerage and consulting services primarily through fees paid by clients and/or commissions paid out of premiums charged by insurance and reinsurance companies. Commission rates vary in amount depending upon the type of insurance or reinsurance coverage provided, the particular insurer or reinsurer, the capacity in which the broker acts and negotiations with clients. Revenues can be affected by premium rate levels in the insurance/reinsurance markets, the amount of risk retained by insurance and reinsurance clients themselves and by the value of the risks that have been insured since commission based compensation is frequently related to the premiums paid by insureds/reinsureds. In many cases, fee compensation may be negotiated in advance, based on the type of risk, coverage required, and service provided by the Company and ultimately placed into the insurance market or retained by the client. The trends and comparisons of revenue from one period to the next can be affected by changes in premium rate levels, fluctuations in client risk retention, and increases or decreases in the value of risks that have been insured, as well as new and lost business, and the volume of business from new and existing clients. Marsh also receives compensation from insurance companies. This compensation includes, among other things, payment for consulting and analytics services provided to insurers; administrative and other services provided to or on behalf of insurers (including services relating to the administration and management of quota shares, panels and other facilities in which insurers participate); and contingent commissions in parts of its operations. Marsh and Guy Carpenter receive interest income on certain funds (such as premiums and claims proceeds) held in a fiduciary capacity for others. The investment of fiduciary funds is regulated by state and other insurance authorities. These regulations typically provide for segregation of fiduciary funds and limit the types of investments that may be made with them. Interest income from these investments varies depending on the amount of funds invested and applicable interest rates, both of which vary from time to time. For presentation purposes, fiduciary interest is segregated from the other revenues of Marsh and Guy Carpenter and separately presented within the segment, as shown in the revenue by segments charts earlier in this MD&A.30The results of operations for the Risk and Insurance Services segment are presented below: (In millions of dollars)2014 2013 2012Revenue$6,931 $6,596 $6,350Compensation and Benefits3,781 3,618 3,502Other Operating Expenses1,641 1,557 1,514Operating Expenses5,422 5,175 5,016Operating Income$1,509 $1,421 $1,334Operating Income Margin21.8% 21.5% 21.0%RevenueRevenue in the Risk and Insurance Services segment increased 5%, or 3% on an underlying basis, in 2014 compared with 2013. In Marsh, revenue grew to $5.8 billion or 6% in 2014 as compared to 2013, reflecting a 4% increase on an underlying basis and a 3% increase from acquisitions, partly offset by a 1% decrease resulting from the impact of foreign currency translation. The underlying revenue increase reflects growth in all major geographies driven by strong new business, particularly in countries such as the U.S., Canada, and the U.K., as well as in Africa. International operations had underlying revenue growth of 5% reflecting increases of 10% in Latin America, 7% in Asia Pacific and 3% in EMEA, while U.S. / Canada increased 3%.

In Marsh, revenue grew to $5.4 billion in 2013, an increase of 4% from the prior year, reflecting 3% growth in underlying revenue and a 2% increase from acquisitions, partly offset by a 1% decrease resulting from the impact of foreign currency translation. The underlying revenue increase of 3% reflects growth in all major geographies which was driven by increased new business.

The increase in expenses on an underlying basis is primarily due to higher base salaries, incentive compensation, facilities and intangible asset amortization expenses, partly offset by lower pension costs.Expenses in the Risk and Insurance Services segment increased 3% on both a reported and underlying basis in 2013 compared with 2012. The increase in expenses on an underlying basis is primarily due to higher base salaries, pension costs and adjustments to acquisition-related contingent consideration liabilities, partly offset by lower costs related to professional indemnity claims.ConsultingThe Company conducts business in its Consulting segment through two main business groups. Mercer provides consulting expertise, advice, services and solutions in the areas of health, retirement, talent and investments. Oliver Wyman Group provides specialized management, economic and brand consulting services.The major component of revenue in the Consulting business is fees paid by clients for advice and services. Mercer, principally through its health line of business, also earns revenue in the form of commissions received from insurance companies for the placement of group (and occasionally individual) insurance contracts, primarily life, health and accident coverages. Revenue for Mercer’s delegated investment management business and certain of Mercer’s defined contribution administration services consists principally of fees based on assets under management and/or administration.32Revenue in the Consulting segment is affected by, among other things, global economic conditions, including changes in clients’ particular industries and markets. Revenue is also affected by competition due to the introduction of new products and services, broad trends in employee demographics, including levels of employment, the effect of government policies and regulations, and fluctuations in interest and foreign exchange rates. Revenues from the provision of investment management services and retirement trust and administrative services are significantly affected by the level of assets under management and securities market performance. Reimbursable expenses incurred by professional staff in the generation of revenue and sub-advisory fees incurred by the majority of funds are included on a gross basis in the investment management business in revenue and the related expenses are included in other operating expenses.The results of operations for the Consulting segment are presented below: (In millions of dollars)2014 2013 2012Revenue$6,059 $5,701 $5,613Compensation and Benefits3,398 3,269 3,298Other Operating Expenses1,665 1,587 1,623Operating Expenses5,063 4,856 4,921Operating Income$996 $845 $692Operating Income Margin16.4% 14.8% 12.3%RevenueConsulting revenue in 2014 increased 6% on both a reported and underlying basis as compared to 2013. Mercer’s revenue was $4.4 billion in 2014, an increase of 3% on both a reported and underlying basis, partly offset by a 1% decrease due to the impact of foreign currency translation. The underlying revenue growth reflects an increase in Investments of 9%, Health of 3% and Retirement of 2%, partly offset by a decrease in Talent of 1%. Oliver Wyman’s revenue increased 17% in 2014 compared to 2013, or 15% on an underlying basis, as all industry sectors contributed to this growth. On a geographic basis, the revenue growth was attributable to both North America and Europe.The Consulting segment completed six acquisitions during 2014.•February - Mercer acquired Transition Assist, a retiree exchange specializing in helping retirees in employer-sponsored plans select Medicare supplemental health care insurance.•September - Oliver Wyman acquired Bonfire Communications, an agency specializing in employee engagement and internal communications based in San Francisco, California.•November - Mercer acquired AUSREM, a remuneration research and workforce consulting specialist based in Australia, and Jeitosa Group International, a global HR business consultancy and IT systems integration firm.•December - Mercer acquired Denarius, a compensation and benefits survey and information products consulting firm based in Chile, and Oliver Wyman acquired OC&C Strategy Consultants (Boston) LLC (part of the OC&C network) a Boston-based consulting firm specializing in the business media, information services and education sectors. During 2014, Mercer acquired a 34% stake in South Africa-based Alexander Forbes Group Holding Limited (“Alexander Forbes”) becoming a strategic shareholder after Alexander Forbes successfully launched an initial public offering. The Company’s investment in Alexander Forbes is accounted for using the equity method of accounting and is included in other assets in the consolidated balance sheet. Consulting revenue in 2013 increased 2% compared with 2012 on both a reported and underlying basis. Mercer’s revenue was $4.2 billion in 2013, an increase of 2% reflecting a 4% increase in underlying revenue, partly offset by a 1% decrease due to the impact of foreign currency translation. The underlying revenue growth was primarily driven by Health and Investments, which increased 6% and 9%, respectively. Oliver Wyman’s revenue was flat in 2013 compared to 2012, as a 1% decrease in underlying revenue was offset by a 1% increase due to the impact of foreign currency translation. 33The Consulting segment completed two acquisitions during 2013.•July - Oliver Wyman acquired Corven, a U.K.-based management consultancy firm.•August - Mercer acquired Global Remuneration Solutions, a market leading compensation consulting firm based in South Africa.ExpenseConsulting expenses in 2014 increased 4% on both a reported and underlying basis compared to 2013. This increase reflects the impact of higher incentive compensation costs, partly offset by lower pension costs.Consulting expenses in 2013 decreased 1% on both a reported and underlying basis compared to 2012. This decrease reflects the impact of lower restructuring costs and continued strong expense control.Corporate and OtherCorporate expenses in 2014 were $204 million compared to $190 million in 2013. The increase is primarily due to corporate initiatives, which include strengthening cyber security protections, expenses related to strategic investments and corporate transformation efforts, primarily within the HR and Finance functions. Corporate expenses in 2013 were $190 million compared to $203 million in 2012. The decrease is primarily due to lower amortization of equity awards and lower severance, partially offset by higher pension expense. Discontinued OperationsAs part of the disposal transactions for Putnam and Kroll, the Company provided certain indemnities, primarily related to pre-transaction tax uncertainties and legal contingencies. In accordance with applicable accounting guidance, liabilities were established related to these indemnities at the time of the sales and reflected as a reduction of the gain on disposal. Discontinued operations includes charges or credits resulting from the settlement or resolution of the indemnified matters, as well as adjustments to the liabilities related to such matters. On December 31, 2014, an agreement was reached between Putnam and the Massachusetts Department of Revenue (""DOR"") regarding a tax dispute, which was covered under the indemnity agreement discussed above. The December 2014 agreement was subject to certain approvals, which included the State Attorney General and the Commissioner of the DOR. In January 2015, all necessary approvals were received, the agreement was executed and the tax was paid. Concurrently, Putnam and the Company executed a settlement agreement to resolve all remaining matters under the indemnity agreement. The Company recorded a gain, net of federal tax, of approximately $28 million in 2014 related to the settlement with Putnam. Discontinued operations in 2013 includes estimated costs covered under the indemnity related to the Kroll sale as well as tax indemnities related to the Putnam sale. Summarized Statements of Income data for discontinued operations are as follows:For the Years Ended December 31,(In millions of dollars, except per share figures)2014 2013 2012Income (loss) from discontinued operations, net of tax$— $— $—Disposals of discontinued operations 42 (4) (2)Income tax (credit) expense 16 (10) 1Disposals of discontinued operations, net of tax26 6 (3)Discontinued operations, net of tax$26 $6 $(3)Discontinued operations, net of tax per share —Basic$0.05 $0.01 $——Diluted$0.04 $0.01 $—34Other Corporate ItemsInterestInterest income earned on corporate funds amounted to $21 million in 2014 compared with $18 million in 2013. The increase in interest income is due to a higher level of invested funds, partly offset by lower effective interest rates. Interest expense was $165 million in 2014 compared with $167 million in 2013. Interest income earned on corporate funds amounted to $18 million in 2013 compared with $24 million in 2012. The decrease in interest income is due to lower average interest rates compared with the prior year. Interest expense was $167 million in 2013 compared with $181 million in 2012. The decrease is due to lower average debt balances in 2013 and lower interest rates on senior notes issued in 2013 compared with the interest rates on senior notes that matured or were extinguished during 2013.Cost of Extinguishment of DebtIn October 2014, the Company redeemed $230 million of its 2015 notes and $400 million of its 2019 notes. The Company acquired the notes at market value plus a make-whole premium based on the terms of the original indenture, which exceeded the carrying value of the notes and resulted in a cost of $137 million in the fourth quarter of 2014.In October 2013, the Company redeemed $250 million of its 2015 Notes. The Company acquired the notes at market value plus a make-whole premium based on the terms of the original indenture, which exceeded the carrying value of the notes and resulted in a cost of approximately $24 million in the fourth quarter of 2013.Investment IncomeThe caption “Investment income” in the consolidated statements of income comprises realized and unrealized gains and losses from investments recognized in current earnings. It includes, when applicable, other than temporary declines in the value of debt and available-for-sale securities and equity method gains or losses on its investment in private equity. The Company's investments may include direct investments in insurance or consulting companies and investments in private equity funds. The Company recorded investment income of $37 million and $69 million in 2014 and 2013, respectively. In 2014, the Company recorded gains of $31 million related to our general partner carried interest from Trident III no longer subject to claw-back and gains of $6 million primarily related to investments in private equity funds. In 2013, the Company recorded gains of $41 million related to its general partner carried interest from Trident III, $22 million of gains related to its investment in Trident II and $6 million primarily related to investments in private equity funds. At December 31, 2014 and 2013, the Company had deferred performance fees of approximately $16 million and $38 million, respectively, related to Trident III. The timing of recognition of the remaining deferred performance fees is unknown and is not controlled by the Company.In 2013, investment income was $69 million compared with $24 million in 2012. This increase was primarily due to $41 million of performance fees from Trident III. In addition, 2012 results included an impairment loss on a debt security of $8 million.Income TaxesThe Company's consolidated effective tax rate was 28.5%, 30.1% and 29.0% in 2014, 2013 and 2012, respectively. The tax rate in each year reflects foreign operations which are taxed at rates lower than the U.S. statutory tax rate. The lower effective tax rate attributed to the Company's foreign operations primarily reflects lower corporate tax rates that prevail outside of the U.S., net of the U.S. tax impact from repatriating foreign earnings. In 2014, pre-tax income in the U.K., Canada, Australia, Germany and Bermuda accounted for approximately 60% of the Company's total non-U.S. pre-tax income, with effective rates in those countries of 21%, 26%, 29%, 28% and 1%, respectively. Under current U.S. tax law, the Company anticipates its non-U.S. operations will continue to incur taxes at rates below the U.S. federal tax rate of 35%. The Company's U.S. revenue over the past three years has been approximately 45% of total revenue, while over that period the pre-tax income from U.S. locations varied from 15% to 23% of total pre-tax income.35As a U.S.-domiciled parent holding company, Marsh & McLennan Companies, Inc. is the issuer of essentially all of the Company's external indebtedness, and incurs the related interest expense in the U.S. Further, most senior executive and oversight functions are conducted in the U.S. and the associated costs are incurred primarily in the United States.The effective tax rate may vary significantly from period to period for the foreseeable future. It is sensitive to the geographic mix and repatriation of the Company's earnings, which may result in higher or lower tax rates. A proportional increase in U.S. pre-tax income will tend to increase the effective tax rate because U.S. federal and state corporate tax rates exceed tax rates applicable outside the U.S. Losses in certain jurisdictions cannot be offset by earnings from other operations, and may require valuation allowances that affect the rate, depending on estimates of the realizability of associated deferred tax assets. The effective tax rate is also sensitive to changes in unrecognized tax benefits, including the impact of settled tax audits and expired statutes of limitation.The realization of deferred tax assets depends on generating future taxable income during the periods in which the tax benefits are deductible or creditable. Tax liabilities are determined and assessed jurisdictionally by legal entity or filing group. Certain taxing jurisdictions allow or require combined or consolidated tax filings. The Company assessed the realizability of its deferred tax assets and considered all available evidence, including the existence of a recent history of losses, placing particular weight on evidence that could be objectively verified. A valuation allowance was recorded to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount that the Company believes is more likely than not to be realized. Changes in tax laws or tax rulings could have a significant impact on our effective tax rate. For example, proposals for fundamental U.S. international tax reform, if enacted, could have a significant adverse impact on the effective tax rate.Liquidity and Capital ResourcesThe Company is organized as a holding company, a legal entity separate and distinct from its operating subsidiaries. As a holding company without significant operations of its own, the Company is dependent upon dividends and other payments from its operating subsidiaries to meet its obligations for paying principal and interest on outstanding debt obligations, for paying dividends to stockholders, for share repurchases and for corporate expenses. Other sources of liquidity include borrowing facilities discussed below in financing cash flows.The Company derives a significant portion of its revenue and operating profit from operating subsidiaries located outside of the United States. Funds from the Company’s operating subsidiaries located outside of the United States are regularly repatriated to the United States out of annual earnings. At December 31, 2014, the Company had approximately $1.3 billion of cash and cash equivalents in its foreign operations, substantially all of which is considered to be permanently invested in those operations to fund foreign investments and working capital needs. At the current time, the Company does not intend to repatriate any of this cash. The non-U.S. cash and cash equivalents considered permanently reinvested includes $179 million of operating funds required to be maintained for regulatory requirements or as collateral under certain captive insurance arrangements. The Company expects to continue its practice of repatriating foreign funds out of current annual earnings. While management does not foresee a need to repatriate the funds which are currently deemed permanently invested, if facts or circumstances change, management could elect to repatriate them, if necessary, which could result in higher effective tax rates in the future. During 2014, the Company recorded foreign currency translation adjustments which reduced net equity by $515 million. Continued strengthening of the U.S. dollar against foreign currencies would further reduce the translated U.S. dollar value of the Company’s net investments in its non-U.S. subsidiaries, as well as the translated U.S. dollar value of cash repatriations from those subsidiaries. Cash on our consolidated balance sheets includes funds available for general corporate purposes. Funds held on behalf of clients in a fiduciary capacity are segregated and shown separately in the consolidated balance sheets as an offset to fiduciary liabilities. Fiduciary funds cannot be used for general corporate purposes, and should not be considered as a source of liquidity for the Company.36Operating Cash FlowsThe Company generated $2.1 billion of cash from operations in 2014, compared with $1.3 billion in 2013. These amounts reflect the net income reported by the Company during those periods, excluding gains or losses from investments, cost of extinguishment of debt and the disposition of businesses, adjusted for non-cash charges such as depreciation and amortization and changes in working capital which relate, primarily, to the timing of payments for accrued liabilities or receipts of assets. Approximately half of this increase is due to lower pension contributions in 2014 as compared to 2013, which is further discussed below.Pension Related ItemsDuring 2014, the Company contributed $25 million to its U.S. pension plans and $156 million to non-U.S. pension plans. In 2013, the Company contributed $26 million to U.S. plans and $620 million to non-U.S. plans, which included contributions of $250 million to pre-fund all of the 2014, and a substantial portion of the 2015 deficit funding contributions for the U.K. plans and a discretionary contribution of $70 million to the Canadian plans.In the U.S., contributions to the tax-qualified defined benefit plans are based on ERISA guidelines and the Company generally expects to maintain a funded status of 80% or more of the liability determined under the ERISA guidelines. The pension stabilization provisions included in the ""Moving Ahead for Progress in the 21st Century Act"", enacted on July 6, 2012, changed the methodology for determining the discount rate used for calculating plan liabilities under ERISA, which determines, in part, the funding requirements. After considering the impact of the pension funding stabilization provisions discussed above, the Company made a $0.2 million contribution to its tax-qualified U.S. pension plan in the first quarter of 2014. There currently is no ERISA funding requirement for the U.S. qualified plan for 2015. The Company expects to fund approximately $25 million to its non-qualified U.S. pension plans in 2015.The Company has a large number of non-U.S. defined benefit pension plans, the largest of which are in the U.K., which comprise approximately 83% of non-U.S. plan assets. Contribution rates for non-U.S. plans are generally based on local funding practices and statutory requirements, which may differ significantly from measurements under U.S. GAAP. In the U.K., contributions to defined benefit pension plans are based on statutory requirements and are determined through a negotiation process between the Company and the plans' trustee that typically occurs every three years in conjunction with the actuarial valuation of the plans. This negotiation process is governed by U.K. pension regulations. The assumptions that result from the funding negotiations are different from those used for U.S. GAAP and currently result in a lower funded status than under U.S. GAAP. In March 2014, the Company and the Trustee of the U.K. Defined Benefits Plans agreed to a funding deficit recovery plan for the U.K. defined benefit pension plans. The current agreement with the Trustee sets out the annual deficit contributions which would be due based on the deficit at December 31, 2012. The funding level is subject to re-assessment, in most cases on November 1st of each year. If the funding level on November 1st has sufficiently improved, no deficit funding contributions will be required in the following year, and the contribution amount will be deferred. As part of a long-term strategy, which depends on having greater influence over asset allocation and overall investment decisions, the Company has agreed to support annual deficit contributions by the U.K. operating companies under certain circumstances, up to GBP 450 million over a seven-year period.As a result of the significant improvement in funded status during 2013, which included the $250 million deficit pre-funding contribution discussed above, no additional deficit recovery contributions were required in 2014. Based on the funding test carried out at November 1, 2014, Company contributions to the U.K. plans in 2015 are expected to be $54 million. The U.K. employers also contribute an expense allowance each year of approximately $9 million.In the aggregate, the Company expects to contribute approximately $169 million to its non-U.S. defined benefit plans in 2015, comprising approximately $106 million to plans outside of the U.K. and $63 million to the U.K. plans.Funding amounts may be influenced by future asset performance, the level of discount rates and other variables impacting the funded status of the plan.37After completion of a consultation period with affected colleagues, in January 2014, the Company amended its U.K. defined benefit pension plans to close those plans to future benefit accruals effective August 1, 2014 and replaced those plans, along with its existing defined contribution plans, with a new, comprehensive defined contribution arrangement. This change resulted in a curtailment of the U.K. defined benefit plans and, as required under U.S. GAAP, the Company re-measured the defined benefit plans’ assets and liabilities at the amendment date, based on assumptions and market conditions at that date. As a result of the re-measurement, the Projected Benefit Obligation (""PBO"") increased by approximately $147 million and the funded status decreased by approximately $137 million. The change in the PBO and in the funded status relates primarily to a decrease in the discount rate at the re-measurement date. The net periodic benefit costs recognized in 2014 were based on a weighted average resulting from the December 31, 2013 measurement and the January 2014 re-measurement. The Company recognized a curtailment gain of $65 million in the first quarter of 2014, primarily resulting from the recognition of the remaining unamortized prior service credit related to a plan amendment made in December 2012. This gain was largely offset by the cost of a transition benefit to certain employees most impacted by the amendment.The year-over-year change in the funded status of the Company's pension plans is impacted by the variance between actual and assumed results, particularly with regard to return on assets and changes in the discount rate, as well as the amount of Company contributions, if any. Unrecognized actuarial losses were approximately $1.7 billion and $3.2 billion at December 31, 2014 for the U.S. plans and non-U.S. plans, respectively, compared with $1.0 billion and $3.0 billion at December 31, 2013. The increase is primarily due to the impact of decreases in the discount rates, partly offset by actual returns on plan assets in 2014 that were higher than the estimated long-term rate of return on plan assets. In the past several years, the amount of actuarial losses has been significantly impacted, both positively and negatively, by actual asset performance and changes in discount rates. The discount rate used to measure plan liabilities decreased in both the U.S. and the U.K. (the Company's two largest plans) in 2014 after increasing in 2013 for the first time in four years. Prior to 2013, the discount rate decreased in each of the four years from 2009 to 2012. At the end of 2009, the weighted average discount rate for all plans was 6.0%, declining to 5.6%, 4.9% and 4.4% at the end of 2010, 2011 and 2012, respectively. In 2013, the weighted average discount rate increased to 4.8%, and in 2014, it decreased to 3.8%. An increase in the discount rate decreases the measured plan benefit obligation, resulting in actuarial gains, while a decrease in the discount rate increases the measured plan obligation, resulting in actuarial losses. During 2014, the Company's defined benefit pension plan assets had actual returns of 9.8% and 19.4% in the U.S. and U.K., respectively. During 2013, the Company's defined benefit pension plan assets had actual returns of 12.6%, and 8.6% in the U.S. and U.K., respectively; and in 2012, the actual returns were 14.1% in the U.S. and 9.8% in the U.K. In 2013, both the increase in the discount rate and actual asset returns that were higher than the assumed rates of return contributed to actuarial gains. In 2012, actuarial losses resulting from declines in the discount rate were partly offset by actual asset returns which exceeded the assumed rate of return.Overall, based on the measurement at December 31, 2014, expenses related to the Company’s defined benefit pension are expected to increase in 2015 by approximately $115 million. This is being driven by an increase of approximately $80 million in U.S. plans and by an increase of $35 million in non-U.S. plans. The increase in the expected pension expense results primarily from a decrease in the discount rates used to measure plan liabilities and lower pension expense in 2014 as a result of recording the curtailment gain in 2014, partly offset by the impact of an increase in plan assets at the end of 2014 resulting from investment returns.The Company’s accounting policies for its defined benefit pension plans, including the selection of and sensitivity to assumptions, are discussed below under Management’s Discussion of Critical Accounting Policies. For additional information regarding the Company’s retirement plans, see Note 8 to the consolidated financial statements.The Company plans to implement changes to its post-65 retiree medical plan in 2015. The impact of the plan amendment will be recognized when the terms of the amendment are finalized and communicated to impacted employees.38Financing Cash FlowsNet cash used for financing activities was $961 million in 2014 compared with $834 million of net cash used for financing activities in 2013. DebtThe Company increased outstanding debt by approximately $432 million in 2014 and $37 million in 2013. In September 2014, the Company issued $300 million of 2.35% five-year senior notes and $500 million of 3.50% 10.5-year senior notes. In October 2014, a significant portion of the net proceeds of this offering was used to redeem $630 million of debt, including $230 million of 5.75% senior notes due in September 2015 and $400 million of 9.25% senior notes due in 2019. Total cash outflow related to this transaction was approximately $765 million, including a $137 million cost for early redemption, which is reflected as a charge in the consolidated statements of income in the fourth quarter of 2014.During the second quarter of 2014, the Company issued $600 million of 3.5% ten-year senior notes. A portion of the net proceeds of this offering was used for general corporate purposes as well as the repayment of $320 million of 5.375% senior notes that matured in July 2014.In September 2013, the Company issued $250 million of 2.55% five-year senior notes and $250 million of 4.05% ten-year senior notes. The net proceeds of this offering were used for general corporate purposes, which included a partial redemption of $250 million of the outstanding principal amount of the existing 5.75% senior notes due 2015. The redemption settled in October 2013 with a total cash outflow of approximately $275 million, including a $24 million cost for early redemption.During the first quarter of 2013, the Company used cash to repay its 4.85% fixed rate $250 million senior notes that matured. During the first quarter of 2012, the Company repaid its 6.25% fixed rate $250 million senior notes that matured. The Company used proceeds from the issuance of 2.3% five-year $250 million senior notes in the first quarter to repay the maturing notes.AcquisitionsDuring 2014, the Company paid $42 million of contingent payments related to acquisitions made in prior years. These payments are split between financing and operating cash flows in the consolidated statements of cash flows. The portion of these payments that is reflected as a financing activity is $30 million, which represents payments related to the contingent consideration liability that was recorded on the date of acquisition. Payments related to increases in the contingent consideration liability subsequent to the date of acquisition, which were $12 million in 2014, are reflected as operating cash flows. Remaining estimated future contingent consideration payments of $207 million for acquisitions completed in 2014 and in prior years are included in accounts payable and accrued liabilities or other liabilities in the consolidated balance sheet at December 31, 2014. The Company paid deferred purchase consideration related to prior years' acquisitions of $25 million, $15 million and $59 million for the years ended December 31, 2014, 2013 and 2012, respectively. Remaining deferred cash payments of approximately $96 million are included in accounts payable and accrued liabilities or other liabilities in the consolidated balance sheet at December 31, 2014.The Company paid $17 million in 2013 and $30 million in 2012 of contingent payments related to acquisitions made in prior periods.Credit FacilitiesOn March 27, 2014, the Company and certain of its foreign subsidiaries amended the $1.0 billion facility, discussed below, into a new $1.2 billion multi-currency five-year unsecured revolving credit facility. The interest rate on this facility is based on LIBOR plus a fixed margin which varies with the Company's credit ratings. This facility expires in March 2019 and requires the Company to maintain certain coverage and leverage ratios which are tested quarterly. There were no borrowings outstanding under this facility at December 31, 2014.The Company and certain of its foreign subsidiaries previously maintained a $1.0 billion multi-currency five-year revolving credit facility. The facility was previously due to expire in October 2016 and was in 39effect until March 2014. There were no borrowings outstanding under this facility at the time it was amended.In December 2012, the Company closed on a $50 million, 3-year delayed draw term loan facility. The interest rate on this facility is based on LIBOR plus an agreed fixed margin which varies with the Company's credit ratings. The facility requires the Company to maintain coverage ratios and leverage ratios consistent with the revolving credit facility discussed above. The Company had $50 million of borrowings under this facility at December 31, 2014. The Company's senior debt is currently rated Baa1 by Moody's and A- by Standard & Poor's. The Company's short-term debt is currently rated P-2 by Moody's and A-2 by Standard & Poor's. The Company carries a stable outlook from Moody's and Standard & Poor's.The Company also maintains other credit facilities, guarantees and letters of credit with various banks, primarily related to operations located outside the United States, aggregating $260 million at December 31, 2014 and $282 million at December 31, 2013. There was $0.6 million outstanding borrowings under these facilities at December 31, 2014 and $1 million outstanding borrowings under these facilities at December 31, 2013.Share RepurchasesIn May 2014, the Board of Directors increased the amount of the Company's share repurchase program to $2 billion. During 2014, the Company repurchased 15.5 million shares of its common stock for total consideration of $800 million at an average price per share of $51.44. The Company remains authorized to purchase additional shares of its common stock up to a value of approximately $1.3 billion. There is no time limit on this authorization. During 2013, the Company repurchased approximately 13.2 million shares of its common stock for total consideration of $550 million at an average price per share of $41.76.DividendsThe Company paid total dividends of $582 million in 2014 ($1.06 per share), $533 million in 2013 ($0.96 per share) and $497 million in 2012 ($0.90 per share).Investing Cash FlowsNet cash used for investing activities amounted to $1.2 billion in 2014 compared with $446 million used for investing activities in 2013. The Company made 21 acquisitions in 2014. Cash used for these acquisitions, net of cash acquired, was $554 million. On June 23, 2014, Mercer entered into a definitive agreement to acquire a 34% stake in South Africa-based Alexander Forbes Group Holdings Limited (""Alexander Forbes""), becoming a strategic shareholder after Alexander Forbes successfully launched an initial public offering. Mercer purchased its stake in Alexander Forbes in two tranches at 7.50 South African Rand per share. On July 24, 2014, the Company purchased 14.9% of Alexander Forbes common shares for approximately $137 million and in October 2014, the Company paid approximately $166 million for the remaining 19.1%, which is included in other assets in the consolidated balance sheet. The investment in Alexander Forbes is accounted for using the equity method. The Company made eight acquisitions in 2013. Cash used for these acquisitions, net of cash acquired was $125 million. In addition, in 2013, the Company paid $2 million for the purchase of other intangible assets. The Company received proceeds from distributions on its Investment in Trident II of $100 million and $35 million in 2013 and 2012, respectively. Trident II has now fully harvested all its portfolio investments and final distributions were made to partners during the fourth quarter of 2013. The Company’s additions to fixed assets and capitalized software, which amounted to $368 million in 2014 and $401 million in 2013, primarily relate to computer equipment purchases, the refurbishing and modernizing of office facilities and software development costs. The Company has commitments for potential future investments of approximately $60 million in two private equity funds that invest primarily in financial services companies. 40Commitments and ObligationsThe following sets forth the Company’s future contractual obligations by the types identified in the table below as of December 31, 2014: Payment due by PeriodContractual Obligations(In millions of dollars)Total Within1 Year 1-3Years 4-5Years After 5YearsCurrent portion of long-term debt$11 $11 $— $— $—Long-term debt3,394 — 324 575 2,495Interest on long-term debt1,339 133 259 242 705Net operating leases2,218 317 534 393 974Service agreements441 195 177 59 10Other long-term obligations335 80 166 87 2Purchase commitments30 29 1 — —Total$7,768 $765 $1,461 $1,356 $4,186The above does not include the liability for unrecognized tax benefits of $97 million as the Company is unable to reasonably predict the timing of settlement of these liabilities, other than approximately $4 million that may become payable during 2015. The above does not include the indemnified liabilities discussed in Note 15 as the Company is unable to reasonably predict the timing of settlement of these liabilities. The above does not include an $82 million payment the Company made to Putnam in January 2015 to fully satisfy and extinguish its indemnity obligations related to the Putnam disposition.The above does not include net pension liabilities of approximately $2.0 billion because the timing and amount of ultimate payment of such liability is dependent upon future events, including, but not limited to, future returns on plan assets, and changes in the discount rate used to measure the liabilities. The amounts of estimated future benefits payments to be made from pension plan assets are disclosed in Note 8 to the consolidated financial statements. In 2015, the Company expects to contribute approximately $25 million and $169 million to its U.S. and non-U.S. pension plans, respectively. Management’s Discussion of Critical Accounting PoliciesThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (“GAAP”) requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue and expenses, and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. Management considers the policies discussed below to be critical to understanding the Company’s financial statements because their application places the most significant demands on management’s judgment, and requires management to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain. Actual results may differ from those estimates.Legal and Other Loss ContingenciesThe Company and its subsidiaries are subject to numerous claims, lawsuits and proceedings including claims for errors and omissions (""E&O""). GAAP requires that a liability be recorded when a loss is both probable and reasonably estimable. Significant management judgment is required to apply this guidance. The Company utilizes case level reviews by inside and outside counsel, an internal actuarial analysis and other analyses to estimate potential losses. The liability is reviewed quarterly and adjusted as developments warrant. In many cases, the Company has not recorded a liability, other than for legal fees to defend the claim, because we are unable, at the present time, to make a determination that a loss is both probable and reasonably estimable. Given the unpredictability of E&O claims and of litigation that could flow from them, it is possible that an adverse outcome in a particular matter could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s businesses, results of operations, financial condition or cash flow in a given quarterly or annual period.In addition, to the extent that insurance coverage is available, significant management judgment is required to determine the amount of recoveries that are probable of collection under the Company’s various insurance programs.41Retirement BenefitsThe Company maintains qualified and non-qualified defined benefit pension and defined contribution plans for its eligible U.S. employees and a variety of defined benefit and defined contribution plans for its eligible non-U.S. employees. The Company’s policy for funding its tax qualified defined benefit retirement plans is to contribute amounts at least sufficient to meet the funding requirements set forth in U.S. and applicable foreign laws.The Company recognizes the funded status of its over-funded defined benefit pension and retiree medical plans as a net benefit plan asset and its unfunded and underfunded plans as a net benefit plan liability. The gains or losses and prior service costs or credits that have not been recognized as components of net periodic costs are recorded as a component of Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income (“AOCI”), net of tax, in the Company’s consolidated balance sheets. The gains and losses that exceed specified corridors are amortized prospectively out of AOCI over a period that approximates the average remaining service period of active employees, or for plans in which substantially all the participants are inactive, over the remaining life expectancy of the inactive employees. The determination of net periodic pension cost is based on a number of assumptions, including an expected long-term rate of return on plan assets, the discount rate, mortality and assumed rate of salary increase. Significant assumptions used in the calculation of net periodic pension costs and pension liabilities are disclosed in Note 8 to the consolidated financial statements. The Company believes the assumptions for each plan are reasonable and appropriate and will continue to evaluate assumptions at least annually and adjust them as appropriate.Future pension expense or credits will depend on plan provisions, future investment performance, future assumptions and various other factors related to the populations participating in the pension plans. Holding all other assumptions constant, a half-percentage point change in the rate of return on plan assets and discount rate assumptions would affect net periodic pension cost for the U.S. and U.K. plans, which together comprise approximately 86% of total pension plan liabilities, as follows: 0.5 PercentagePoint Increase 0.5 PercentagePoint Decrease(In millions of dollars)U.S. U.K. U.S. U.K.Assumed Rate of Return on Plan Assets$(20) $(38) $20 $38Discount Rate$(45) $(13) $48 $9Changing the discount rate and leaving the other assumptions constant may not be representative of the impact on expense, because the long-term rates of inflation and salary increases are often correlated with the discount rate. Changes in these assumptions will not necessarily have a linear impact on the net periodic pension cost.The Company contributes to certain health care and life insurance benefits provided to its retired employees. The cost of these post-retirement benefits for employees in the U.S. is accrued during the period up to the date employees are eligible to retire, but is funded by the Company as incurred. The key assumptions and sensitivity to changes in the assumed health care cost trend rate are discussed in Note 8 to the consolidated financial statements.Income TaxesThe Company's tax rate reflects its income, statutory tax rates and tax planning in the various jurisdictions in which it operates. Significant judgment is required in determining the annual effective tax rate and in evaluating uncertain tax positions. The Company reports a liability for unrecognized tax benefits resulting from uncertain tax positions taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. The evaluation of a tax position is a two-step process. The first step involves recognition. The Company determines whether it is more likely than not that a tax position will be sustained upon tax examination, including resolution of any related appeals or litigation, based on only the technical merits of the position. The technical merits of a tax position derive from both statutory and judicial authority (legislation and statutes, legislative intent, regulations, rulings, and case law) and their applicability to the facts and circumstances of the tax position. If a tax position does not meet the more likely than not recognition threshold, the benefit of that position is not recognized in the financial statements. The second step is measurement. A tax position 42that meets the more likely than not recognition threshold is measured to determine the amount of benefit to recognize in the financial statements. The tax position is measured as the largest amount of benefit that is greater than 50 percent likely of being realized upon ultimate resolution with a taxing authority.Uncertain tax positions are evaluated based upon the facts and circumstances that exist at each reporting period and involve significant management judgment. Subsequent changes in judgment based upon new information may lead to changes in recognition, derecognition, and measurement. Adjustments may result, for example, upon resolution of an issue with the taxing authorities, or expiration of a statute of limitations barring an assessment for an issue.Tax law requires items be included in the Company's tax returns at different times than the items are reflected in the financial statements. As a result, the annual tax expense reflected in the consolidated statements of income is different than that reported in the tax returns. Some of these differences are permanent, such as expenses that are not deductible in the returns, and some differences are temporary and reverse over time, such as depreciation expense. Temporary differences create deferred tax assets and liabilities. Deferred tax liabilities generally represent tax expense recognized in the financial statements for which payment has been deferred, or expense for which a deduction has been taken already in the tax return but the expense has not yet been recognized in the financial statements. Deferred tax assets generally represent items that can be used as a tax deduction or credit in tax returns in future years for which a benefit has already been recorded in the financial statements. In assessing the need for and amount of a valuation allowance for deferred tax assets, the Company considers whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized and adjusts the valuation allowance accordingly. The Company evaluates all significant available positive and negative evidence, including the existence of losses in recent years and its forecast of future taxable income by jurisdiction, in assessing the need for a valuation allowance. The Company also considers tax planning strategies that would result in realization of deferred tax assets, and the presence of taxable income in prior period tax filings in jurisdictions that allow for the carryback of tax attributes pursuant to the applicable tax law. The underlying assumptions the Company uses in forecasting future taxable income require significant judgment and take into account the Company's recent performance. The ultimate realization of deferred tax assets is dependent on the generation of future taxable income during the periods in which temporary differences or carry-forwards are deductible or creditable. Valuation allowances are established for deferred tax assets when it is estimated that it is more likely than not that future taxable income will be insufficient to fully use a deduction or credit in that jurisdiction.Fair Value DeterminationsGoodwill Impairment Testing—The Company is required to assess goodwill and any indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment annually, or more frequently if circumstances indicate impairment may have occurred. The Company performs the annual impairment test for each of its reporting units during the third quarter of each year. In accordance with applicable accounting guidance, the Company assesses qualitative factors to determine whether it is necessary to perform the two-step goodwill impairment test. The Company considered numerous factors, which included that the fair value of each reporting unit exceeded its carrying value by a substantial margin in its most recent estimate of reporting unit fair values, whether significant acquisitions or dispositions occurred which might alter the fair value of its reporting units, macroeconomic conditions and their potential impact on reporting unit fair values, actual performance compared with budget and prior projections used in its estimation of reporting unit fair values, industry and market conditions, and the year-over year change in the Company’s share price. The Company completed its qualitative assessment in the third quarter of 2014 and concluded that a two-step goodwill impairment test was not required in 2014 and that goodwill was not impaired.Share-based PaymentThe guidance for accounting for share-based payments requires, among other things, that the estimated fair value of stock options be charged to earnings. Significant management judgment is required to determine the appropriate assumptions for inputs such as volatility and expected term necessary to estimate option values. In addition, management judgment is required to analyze the terms of the plans and awards granted thereunder to determine if awards will be treated as equity awards or liability awards, as defined by the accounting guidance.43As of December 31, 2014, there was $16 million of unrecognized compensation cost related to stock option awards. The weighted-average periods over which the costs are expected to be recognized is 1.05 years. Also as of December 31, 2014, there was $55.8 million of unrecognized compensation cost related to the Company’s restricted stock, restricted stock unit and deferred stock unit awards. The weighted-average period over which that cost is expected to be recognized is approximately one year.See Note 9 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding accounting for share-based payments.New Accounting PronouncementsNote 1 to the consolidated financial statements contains a summary of the Company’s significant accounting policies, including a discussion of recently issued accounting pronouncements and their impact or potential future impact on the Company’s financial results, if determinable, under the sub-heading ""New Accounting Pronouncements"".44Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market RiskMarket Risk and Credit RiskCertain of the Company’s revenues, expenses, assets and liabilities are exposed to the impact of interest rate changes and fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates and equity markets.Interest Rate Risk and Credit RiskInterest income generated from the Company’s cash investments as well as invested fiduciary funds will vary with the general level of interest rates.The Company had the following investments subject to variable interest rates: (In millions of dollars)December 31, 2014Cash and cash equivalents invested in money market funds, certificates of deposit and time deposits$1,958Fiduciary cash and investments$4,552Based on the above balances, if short-term interest rates increased or decreased by 10%, or 8 basis points, over the course of the year, annual interest income, including interest earned on fiduciary funds, would increase or decrease by approximately $3 million.In addition to interest rate risk, our cash investments and fiduciary fund investments are subject to potential loss of value due to counter-party credit risk. To minimize this risk, the Company and its subsidiaries invest pursuant to a Board approved investment policy. The policy mandates the preservation of principal and liquidity and requires broad diversification with counter-party limits assigned based primarily on credit rating and type of investment. The Company carefully monitors its cash and fiduciary fund investments and will further restrict the portfolio as appropriate to market conditions. The majority of cash and fiduciary fund investments are invested in short-term bank deposits and liquid money market funds.Foreign Currency RiskThe translated values of revenue and expense from the Company’s international operations are subject to fluctuations due to changes in currency exchange rates. The non-U.S. based revenue that is exposed to foreign exchange fluctuations is approximately 55% of total revenue. We periodically use forward contracts and options to limit foreign currency exchange rate exposure on net income and cash flows for specific, clearly defined transactions arising in the ordinary course of business. Although the Company has significant revenue generated in foreign locations which is subject to foreign exchange rate fluctuations, in most cases both the foreign currency revenue and expenses are in the functional currency of the foreign location. As such, the U.S. dollar translation of both the revenues and expenses, as well as the potentially offsetting movements of various currencies against the U.S. dollar, generally tends to mitigate the impact on net operating income of foreign currency risk. If foreign exchange rates of major currencies (Euro, Sterling, Australian dollar and Canadian dollar) moved 10% in the same direction against the US dollar compared with the foreign exchange rates in 2014, the Company estimates net operating income would increase or decrease by approximately $54 million. The Company has exposure to approximately 80 foreign currencies overall. In the fourth quarter of 2014, the U.S. dollar strengthened significantly against most currencies. If exchange rates at January 31, 2015 hold constant throughout 2015, the Company estimates the year-over-year impact from conversion of foreign currency earnings would reduce full year income by approximately $125 million. In Continental Europe, the largest amount of revenue from renewals for the Risk & Insurance segment occurs in the first quarter. Consequently, a significant portion of the year-over-year foreign exchange impact would occur in the first quarter.Equity Price RiskThe Company holds investments in both public and private companies as well as private equity funds that invest primarily in financial services companies. Publicly traded investments of $18 million are classified as available for sale. Non-publicly traded investments of $12 million are accounted for using the cost 45method and $388 million are accounted for using the equity method. The investments are subject to risk of changes in market value, which if determined to be other than temporary, could result in realized impairment losses. The Company periodically reviews the carrying value of such investments to determine if any valuation adjustments are appropriate under the applicable accounting pronouncements.OtherA number of lawsuits and regulatory proceedings are pending.

The Company achieved this growth despite significant foreign exchange headwinds, caused by the strengthened U.S. dollar, which had the effect of reducing the translated value of the Company’s foreign earnings.Diluted net income per share from continuing operations was $2.98, compared to $2.61 last year, reflecting a $160 million increase in net income as well as a 3% decrease in the average number of diluted shares outstanding as compared to the same period last year. Shares issued related to the vesting of share awards and exercise of employee stock options were more than offset by share repurchases over the past four quarters.Risk and Insurance Services operating income increased $30 million or 2% in 2015 compared with 2014. Revenue decreased 1%, but increased 3% on an underlying basis, to $6.9 billion in 2015, reflecting underlying revenue growth of 3% at Marsh and 2% at Guy Carpenter, while expenses decreased 2%, but increased 2% on an underlying basis. Consulting operating income increased $80 million or 8% to $1.1 billion in 2015 compared with 2014, reflecting flat revenue, but an increase of 5% on an underlying basis. Expense decreased 1%, but increased 4% on an underlying basis. Mercer and Oliver Wyman recorded underlying revenue growth of 4% and 7%, respectively, in 2015 as compared to 2014. The operating income and revenue in 2015 include a pre-tax gain of $37 million from the sale of Mercer's U.S. defined contribution recordkeeping business.Consolidated operating income increased 11% to $2.3 billion in 2014 compared with $2.1 billion in 2013. This reflects the combined impact of a 6% increase in revenue and a 5% increase in expense.Risk and Insurance Services operating income increased $88 million or 6% in 2014 compared with 2013. Revenue increased 5%, or 3% on an underlying basis, to $6.9 billion in 2014, reflecting underlying revenue growth of 4% at Marsh and 2% at Guy Carpenter, while expenses increased 5%, or 3% on an underlying basis. Consulting operating income increased $151 million or 18% to $996 million in 2014 compared with 2013, reflecting a 6% increase in revenue and a 4% increase in expense. Mercer and Oliver Wyman recorded underlying revenue growth of 3% and 15%, respectively, in 2014 as compared to 2013.The Company recorded expenses related to the early extinguishment of debt of $137 million in 2014 and $24 million in 2013.Consolidated net income attributable to the Company was $1.6 billion in 2015, compared with $1.5 billion in 2014 and $1.4 billion in 2013.28Consolidated Revenue and ExpenseBecause the Company conducts business in many countries, foreign exchange rate movements may impact period-to-period comparisons of revenue. Similarly, the revenue impact of acquisitions and dispositions may affect period-to-period comparisons of revenue. Underlying revenue measures the change in revenue from one period to another by isolating these impacts. The impact of foreign currency exchange fluctuations, acquisitions and dispositions, including transfers among businesses and other items, on the Company’s operating revenues is as follows: Year EndedDecember 31, Components of Revenue Change*(In millions, except percentage figures)2015 2014 % Change GAAPRevenue CurrencyImpact Acquisitions/DispositionsImpact UnderlyingRevenueRisk and Insurance Services Marsh$5,727 $5,753 — (7)% 3 % 3%Guy Carpenter1,121 1,154 (3)% (4)% (1)% 2%Subtotal6,848 6,907 (1)% (6)% 2 % 3%Fiduciary Interest Income21 24 Total Risk and Insurance Services6,869 6,931 (1)% (6)% 2 % 3%Consulting Mercer4,313 4,350 (1)% (7)% 2 % 4%Oliver Wyman Group1,751 1,709 3 % (6)% 2 % 7%Total Consulting6,064 6,059 — (7)% 2 % 5%Corporate/Eliminations(40) (39) Total Revenue$12,893 $12,951 — (6)% 2 % 4%*Components of revenue change may not add due to rounding.The following table provides more detailed revenue information for certain of the components presented above: Year EndedDecember 31, Components of Revenue Change*(In millions, except percentage figures)2015 2014 % Change GAAPRevenue CurrencyImpact Acquisitions/DispositionsImpact UnderlyingRevenueMarsh: EMEA$1,848 $1,980 (7)% (10)% 1 % 2%Asia Pacific636 683 (7)% (10)% 1 % 2%Latin America380 413 (8)% (18)% 2 % 8%Total International2,864 3,076 (7)% (11)% 1 % 3%U.S. / Canada2,863 2,677 7 % (1)% 5 % 3%Total Marsh$5,727 $5,753 — (7)% 3 % 3%Mercer: Health$1,558 $1,553 — (3)% (2)% 6%Retirement1,345 1,375 (2)% (7)% 5 % —Investments818 836 (2)% (12)% 2 % 7%Talent592 586 1 % (7)% 3 % 5%Total Mercer$4,313 $4,350 (1)% (7)% 2 % 4%Underlying revenue measures the change in revenue using consistent currency exchange rates, excluding the impact of certain items that affect comparability such as: acquisitions, dispositions and transfers among businesses.

Revenue in the Risk and Insurance Services segment decreased 1% in 2015 compared with 2014, but increased 3% on an underlying basis. Revenue increased 3% and 2% on an underlying basis at Marsh and Guy Carpenter, respectively, as compared to 2014. The Consulting 30segment's revenue was flat compared to 2014, but increased 5% on an underlying basis. Mercer and Oliver Wyman's revenue increased 4% and 7% on an underlying basis, respectively, compared to 2014. Consolidated revenue of $13 billion in 2014 increased 6%, or 5% on an underlying basis, compared with $12.3 billion in 2013. Revenue in the Risk and Insurance Services segment increased 5% in 2014 compared with 2013, or 3% on an underlying basis, with underlying revenue growth of 4% at Marsh and 2% at Guy Carpenter. The Consulting segment's revenue increased 6% on both a reported and underlying basis. On an underlying basis, Mercer's revenue was up 3% in 2014 compared with 2013, while revenue of the Oliver Wyman Group increased 15%.Operating ExpenseConsolidated operating expenses decreased 2% in 2015 compared with the same period in 2014, but increased 3% on an underlying basis. The increase in underlying expenses primarily reflects higher base salary, bonus, and higher defined benefit and defined contribution plan costs (""retirement benefit costs""), partly offset by the impact of the net benefit from the termination of the Company's post-65 retiree medical reimbursement plan in the U.S. (the ""RRA Plan"").Consolidated operating expenses increased 5% in 2014 compared with the same period in 2013 and 4% on an underlying basis. The increase in underlying expenses primarily reflects higher incentive compensation, facilities and software amortization costs, partly offset by lower pension costs.Risk and Insurance ServicesIn the Risk and Insurance Services segment, the Company’s subsidiaries and other affiliated entities act as brokers, agents or consultants for insureds, insurance underwriters and other brokers in the areas of risk management, insurance broking and insurance program management services, primarily under the name of Marsh; and engage in reinsurance broking, catastrophe and financial modeling services and related advisory functions, primarily under the name of Guy Carpenter.Marsh and Guy Carpenter are compensated for brokerage and consulting services primarily through fees paid by clients and/or commissions paid out of premiums charged by insurance and reinsurance companies. Commission rates vary in amount depending upon the type of insurance or reinsurance coverage provided, the particular insurer or reinsurer, the capacity in which the broker acts and negotiations with clients. Revenues can be affected by premium rate levels in the insurance/reinsurance markets, the amount of risk retained by insurance and reinsurance clients themselves and by the value of the risks that have been insured since commission-based compensation is frequently related to the premiums paid by insureds/reinsureds. In many cases, fee compensation may be negotiated in advance, based on the type of risk, coverage required, and service provided by the Company and ultimately placed into the insurance market or retained by the client. The trends and comparisons of revenue from one period to the next can be affected by changes in premium rate levels, fluctuations in client risk retention, and increases or decreases in the value of risks that have been insured, as well as new and lost business, and the volume of business from new and existing clients. Marsh also receives compensation from insurance companies. This compensation includes, among other things, payment for consulting and analytics services provided to insurers; administrative and other services provided to or on behalf of insurers (including services relating to the administration and management of quota share, panels and other facilities in which insurers participate); and contingent commissions. Marsh and Guy Carpenter receive interest income on certain funds (such as premiums and claims proceeds) held in a fiduciary capacity for others. The investment of fiduciary funds is regulated by state and other insurance authorities. These regulations typically require segregation of fiduciary funds and limit the types of investments that may be made with them. Interest income from these investments varies depending on the amount of funds invested and applicable interest rates, both of which vary from time to time. For presentation purposes, fiduciary interest is segregated from the other revenues of Marsh and Guy Carpenter and separately presented within the segment, as shown in the revenue by segments charts earlier in this MD&A.31The results of operations for the Risk and Insurance Services segment are presented below: (In millions of dollars)2015 2014 2013Revenue$6,869 $6,931 $6,596Compensation and Benefits3,629 3,781 3,618Other Operating Expenses1,701 1,641 1,557Operating Expenses5,330 5,422 5,175Operating Income$1,539 $1,509 $1,421Operating Income Margin22.4% 21.8% 21.5%RevenueRevenue in the Risk and Insurance Services segment decreased 1%, but increased 3% on an underlying basis, in 2015 compared with 2014. In Marsh, revenue of $5.7 billion, was essentially flat on a reported basis in 2015 as compared to 2014, reflecting a 3% increase on an underlying basis and a 3% increase from acquisitions, offset by a 7% decrease resulting from the impact of foreign currency translation. The underlying revenue increase reflects growth in all major geographies. International operations had underlying revenue growth of 3% reflecting increases of 8% in Latin America, 2% in Asia Pacific and 2% in EMEA, while U.S./Canada increased 3%.Guy Carpenter’s revenue decreased 3% to $1.1 billion in 2015 compared with 2014, but increased 2% on an underlying basis.Fiduciary interest income was $21 million in 2015 compared to $24 million in 2014 due to lower average invested funds combined with lower interest rates.The Risk and Insurance Services segment completed thirteen acquisitions during 2015. Acquisition details can be found in Note 4 to the consolidated financial statements.Revenue in the Risk and Insurance Services segment increased 5%, or 3% on an underlying basis, in 2014 compared with 2013.In Marsh, revenue grew to $5.8 billion or 6% in 2014 as compared to 2013, reflecting a 4% increase on an underlying basis and a 3% increase from acquisitions, partly offset by a 1% decrease resulting from the impact of foreign currency translation. The underlying revenue increase reflects growth in all major geographies driven by strong new business, particularly in countries such as the U.S., Canada, and the U.K., as well as in Africa. International operations had underlying revenue growth of 5% reflecting increases of 10% in Latin America, 7% in Asia Pacific and 3% in EMEA, while U.S./Canada increased 3%. Guy Carpenter’s revenue increased 2% to $1.2 billion in 2014 compared with 2013 on both a reported and an underlying basis, reflecting growth across the U.S., U.K. Facultative, Asia and Global Specialties such as Aviation and Marine.Fiduciary interest income was $24 million in 2014 compared to $27 million in 2013 due to lower average invested funds combined with lower interest rates.The Risk and Insurance segment completed fifteen acquisitions during 2014.ExpenseExpenses in the Risk and Insurance Services segment decreased 2% on a reported basis, but increased 2% on an underlying basis, in 2015 compared with 2014. The impact of foreign currency translation reduced expenses by 7%, partly offset by a 3% increase related to acquisitions. The increase in underlying expenses reflects higher base salaries, incentive compensation and retirement benefit costs, higher amortization of intangible assets and charges for adjustments to acquisition-related contingent consideration liabilities, partly offset by the impact of the net benefit from the termination of the RRA plan.Expenses in the Risk and Insurance Services segment increased 5% on a reported basis and 3% on an underlying basis in 2014 compared with 2013. The increase in expenses on an underlying basis is 32primarily due to higher base salaries, incentive compensation, facilities and intangible asset amortization expenses, partly offset by lower defined benefit pension costs.ConsultingThe Company conducts business in its Consulting segment through two main business groups. Mercer provides consulting expertise, advice, services and solutions in the areas of health, retirement, talent and investments. Oliver Wyman Group provides specialized management, economic and brand consulting services.The major component of revenue in the Consulting business is fees paid by clients for advice and services. Mercer, principally through its health line of business, also earns revenue in the form of commissions received from insurance companies for the placement of group (and occasionally individual) insurance contracts, primarily life, health and accident coverages. Revenue for Mercer’s investment management business and certain of Mercer’s defined contribution administration services consists principally of fees based on assets under management and/or administration.Revenue in the Consulting segment is affected by, among other things, global economic conditions, including changes in clients’ particular industries and markets. Revenue is also affected by competition due to the introduction of new products and services, broad trends in employee demographics, including levels of employment, the effect of government policies and regulations, and fluctuations in interest and foreign exchange rates. Revenues from the provision of investment management services and retirement trust and administrative services are significantly affected by the level of assets under management and securities market performance. Reimbursable expenses incurred by professional staff in the generation of revenue and sub-advisory fees incurred by the majority of funds are included on a gross basis in the investment management business in revenue and the related expenses are included in other operating expenses.The results of operations for the Consulting segment are presented below: (In millions of dollars)2015 2014 2013Revenue$6,064 $6,059 $5,701Compensation and Benefits3,354 3,398 3,269Other Operating Expenses1,635 1,665 1,587Operating Expenses4,989 5,063 4,856Operating Income$1,075 $996 $845Operating Income Margin17.7% 16.4% 14.8%RevenueConsulting revenue in 2015, was essentially flat compared to 2014, reflecting a 5% increase on an underlying basis and a 2% increase related to acquisitions, offset by a 7% decrease from the impact of foreign currency translation. Mercer’s revenue was $4.3 billion in 2015, a decrease of 1%, but an increase of 4% on an underlying basis. The year over year revenue change also reflects an increase of 2% from acquisitions/dispositions, offset by a decrease of 7% from the impact of foreign currency translation. Mercer's revenue includes a $37 million gain from the disposal of its U.S. defined contribution recordkeeping business, and is reflected in the 2% impact from acquisitions/dispositions. The underlying revenue growth reflects an increase in Investments of 7%, Health of 6% and Talent of 5%, while Retirement remained flat. Oliver Wyman’s revenue increased 3% in 2015 compared to 2014, reflecting an increase of 7% on an underlying basis and a 2% increase from acquisitions, partly offset by a decrease of 6% from the impact of foreign currency translation.The Consulting segment completed eight acquisitions during 2015. Acquisition details can be found in Note 4 to the consolidated financial statements.Consulting revenue in 2014 increased 6% on both a reported and underlying basis as compared to 2013. Mercer’s revenue was $4.4 billion in 2014, an increase of 3% on both a reported and underlying basis, partly offset by a 1% decrease due to the impact of foreign currency translation. The underlying revenue growth reflects an increase in Investments of 9%, Health of 3% and Retirement of 2%, partly offset by a 33decrease in Talent of 1%. Oliver Wyman’s revenue increased 17% in 2014 compared to 2013, or 15% on an underlying basis, as all industry sectors contributed to this growth. On a geographic basis, the revenue growth was attributable to both North America and Europe.The Consulting segment completed six acquisitions during 2014.During 2014, Mercer acquired a 34% stake in South Africa-based Alexander Forbes Group Holding Limited (""Alexander Forbes""). The Company’s investment in Alexander Forbes is accounted for using the equity method of accounting and is included in other assets in the consolidated balance sheets.ExpenseConsulting expenses in 2015 decreased 1%, reflecting increases of 4% in underlying expenses and 1% related to acquisitions, partly offset by a 6% decrease from the impact of foreign currency translation. The increase in underlying expenses reflects the impact of higher base salaries and incentive compensation costs and higher retirement benefit costs, partly offset by the impact of the net benefit from the termination of the RRA plan.Consulting expenses in 2014 increased 4% on both a reported and underlying basis compared to 2013. This increase reflects the impact of higher incentive compensation costs, partly offset by lower defined benefit pension costs.Corporate and OtherCorporate expenses in 2015 were $195 million compared to $204 million in 2014. The lower expenses in 2015 were primarily due to the cost of non-recurring corporate initiatives which occurred in 2014, discussed in more detail below.Corporate expenses in 2014 were $204 million compared to $190 million in 2013. The increase is primarily due to corporate initiatives, which include strengthening cyber security protections, expenses related to strategic investments and corporate transformation efforts, primarily within the HR and Finance functions. Discontinued OperationsAs part of the disposal transactions for Putnam and Kroll, the Company provided certain indemnities, primarily related to pre-transaction tax uncertainties and legal contingencies. In accordance with applicable accounting guidance, liabilities were established related to these indemnities at the time of the sales and reflected as a reduction of the gain on disposal. Discontinued operations includes charges or credits resulting from the settlement or resolution of the indemnified matters, as well as adjustments to the liabilities related to such matters.On December 31, 2014, an agreement was reached between Putnam and the Massachusetts Department of Revenue (""DOR"") regarding a tax dispute, which was covered under the indemnity agreement discussed above. The December 2014 agreement was subject to certain approvals, which included the State Attorney General and the Commissioner of the DOR. In January 2015, all necessary approvals were received, the agreement was executed and the tax was paid. Concurrently, Putnam and the Company executed a settlement agreement to resolve all remaining matters under the indemnity agreement. The Company recorded a gain, net of federal tax, of approximately $28 million in 2014 related to the settlement with Putnam.Discontinued operations in 2013 includes estimated costs covered under the indemnity related to the Kroll sale as well as tax indemnities related to the Putnam sale.34Summarized Statements of Income data for discontinued operations are as follows:For the Years Ended December 31,(In millions of dollars, except per share figures)2015 2014 2013Income (loss) from discontinued operations, net of tax$— $— $—Disposals of discontinued operations (5) 42 (4)Income tax (credit) expense (5) 16 (10)Disposals of discontinued operations, net of tax— 26 6Discontinued operations, net of tax$— $26 $6Discontinued operations, net of tax per share —Basic$— $0.05 $0.01—Diluted$— $0.04 $0.01Other Corporate ItemsInterestInterest income earned on corporate funds amounted to $13 million in 2015 compared with $21 million in 2014, primarily due to a lower level of invested funds in 2015. Interest expense was $163 million in 2015 compared with $165 million in 2014, due to lower average interest rates in 2015 compared with the prior year, partly offset by higher average debt outstanding during 2015.Interest income earned on corporate funds amounted to $21 million in 2014 compared with $18 million in 2013. The increase in interest income is due to a higher level of invested funds, partly offset by lower effective interest rates. Interest expense was $165 million in 2014 compared with $167 million in 2013.Cost of Extinguishment of DebtIn October 2014, the Company redeemed $230 million of its 2015 notes and $400 million of its 2019 notes. The Company acquired the notes at market value plus a make-whole premium based on the terms of the original indenture, which exceeded the carrying value of the notes and resulted in a cost of $137 million in the fourth quarter of 2014.In October 2013, the Company redeemed $250 million of its 2015 notes. The Company acquired thenotes at market value plus a make-whole premium based on the terms of the original indenture, whichexceeded the carrying value of the notes and resulted in a cost of approximately $24 million in the fourthquarter of 2013.Investment IncomeThe caption ""Investment income (loss)"" in the consolidated statements of income comprises realized and unrealized gains and losses from investments recognized in current earnings. It includes, when applicable, other-than-temporary declines in the value of debt and available-for-sale securities and equity method gains or losses on its investment in private equity funds. The Company's investments may include direct investments in insurance or consulting companies and investments in private equity funds. The Company recorded net investment income of $38 million and $37 million in 2015 and 2014, respectively, primarily related to the general partner carried interest from Trident III. Stonepoint Capital, the investment manager of Trident III, harvested the remaining two investments of Trident III during the third quarter of 2015, which resulted in the Company recognizing its remaining deferred performance fees.Income TaxesThe Company's consolidated effective tax rate was 29.1%, 28.5% and 30.1% in 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively. The tax rate in each year reflects foreign operations which are taxed at rates lower than the U.S. statutory tax rate. The lower effective tax rate attributed to the Company's foreign operations primarily reflects lower corporate tax rates that prevail outside of the U.S., net of the U.S. tax impact from repatriating foreign earnings. In 2015, pre-tax income in the U.K., Canada, Australia, Germany, Bermuda and Ireland accounted for approximately 60% of the Company's total non-U.S. pre-tax income, with effective rates in those countries of 22% (excluding the non-cash deferred tax impact of U.K. tax 35legislation enacted in 2015), 27%, 30%, 31%, 1% and 12%, respectively. Under current U.S. tax law, the Company anticipates its non-U.S. operations will continue to incur taxes at rates below the U.S. federal tax rate of 35%. The Company's U.S. revenue over the past three years has been approximately 46% of total revenue, while over that period the pre-tax income from U.S. locations varied from 15% to 30% of total pre-tax income.As a U.S.-domiciled parent holding company, Marsh & McLennan Companies, Inc. is the issuer of essentially all of the Company's external indebtedness, and incurs the related interest expense in the U.S. Further, most senior executive and oversight functions are conducted in the U.S. and the associated costs are incurred primarily in the United States.The effective tax rate may vary significantly from period to period for the foreseeable future. It is sensitive to the geographic mix and repatriation of the Company's earnings, which may result in higher or lower tax rates. A proportional increase in U.S. pre-tax income will tend to increase the effective tax rate because U.S. federal and state corporate tax rates exceed tax rates applicable outside the U.S. Losses in certain jurisdictions cannot be offset by earnings from other operations, and may require valuation allowances that affect the rate, depending on estimates of the realizability of associated deferred tax assets. The effective tax rate is also sensitive to changes in unrecognized tax benefits, including the impact of settled tax audits and expired statutes of limitation.The realization of deferred tax assets depends on generating future taxable income during the periods in which the tax benefits are deductible or creditable. Tax liabilities are determined and assessed jurisdictionally by legal entity or filing group. Certain taxing jurisdictions allow or require combined or consolidated tax filings. The Company assessed the realizability of its deferred tax assets and considered all available evidence, including the existence of a recent history of losses, placing particular weight on evidence that could be objectively verified. A valuation allowance was recorded to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount that the Company believes is more likely than not to be realized.Changes in tax laws or tax rulings in any of the jurisdictions in which we operate could have a significant adverse impact on our effective tax rate.Liquidity and Capital ResourcesThe Company is organized as a holding company, a legal entity separate and distinct from its operating subsidiaries. As a holding company without significant operations of its own, the Company is dependent upon dividends and other payments from its operating subsidiaries to meet its obligations for paying principal and interest on outstanding debt obligations, for paying dividends to stockholders, for share repurchases and for corporate expenses. We also provide financial support to our operating subsidiaries for acquisitions, investments and certain parts of their business that require liquidity, such as the capital markets raising business of Guy Carpenter. Other sources of liquidity include borrowing facilities discussed below in financing cash flows.The Company derives a significant portion of its revenue and operating profit from operating subsidiaries located outside of the United States. Funds from the Company’s operating subsidiaries located outside of the United States are regularly repatriated to the United States out of annual earnings. At December 31, 2015, the Company had approximately $800 million of cash and cash equivalents in its foreign operations, substantially all of which is considered to be permanently invested in those operations to fund foreign investments and working capital needs. At the current time, the Company does not intend to repatriate any of this cash. The non-U.S. cash and cash equivalents considered permanently reinvested includes $191 million of operating funds required to be maintained for regulatory requirements or as collateral under certain captive insurance arrangements. The Company expects to continue its practice of repatriating foreign funds out of current annual earnings. While management does not foresee a need to repatriate the funds which are currently deemed permanently invested, if facts or circumstances change, management could elect to repatriate them, if necessary, which could result in higher effective tax rates in the future. During 2015, the Company recorded foreign currency translation adjustments which reduced net equity by $643 million. Continued strengthening of the U.S. dollar against foreign currencies would further reduce the translated U.S. dollar value of the Company’s net investments in its non-U.S. subsidiaries, as well as the translated U.S. dollar value of cash repatriations from those subsidiaries.36Cash on our consolidated balance sheets includes funds available for general corporate purposes. Funds held on behalf of clients in a fiduciary capacity are segregated and shown separately in the consolidated balance sheets as an offset to fiduciary liabilities. Fiduciary funds cannot be used for general corporate purposes, and should not be considered as a source of liquidity for the Company.Operating Cash FlowsThe Company generated $1.9 billion of cash from operations in 2015, compared with $2.1 billion in 2014. These amounts reflect the net income reported by the Company during those periods, excluding gains or losses from investments, cost of extinguishment of debt and the disposition of businesses, adjusted for non-cash charges such as depreciation and amortization and changes in working capital which relate, primarily, to the timing of payments for accrued liabilities or receipts of assets.Pension-Related ItemsDuring 2015, the Company contributed $29 million to its U.S. pension plans and $166 million to non-U.S. pension plans. In 2014, the Company contributed $25 million to U.S. plans and $156 million to non-U.S. plans.In the U.S., contributions to the tax-qualified defined benefit plans are based on ERISA guidelines and the Company generally expects to maintain a funded status of 80% or more of the liability determined under the ERISA guidelines. The pension stabilization provisions included in the ""Moving Ahead for Progress in the 21st Century Act"", enacted on July 6, 2012, changed the methodology for determining the discount rate used for calculating plan liabilities under ERISA, which determines, in part, the funding requirements. After considering the impact of the pension funding stabilization provisions discussed above, there was no ERISA funding requirement for the U.S. qualified plan in 2015. The Company made a $0.2 million contribution to its tax-qualified U.S. pension plan in the first quarter of 2014. There currently is no ERISA funding requirement for the U.S. qualified plan for 2016. The Company expects to fund approximately $26 million to its non-qualified U.S. pension plans in 2016.The Company continues to manage the cost and assess the competitiveness of its benefits programs, and also to manage the risks related to its defined benefit pension plan liabilities. Effective September 1, 2015, the Company divided its U.S. qualified defined benefit plan. The existing plan was amended to cover only the retirees currently receiving benefits and terminated vested participants as of August 1, 2015. The Company's active participants as of that date were transferred into a newly established, legally separate qualified defined benefit plan. The benefits provided to the plans’ participants were unchanged. As a result of the plan amendment and establishment of the new plan, the Company re-measured the assets and liabilities of the two plans, as required under U.S. GAAP, based on assumptions and market conditions at the amendment date. Net periodic pension expense in 2015 includes the weighted average costs of the December 31, 2014 measurement and the September 1, 2015 re-measurement.Effective August 1, 2015, the Company amended its Ireland defined benefit pension plans to close those plans to future benefit accruals and replaced those plans with a defined contribution arrangement. The Company re-measured the assets and liabilities of the plans, based on assumptions and market conditions on the amendment date.The Company has a large number of non-U.S. defined benefit pension plans, the largest of which are in the U.K., which comprise approximately 83% of non-U.S. plan assets. Contribution rates for non-U.S. plans are generally based on local funding practices and statutory requirements, which may differ significantly from measurements under U.S. GAAP. In the U.K., contributions to defined benefit pension plans are determined through a negotiation process between the Company and the plans' trustee that typically occurs every three years in conjunction with the actuarial valuation of the plans. This process is governed by U.K. pension regulations. The assumptions that result from the funding negotiations are different from those used for U.S. GAAP and currently result in a lower funded status than under U.S. GAAP. In March 2014, the Company and the Trustee of the U.K. Defined Benefits Plans agreed to a funding deficit recovery plan for the U.K. defined benefit pension plans. The current agreement with the Trustee sets out the annual deficit contributions which would be due based on the deficit at December 31, 2012. The funding level is subject to re-assessment, in most cases on November 1st of each year. If the funding level on November 1st is sufficient, no deficit funding contributions will be required in the following year, and the contribution amount will be deferred. As part of a long-term strategy, which depends on 37having greater influence over asset allocation and overall investment decisions, the Company has agreed to support annual deficit contributions by the U.K. operating companies under certain circumstances, up to GBP 450 million over a seven-year period (""contingent guarantee agreement"").The Company contributed $51 million to the U.K. plans in 2015. The U.K. employers also contribute an expense allowance each year of approximately $9 million. Based on the funding test carried out at November 1, 2015, the Company contributions to the U.K. plans in 2016 are expected to be approximately $100 million, including the expense allowance.In the aggregate, the Company expects to contribute approximately $191 million to its non-U.S. defined benefit plans in 2016, comprising approximately $91 million to plans outside of the U.K. and $100 million to the U.K. plans.Funding amounts may be influenced by future asset performance, the level of discount rates and other variables impacting the funded status of the plan.After completion of a consultation period with affected colleagues, in January 2014, the Company amended its U.K. defined benefit pension plans to close those plans to future benefit accruals effective August 1, 2014 and replaced those plans, along with its existing defined contribution plans, with a new, comprehensive defined contribution arrangement. This change resulted in a curtailment of the U.K. defined benefit plans, and as required under GAAP, the Company re-measured the defined benefit plans’ assets and liabilities at the amendment date, based on assumptions and market conditions at that date. The Company recognized a curtailment gain of $65 million in the first quarter of 2014, primarily resulting from the recognition of the remaining unamortized prior service credit related to a plan amendment made in December 2012. This gain was mostly offset by the cost of a transition benefit to certain employees most impacted by the amendment.The year-over-year change in the funded status of the Company's pension plans is impacted by the difference between actual and assumed results, particularly with regard to return on assets, and changes in the discount rate, as well as the amount of Company contributions, if any. Unrecognized actuarial losses were approximately $1.8 billion and $2.9 billion at December 31, 2015 for the U.S. plans and non-U.S. plans, respectively, compared with $1.7 billion and $3.2 billion at December 31, 2014. The increase in the U.S. was due to the increase in the discount rate, partially offset by negative returns on plan assets. The decrease in the non-U.S. plans was primarily due to the impact of increases in the discount rates and actual returns on plan assets in 2015 that were lower than the estimated long-term rate of return on plan assets. In the past several years, the amount of actuarial losses has been significantly impacted, both positively and negatively, by actual asset performance and changes in discount rates. The discount rate used to measure plan liabilities increased in both the U.S. and the U.K. (the Company's largest plans) in 2015 after decreasing in 2014. The discount rate increased in 2013 following decreases in each of the four years from 2009 to 2012. An increase in the discount rate decreases the measured plan benefit obligation, resulting in actuarial gains, while a decrease in the discount rate increases the measured plan obligation, resulting in actuarial losses. During 2015, the Company's defined benefit pension plan assets had a loss of 3.9% in the U.S. and gain of 1.2% in the U.K. During 2014, the Company's defined benefit pension plan assets had actual returns of 9.8% and 19.4% in the U.S. and U.K., respectively, and in 2013, actual returns of 12.6%, and 8.6% in the U.S. and U.K., respectively.Overall, based on the measurement at December 31, 2015, expenses related to the Company’s defined benefit pension plans are expected to decrease in 2016 by approximately $165 million from the 2015 expenses of $82 million. This is driven by expense decreases of approximately $80 million in U.S. plans and $85 million in non-U.S. plans. The expense decrease in the U.S. plans results primarily from an increase in the discount rates used to measure plan liabilities and costs and the impact of an increase in the length of the period over which actuarial gains and losses are amortized, moving to average life expectancy for a U.S. plan that has substantially all inactive members. The decrease in the Company’s non-U.S. defined benefit plans is due to generally higher discount rates used to measure plan liabilities and costs, the impact of the amortization period for actuarial gains and losses moving to average life expectancy for plans in Ireland that were frozen and have substantially all inactive members, and a change in how the Company estimates the service and interest cost components of net periodic benefit costs (described in more detail below), partly offset by lower estimated returns to be earned on plan assets.38Historically, service and interest costs were estimated using a single weighted average discount rate derived from the yield curves used to measure the benefit obligations at the beginning of the period. For 2016, the Company has changed the approach used to estimate the service and interest cost components of net periodic benefit cost for its significant non-U.S. plans. This change in approach was made to improve the correlation between the projected benefit cash flows and the corresponding yield curve spot rates and to provide a more precise measurement of service and interest costs. The change does not impact the measurement of the plans’ total projected benefit obligation. The Company has accounted for this change as a change in estimate, that will be applied prospectively beginning in 2016. As a result of this change, service and interest cost in 2016 are expected to be approximately $45 million lower than if the prior approach were used in 2016. This amount is included in the $85 million decrease for non-U.S. plans described above.The Company’s accounting policies for its defined benefit pension plans, including the selection of and sensitivity to assumptions, are discussed below under Management’s Discussion of Critical Accounting Policies. For additional information regarding the Company’s retirement plans, see Note 8 to the consolidated financial statements.In March 2015, the Company amended its U.S. Post-65 retiree medical reimbursement plan (the ""RRA plan""), resulting in its termination, with benefits to certain participants to be paid through December 31, 2016. As a result of the termination of the RRA plan, the Company recognized a net credit of approximately $125 million in the first quarter of 2015.Financing Cash FlowsNet cash used for financing activities was $906 million in 2015 compared with $968 million used in 2014.DebtThe Company increased outstanding debt by approximately $1.0 billion in 2015 and $426 million in 2014.In September 2015, the Company issued $600 million of 3.75% 10.5-year senior notes. The Company used the net proceeds for general corporate purposes.In March 2015, the Company issued $500 million of 2.35% five-year senior notes. The Company used the net proceeds for general corporate purposes.In September 2014, the Company issued $300 million of 2.35% five-year senior notes and $500 million of 3.50% 10.5-year senior notes. In October 2014, a significant portion of the net proceeds of this offering was used to redeem $630 million of debt, including $230 million of 5.75% senior notes due in September 2015 and $400 million of 9.25% senior notes due in 2019. Total cash outflow related to this transaction was approximately $765 million, including a $137 million cost for early redemption, which was reflected as a charge in the consolidated statements of income in the fourth quarter of 2014.During the second quarter of 2014, the Company issued $600 million of 3.5% ten-year senior notes. The net proceeds of this offering were used for general corporate purposes, including the repayment of $320 million of 5.375% senior notes that matured in July 2014.In September 2013, the Company issued $250 million of 2.55% five-year senior notes and $250 million of 4.05% ten-year senior notes. The net proceeds of this offering were used for general corporate purposes, which included a partial redemption of $250 million of the outstanding principal amount of the existing 5.75% senior notes due 2015. The redemption settled in October 2013 with a total cash outflow of approximately $275 million, including a $24 million cost for early redemption.AcquisitionsDuring 2015, the Company paid $47 million of contingent payments related to acquisitions made in prior years. These payments are split between financing and operating cash flows in the consolidated statements of cash flows. The portion of these payments that is reflected as a financing activity is $13 million, which represents payments related to the contingent consideration liability that was recorded on the date of acquisition. Payments related to increases in the contingent consideration liability subsequent to the date of acquisition, which were $34 million in 2015, are reflected as operating cash flows. Remaining estimated future contingent consideration payments of $309 million for acquisitions completed 39in 2015 and in prior years are included in accounts payable and accrued liabilities or other liabilities in the consolidated balance sheet at December 31, 2015. The Company paid deferred purchase consideration related to prior years' acquisitions of $36 million, $25 million and $15 million for the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively. Remaining deferred cash payments of approximately $143 million are included in accounts payable and accrued liabilities or other liabilities in the consolidated balance sheet at December 31, 2015.In 2014, the Company paid $42 million of contingent payments related to acquisitions made in prior periods, of which $30 million was reported as financing cash flows and $12 million as operating cash flows. In 2013, the Company made $17 million of contingent payments related to acquisitions made in prior periods.Credit FacilitiesOn November 24, 2015, the Company and certain of its subsidiaries amended its $1.2 billion facility, discussed below, into a new $1.5 billion multi-currency five-year unsecured revolving credit facility. The interest rate on this facility is based on LIBOR plus a fixed margin which varies with the Company's credit ratings. This facility expires in November 2020 and requires the Company to maintain certain coverage and leverage ratios which are tested quarterly. There were no borrowings outstanding under this facility at December 31, 2015.The Company and certain of its subsidiaries previously maintained a $1.2 billion multi-currency five-year revolving credit facility. The facility was previously due to expire in March 2019 and was in effect until November 2015. There were no borrowings outstanding under this facility at the time it was amended.The Company has a $150 million uncommitted bank credit line. There were no borrowings under this facility at December 31, 2015.In December 2012, the Company closed on a $50 million, three-year delayed draw term loan facility. The interest rate on this facility was based on LIBOR plus an agreed fixed margin which varied with the Company's credit ratings. The loan was repaid and the facility was terminated on October 30, 2015.The Company's senior debt is currently rated A- by Standard & Poor's and Baa1 by Moody's. The Company's short-term debt is currently rated A-2 by Standard & Poor's and P-2 by Moody's. The Company carries a stable outlook from both firms.The Company also maintains other credit facilities, guarantees and letters of credit with various banks, primarily related to operations located outside the United States, aggregating $229 million at December 31, 2015 and $260 million at December 31, 2014. There was $0.4 million outstanding borrowings under these facilities at December 31, 2015 and $0.6 million outstanding borrowings under these facilities at December 31, 2014.Share RepurchasesIn May 2015, the Board of Directors renewed the Company's share repurchase program, allowing management to buy back up to $2 billion of shares going forward. During 2015, the Company repurchased 24.8 million shares of its common stock for total consideration of $1.4 billion at an average price per share of $56.46. As of December 31, 2015, the Company remained authorized to purchase additional shares of its common stock up to a value of approximately $1.2 billion. There is no time limit on this authorization. During 2014, the Company repurchased 15.5 million shares of its common stock for total consideration of $800 million at an average price per share of $51.44.DividendsThe Company paid total dividends of $632 million in 2015 ($1.18 per share), $582 million in 2014 ($1.06 per share) and $533 million in 2013 ($0.96 per share).40Investing Cash FlowsNet cash used for investing activities amounted to $1.3 billion in 2015 compared with $1.2 billion used for investing activities in 2014. The Company made 21 acquisitions in 2015. Cash used for these acquisitions, net of cash acquired, was $952 million. On June 23, 2014, Mercer acquired 34% of the common shares of South Africa-based Alexander Forbes Group Holdings Limited (""Alexander Forbes""). Mercer purchased its stake in Alexander Forbes in two tranches at 7.50 South African Rand per share at an aggregate purchase price of approximately $300 million. The investment in Alexander Forbes is accounted for using the equity method and is included in other assets in the consolidated balance sheets. The Company made 21 acquisitions in 2014. Cash used for these acquisitions, net of cash acquired, was $554 million. The Company received proceeds from distributions on its Investment in Trident II of $100 million in 2013. Trident II fully harvested all its portfolio investments and made final distributions to partners during the fourth quarter of 2013. The Company’s additions to fixed assets and capitalized software, which amounted to $325 million in 2015 and $368 million in 2014, primarily relate to computer equipment purchases, the refurbishing and modernizing of office facilities and software development costs. On February 24, 2015, Mercer purchased shares of common stock of Benefitfocus (NASDAQ:BNFT) constituting approximately 9.9% of BNFT's outstanding capital stock as of the acquisition date. The purchase price for the BNFT shares and certain other rights and other consideration was approximately $75 million.The Company has commitments for potential future investments of approximately $54 million in four private equity funds that invest primarily in financial services companies. Commitments and ObligationsThe following sets forth the Company’s future contractual obligations by the types identified in the table below as of December 31, 2015: Payment due by PeriodContractual Obligations(In millions of dollars)Total Within1 Year 1-3Years 4-5Years After 5YearsCurrent portion of long-term debt$12 $12 $— $— $—Long-term debt4,433 — 525 827 3,081Interest on long-term debt1,496 166 321 289 720Net operating leases2,149 325 566 416 842Service agreements284 172 101 9 2Other long-term obligations508 143 310 50 5Purchase commitments13 13 — — —Total$8,895 $831 $1,823 $1,591 $4,650The above does not include the liability for unrecognized tax benefits of $74 million as the Company is unable to reasonably predict the timing of settlement of these liabilities, other than approximately $3 million that may become payable during 2016. The above does not include the indemnified liabilities discussed in Note 15 as the Company is unable to reasonably predict the timing of settlement of these liabilities. The above does not include net pension liabilities of approximately $1.9 billion because the timing and amount of ultimate payment of such liability is dependent upon future events, including, but not limited to, future returns on plan assets and changes in the discount rate used to measure the liabilities. The amounts of estimated future benefits payments to be made from pension plan assets are disclosed in Note 8 to the consolidated financial statements. In 2016, the Company expects to contribute approximately $26 million and $191 million to its U.S. and non-U.S. pension plans, respectively.41Management’s Discussion of Critical Accounting PoliciesThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (""GAAP"") requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue and expenses, and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. Management considers the policies discussed below to be critical to understanding the Company’s financial statements because their application places the most significant demands on management’s judgment, and requires management to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain. Actual results may differ from those estimates.Legal and Other Loss ContingenciesThe Company and its subsidiaries are subject to numerous claims, lawsuits and proceedings including claims for errors and omissions (""E&O""). GAAP requires that a liability be recorded when a loss is both probable and reasonably estimable. Significant management judgment is required to apply this guidance. The Company utilizes case level reviews by inside and outside counsel, an internal actuarial analysis and other analyses to estimate potential losses. The liability is reviewed quarterly and adjusted as developments warrant. In many cases, the Company has not recorded a liability, other than for legal fees to defend the claim, because we are unable, at the present time, to make a determination that a loss is both probable and reasonably estimable. Given the unpredictability of E&O claims and of litigation that could flow from them, it is possible that an adverse outcome in a particular matter could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s businesses, results of operations, financial condition or cash flow in a given quarterly or annual period.In addition, to the extent that insurance coverage is available, significant management judgment is required to determine the amount of recoveries that are probable of collection under the Company’s various insurance programs.Retirement BenefitsThe Company maintains qualified and non-qualified defined benefit pension and defined contribution plans for its eligible U.S. employees and a variety of defined benefit and defined contribution plans for its eligible non-U.S. employees. The Company’s policy for funding its tax-qualified defined benefit retirement plans is to contribute amounts at least sufficient to meet the funding requirements set forth in U.S. and applicable foreign laws.The Company recognizes the funded status of its over-funded defined benefit pension and retiree medical plans as a net benefit plan asset and its unfunded and underfunded plans as a net benefit plan liability. The gains or losses and prior service costs or credits that have not been recognized as components of net periodic costs are recorded as a component of Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income (""AOCI""), net of tax, in the Company’s consolidated balance sheets. The gains and losses that exceed specified corridors are amortized prospectively out of AOCI over a period that approximates the average remaining service period of active employees, or for plans in which substantially all the participants are inactive, over the remaining life expectancy of the inactive employees.The determination of net periodic pension cost is based on a number of assumptions, including an expected long-term rate of return on plan assets, the discount rate, mortality and assumed rate of salary increase. Significant assumptions used in the calculation of net periodic pension costs and pension liabilities are disclosed in Note 8 to the consolidated financial statements. The Company believes the assumptions for each plan are reasonable and appropriate and will continue to evaluate assumptions at least annually and adjust them as appropriate.42Future pension expense or credits will depend on plan provisions, future investment performance, future assumptions and various other factors related to the populations participating in the pension plans. Holding all other assumptions constant, a half-percentage point change in the rate of return on plan assets and discount rate assumptions would affect net periodic pension cost for the U.S. and U.K. plans, which together comprise approximately 86% of total pension plan liabilities, as follows: 0.5 PercentagePoint Increase 0.5 PercentagePoint Decrease(In millions of dollars)U.S. U.K. U.S. U.K.Assumed Rate of Return on Plan Assets$(22) $(40) $22 $40Discount Rate$(26) $(7) $29 $6Changing the discount rate and leaving the other assumptions constant may not be representative of the impact on expense, because the long-term rates of inflation and salary increases are often correlated with the discount rate. Changes in these assumptions will not necessarily have a linear impact on the net periodic pension cost.The Company contributes to certain health care and life insurance benefits provided to its retired employees. The cost of these post-retirement benefits for employees in the U.S. is accrued during the period up to the date employees are eligible to retire, but is funded by the Company as incurred. The key assumptions and sensitivity to changes in the assumed health care cost trend rate are discussed in Note 8 to the consolidated financial statements.Income TaxesThe Company's tax rate reflects its income, statutory tax rates and tax planning in the various jurisdictions in which it operates. Significant judgment is required in determining the annual effective tax rate and in evaluating uncertain tax positions. The Company reports a liability for unrecognized tax benefits resulting from uncertain tax positions taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. The evaluation of a tax position is a two-step process. The first step involves recognition. The Company determines whether it is more likely than not that a tax position will be sustained upon tax examination, including resolution of any related appeals or litigation, based on only the technical merits of the position. The technical merits of a tax position derive from both statutory and judicial authority (legislation and statutes, legislative intent, regulations, rulings, and case law) and their applicability to the facts and circumstances of the tax position. If a tax position does not meet the more likely than not recognition threshold, the benefit of that position is not recognized in the financial statements. The second step is measurement. A tax position that meets the more likely than not recognition threshold is measured to determine the amount of benefit to recognize in the financial statements. The tax position is measured as the largest amount of benefit that is greater than 50 percent likely of being realized upon ultimate resolution with a taxing authority.Uncertain tax positions are evaluated based upon the facts and circumstances that exist at each reporting period and involve significant management judgment. Subsequent changes in judgment based upon new information may lead to changes in recognition, derecognition, and measurement. Adjustments may result, for example, upon resolution of an issue with the taxing authorities, or expiration of a statute of limitations barring an assessment for an issue.Tax law requires items be included in the Company's tax returns at different times than the items are reflected in the financial statements. As a result, the annual tax expense reflected in the consolidated statements of income is different than that reported in the tax returns. Some of these differences are permanent, such as expenses that are not deductible in the returns, and some differences are temporary and reverse over time, such as depreciation expense. Temporary differences create deferred tax assets and liabilities. Deferred tax liabilities generally represent tax expense recognized in the financial statements for which payment has been deferred, or expense for which a deduction has been taken already in the tax return but the expense has not yet been recognized in the financial statements. Deferred tax assets generally represent items that can be used as a tax deduction or credit in tax returns in future years for which a benefit has already been recorded in the financial statements. In assessing the need for and amount of a valuation allowance for deferred tax assets, the Company considers whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized and adjusts 43the valuation allowance accordingly. The Company evaluates all significant available positive and negative evidence, including the existence of losses in recent years and its forecast of future taxable income by jurisdiction, in assessing the need for a valuation allowance. The Company also considers tax planning strategies that would result in realization of deferred tax assets, and the presence of taxable income in prior period tax filings in jurisdictions that allow for the carryback of tax attributes pursuant to the applicable tax law. The underlying assumptions the Company uses in forecasting future taxable income require significant judgment and take into account the Company's recent performance. The ultimate realization of deferred tax assets is dependent on the generation of future taxable income during the periods in which temporary differences or carry-forwards are deductible or creditable. Valuation allowances are established for deferred tax assets when it is estimated that it is more likely than not that future taxable income will be insufficient to fully use a deduction or credit in that jurisdiction.Fair Value DeterminationsGoodwill Impairment Testing—The Company is required to assess goodwill and any indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment annually, or more frequently if circumstances indicate impairment may have occurred. The Company performs the annual impairment test for each of its reporting units during the third quarter of each year. In accordance with applicable accounting guidance, the Company assesses qualitative factors to determine whether it is necessary to perform the two-step goodwill impairment test. The Company considered numerous factors, which included that the fair value of each reporting unit exceeded its carrying value by a substantial margin in its most recent estimate of reporting unit fair values, whether significant acquisitions or dispositions occurred which might alter the fair value of its reporting units, macroeconomic conditions and their potential impact on reporting unit fair values, actual performance compared with budget and prior projections used in its estimation of reporting unit fair values, industry and market conditions, and the year-over-year change in the Company’s share price.The Company completed its qualitative assessment in the third quarter of 2015 and concluded that a two-step goodwill impairment test was not required in 2015 and that goodwill was not impaired.Share-based PaymentThe guidance for accounting for share-based payments requires, among other things, that the estimated fair value of stock options be charged to earnings. Significant management judgment is required to determine the appropriate assumptions for inputs such as volatility and expected term necessary to estimate option values. In addition, management judgment is required to analyze the terms of the plans and awards granted thereunder to determine if awards will be treated as equity awards or liability awards, as defined by the accounting guidance.As of December 31, 2015, there was $11.8 million of unrecognized compensation cost related to stock option awards. The weighted-average period over which the costs are expected to be recognized is 1.16 years. Also as of December 31, 2015, there was $94.5 million of unrecognized compensation cost related to the Company’s restricted stock, restricted stock unit and performance stock unit awards. The weighted-average period over which that cost is expected to be recognized is approximately 1.1 years.See Note 9 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding accounting for share-based payments.New Accounting PronouncementsNote 1 to the consolidated financial statements contains a summary of the Company’s significant accounting policies, including a discussion of recently issued accounting pronouncements and their impact or potential future impact on the Company’s financial results, if determinable, under the sub-heading ""New Accounting Pronouncements"".44Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market RiskMarket Risk and Credit RiskCertain of the Company’s revenues, expenses, assets and liabilities are exposed to the impact of interest rate changes and fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates and equity markets.Interest Rate Risk and Credit RiskInterest income generated from the Company’s cash investments as well as invested fiduciary funds will vary with the general level of interest rates.The Company had the following investments subject to variable interest rates: (In millions of dollars)December 31, 2015Cash and cash equivalents invested in money market funds, certificates of deposit and time deposits$1,374Fiduciary cash and investments$4,146Based on the above balances, if short-term interest rates increased or decreased by 10%, or 6 basis points, over the course of the year, annual interest income, including interest earned on fiduciary funds, would increase or decrease by approximately $2 million.In addition to interest rate risk, our cash investments and fiduciary fund investments are subject to potential loss of value due to counter-party credit risk. To minimize this risk, the Company and its subsidiaries invest pursuant to a Board approved investment policy. The policy mandates the preservation of principal and liquidity and requires broad diversification with counter-party limits assigned based primarily on credit rating and type of investment. The Company carefully monitors its cash and fiduciary fund investments and will further restrict the portfolio as appropriate to market conditions. The majority of cash and fiduciary fund investments are invested in short-term bank deposits and liquid money market funds.Foreign Currency RiskThe translated values of revenue and expense from the Company’s international operations are subject to fluctuations due to changes in currency exchange rates. The non-U.S. based revenue that is exposed to foreign exchange fluctuations is approximately 51% of total revenue. We periodically use forward contracts and options to limit foreign currency exchange rate exposure on net income and cash flows for specific, clearly defined transactions arising in the ordinary course of business. Although the Company has significant revenue generated in foreign locations which is subject to foreign exchange rate fluctuations, in most cases both the foreign currency revenue and expenses are in the functional currency of the foreign location. As such, under normal circumstances, the U.S. dollar translation of both the revenues and expenses, as well as the potentially offsetting movements of various currencies against the U.S. dollar, generally tends to mitigate the impact on net operating income of foreign currency risk. If foreign exchange rates of major currencies (Euro, Sterling, Australian dollar and Canadian dollar) moved 10% in the same direction against the U.S. dollar compared with the foreign exchange rates in 2015, the Company estimates net operating income would increase or decrease by approximately $50 million. The Company has exposure to approximately 80 foreign currencies overall. Starting at the end of 2014 and continuing through 2015, the U.S. dollar strengthened significantly against most currencies, which had a significant impact on net operating income in 2015. If exchange rates at January 31, 2016 hold constant throughout 2016, the Company estimates the year-over-year impact from conversion of foreign currency earnings will reduce full year income by approximately $50 million. In Continental Europe, the largest amount of revenue from renewals for the Risk & Insurance segment occurs in the first quarter. Consequently, a significant portion of the year-over-year foreign exchange impact is expected to occur in the first quarter.45Equity Price RiskThe Company holds investments in both public and private companies as well as private equity funds that invest primarily in financial services companies. Investments of approximately $20 million are classified as available for sale, approximately $76 million are accounted for using the cost method, which includes the Company's investment in Benefitfocus, and $347 million are accounted for using the equity method, which includes the Company's investments in Alexander Forbes. The investments are subject to risk of changes in market value, which, if determined to be other than temporary, could result in realized impairment losses. The Company periodically reviews the carrying value of such investments to determine if any valuation adjustments are appropriate under the applicable accounting pronouncements.At December 31, 2015, the carrying value of the Company's investment in Alexander Forbes, purchased at 7.50 South African Rand per share, was approximately $230 million. The market value of the Company's shares, based on the closing share price of 5.78 Rand per share, was approximately $166 million. During 2015, the share price of Alexander Forbes ranged from 10.38 Rand to 5.32 Rand. The trading price first dropped below MMC's purchase price at the end of November 2015. The Company considered several factors related to its investment in Alexander Forbes, including its financial position, the near- and long-term prospects of Alexander Forbes and the broader South African economy and capital markets, the length of time and extent to which the market value was below cost, and the Company’s intent and ability to retain the investment for a sufficient period of time to allow for anticipated recovery in market value. As a result, the Company determined the investment was not impaired.OtherA number of lawsuits and regulatory proceedings are pending.

Diluted net income per share from continuing operations was $3.38 in 2016, compared with $2.98 in 2015, reflecting a $169 million increase in net income as well as a 2% decrease in the average number of diluted shares outstanding as compared to the same period last year. Shares issued related to the vesting of share awards and exercise of employee stock options were more than offset by share repurchases over the past four quarters.Risk and Insurance Services operating income increased $214 million, or 14% in 2016 compared with 2015. Revenue increased 4% reflecting a 3% increase on an underlying basis and a 3% increase from acquisitions, partly offset by a decrease resulting from the impact of foreign currency translation of 2%. Expense increased 1% in 2016 compared with 2015.Consulting operating income increased $28 million, or 3%, to $1.1 billion in 2016 compared with 2015, reflecting the combined impact of 1% revenue growth, while expense was flat.Consolidated operating income increased 5% to $2.4 billion in 2015 compared with $2.3 billion in 2014, reflecting the combined impact of a slight decrease in revenue and a 2% decrease in expense as compared with the prior year. The Company achieved this growth despite significant foreign exchange headwinds, caused by the strengthened U.S. dollar, which had the effect of reducing the translated value of the Company's foreign earnings.Risk and Insurance Services operating income increased $30 million, or 2%, in 2015 compared with 2014. Revenue decreased 1%, while expenses decreased 2%.Consulting operating income increased $80 million, or 8%, to $1.1 billion in 2015 compared with 2014, reflecting flat revenue and decrease in expense of 1%. The operating income and revenue in 2015 include a pre-tax gain of $37 million from the sale of Mercer's U.S. defined contribution recordkeeping business.The Company recorded expenses related to the early extinguishment of debt of $137 million in 2014.Consolidated net income attributable to the Company was $1.8 billion in 2016, compared with $1.6 billion in 2015 and $1.5 billion in 2014.29Consolidated Revenue and ExpenseRevenue - Components of ChangeThe Company conducts business in many countries. As a result foreign exchange rate movements may impact period-to-period comparisons of revenue. Similarly, certain other items such as the revenue impact of acquisitions and dispositions, including transfers among businesses, may impact period-to-period comparisons of revenue. Underlying revenue measures the change in revenue from one period to another by isolating these impacts. The impact of foreign currency exchange fluctuations, acquisitions and dispositions, including transfers among businesses, on the Company’s operating revenues by segment was as follows: Year EndedDecember 31, Components of Revenue Change*(In millions, except percentage figures)2016 2015 % Change GAAPRevenue CurrencyImpact Acquisitions/DispositionsImpact UnderlyingRevenueRisk and Insurance Services Marsh$5,976 $5,727 4% (2)% 4 % 3%Guy Carpenter1,141 1,121 2% — — 2%Subtotal7,117 6,848 4% (2)% 3 % 3%Fiduciary Interest Income26 21 Total Risk and Insurance Services7,143 6,869 4% (2)% 3 % 3%Consulting Mercer4,323 4,313 — (2)% — 3%Oliver Wyman Group1,789 1,751 2% (2)% — 3%Total Consulting6,112 6,064 1% (2)% — 3%Corporate/Eliminations(44) (40) Total Revenue$13,211 $12,893 2% (2)% 2 % 3%*Components of revenue change may not add due to rounding.The following table provides more detailed revenue information for certain of the components presented above: Year EndedDecember 31, Components of Revenue Change*(In millions, except percentage figures)2016 2015 % Change GAAPRevenue CurrencyImpact Acquisitions/DispositionsImpact UnderlyingRevenueMarsh: EMEA$1,924 $1,848 4 % (4)% 6 % 2 %Asia Pacific635 636 — — (3)% 3 %Latin America374 380 (2)% (10)% — 8 %Total International2,933 2,864 2 % (4)% 4 % 3 %U.S. / Canada3,043 2,863 6 % — 4 % 2 %Total Marsh$5,976 $5,727 4 % (2)% 4 % 3 %Mercer: Health$1,588 $1,558 2 % (1)% — 3 %Retirement1,215 1,345 (10)% (3)% (6)% —Investments838 818 2 % (3)% — 6 %Talent682 592 15 % (2)% 12 % 5 %Total Mercer$4,323 $4,313 — (2)% — 3 %Underlying revenue measures the change in revenue using consistent currency exchange rates, excluding the impact of certain items that affect comparability such as: acquisitions, dispositions, transfers among businesses and the deconsolidation of Marsh India.

Revenue in the Risk and Insurance Services segment increased 4% in 2016 compared with 2015, or 3% on an underlying basis. Revenue increased 3% and 2% on an underlying basis at Marsh and Guy Carpenter, respectively, as compared with 2015. The Consulting segment's revenue increased 1% on a 31reported basis compared with 2015, or 3% on an underlying basis. Both Mercer and Oliver Wyman Group's revenue increased 3% on an underlying basis compared with 2015. Consolidated revenue was $12.9 billion in 2015, a slight decrease from 2014, but an increase of 4% on an underlying basis. Revenue in the Risk and Insurance Services segment decreased 1% in 2015 compared with 2014, but increased 3% on an underlying basis. Revenue increased 3% and 2% on an underlying basis at Marsh and Guy Carpenter, respectively, as compared with 2014. The Consulting segment's revenue was flat compared with 2014, but increased 5% on an underlying basis. Mercer and Oliver Wyman's revenue increased 4% and 7% on an underlying basis, respectively, compared with 2014.Operating ExpenseConsolidated operating expenses increased 1% in 2016 compared with the same period in 2015 on both a reported and underlying basis. The underlying expense increase reflects higher base salary costs, higher amortization of identified intangible assets and the impact of the net benefit from the termination of the Company's post-65 retiree medical reimbursement plan in the United States (the ""RRA Plan""), which was recorded in the first quarter of 2015, partly offset by decreases in defined benefit plan pension expense and contingent acquisition consideration expense.Consolidated operating expenses decreased 2% in 2015 compared with the same period in 2014, but increased 3% on an underlying basis. The increase in underlying expenses primarily reflects higher base salary, bonus, and higher defined benefit and defined contribution plan costs (""retirement benefit costs""), partly offset by the impact of the net benefit from the termination of the RRA plan.Risk and Insurance ServicesIn the Risk and Insurance Services segment, the Company’s subsidiaries and other affiliated entities act as brokers, agents or consultants for insureds, insurance underwriters and other brokers in the areas of risk management, insurance broking and insurance program management services, primarily under the name of Marsh; and engage in reinsurance broking, catastrophe and financial modeling services and related advisory functions, primarily under the name of Guy Carpenter.Marsh and Guy Carpenter are compensated for brokerage and consulting services primarily through fees paid by clients or commissions paid out of premiums charged by insurance and reinsurance companies. Commission rates vary in amount depending upon the type of insurance or reinsurance coverage provided, the particular insurer or reinsurer, the capacity in which the broker acts and negotiates with clients. Revenues can be affected by premium rate levels in the insurance/reinsurance markets, the amount of risk retained by insurance and reinsurance clients themselves and by the value of the risks that have been insured since commission-based compensation is frequently related to the premiums paid by insureds/reinsureds. In many cases, fee compensation may be negotiated in advance, based on the type of risk, coverage required and service provided by the Company and ultimately, the extent of the risk placed into the insurance market or retained by the client. The trends and comparisons of revenue from one period to the next can be affected by changes in premium rate levels, fluctuations in client risk retention and increases or decreases in the value of risks that have been insured, as well as new and lost business, and the volume of business from new and existing clients.Marsh also receives other compensation from insurance companies, separate from retail fees and commissions. This compensation includes, among other things, payment for consulting and analytics services provided to insurers; administrative and other services provided to or on behalf of insurers (including services relating to the administration and management of quota share, panels and other facilities in which insurers participate); and contingent commissions. Marsh and Guy Carpenter also receive interest income on certain funds (such as premiums and claims proceeds) held in a fiduciary capacity for others. The investment of fiduciary funds is regulated by state and other insurance authorities. These regulations typically require segregation of fiduciary funds and limit the types of investments that may be made with them. Interest income from these investments varies depending on the amount of funds invested and applicable interest rates, both of which vary from time to time. For presentation purposes, fiduciary interest is segregated from the other revenues of Marsh and Guy Carpenter and separately presented within the segment, as shown in the revenue by segments charts presented earlier in this MD&A.32The results of operations for the Risk and Insurance Services segment are presented below: (In millions of dollars, except percentages)2016 2015 2014Revenue$7,143 $6,869 $6,931Compensation and Benefits3,732 3,629 3,781Other Operating Expenses1,658 1,701 1,641Operating Expenses5,390 5,330 5,422Operating Income$1,753 $1,539 $1,509Operating Income Margin24.5% 22.4% 21.8%RevenueRevenue in the Risk and Insurance Services segment increased 4% in 2016 compared with 2015, as a 3% growth in underlying revenue and 3% growth from acquisitions was partly offset by a 2% decrease resulting from the impact of foreign currency translation.

The impact of foreign currency translation reduced expenses by 3%, which was offset by a 3% increase related to acquisitions. The increase in underlying expense reflects higher base salary and incentive compensation costs, higher identified intangible asset amortization expense and the impact of the net benefit from the termination of the RRA plan which was recorded in the first quarter of 2015, offset by a decrease in defined benefit plan pension expense and lower contingent consideration costs related to acquisitions.Expense in the Risk and Insurance Services segment decreased 2% on a reported basis, but increased 2% on an underlying basis, in 2015 compared with 2014.

We believe this combination will align Mercer’s investment management capabilities globally. In addition, moving forward we will refer to our talent business as our career business.The Company conducts business in its Consulting segment through two main business groups, Mercer and Oliver Wyman Group. Mercer provides consulting expertise, advice, services and solutions in the areas of health, retirement, talent and investments. Oliver Wyman Group provides specialized management, economic and brand consulting services.The major component of revenue in the Consulting business is fees paid by clients for advice and services. Mercer, principally through its health line of business, also earns revenue in the form of commissions received from insurance companies for the placement of group (and occasionally individual) insurance contracts, primarily life, health and accident coverages. Revenue for Mercer’s investment management business and certain of Mercer’s defined contribution administration services consists principally of fees based on assets under management or administration.Revenue in the Consulting segment is affected by, among other things, global economic conditions, including changes in clients’ particular industries and markets. Revenue is also affected by competition due to the introduction of new products and services, broad trends in employee demographics, including levels of employment, the effect of government policies and regulations, and fluctuations in interest and foreign exchange rates. Revenues from the provision of investment management services and retirement trust and administrative services are significantly affected by the level of assets under management or administration and securities market performance.For the investment management business, revenues from the majority of funds are included on a gross basis in accordance with U.S. GAAP and include reimbursable expenses incurred by professional staff and sub-advisory fees, and the related expenses are included in other operating expenses.The results of operations for the Consulting segment are presented below: (In millions of dollars, except percentages)2016 2015 2014Revenue$6,112 $6,064 $6,059Compensation and Benefits3,385 3,354 3,398Other Operating Expenses1,624 1,635 1,665Operating Expenses5,009 4,989 5,063Operating Income$1,103 $1,075 $996Operating Income Margin18.1% 17.7% 16.4%RevenueConsulting revenue in 2016 increased 1% compared with 2015, reflecting a 3% increase on an underlying basis offset by a 2% decrease from the impact of foreign currency translation. Mercer’s revenue of $4.3 billion was flat when compared with 2015 but increased 3% on an underlying basis. Mercer's year over year revenue comparison reflects a decrease of 2% from the impact of foreign currency translation. The underlying revenue growth reflects an increase in Investments of 6%, Health of 3% and Talent of 5%, while Retirement remained flat. Oliver Wyman Group’s revenue increased 2% in 2016 compared with 2015, reflecting an increase of 3% on an underlying basis, partly offset by a decrease of 2% from the impact of foreign currency translation.The Consulting segment completed six acquisitions during 2016. Information regarding those acquisitions is included in Note 4 to the consolidated financial statements.Consulting revenue in 2015 was flat compared with 2014, reflecting a 5% increase on an underlying basis and a 2% increase related to acquisitions, offset by a 7% decrease from the impact of foreign currency translation. Mercer’s revenue was $4.3 billion in 2015, a decrease of 1%, but an increase of 4% on an underlying basis. The year over year revenue change also reflects an increase of 2% from acquisitions/dispositions, offset by a decrease of 7% from the impact of foreign currency translation. Mercer's revenue in 2015 includes a $37 million gain from the disposal of its U.S. defined contribution recordkeeping business, and is reflected in the 2% impact from acquisitions/dispositions. The underlying revenue growth 34reflects an increase in Investments of 7%, Health of 6% and Talent of 5%, while Retirement remained flat. Oliver Wyman’s revenue increased 3% in 2015 compared with 2014, reflecting an increase of 7% on an underlying basis and a 2% increase from acquisitions, partly offset by a decrease of 6% from the impact of foreign currency translation.The Consulting segment completed eight acquisitions during 2015.ExpenseConsulting expense in 2016 was essentially flat compared with 2015, reflecting an increase of 2% on an underlying basis offset by a 2% decrease from the impact of foreign currency translation. The increase in underlying expense reflects higher base salaries and the impact of the net benefit from the termination of the RRA plan which was recorded in the first quarter of 2015, partly offset by lower defined benefit plan pension expense.Consulting expense in 2015 decreased 1%, reflecting increases of 4% in underlying expenses and 1% related to acquisitions, partly offset by a 6% decrease from the impact of foreign currency translation. The increase in underlying expense reflects the impact of higher base salaries and incentive compensation costs and higher retirement benefit costs, partly offset by the impact of the net benefit from the termination of the RRA plan.Corporate and OtherCorporate expense in 2016 was $192 million compared with $195 million in 2015, reflecting lower executive compensation and lower defined benefit pension costs. Corporate expense in 2015 was $195 million compared with $204 million in 2014. The lower expenses in 2015 were primarily due to the cost of non-recurring corporate initiatives which occurred in 2014, which included strengthening cyber security protections, expenses related to strategic investments and corporate transformation efforts, primarily within the HR and Finance functions. Discontinued OperationsAs part of the disposal transactions for Putnam and Kroll, the Company provided certain indemnities, primarily related to pre-transaction tax uncertainties and legal contingencies. In accordance with applicable accounting guidance, liabilities were established related to these indemnities at the time of the sales and reflected as a reduction of the gain on disposal. Discontinued operations includes charges or credits resulting from the settlement or resolution of the indemnified matters, as well as adjustments to the liabilities related to such matters.On December 31, 2014, an agreement was reached between Putnam and the Massachusetts Department of Revenue (""DOR"") regarding a tax dispute, which was covered under the indemnity agreement referred to above. In January 2015, all necessary approvals were received, the agreement was executed and the tax was paid. Concurrently, Putnam and the Company executed a settlement agreement to resolve all remaining matters under the indemnity agreement. The Company recorded a gain, net of federal tax, of approximately $28 million in 2014 related to the settlement with Putnam.Summarized Statements of Income data for discontinued operations are as follows:For the Years Ended December 31,(In millions of dollars, except per share figures)2016 2015 2014Income (loss) from discontinued operations, net of tax$— $— $—Disposals of discontinued operations — (5) 42Income tax (credit) expense — (5) 16Disposals of discontinued operations, net of tax— — 26Discontinued operations, net of tax$— $— $26Discontinued operations, net of tax per share —Basic$— $— $0.05—Diluted$— $— $0.0435Other Corporate ItemsInterestInterest income earned on corporate funds amounted to $5 million in 2016 compared with $13 million in 2015. The decrease is due to the combined effects of a lower level of invested funds and lower interest rates. Interest expense was $189 million in 2016 compared with $163 million in 2015 due to higher average debt outstanding during 2015.Interest income earned on corporate funds amounted to $13 million in 2015 compared with $21 million in 2014, primarily due to a lower level of invested funds in 2015. Interest expense was $163 million in 2015 compared with $165 million in 2014, due to lower average interest rates in 2015 compared with the prior year, partly offset by higher average debt outstanding during 2015.Cost of Extinguishment of DebtIn October 2014, the Company redeemed $230 million of its 2015 notes and $400 million of its 2019 notes. The Company acquired the notes at market value plus a make-whole premium based on the terms of the original indenture, which exceeded the carrying value of the notes and resulted in a cost of $137 million in the fourth quarter of 2014.Investment IncomeThe caption ""Investment income (loss)"" in the consolidated statements of income comprises realized and unrealized gains and losses from investments recognized in current earnings. It includes, when applicable, other-than-temporary declines in the value of debt and available-for-sale securities and equity method gains or losses on its investment in private equity funds. The Company's investments may include direct investments in insurance, consulting and related companies and investments in private equity funds. The Company recorded net investment income of less than $1 million in 2016 and $38 million in 2015. Net investment income in 2015 was primarily related to the general partner carried interest from Trident III. Stonepoint Capital, the investment manager of Trident III, substantially liquidated the remaining two investments of Trident III during the third quarter of 2015, which resulted in the Company recognizing its remaining deferred performance fees.Income TaxesThe Company's consolidated effective tax rate was 27.6%, 29.1% and 28.5% in 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively. These rates reflect foreign operations which are taxed at rates below the U.S. statutory tax rate, including the effect of repatriation, as well as the impact of discrete tax matters such as tax legislation, changes in valuation allowances, nontaxable adjustments to contingent acquisition consideration and the true-up of the tax provision to amounts filed in the Company's tax returns. In 2016, pre-tax income in the U.K., Canada, Luxembourg, Australia, Bermuda and Ireland accounted for approximately 60% of the Company's total non-U.S. pre-tax income, with effective rates in those countries of 23% (excluding certain discrete adjustments), 27%, 2%, 30%, 1% and 13%, respectively. The Company anticipates its non-U.S. operations will continue to incur taxes at rates below the U.S. federal tax rate of 35% under current U.S. law. The Company's U.S. revenue over the past three years has been approximately 50% of total revenue, while over that period the pre-tax income from U.S. locations has been approximately 25% of total pre-tax income.As a U.S.-domiciled parent holding company, Marsh & McLennan Companies, Inc. is the issuer of essentially all of the Company's external indebtedness, and incurs the related interest expense in the U.S. Further, most senior executive and oversight functions are conducted in the U.S. and the associated costs are incurred primarily in the United States.The effective tax rate may vary significantly from period to period for the foreseeable future. It is sensitive to the geographic mix of and repatriation of the Company's earnings, which may result in higher or lower effective tax rates. A proportional increase in U.S. pre-tax income will tend to increase the effective tax rate because U.S. federal and state corporate tax rates exceed tax rates applicable outside the U.S. Losses in certain jurisdictions cannot be offset by earnings from other operations, and may require valuation allowances that affect the rate, depending on estimates of the realizability of associated deferred tax assets. The effective tax rate is also sensitive to changes in unrecognized tax benefits, including the impact of settled tax audits and expired statutes of limitation.The realization of deferred tax assets depends on generating future taxable income during the periods in which the tax benefits are deductible or creditable. Tax liabilities are determined and assessed 36jurisdictionally by legal entity or filing group. Certain taxing jurisdictions allow or require combined or consolidated tax filings. The Company assessed the realizability of its deferred tax assets. The Company considered all available evidence, including the existence of a recent history of losses, placing particular weight on evidence that could be objectively verified. A valuation allowance was recorded to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount that the Company believes is more likely than not to be realized.Changes in tax laws, rulings, policies or related legal and regulatory interpretations occur frequently and may also have significant favorable or adverse impacts on our effective tax rate. For example, political activity surrounding proposals for fundamental U.S. tax reform have recently intensified and such reform, if enacted, could have a significant impact on the Company's effective tax rate.Liquidity and Capital ResourcesThe Company is organized as a legal entity separate and distinct from its operating subsidiaries. As the Company does not have significant operations of its own, the Company is dependent upon dividends and other payments from its operating subsidiaries to pay principal and interest on its outstanding debt obligations, pay dividends to stockholders, repurchase its shares and pay corporate expenses. The Company also provides financial support to its operating subsidiaries for acquisitions, investments and certain parts of their business that require liquidity, such as the capital markets business of Guy Carpenter. Other sources of liquidity include borrowing facilities discussed below in financing cash flows.The Company derives a significant portion of its revenue and operating profit from operating subsidiaries located outside of the United States. Funds from those operating subsidiaries are regularly repatriated to the United States out of annual earnings. At December 31, 2016, the Company had approximately $850 million of cash and cash equivalents in its foreign operations, substantially all of which is considered to be permanently invested in those operations to fund foreign investments and working capital needs. The non-U.S. cash and cash equivalents considered permanently reinvested includes $144 million of operating funds required to be maintained for regulatory requirements or as collateral under certain captive insurance arrangements. The Company expects to continue its practice of repatriating foreign funds from its non-U.S. operating subsidiaries out of current annual earnings. While management does not foresee a need to repatriate the funds which are currently deemed permanently invested, if facts or circumstances change, management could elect to repatriate them, if necessary, which could result in higher effective tax rates in the future. During 2016, the Company recorded foreign currency translation adjustments which reduced net equity by $778 million. Continued strengthening of the U.S. dollar against foreign currencies would further reduce the translated U.S. dollar value of the Company’s net investments in its non-U.S. subsidiaries, as well as the translated U.S. dollar value of cash repatriations from those subsidiaries.Cash on our consolidated balance sheets includes funds available for general corporate purposes. Funds held on behalf of clients in a fiduciary capacity are segregated and shown separately in the consolidated balance sheets as an offset to fiduciary liabilities. Fiduciary funds cannot be used for general corporate purposes, and should not be considered as a source of liquidity for the Company.Operating Cash FlowsThe Company generated $2.0 billion of cash from operations in 2016, compared with $1.9 billion in 2015. These amounts reflect the net income of the Company during those periods, excluding gains or losses from investments, adjusted for non-cash charges and changes in working capital which relate primarily to the timing of payments of accrued liabilities or receipts of assets and pension contributions.Pension-Related ItemsContributionsDuring 2016, the Company contributed $27 million to its U.S. pension plans and $187 million to non-U.S. pension plans. In 2015, the Company contributed $29 million to U.S. plans and $166 million to non-U.S. plans.In the United States, contributions to the tax-qualified defined benefit plans are based on ERISA guidelines and the Company generally expects to maintain a funded status of 80% or more of the liability determined under the ERISA guidelines. There was no ERISA funding requirement for the U.S. qualified plan in 2016. The Company expects to fund approximately $32 million to its U.S. pension plans in 2017, including $6 million to its U.S. qualified plan to meet ERISA funding requirements.37The Company contributed $91 million to the U.K. plans in 2016, including an expense allowance of approximately $9 million. Based on the funding test carried out at November 1, 2016, the Company contributions to the U.K. plans in 2017 are expected to be approximately $125 million, including the expense allowance.Outside the United States, the Company has a large number of non-U.S. defined benefit pension plans, the largest of which are in the U.K., which comprise approximately 81% of non-U.S. plan assets at December 31, 2016. Contribution rates for non-U.S. plans are generally based on local funding practices and statutory requirements, which may differ significantly from measurements under U.S. GAAP. In the U.K., the assumptions used to determine pension contributions are the result of legally-prescribed negotiations between the Company and the plans' trustee that typically occurs every three years in conjunction with the actuarial valuation of the plans. Currently, this results in a lower funded status than under U.S. GAAP and may result in contributions irrespective of the U.S. GAAP funded status. In November 2016, the Company and the Trustee of the U.K. Defined Benefits Plans agreed to a funding deficit recovery plan for the U.K. defined benefit pension plans. The current agreement with the Trustee sets out the annual deficit contributions which would be due based on the deficit at December 31, 2015. The funding level is subject to re-assessment, in most cases on November 1 of each year. If the funding level on November 1 is sufficient, no deficit funding contributions will be required in the following year, and the contribution amount will be deferred. As part of a long-term strategy, which depends on having greater influence over asset allocation and overall investment decisions, in November 2016 the Company renewed its agreement to support annual deficit contributions by the U.K. operating companies under certain circumstances, up to GBP 450 million over a seven-year period.In the aggregate, the Company expects to contribute approximately $224 million to its non-U.S. defined benefit plans in 2017, comprising approximately $99 million to plans outside of the U.K. and $125 million to the U.K. plans.Changes to Pension PlansEffective September 1, 2015, the Company divided its U.S. qualified defined benefit plan to provide enhanced flexibility to manage the risk associated with those participants not receiving benefit accruals. The existing plan was amended to cover only the retirees currently receiving benefits and terminated vested participants as of August 1, 2015. The Company's active participants as of that date were transferred into a newly established, legally separate qualified defined benefit plan. The benefits offered to the plans' participants were unchanged. As a result of the plan amendment and establishment of the new plan, the Company re-measured the assets and liabilities of the two plans as required under U.S. GAAP, based on assumptions and market conditions at the amendment date. The net periodic pension expense recognized in 2015 reflects the weighted average costs of the December 31, 2014 measurement and the September 1, 2015 re-measurement.The Company continues to manage the cost and assess the competitiveness of its benefits programs, and also to manage the risks related to its defined benefit pension plan liabilities. In October 2016, the Company modified its U.S. defined benefit pension plans to discontinue further benefit accruals for participants after December 31, 2016. At the same time, the Company amended its U.S. defined contribution retirement plans for most of its U.S. employees to add an automatic Company contribution equal to 4% of eligible base pay beginning on January 1, 2017. This new Company contribution, together with the Company’s current matching contribution, provides eligible U.S. employees with the opportunity to receive a total contribution of up to 7% of eligible base pay. As required under GAAP, the defined benefit plans that were significantly impacted by the modification were re-measured in October 2016 using market data and assumptions as of the modification date. The net periodic pension expense recognized in 2016 reflects the weighted average costs of the December 31, 2015 measurement and the October 2016 re-measurement. In addition, the U.S. qualified plans were merged effective December 30, 2016, since no participants would be receiving benefit accruals after December 2016.After completion of a consultation period with affected colleagues, in January 2014, the Company amended its U.K. defined benefit pension plans to close those plans to future benefit accruals effective August 1, 2014 and replaced those plans, along with its existing defined contribution plans, with a new, comprehensive defined contribution arrangement. This change resulted in a curtailment of the U.K. defined benefit plans, and as required under GAAP, the Company re-measured the defined benefit plans’ assets and liabilities at the amendment date, based on assumptions and market conditions at that date. The Company recognized a curtailment gain of $65 million in the first quarter of 2014, primarily resulting from the recognition of the remaining unamortized prior service credit related to a plan amendment made 38in December 2012. This gain was mostly offset by the cost of a transition benefit to certain employees most impacted by the amendment.Effective August 1, 2015, the Company amended its Ireland defined benefit pension plans to close those plans to future benefit accruals and replaced those plans with a defined contribution arrangement. The Company re-measured the assets and liabilities of the plans, based on assumptions and market conditions on the amendment date.Changes in Funded Status and ExpenseThe year-over-year change in the funded status of the Company's pension plans is impacted by the difference between actual and assumed results, particularly with regard to return on assets, and changes in the discount rate, as well as the amount of Company contributions, if any. Unrecognized actuarial losses were approximately $1.7 billion and $3.1 billion at December 31, 2016 for the U.S. plans and non-U.S. plans, respectively, compared with $1.8 billion and $2.9 billion at December 31, 2015. The decrease in the U.S. was primarily due to the modification of the U.S. plans mentioned above. The increase in the non-U.S. plans was primarily due to the impact of decreases in the discount rates partly offset by actual returns on plan assets in 2016 that were higher than the estimated long-term rate of return on plan assets. In the past several years, the amount of actuarial losses has been significantly impacted, both positively and negatively, by actual asset performance and changes in discount rates. The discount rate used to measure plan liabilities decreased in both the U.S. and the U.K. (the Company's largest plans) in 2016 after increasing in 2015. The increase in 2015 followed a decrease in 2014. An increase in the discount rate decreases the measured plan benefit obligation, resulting in actuarial gains, while a decrease in the discount rate increases the measured plan obligation, resulting in actuarial losses. During 2016, the Company's defined benefit pension plan assets had actual returns of 9.8% and 22.1% in the U.S. and U.K., respectively. During 2015, the Company's defined benefit pension plan assets had a loss of 3.9% in the U.S. and gain of 1.2% in the U.K. During 2014, the Company's defined benefit pension plan assets had actual returns of 9.8% and 19.4% in the U.S. and U.K., respectively.Overall, based on the measurement at December 31, 2016, expenses related to the Company’s defined benefit pension plans are expected to decrease in 2017 by approximately $120 million from 2016. This is driven by expense decreases in U.S. plans resulting from the modification of those plans which discontinued further benefit accruals for participants after December 31, 2016, as mentioned above. This decrease will be partially offset by an increase in defined contribution expense due to the additional automatic company contribution also mentioned above. The impact of the reduction in expense from the modification of the U.S. plans offset by the additional expense from the additional Company contributions to the defined contribution plan is expected to result in a net expense reduction of approximately $30 million, net of bonus. Pension expenses in the Company’s non-U.S. defined benefit plans are expected to increase approximately $5 million from 2016.Historically, service and interest costs were estimated using a single weighted average discount rate derived from the yield curves used to measure the benefit obligations at the beginning of the period. In 2016, the Company changed the approach used to estimate the service and interest cost components of net periodic benefit cost for its significant non-U.S. plans. This change in approach was made to improve the correlation between the projected benefit cash flows and the corresponding yield curve spot rates and to provide a more precise measurement of service and interest costs. The change did not impact the measurement of the plans’ total projected benefit obligation. The Company accounted for this change as a change in estimate, that was applied prospectively beginning in 2016 and resulted in pension expense being approximately $45 million lower than if the prior approach had been used.The Company’s accounting policies for its defined benefit pension plans, including the selection of and sensitivity to assumptions, are discussed below under Management’s Discussion of Critical Accounting Policies. For additional information regarding the Company’s retirement plans, see Note 8 to the consolidated financial statements.In March 2015, the Company amended the RRA, resulting in its termination, with benefits to certain participants to be paid through December 31, 2016. As a result of the termination of the RRA plan, the Company recognized a net credit of approximately $125 million in the first quarter of 2015.39Financing Cash FlowsNet cash used for financing activities was $1.1 billion in 2016 compared with $906 million used in 2015.DebtThe Company increased outstanding debt by approximately $400 million in 2016 and $1 billion in 2015.The Company has established a short-term debt financing program of up to $1.5 billion through the issuance of commercial paper. The proceeds from the issuance of commercial paper are used for general corporate purposes. The Company had $50 million of commercial paper outstanding at December 31, 2016 at an effective interest rate of 1%.In March 2016, the Company issued $350 million of 3.30% seven-year senior notes. In September 2015, the Company issued $600 million of 3.75% 10.5-year senior notes, and in March 2015, the Company issued $500 million of 2.35% five-year senior notes. The Company used the net proceeds from these issuances for general corporate purposes.In September 2014, the Company issued $300 million of 2.35% five-year senior notes and $500 million of 3.50% 10.5-year senior notes. In October 2014, a significant portion of the net proceeds of this offering was used to redeem $630 million of debt, including $230 million of 5.75% senior notes due in September 2015 and $400 million of 9.25% senior notes due in 2019. Total cash outflow related to this transaction was approximately $765 million, including a $137 million cost for early redemption, which was reflected as a charge in the consolidated statements of income in the fourth quarter of 2014.During the second quarter of 2014, the Company issued $600 million of 3.5% ten-year senior notes. The net proceeds of this offering were used for general corporate purposes, including the repayment of $320 million of 5.375% senior notes that matured in July 2014.In January 2017, the Company issued $500 million of 2.75% senior notes due in 2022 and $500 million of 4.35% senior notes due in 2047. The Company intends to use the net proceeds for general corporate purposes, which may include the repayment of a $250 million debt maturity in April 2017.Credit FacilitiesThe Company and certain of its subsidiaries maintain a $1.5 billion multi-currency five-year unsecured revolving credit facility. The interest rate on this facility is based on LIBOR plus a fixed margin which varies with the Company's credit ratings. This facility expires in November 2020 and requires the Company to maintain certain coverage and leverage ratios which are tested quarterly. There were no borrowings outstanding under this facility at December 31, 2016.The Company also maintains other credit facilities, guarantees and letters of credit with various banks, aggregating $376 million at December 31, 2016 and $379 million at December 31, 2015. There were $1.6 million of outstanding borrowings under these facilities at December 31, 2016 and $0.4 million of outstanding borrowings under these facilities at December 31, 2015.The Company's senior debt is currently rated A- by Standard & Poor's and Baa1 by Moody's. The Company's short-term debt is currently rated A-2 by Standard & Poor's and P-2 by Moody's. The Company carries a stable outlook from both firms.Share RepurchasesDuring 2016, the Company repurchased 12.7 million shares of its common stock for total consideration of $800 million at an average price per share of $63.18. In November 2016, the Board of Directors authorized an increase in the Company’s share repurchase program, which supersedes any prior authorization, allowing management to buy back up to $2.5 billion of the Company’s common stock going forward. As of December 31, 2016, the Company remained authorized to purchase additional shares of its common stock up to a value of approximately $2.4 billion. There is no time limit on this authorization. During 2015, the Company repurchased 24.8 million shares of its common stock for total consideration of $1.4 billion at an average price per share of $56.46.DividendsThe Company paid total dividends of $682 million in 2016 ($1.30 per share), $632 million in 2015 ($1.18 per share) and $582 million in 2014 ($1.06 per share).40Contingent Payments Related To AcquisitionsDuring 2016, the Company paid $86 million of contingent payments related to acquisitions made in prior years. These payments are split between financing and operating cash flows in the consolidated statements of cash flows. Payments of $44 million related to the contingent consideration liability that was recorded on the date of acquisition are reflected as financing cash flows. Payments related to increases in the contingent consideration liability subsequent to the date of acquisition of $42 million are reflected as operating cash flows. Remaining estimated future contingent consideration payments of $241 million for acquisitions completed in 2016 and in prior years are included in accounts payable and accrued liabilities or other liabilities in the consolidated balance sheet at December 31, 2016. The Company paid deferred purchase consideration related to prior years' acquisitions of $54 million, $36 million and $25 million in the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively. Remaining deferred cash payments of approximately $113 million are included in accounts payable and accrued liabilities or other liabilities in the consolidated balance sheet at December 31, 2016.In 2015, the Company paid $47 million of contingent payments related to acquisitions made in prior periods, of which $13 million was reported as financing cash flows and $34 million as operating cash flows. In 2014, the Company made $42 million of contingent payments related to acquisitions made in prior periods, of which $30 million was reported as financing cash flows and $12 million as operating cash flows.Investing Cash FlowsNet cash used for investing activities amounted to $1.1 billion in 2016 compared with $1.3 billion used for investing activities in 2015. The Company paid $813 million and $952 million, net of cash acquired, for acquisitions it made during 2016 and 2015, respectively.On February 24, 2015, Mercer purchased shares of common stock of Benefitfocus (NASDAQ:BNFT) constituting approximately 9.9% of BNFT's outstanding capital stock as of the acquisition date. The purchase price for the BNFT shares and certain other rights and other consideration was approximately $75 million. In 2015, the Company elected to account for this investment under the cost method of accounting as the shares purchased were categorized as restricted. Effective December 31, 2016, these shares are no longer considered restricted for the purpose of determining if they are marketable securities under GAAP, and are accounted for as available for sale securities and included in other assets in the consolidated balance sheets.On June 23, 2014, Mercer acquired 34% of the common shares of South Africa-based Alexander Forbes Group Holdings Limited (""Alexander Forbes""). Mercer purchased its stake in Alexander Forbes in two tranches at 7.50 South African Rand per share at an aggregate purchase price of approximately $300 million. The investment in Alexander Forbes is accounted for using the equity method and is included in other assets in the consolidated balance sheets. The Company’s additions to fixed assets and capitalized software, which amounted to $253 million in 2016 and $325 million in 2015, primarily relate to computer equipment purchases, the refurbishing and modernizing of office facilities and software development costs.The Company has commitments for potential future investments of approximately $45 million in four private equity funds that invest primarily in financial services companies. 41Commitments and ObligationsThe following sets forth the Company’s future contractual obligations by the types identified in the table below as of December 31, 2016: Payment due by PeriodContractual Obligations(In millions of dollars)Total Within1 Year 1-3Years 4-5Years After 5YearsCommercial paper$50 $50 $— $— $—Current portion of long-term debt262 262 — — —Long-term debt5,520 — 575 1,029 3,916Interest on long-term debt2,128 193 405 363 1,167Net operating leases2,173 326 564 424 859Service agreements351 225 115 10 1Other long-term obligations385 164 204 12 5Total$10,869 $1,220 $1,863 $1,838 $5,948The above includes the senior notes issued in January 2017. The above does not include the liability for unrecognized tax benefits of $65 million as the Company is unable to reasonably predict the timing of settlement of these liabilities, other than approximately $2 million that may become payable during 2017. The above does not include net pension liabilities of approximately $1.9 billion because the timing and amount of ultimate payment of such liability is dependent upon future events, including, but not limited to, future returns on plan assets and changes in the discount rate used to measure the liabilities. The amounts of estimated future benefits payments to be made from pension plan assets are disclosed in Note 8 to the consolidated financial statements. In 2017, the Company expects to contribute approximately $32 million and $224 million to its U.S. and non-U.S. defined benefit pension plans, respectively.Management’s Discussion of Critical Accounting PoliciesThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (""GAAP"") requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue and expenses, and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. Management considers the policies discussed below to be critical to understanding the Company’s financial statements because their application places the most significant demands on management’s judgment, and requires management to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain. Actual results may differ from those estimates.Legal and Other Loss ContingenciesThe Company and its subsidiaries are subject to numerous claims, lawsuits and proceedings including claims for errors and omissions (""E&O""). GAAP requires that a liability be recorded when a loss is both probable and reasonably estimable. Significant management judgment is required to apply this guidance. The Company utilizes case level reviews by inside and outside counsel, an internal actuarial analysis by Oliver Wyman Group, a subsidiary of the Company, and other analyses to estimate potential losses. The liability is reviewed quarterly and adjusted as developments warrant. In many cases, the Company has not recorded a liability, other than for legal fees to defend the claim, because we are unable, at the present time, to make a determination that a loss is both probable and reasonably estimable. Given the unpredictability of E&O claims and of litigation that could flow from them, it is possible that an adverse outcome in a particular matter could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s businesses, results of operations, financial condition or cash flow in a given quarterly or annual period.In addition, to the extent that insurance coverage is available, significant management judgment is required to determine the amount of recoveries that are probable of collection under the Company’s various insurance programs.Retirement BenefitsThe Company maintains qualified and non-qualified defined benefit pension and defined contribution plans for its eligible U.S. employees and a variety of defined benefit and defined contribution plans for its eligible non-U.S. employees. The Company’s policy for funding its tax-qualified defined benefit retirement 42plans is to contribute amounts at least sufficient to meet the funding requirements set forth in U.S. and applicable foreign laws.The Company recognizes the funded status of its over-funded defined benefit pension and retiree medical plans as a net benefit plan asset and its unfunded and underfunded plans as a net benefit plan liability. The gains or losses and prior service costs or credits that have not been recognized as components of net periodic costs are recorded as a component of Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income (""AOCI""), net of tax, in the Company’s consolidated balance sheets. The gains and losses that exceed specified corridors are amortized prospectively out of AOCI over a period that approximates the remaining life expectancy of participants in plans where substantially all participants are inactive or the average remaining service period of active participants for plans with active participants.The determination of net periodic pension cost is based on a number of assumptions, including an expected long-term rate of return on plan assets, the discount rate, mortality and assumed rate of salary increase. The assumptions used in the calculation of net periodic pension costs and pension liabilities are disclosed in Note 8 to the consolidated financial statements. The assumptions for expected rate of return on plan assets and the discount rate are discussed in more detail below.The long-term rate of return on plan assets assumption is determined for each plan based on the facts and circumstances that exist as of the measurement date, and the specific portfolio mix of each plan’s assets. The Company utilizes a model developed by Mercer, a subsidiary of the Company, to assist in the determination of this assumption. The model takes into account several factors, including: actual and target portfolio allocation; investment, administrative and trading expenses incurred directly by the plan trust; historical portfolio performance; relevant forward-looking economic analysis; and expected returns, variances and correlations for different asset classes. These measures are used to determine probabilities using standard statistical techniques to calculate a range of expected returns on the portfolio. The target asset allocation for the U.S. Plans is 64% equities and equity alternatives and 36% fixed income. At the end of 2016, the actual allocation for the U.S. Plans was 65% equities and equity alternatives and 35% fixed income. The target asset allocation for the U.K. Plans, which comprise approximately 81% of non-U.S. Plan assets, is 48% equities and equity alternatives and 52% fixed income. At the end of 2016, the actual allocation for the U.K. Plans was 48% equities and equity alternatives and 52% fixed income.The discount rate selected for each U.S. plan is based on a model bond portfolio with coupons and redemptions that closely match the expected liability cash flows from the plan. Discount rates for non-U.S. plans are based on appropriate bond indices adjusted for duration; in the U.K., the plan duration is reflected using the Mercer yield curve.The table below shows the weighted average assumed rate of return and the discount rate at the December 31, 2016 measurement date (for measuring pension expense in 2017) for the total Company, the U.S. and the Rest of World (""ROW""). Total Company U.S. ROWAssumed Rate of Return on Plan Assets6.64% 7.95% 6.07%Discount Rate3.40% 4.58% 2.69%Holding all other assumptions constant, a half-percentage point change in the rate of return on plan assets and discount rate assumptions would affect net periodic pension cost for the U.S. and U.K. plans, which together comprise approximately 86% of total pension plan liabilities, as follows: 0.5 PercentagePoint Increase 0.5 PercentagePoint Decrease(In millions of dollars)U.S. U.K. U.S. U.K.Assumed Rate of Return on Plan Assets$(23) $(36) $23 $36Discount Rate$(2) $(5) $2 $2The impact of discount rate changes shown above relates to the increase or decrease in actuarial gains or losses being amortized through net periodic pension cost, as well as the increase or decrease in interest expense, with all other facts and assumptions held constant. It does not contemplate nor include potential future impacts a change in the interest rate environment and discount rates might cause, such 43as the impact on the market value of the plans’ assets. Changing the discount rate and leaving the other assumptions constant also may not be representative of the impact on expense, because the long-term rates of inflation and salary increases are often correlated with the discount rate. Changes in these assumptions will not necessarily have a linear impact on the net periodic pension cost.The Company contributes to certain health care and life insurance benefits provided to its retired employees. The cost of these post-retirement benefits for employees in the U.S. is accrued during the period up to the date employees are eligible to retire, but is funded by the Company as incurred. The key assumptions and sensitivity to changes in the assumed health care cost trend rate are discussed in Note 8 to the consolidated financial statements.Income TaxesThe Company's tax rate reflects its income, statutory tax rates and tax planning in the various jurisdictions in which it operates. Significant judgment is required in determining the annual effective tax rate and in evaluating uncertain tax positions. The Company reports a liability for unrecognized tax benefits resulting from uncertain tax positions taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. The evaluation of a tax position is a two-step process. The first step involves recognition. The Company determines whether it is more likely than not that a tax position will be sustained upon tax examination, including resolution of any related appeals or litigation, based on only the technical merits of the position. The technical merits of a tax position derive from both statutory and judicial authority (legislation and statutes, legislative intent, regulations, rulings, and case law) and their applicability to the facts and circumstances of the tax position. If a tax position does not meet the more-likely-than-not recognition threshold, the benefit of that position is not recognized in the financial statements. The second step is measurement. A tax position that meets the more-likely-than-not recognition threshold is measured to determine the amount of benefit to recognize in the financial statements. The tax position is measured as the largest amount of benefit that is greater than 50 percent likely of being realized upon ultimate resolution with a taxing authority.Uncertain tax positions are evaluated based upon the facts and circumstances that exist at each reporting period and involve significant management judgment. Subsequent changes in judgment based upon new information may lead to changes in recognition, derecognition, and measurement. Adjustments may result, for example, upon resolution of an issue with the taxing authorities, or expiration of a statute of limitations barring an assessment for an issue.Certain items are included in the Company's tax returns at different times than the items are reflected in the financial statements. As a result, the annual tax expense reflected in the consolidated statements of income is different than that reported in the tax returns. Some of these differences are permanent, such as expenses that are not deductible in the returns, and some differences are temporary and reverse over time, such as depreciation expense. Temporary differences create deferred tax assets and liabilities, which are measured at existing tax rates. Deferred tax liabilities generally represent tax expense recognized in the financial statements for which payment has been deferred, or expense for which a deduction has been taken already in the tax return but the expense has not yet been recognized in the financial statements. Deferred tax assets generally represent items that can be used as a tax deduction or credit in tax returns in future years for which a benefit has already been recorded in the financial statements. In assessing the need for and amount of a valuation allowance for deferred tax assets, the Company considers whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized and adjusts the valuation allowance accordingly. The Company evaluates all significant available positive and negative evidence, including the existence of losses in recent years and its forecast of future taxable income by jurisdiction, in assessing the need for a valuation allowance. The Company also considers tax planning strategies that would result in realization of deferred tax assets, and the presence of taxable income in prior period tax filings in jurisdictions that allow for the carryback of tax attributes pursuant to the applicable tax law. The underlying assumptions the Company uses in forecasting future taxable income require significant judgment and take into account the Company's recent performance. The ultimate realization of deferred tax assets is dependent on the generation of future taxable income during the periods in which temporary differences or carry-forwards are deductible or creditable. Valuation allowances are established for deferred tax assets when it is estimated that it is more likely than not that future taxable income will be insufficient to fully use a deduction or credit in that jurisdiction. 44Fair Value DeterminationsGoodwill Impairment Testing—The Company is required to assess goodwill and any indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment annually, or more frequently if circumstances indicate impairment may have occurred. The Company performs the annual impairment test for each of its reporting units during the third quarter of each year. In accordance with applicable accounting guidance, the Company assesses qualitative factors to determine whether it is necessary to perform the two-step goodwill impairment test. The Company considered numerous factors, which included that the fair value of each reporting unit exceeded its carrying value by a substantial margin in its most recent estimate of reporting unit fair values, whether significant acquisitions or dispositions occurred which might alter the fair value of its reporting units, macroeconomic conditions and their potential impact on reporting unit fair values, actual performance compared with budget and prior projections used in its estimation of reporting unit fair values, industry and market conditions, and the year-over-year change in the Company’s share price.The Company completed its qualitative assessment in the third quarter of 2016 and concluded that a two-step goodwill impairment test was not required in 2016 and that goodwill was not impaired.Share-based PaymentThe guidance for accounting for share-based payments requires, among other things, that the estimated fair value of stock options be charged to earnings. Significant management judgment is required to determine the appropriate assumptions for inputs such as volatility and expected term necessary to estimate option values. In addition, management judgment is required to analyze the terms of the plans and awards granted thereunder to determine if awards will be treated as equity awards or liability awards, as defined by the accounting guidance.As of December 31, 2016, there was $14.4 million of unrecognized compensation cost related to stock option awards. The weighted-average period over which the costs are expected to be recognized is 1.42 years. Also as of December 31, 2016, there was $127.2 million of unrecognized compensation cost related to the Company’s restricted stock, restricted stock unit and performance stock unit awards. The weighted-average period over which that cost is expected to be recognized is approximately 1.05 years.See Note 9 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding accounting for share-based payments.New Accounting PronouncementsNote 1 to the consolidated financial statements contains a summary of the Company’s significant accounting policies, including a discussion of recently issued accounting pronouncements and their impact or potential future impact on the Company’s financial results, if determinable, under the sub-heading ""New Accounting Pronouncements"".45Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market RiskMarket Risk and Credit RiskCertain of the Company’s revenues, expenses, assets and liabilities are exposed to the impact of interest rate changes and fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates and equity markets.Interest Rate Risk and Credit RiskInterest income generated from the Company’s cash investments as well as invested fiduciary funds will vary with the general level of interest rates.The Company had the following investments subject to variable interest rates: (In millions of dollars)December 31, 2016Cash and cash equivalents invested in money market funds, certificates of deposit and time deposits$1,026Fiduciary cash and investments$4,241Based on the above balances, if short-term interest rates increased or decreased by 10%, or 6 basis points, over the full year, annual interest income, including interest earned on fiduciary funds, would increase or decrease by approximately $2 million.In addition to interest rate risk, our cash investments and fiduciary fund investments are subject to potential loss of value due to counter-party credit risk. To minimize this risk, the Company and its subsidiaries invest pursuant to a Board approved investment policy. The policy mandates the preservation of principal and liquidity and requires broad diversification with counter-party limits assigned based primarily on credit rating and type of investment. The Company carefully monitors its cash and fiduciary fund investments and will further restrict the portfolio as appropriate to market conditions. The majority of cash and fiduciary fund investments are invested in short-term bank deposits and liquid money market funds.Foreign Currency RiskThe translated values of revenue and expense from the Company’s international operations are subject to fluctuations due to changes in currency exchange rates. The non-U.S. based revenue that is exposed to foreign exchange fluctuations is approximately 50% of total revenue. We periodically use forward contracts and options to limit foreign currency exchange rate exposure on net income and cash flows for specific, clearly defined transactions arising in the ordinary course of business. Although the Company has significant revenue generated in foreign locations which is subject to foreign exchange rate fluctuations, in most cases both the foreign currency revenue and expenses are in the functional currency of the foreign location. As such, under normal circumstances, the U.S. dollar translation of both the revenues and expenses, as well as the potentially offsetting movements of various currencies against the U.S. dollar, generally tends to mitigate the impact on net operating income of foreign currency risk. However, there have been periods where the impact was not mitigated due to external market factors, and recent events, including the vote on ""Brexit"" in the United Kingdom, may result in greater foreign exchange rate fluctuations in the future. If foreign exchange rates of major currencies (Euro, Sterling, Australian dollar and Canadian dollar) moved 10% in the same direction against the U.S. dollar compared with the foreign exchange rates in 2016, the Company estimates net operating income would increase or decrease by approximately $54 million. The Company has exposure to approximately 80 foreign currencies overall. In Continental Europe, the largest amount of revenue from renewals for the Risk & Insurance Services segment occurs in the first quarter.Equity Price RiskThe Company holds investments in both public and private companies as well as private equity funds. Investments of approximately $105 million are classified as available for sale, which includes the Company's investment in Benefitfocus. Approximately $21 million are accounted for using the cost method and $389 million are accounted for using the equity method, which includes the Company's 46investments in Alexander Forbes. The investments are subject to risk of changes in market value, which, if determined to be other than temporary, could result in realized impairment losses. The Company periodically reviews the carrying value of such investments to determine if any valuation adjustments are appropriate under the applicable accounting pronouncements.As of December 31, 2016, the carrying value of the Company’s investment in Alexander Forbes was $247 million. As of December 31, 2016, the market value of the approximately 443 million shares of Alexander Forbes owned by the Company, based on the December 31, 2016 closing share price of 7.95 South African Rand per share, was approximately $251 million. OtherA number of lawsuits and regulatory proceedings are pending.

62709,MMC,"MARSH & MCLENNAN COMPANIES, INC.",2018,"Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations GeneralMarsh & McLennan Companies, Inc. and its consolidated subsidiaries (the ""Company"") is a global professional services firm offering clients advice and solutions in risk, strategy and people. Its businesses include: Marsh, the insurance broker, intermediary and risk advisor; Guy Carpenter, the risk and reinsurance specialist; Mercer, the provider of HR and Investment related financial advice and services; and Oliver Wyman Group, the management, economic and brand consultancy.

The TCJA provides for a reduction in the U.S. corporate tax rate to 21% and the creation of a territorial tax system. The TCJA also changes the deductibility of certain expenses, primarily executive officers compensation. An aggregate charge of $460 million was recorded in the fourth quarter of 2017 as a result of the enactment of the TCJA. The TCJA provides for a transition to the territorial system through a deemed repatriation tax (the ""transition tax"") on undistributed earnings of non-U.S. subsidiaries. The Company recorded a provisional charge of $240 million in the fourth quarter of 2017 as an estimate of U.S. transition taxes and ancillary effects, including state taxes and foreign withholding taxes related to the change in permanent reinvestment status with respect to our pre-2018 foreign earnings. This transition tax is payable over eight years. The reduction of the U.S. corporate tax rate from 35% to 21%, reduces the value of the U.S. deferred tax assets and liabilities, accordingly, a net charge of $220 million was recorded. A more complete discussion of the TCJA and its impact on the Company’s results is included under the heading ""Income Taxes"".•Pension Settlement charge in the U.K. - The Defined Benefit Pension Plans in the U.K. allow participants an option for the payment of a lump sum distribution from plan assets before retirement in full satisfaction of the retirement benefits due to the participant as well as any survivor’s benefit. The Company’s policy under applicable U.S. GAAP is to treat these lump sum payments as a partial settlement of the plan liability if they exceed the sum of service cost plus interest cost components of net period pension cost of a plan for the year (""settlement thresholds""). The amount of lump sum payments through December 31, 2017 exceeded the settlement thresholds in two of the U.K. plans. This resulted in a non-cash settlement charge of $54 million recorded in December 2017, of which approximately 85% impacted Risk and Insurance Services.Consolidated operating income increased 7%, to $2.9 billion, in 2017 compared with $2.7 billion in 2016, reflecting the combined impact of a 6% increase in revenue and a 6% increase in expenses as compared with the prior year. Income before income taxes increased 7%, to $2.6 billion, reflecting the increase in operating income partly offset by higher interest expense, primarily reflecting an increase in average debt outstanding during the year resulting from the issuance of $1 billion of senior notes in January 2017, partly offset by the repayment of $250 million of senior notes in April 2017.Diluted earnings per share was $2.87 in 2017, compared with $3.38 in 2016. The decrease reflects a significantly higher effective tax rate in 2017, primarily resulting from an aggregate provisional charge of $460 million related to the enactment in December 2017 of U.S. tax reform and a pension settlement charge, which are discussed above. The impact from U.S. tax reform was partly offset by discrete tax items during the year, in particular the benefit from the required change in accounting for tax consequences related to stock compensation. The $460 million provisional charge related to U.S. tax reform reduced diluted earnings per share by $0.89.Average diluted shares outstanding for 2017 decreased to 519 million, compared with 524 million during 2016. Shares issued related to the vesting of share awards and the exercise of employee stock options, were more than offset by share repurchases during the year. Average shares outstanding in 2017 was also impacted by the change in accounting for stock compensation. Under the applicable guidance, the excess tax benefits for unvested shares and unexercised stock options are no longer included in the calculation of common stock equivalents (""CSEs"") under the treasury stock method. This had the effect of increasing CSEs by approximately 1.7 million shares in 2017.Risk and Insurance Services operating income increased $118 million, or 7%, in 2017 compared with 2016. Revenue increased 7%, reflecting a 3% increase on an underlying basis and a 4% increase from acquisitions. Expense increased 7% or 2% on an underlying basis in 2017 compared with 2016.Consulting operating income increased $71 million, or 6%, to $1.2 billion in 2017 compared with 2016, reflecting the combined impact of 5% growth for both revenue and expense.32Consolidated operating income increased 10% to $2.7 billion in 2016 compared with $2.4 billion in 2015, reflecting the combined impact of a 2% increase in revenue and a 1% increase in expenses as compared to the prior year.Risk and Insurance Services operating income increased $214 million, or 14% in 2016 compared with 2015. Revenue increased 4% reflecting a 3% increase on an underlying basis and a 3% increase from acquisitions, partly offset by a decrease resulting from the impact of foreign currency translation of 2%. Expense increased 1% in 2016 compared with 2015.Consulting operating income increased $28 million, or 3%, to $1.1 billion in 2016 compared with 2015, reflecting the combined impact of 1% revenue growth, while expense was flat.33Consolidated Revenue and ExpenseRevenue - Components of ChangeThe Company conducts business in many countries. As a result, foreign exchange rate movements may impact period-to-period comparisons of revenue. Similarly, certain other items such as the revenue impact of acquisitions and dispositions, including transfers among businesses, may impact period-to-period comparisons of revenue. Underlying revenue measures the change in revenue from one period to another by isolating these impacts. The impact of foreign currency exchange fluctuations, acquisitions and dispositions, including transfers among businesses, on the Company’s operating revenues by segment was as follows: Year EndedDecember 31, Components of Revenue Change*(In millions, except percentage figures)2017 2016 % Change GAAPRevenue CurrencyImpact Acquisitions/DispositionsImpact UnderlyingRevenueRisk and Insurance Services Marsh$6,404 $5,976 7% — 5% 3%Guy Carpenter1,187 1,141 4% — — 4%Subtotal7,591 7,117 7% — 4% 3%Fiduciary Interest Income39 26 Total Risk and Insurance Services7,630 7,143 7% — 4% 3%Consulting Mercer4,528 4,323 5% — 2% 2%Oliver Wyman Group1,916 1,789 7% — — 7%Total Consulting6,444 6,112 5% — 2% 4%Corporate/Eliminations(50) (44) Total Revenue$14,024 $13,211 6% — 3% 3%*Components of revenue change may not add due to rounding.The following table provides more detailed revenue information for certain of the components presented above: Year EndedDecember 31, Components of Revenue Change*(In millions, except percentage figures)2017 2016 % Change GAAPRevenue CurrencyImpact Acquisitions/DispositionsImpact UnderlyingRevenueMarsh: EMEA$2,033 $1,924 6 % (1)% 7 % —Asia Pacific645 635 2 % — (5)% 6 %Latin America404 374 8 % (3)% 3 % 7 %Total International3,082 2,933 5 % (1)% 4 % 2 %U.S. / Canada3,322 3,043 9 % — 6 % 4 %Total Marsh$6,404 $5,976 7 % — 5 % 3 %Mercer: Defined Benefit Consulting & Administration$1,381 $1,447 (5)% (1)% (2)% (2)%Investment Management & Related Services767 606 26 % 1 % 15 % 10 % Total Wealth2,148 2,053 5 % — 3 % 2 %Health1,648 1,588 4 % — 2 % 2 %Career732 682 7 % — 2 % 5 %Total Mercer$4,528 $4,323 5 % — 2 % 2 %Underlying revenue measures the change in revenue using consistent currency exchange rates, excluding the impact of certain items that affect comparability such as: acquisitions, dispositions, transfers among businesses and the deconsolidation of Marsh India.Effective January 1, 2017, Mercer established a Wealth business reflecting a unified client strategy for its former Retirement and Investment business.

Revenue in the Risk and Insurance Services segment increased 7% in 2017 compared with 2016, or 3% on an underlying basis. Revenue increased 3% and 4% on an underlying basis at Marsh and Guy Carpenter, respectively, as compared with 2016. The Consulting segment's revenue increased 5% compared with 2016, or 4% on an underlying basis. Revenue increased 2% and 7% on an underlying basis at Mercer and Oliver Wyman Group, respectively, as compared with 2016.35Consolidated revenue was $13.2 billion in 2016, an increase of 2%, or 3% on an underlying basis. Revenue in the Risk and Insurance Services segment increased 4% in 2016 compared with 2015, or 3% on an underlying basis. Revenue increased 3% and 2% on an underlying basis at Marsh and Guy Carpenter, respectively, as compared with 2015. The Consulting segment's revenue increased 1% on a reported basis compared with 2015, or 3% on an underlying basis. Both Mercer and Oliver Wyman Group's revenue increased 3% on an underlying basis compared with 2015.Operating ExpenseConsolidated operating expenses increased 6% in 2017 compared with 2016, or 2% on an underlying basis. The increase in underlying expenses was primarily due to higher base salaries and incentive compensation costs, and the pension settlement charge discussed previously, partly offset by lower costs related to liabilities for errors and omissions.Consolidated operating expenses increased 1% in 2016 compared with the same period in 2015 on both a reported and underlying basis. The underlying expense increase reflects higher base salary costs, higher amortization of identified intangible assets and the impact of the net benefit from the termination of the Company's post-65 retiree medical reimbursement plan in the United States (the ""RRA Plan""), which was recorded in the first quarter of 2015, partly offset by decreases in defined benefit plan pension expense and contingent acquisition consideration expense.Risk and Insurance ServicesIn the Risk and Insurance Services segment, the Company’s subsidiaries and other affiliated entities act as brokers, agents or consultants for insureds, insurance underwriters and other brokers in the areas of risk management, insurance broking and insurance program management services, primarily under the name of Marsh; and engage in reinsurance broking, catastrophe and financial modeling services and related advisory functions, primarily under the name of Guy Carpenter.Marsh and Guy Carpenter are compensated for brokerage and consulting services primarily through fees paid by clients or commissions paid out of premiums charged by insurance and reinsurance companies. Commission rates vary in amount depending upon the type of insurance or reinsurance coverage provided, the particular insurer or reinsurer, the capacity in which the broker acts and negotiates with clients. Revenues can be affected by premium rate levels in the insurance/reinsurance markets, the amount of risk retained by insurance and reinsurance clients themselves and by the value of the risks that have been insured since commission-based compensation is frequently related to the premiums paid by insureds/reinsureds. In many cases, fee compensation may be negotiated in advance, based on the type of risk, coverage required and service provided by the Company and ultimately, the extent of the risk placed into the insurance market or retained by the client. The trends and comparisons of revenue from one period to the next can be affected by changes in premium rate levels, fluctuations in client risk retention and increases or decreases in the value of risks that have been insured, as well as new and lost business, and the volume of business from new and existing clients.Marsh also receives other compensation from insurance companies, separate from retail fees and commissions. This compensation includes, among other things, payment for consulting and analytics services provided to insurers; administrative and other services provided to or on behalf of insurers (including services relating to the administration and management of quota share, panels and other facilities in which insurers participate); and contingent commissions. Marsh and Guy Carpenter also receive interest income on certain funds (such as premiums and claims proceeds) held in a fiduciary capacity for others. The investment of fiduciary funds is regulated by state and other insurance authorities. These regulations typically require segregation of fiduciary funds and limit the types of investments that may be made with them. Interest income from these investments varies depending on the amount of funds invested and applicable interest rates, both of which vary from time to time. For presentation purposes, fiduciary interest is segregated from the other revenues of Marsh and Guy Carpenter and separately presented within the segment, as shown in the revenue by segments charts presented earlier in this MD&A.36The results of operations for the Risk and Insurance Services segment are presented below: (In millions of dollars, except percentages)2017 2016 2015Revenue$7,630 $7,143 $6,869Compensation and Benefits4,031 3,732 3,629Other Operating Expenses1,728 1,658 1,701Operating Expenses5,759 5,390 5,330Operating Income$1,871 $1,753 $1,539Operating Income Margin24.5% 24.5% 22.4%RevenueRevenue in the Risk and Insurance Services segment increased 7% in 2017 compared with 2016, due to a 3% growth in underlying revenue and 4% growth from acquisitions.In Marsh, revenue increased 7% to $6.4 billion in 2017 as compared with 2016, reflecting a 3% increase on an underlying basis and a 5% increase from acquisitions. U.S./Canada had underlying revenue growth of 4%. International operations increased 2% on an underlying basis, reflecting increases of 6% in Asia Pacific and 7% in Latin America, while growth in EMEA was flat.Guy Carpenter’s revenue increased 4% to $1.2 billion in 2017 compared with 2016, for both a reported and underlying basis.Fiduciary interest income was $39 million in 2017 compared with $26 million in 2016 due to the combined effect of higher average invested funds and higher interest rates.The Risk and Insurance Services segment completed seven acquisitions during 2017. Information regarding those acquisitions is included in Note 4 to the consolidated financial statements.Revenue in the Risk and Insurance Services segment increased 4% in 2016 compared with 2015, as a 3% growth in underlying revenue and 3% growth from acquisitions was partly offset by a 2% decrease resulting from the impact of foreign currency translation. In Marsh, revenue of $6 billion increased 4% in 2016 as compared with 2015, reflecting a 3% increase on an underlying basis and a 4% increase from acquisitions, offset by a 2% decrease resulting from the impact of foreign currency translation. The underlying revenue increase reflects growth in all major geographies. International operations had underlying revenue growth of 3% reflecting increases of 2% in EMEA, 3% in Asia Pacific and 8% in Latin America, while U.S./Canada increased 2%.Guy Carpenter’s revenue increased 2% to $1.1 billion in 2016 compared with 2015, for both a reported and underlying basis.Fiduciary interest income was $26 million in 2016 compared with $21 million in 2015 due to the combined effect of higher average invested funds and higher interest rates.The Risk and Insurance Services segment completed nine acquisitions during 2016.ExpenseExpense in the Risk and Insurance Services segment increased 7% in 2017 compared with 2016, reflecting a 2% increase on an underlying basis and a 5% increase from acquisitions. The underlying expense increase is primarily due to higher base salaries, incentive compensation costs and the U.K. pension settlement charge discussed previously, partly offset by lower costs related to liabilities for errors and omissions.Expense in the Risk and Insurance Services segment increased 1% on both a reported and underlying basis in 2016 compared with 2015. The impact of foreign currency translation reduced expenses by 3%, which was offset by a 3% increase related to acquisitions. The increase in underlying expense reflects higher base salary and incentive compensation costs, higher identified intangible asset amortization expense and the impact of the net benefit from the termination of the RRA Plan which was recorded in the first quarter of 2015, offset by a decrease in defined benefit plan pension expense and lower contingent consideration costs related to acquisitions.37ConsultingEffective January 1, 2017, Mercer merged its investment and retirement businesses into a newly-created wealth business. We believe this combination better aligns Mercer’s investment management capabilities globally. The Company conducts business in its Consulting segment through two main business groups, Mercer and Oliver Wyman Group. Mercer provides consulting expertise, advice, services and solutions in the areas of health, retirement, talent and investments. Oliver Wyman Group provides specialized management, economic and brand consulting services.The major component of revenue in the Consulting business is fees paid by clients for advice and services. Mercer, principally through its health line of business, also earns revenue in the form of commissions received from insurance companies for the placement of group (and occasionally individual) insurance contracts, primarily life, health and accident coverages. Revenue for Mercer’s investment management business and certain of Mercer’s defined contribution administration services consists principally of fees based on assets under management or administration.Revenue in the Consulting segment is affected by, among other things, global economic conditions, including changes in clients’ particular industries and markets. Revenue is also affected by competition due to the introduction of new products and services, broad trends in employee demographics, including levels of employment, the effect of government policies and regulations, and fluctuations in interest and foreign exchange rates. Revenues from the provision of investment management services and retirement trust and administrative services are significantly affected by the level of assets under management or administration and securities market performance.For the investment management business, revenues from the majority of funds are included on a gross basis in accordance with U.S. GAAP and include reimbursable expenses incurred by professional staff and sub-advisory fees, and the related expenses are included in other operating expenses.The results of operations for the Consulting segment are presented below: (In millions of dollars, except percentages)2017 2016 2015Revenue$6,444 $6,112 $6,064Compensation and Benefits3,509 3,385 3,354Other Operating Expenses1,761 1,624 1,635Operating Expenses5,270 5,009 4,989Operating Income$1,174 $1,103 $1,075Operating Income Margin18.2% 18.1% 17.7%RevenueConsulting revenue in 2017 increased 5% compared with 2016, reflecting a 4% increase on an underlying basis and 2% growth from acquisitions. Mercer's revenue increased 5% to $4.5 billion over the prior year, or 2% on an underlying basis. Mercer's year over year revenue comparison also reflects an increase of 2% from acquisitions. The underlying revenue growth reflects an increase in Career of 5%, Health of 2% and Wealth of 2%. Within Wealth, Investment Management & Related Services increased 10% while Defined Benefit Consulting & Administration decreased 2% compared with the prior year. Oliver Wyman Group’s revenue increased 7% in 2017 compared with 2016, for both a reported and underlying basis.The Consulting segment completed three acquisitions during 2017. Information regarding these acquisitions is included in Note 4 to the consolidated financial statements.Consulting revenue in 2016 increased 1% compared with 2015, reflecting a 3% increase on an underlying basis offset by a 2% decrease from the impact of foreign currency translation. Mercer’s revenue of $4.3 billion was flat when compared with 2015 but increased 3% on an underlying basis. Mercer's year over year revenue comparison reflects a decrease of 2% from the impact of foreign currency translation. The underlying revenue growth reflects an increase in Wealth of 2%, Health of 3% and Career of 5%. Within Wealth, Investment Management & Related Services increased 6% while Defined Benefit Consulting & Administration was flat compared with 2015. Oliver Wyman Group’s revenue increased 2% in 2016 38compared with 2015, reflecting an increase of 3% on an underlying basis, partly offset by a decrease of 2% from the impact of foreign currency translation.The Consulting segment completed six acquisitions during 2016.ExpenseConsulting expense in 2017 increased 5% compared with 2016, reflecting an increase of 3% on an underlying basis and a 3% increase from the impact of acquisitions. The increase in underlying expense reflects higher base salaries, asset based fees and outside service costs, partly offset by lower severance costs and lower costs related to liabilities for errors and omissions.Consulting expense in 2016 was essentially flat compared with 2015, reflecting an increase of 2% on an underlying basis offset by a 2% decrease from the impact of foreign currency translation. The increase in underlying expense reflects higher base salaries and the impact of the net benefit from the termination of the RRA plan which was recorded in the first quarter of 2015, partly offset by lower defined benefit plan pension expense.Corporate and OtherCorporate expense in 2017 was $189 million compared with $192 million in 2016. The decrease in expense is primarily due to lower consulting, occupancy and general insurance costs.Corporate expense in 2016 was $192 million compared with $195 million in 2015, reflecting lower executive compensation and lower defined benefit pension costs. Other Corporate ItemsInterestInterest income earned on corporate funds amounted to $9 million in 2017 compared with $5 million in 2016. Interest expense in 2017 was $237 million compared with $189 million in 2016. The increase in interest expense was primarily due to higher average debt outstanding in 2017.Interest income earned on corporate funds amounted to $5 million in 2016 compared with $13 million in 2015. The decrease is due to the combined effects of a lower level of invested funds and lower interest rates. Interest expense in 2016 was $189 million compared with $163 million in 2015 due to higher average outstanding debt in 2016.Investment IncomeThe caption ""Investment income (loss)"" in the consolidated statements of income comprises realized and unrealized gains and losses from investments recognized in current earnings. It includes, when applicable, other-than-temporary declines in the value of debt and available-for-sale securities and equity method gains or losses on its investment in private equity funds. The Company's investments may include direct investments in insurance, consulting and related companies and investments in private equity funds. The Company recorded net investment income of $15 million in 2017 compared to less than $1 million in 2016 and $38 million in 2015. The increase in 2017 versus 2016 was primarily due to a gain on the sale of an investment and higher equity method gains related to the Company's investments in private equity funds. Net investment income in 2015 was primarily related to the general partner carried interest from Trident III. Stonepoint Capital, the investment manager of Trident III, substantially liquidated the remaining two investments of Trident III during the third quarter of 2015, which resulted in the Company recognizing its remaining deferred performance fees.Income TaxesOn December 22, 2017, the U.S. enacted the TCJA. The TCJA provides for a reduction in the U.S. corporate tax rate to 21% and the creation of a territorial tax system. The TCJA also changes the deductibility of certain expenses, primarily executive officers compensation. The Company recorded a provisional charge of $460 million related to the enactment of the TCJA. As discussed in Note 6 to the consolidated financial statements this provisional charge may be adjusted in 2018. The TCJA provides for a transition to the territorial system via a transition tax on undistributed earnings of non-U.S. subsidiaries. The Company recorded a provisional charge of $240 million in the fourth quarter as an estimate of U.S. transition taxes and ancillary effects, including state taxes and foreign withholding taxes related to the 39change in permanent reinvestment status with respect to our pre-2018 foreign earnings. This transition tax is payable over eight years. The reduction of the U.S. corporate tax rate from 35% to 21%, reduces the value of the US deferred tax assets and liabilities, accordingly, a charge of $220 million was recorded. The more complete discussion of the TCJA and its impact on the Company’s results is further below.The Company's consolidated effective tax rate was 42.9%, 27.6% and 29.1% in 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively. The effective tax rate in 2017 reflects the provisional estimate of U.S. tax reform as well as the impact of the required change in accounting for the tax effects of equity awards. The 2017, 2016 and 2015 rates also reflect foreign operations which historically have been taxed at rates below the U.S. statutory tax rate, including the effect of repatriation, as well as the impact of discrete tax matters such as tax legislation, changes in valuation allowances, nontaxable adjustments to contingent acquisition consideration and the true-up of the tax provision to amounts filed in the Company's tax returns. In 2017, pre-tax income in the U.K., Barbados, Canada, Australia, and Ireland accounted for approximately 60% of the Company's total non-U.S. pre-tax income, with effective rates in those countries of 20%, 1%, 27%, 31% and 12%, respectively.As noted above, the TCJA significantly increased income tax expense from two discrete charges discussed above. The lower U.S. corporate rate is expected to provide a significant ongoing benefit to our effective tax rate and U.S. cash tax liabilities due to the significantly lower U.S. statutory tax rate and the quasi-territorial system.As a U.S. domiciled parent holding company, Marsh & McLennan Companies, Inc. is the issuer of essentially all of the Company's external indebtedness, and incurs the related interest expense in the U.S. Further, most senior executive and oversight functions are conducted in the U.S. and the associated costs are incurred primarily in the United States.The mandatory taxation of accumulated undistributed foreign earnings through the transition tax substantially changed the economic considerations of continued permanent investment of those accumulated earnings, a key component of our global capital strategy. As a result of the transition tax, the Company anticipates repatriating the majority of the accumulated earnings that was previously intended to be permanently re-invested outside of the U.S. We continue to evaluate our global investment strategy in light of expected relief from U.S. tax reform under the new territorial tax regime for future foreign earnings.The effective tax rate may vary significantly from period to period. The rate is sensitive to the geographic mix of the Company's earnings and repatriation of cash, which may result in higher or lower effective tax rates. Losses in certain jurisdictions cannot be offset by earnings from other operations, and may require valuation allowances that affect the rate, depending on estimates of the realizability of associated deferred tax assets. The effective tax rate is also sensitive to changes in unrecognized tax benefits, including the impact of settled tax audits and expired statutes of limitation.The realization of deferred tax assets depends on generating future taxable income during the periods in which the tax benefits are deductible or creditable. Tax liabilities are determined and assessed jurisdictionally by legal entity or filing group. Certain taxing jurisdictions allow or require combined or consolidated tax filings. The Company assessed the realizability of its deferred tax assets. The Company considered all available evidence, including the existence of a recent history of losses, placing particular weight on evidence that could be objectively verified. A valuation allowance was recorded to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount that the Company believes is more likely than not to be realized.Changes in tax laws, rulings, policies or related legal and regulatory interpretations occur frequently and may also have significant favorable or adverse impacts on our current assumptions and effective tax rate.Liquidity and Capital ResourcesThe Company is organized as a legal entity separate and distinct from its operating subsidiaries. As the Company does not have significant operations of its own, the Company is dependent upon dividends and other payments from its operating subsidiaries to pay principal and interest on its outstanding debt obligations, pay dividends to stockholders, repurchase its shares and pay corporate expenses. The Company also provides financial support to its operating subsidiaries for acquisitions, investments and certain parts of their business that require liquidity, such as the capital markets business of Guy Carpenter. Other sources of liquidity include borrowing facilities discussed below in financing cash flows.40The Company derives a significant portion of its revenue and operating profit from operating subsidiaries located outside of the United States. Funds from those operating subsidiaries are regularly repatriated to the United States out of annual earnings. At December 31, 2017, the Company had approximately $1.0 billion of cash and cash equivalents in its foreign operations, which includes $171 million of operating funds required to be maintained for regulatory requirements or as collateral under certain captive insurance arrangements. The Company expects to continue its practice of repatriating foreign funds from its non-U.S. operating subsidiaries out of current annual earnings, and with respect to repatriating 2017 and prior earnings, it is in the process of fully evaluating such factors as its short- and long-term capital needs, acquisition and borrowing strategies, and the availability of cash for repatriation for each of its subsidiaries as it considers its permanent reinvestment assertions going forward in light of the enactment at the end of 2017 of the TCJA. During 2017, the Company recorded foreign currency translation adjustments which increased net equity by $715 million. A weakening of the U.S. dollar against foreign currencies would increase the translated U.S. dollar value of the Company’s net investments in its non-U.S. subsidiaries, as well as the translated U.S. dollar value of cash repatriations from those subsidiaries.Cash on our consolidated balance sheets includes funds available for general corporate purposes. Funds held on behalf of clients in a fiduciary capacity are segregated and shown separately in the consolidated balance sheets as an offset to fiduciary liabilities. Fiduciary funds cannot be used for general corporate purposes, and should not be considered as a source of liquidity for the Company.Operating Cash FlowsThe Company generated $1.9 billion of cash from operations in 2017, compared with $2.0 billion in 2016. These amounts reflect the net income of the Company during those periods, excluding gains or losses from investments, adjusted for non-cash charges and changes in working capital which relate primarily to the timing of payments of accrued liabilities or receipts of assets and pension contributions.Pension-Related ItemsContributionsDuring 2017, the Company contributed $85 million to its U.S. pension plans and $229 million to non-U.S. pension plans compared to contributions of $27 million to U.S. plans and $187 million to non-U.S. plans in 2016.In the United States, contributions to the tax-qualified defined benefit plans are based on ERISA guidelines and the Company generally expects to maintain a funded status of 80% or more of the liability determined under the ERISA guidelines. There was a $6 million contribution to the U.S. qualified plan to meet the ERISA funding requirement in 2017. In addition, the Company made a $50 million discretionary contribution to the U.S. qualified plan in December 2017 and $29 million of contributions to its non-qualified plans. The Company expects to contribute approximately $27 million to its U.S. pension plans in 2018.The Company contributed $129 million to the U.K. plans in 2017, including an expense allowance of approximately $9 million. Based on the funding test carried out at November 1, 2017, the Company contributions to the U.K. plans in 2018 are expected to be approximately $22 million, including the expense allowance.Outside the United States, the Company has a large number of non-U.S. defined benefit pension plans, the largest of which are in the U.K., which comprise approximately 81% of non-U.S. plan assets at December 31, 2017. Contribution rates for non-U.S. plans are generally based on local funding practices and statutory requirements, which may differ significantly from measurements under U.S. GAAP. In the U.K., the assumptions used to determine pension contributions are the result of legally-prescribed negotiations between the Company and the plans' trustee that typically occur every three years in conjunction with the actuarial valuation of the plans. Currently, this results in a lower funded status than under U.S. GAAP and may result in contributions irrespective of the U.S. GAAP funded status. In November 2016, the Company and the Trustee of the U.K. Defined Benefits Plans agreed to a funding deficit recovery plan for the U.K. defined benefit pension plans. The current agreement with the Trustee sets out the annual deficit contributions which would be due based on the deficit at December 31, 2015. The funding level is subject to re-assessment, in most cases on November 1 of each year. If the funding 41level on November 1 is sufficient, no deficit funding contributions will be required in the following year, and the contribution amount will be deferred. The funding level was re-assessed on November 1, 2017 and no deficit funding contributions are required in 2018. The funding level will be re-assessed on November 1, 2018. As part of a long-term strategy, which depends on having greater influence over asset allocation and overall investment decisions, in November 2016 the Company renewed its agreement to support annual deficit contributions by the U.K. operating companies under certain circumstances, up to GBP 450 million over a seven-year period.In the aggregate, the Company expects to contribute approximately $82 million to its non-U.S. defined benefit plans in 2018, comprising approximately $60 million to plans outside of the U.K. and $22 million to the U.K. plans.Changes to Pension PlansIn March 2017, the Company modified its defined benefit pension plans in Canada to discontinue further benefit accruals for participants after December 31, 2017 and replaced them with a defined contribution arrangement. The Company also amended its post-retirement benefits plan in Canada so that individuals who retire after April 1, 2019 will not be eligible to participate, except in certain situations. The Company re-measured the assets and liabilities of the plans, based on assumptions and market conditions on the amendment date.In October 2016, the Company modified its U.S. defined benefit pension plans to discontinue further benefit accruals for participants after December 31, 2016. At the same time, the Company amended its U.S. defined contribution retirement plans for most of its U.S. employees to add an automatic Company contribution equal to 4% of eligible base pay beginning on January 1, 2017. This new Company contribution, together with the Company’s current matching contribution, provides eligible U.S. employees with the opportunity to receive a total contribution of up to 7% of eligible base pay. As required under GAAP, the defined benefit plans that were significantly impacted by the modification were re-measured in October 2016 using market data and assumptions as of the modification date. The net periodic pension expense recognized in 2016 reflects the weighted average costs of the December 31, 2015 measurement and the October 2016 re-measurement. In addition, the U.S. qualified plans were merged effective December 30, 2016, since no participants would be receiving benefit accruals after December 2016.Effective August 1, 2015, the Company amended its Ireland defined benefit pension plans to close those plans to future benefit accruals and replaced those plans with a defined contribution arrangement. The Company re-measured the assets and liabilities of the plans, based on assumptions and market conditions on the amendment date.Changes in Funded Status and ExpenseThe year-over-year change in the funded status of the Company's pension plans is impacted by the difference between actual and assumed results, particularly with regard to return on assets, and changes in the discount rate, as well as the amount of Company contributions, if any. Unrecognized actuarial losses were approximately $1.8 billion and $2.6 billion at December 31, 2017 for the U.S. plans and non-U.S. plans, respectively, compared with $1.7 billion and $3.1 billion at December 31, 2016. The increase in the U.S. was primarily due to a decrease in the discount rate used to measure plan liabilities partly offset by investment returns. The decrease in the non-U.S. plans was primarily due to higher investment returns, the impact of assumption changes and the U.K. settlement in the fourth quarter of 2017 as discussed above, partly offset by the impact of a decrease in discount rates and foreign exchange translation. In the past several years, the amount of unamortized losses has been significantly impacted, both positively and negatively, by actual asset performance and changes in discount rates. The discount rate used to measure plan liabilities decreased in both the U.S. and the U.K. (the Company's largest plans) in 2017 and in 2016. The decreases in 2017 and 2016 followed an increase in 2015. An increase in the discount rate decreases the measured plan benefit obligation, resulting in actuarial gains, while a decrease in the discount rate increases the measured plan obligation, resulting in actuarial losses. During 2017, the Company's defined benefit pension plan assets had actual returns of 19.3% and 9.1% in the U.S. and U.K., respectively. During 2016, the Company's defined benefit pension plan assets had actual returns of 9.8% and 22.1% in the U.S. and U.K., respectively. During 2015, the Company's defined benefit pension plan assets had a loss of 3.9% in the U.S. and gain of 1.2% in the U.K.42Overall, based on the measurement at December 31, 2017, expenses related to the Company’s defined benefit plans are expected to decrease in 2018 by approximately $90 million compared to 2017. Approximately $80 million of the reduction relates to non-U.S. plans, primarily in the U.K. and in Canada. In the U.K., the net benefit credit was reduced in 2017 by the $54 million settlement charge discussed previously. The recognition of a similar charge in 2018 and the amount of such a charge, if any, is dependent upon whether participant lump sum elections reach or exceed the settlement threshold. The remaining decrease primarily relates to plans in Canada, which ceased the accrual of future benefits on January 1, 2018. Approximately half of the defined benefit expense decrease in Canada will be offset by increased costs for contributions to its defined contribution plans.Historically, service and interest costs were estimated using a single weighted average discount rate derived from the yield curves used to measure the benefit obligations at the beginning of the period. In 2016, the Company changed the approach used to estimate the service and interest cost components of net periodic benefit cost for its significant non-U.S. plans. This change in approach was made to improve the correlation between the projected benefit cash flows and the corresponding yield curve spot rates and to provide a more precise measurement of service and interest costs. The change did not impact the measurement of the plans’ total projected benefit obligation. The Company accounted for this change as a change in estimate, that was applied prospectively beginning in 2016 and resulted in pension expense being approximately $45 million lower than if the prior approach had been used.The Company’s accounting policies for its defined benefit pension plans, including the selection of and sensitivity to assumptions, are discussed below under Management’s Discussion of Critical Accounting Policies. For additional information regarding the Company’s retirement plans, see Note 7 to the consolidated financial statements.In March 2015, the Company amended the RRA, resulting in its termination, with benefits to certain participants to be paid through December 31, 2016. As a result of the termination of the RRA plan, the Company recognized a net credit of approximately $125 million in the first quarter of 2015.Financing Cash FlowsNet cash used for financing activities was $1.0 billion in 2017 compared with $1.1 billion used in 2016.DebtThe Company increased outstanding debt by approximately $680 million in 2017 and $400 million in 2016.The Company has established a short-term debt financing program of up to $1.5 billion through the issuance of commercial paper. The proceeds from the issuance of commercial paper are used for general corporate purposes. The Company had no commercial paper outstanding at December 31, 2017.In January 2017, the Company issued $500 million of 2.75% senior notes due in 2022 and $500 million of 4.35% senior notes due in 2047. The Company used the net proceeds for general corporate purposes, which included the repayment of a $250 million debt maturity in April 2017.In March 2016, the Company issued $350 million of 3.30% seven-year senior notes. In September 2015, the Company issued $600 million of 3.75% 10.5-year senior notes, and in March 2015, the Company issued $500 million of 2.35% five-year senior notes. The Company used the net proceeds from these issuances for general corporate purposes.Credit FacilitiesThe Company and certain of its subsidiaries maintain a $1.5 billion multi-currency five-year unsecured revolving credit facility. The interest rate on this facility is based on LIBOR plus a fixed margin which varies with the Company's credit ratings. This facility expires in November 2020 and requires the Company to maintain certain coverage and leverage ratios which are tested quarterly. There were no borrowings outstanding under this facility at December 31, 2017.The Company also maintains other credit facilities, guarantees and letters of credit with various banks, aggregating $624 million at December 31, 2017 and $376 million at December 31, 2016. There were no 43outstanding borrowings under these facilities at December 31, 2017 and $1.6 million of outstanding borrowings under these facilities at December 31, 2016.The Company's senior debt is currently rated A- by Standard & Poor's and Baa1 by Moody's. The Company's short-term debt is currently rated A-2 by Standard & Poor's and P-2 by Moody's. The Company carries a stable outlook from both firms.Share RepurchasesDuring 2017, the Company repurchased 11.5 million shares of its common stock for total consideration of $900 million at an average price per share of $77.93. In November 2016, the Board of Directors authorized an increase in the Company’s share repurchase program, which supersedes any prior authorization, allowing management to buy back up to $2.5 billion of the Company’s common stock going forward. As of December 31, 2017, the Company remained authorized to purchase additional shares of its common stock up to a value of approximately $1.5 billion. There is no time limit on this authorization. During 2016, the Company repurchased 12.7 million shares of its common stock for total consideration of $800 million at an average price per share of $63.18.DividendsThe Company paid total dividends of $740 million in 2017 ($1.43 per share), $682 million in 2016 ($1.30 per share) and $632 million in 2015 ($1.18 per share).Contingent Payments Related To AcquisitionsDuring 2017, the Company paid $108 million of contingent payments related to acquisitions made in prior years. These payments are split between financing and operating cash flows in the consolidated statements of cash flows. Payments of $81 million related to the contingent consideration liability that was recorded on the date of acquisition are reflected as financing cash flows. Payments related to increases in the contingent consideration liability subsequent to the date of acquisition of $27 million are reflected as operating cash flows. Remaining estimated future contingent consideration payments of $189 million for acquisitions completed in 2017 and in prior years are included in accounts payable and accrued liabilities or other liabilities in the consolidated balance sheet at December 31, 2017. The Company paid deferred purchase consideration related to prior years' acquisitions of $55 million, $54 million and $36 million in the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively. Remaining deferred cash payments of approximately $121 million are included in accounts payable and accrued liabilities or other liabilities in the consolidated balance sheet at December 31, 2017.In 2016, the Company paid $86 million of contingent payments related to acquisitions made in prior periods, of which $44 million was reported as financing cash flows and $42 million as operating cash flows. In 2015, the Company made $47 million of contingent payments related to acquisitions made in prior periods, of which $13 million was reported as financing cash flows and $34 million as operating cash flows.Investing Cash FlowsNet cash used for investing activities amounted to $956 million in 2017 compared with $1.1 billion used for investing activities in 2016. The Company paid $655 million and $813 million, net of cash acquired, for acquisitions it made during 2017 and 2016, respectively.On February 24, 2015, Mercer purchased shares of common stock of Benefitfocus (NASDAQ:BNFT) constituting approximately 9.9% of BNFT's outstanding capital stock as of the acquisition date. The purchase price for the BNFT shares and certain other rights and other consideration was approximately $75 million. In 2015, the Company elected to account for this investment under the cost method of accounting as the shares purchased were categorized as restricted. Effective December 31, 2016, these shares were no longer considered restricted for the purpose of determining if they are marketable securities under GAAP, and are accounted for as available for sale securities and included in other assets in the consolidated balance sheets.44The Company’s additions to fixed assets and capitalized software, which amounted to $302 million in 2017 and $253 million in 2016, primarily relate to computer equipment purchases, the refurbishing and modernizing of office facilities and software development costs.The Company has commitments for potential future investments of approximately $57 million in four private equity funds that invest primarily in financial services companies. Commitments and ObligationsThe following sets forth the Company’s future contractual obligations by the types identified in the table below as of December 31, 2017: Payment due by PeriodContractual Obligations(In millions of dollars)Total Within1 Year 1-3Years 4-5Years After 5YearsCurrent portion of long-term debt$262 $262 $— $— $—Long-term debt5,261 — 830 1,030 3,401Interest on long-term debt1,935 206 384 325 1,020Net operating leases2,057 314 542 429 772Service agreements387 228 134 12 13Other long-term obligations338 136 185 13 4Total$10,240 $1,146 $2,075 $1,809 $5,210The above does not include the liability for unrecognized tax benefits of $71 million as the Company is unable to reasonably predict the timing of settlement of these liabilities, other than approximately $1 million that may become payable during 2018. The above does not include net pension liabilities of approximately $1.8 billion because the timing and amount of ultimate payment of such liability is dependent upon future events, including, but not limited to, future returns on plan assets and changes in the discount rate used to measure the liabilities. The above does not include the provisional estimate of transitional tax payments related to the TCJA of $240 million. The amounts of estimated future benefits payments to be made from pension plan assets are disclosed in Note 7 to the consolidated financial statements. In 2018, the Company expects to contribute approximately $27 million and $82 million to its U.S. and non-U.S. defined benefit pension plans, respectively.Management’s Discussion of Critical Accounting PoliciesThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (""GAAP"") requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue and expenses, and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. Management considers the policies discussed below to be critical to understanding the Company’s financial statements because their application places the most significant demands on management’s judgment, and requires management to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain. Actual results may differ from those estimates.Legal and Other Loss ContingenciesThe Company and its subsidiaries are subject to numerous claims, lawsuits and proceedings including claims for errors and omissions (""E&O""). GAAP requires that a liability be recorded when a loss is both probable and reasonably estimable. Significant management judgment is required to apply this guidance. The Company utilizes case level reviews by inside and outside counsel, an internal actuarial analysis by Oliver Wyman Group, a subsidiary of the Company, and other methods to estimate potential losses. The liability is reviewed quarterly and adjusted as developments warrant. In many cases, the Company has not recorded a liability, other than for legal fees to defend the claim, because we are unable, at the present time, to make a determination that a loss is both probable and reasonably estimable. Given the unpredictability of E&O claims and of litigation that could flow from them, it is possible that an adverse outcome in a particular matter could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s businesses, results of operations, financial condition or cash flow in a given quarterly or annual period.45In addition, to the extent that insurance coverage is available, significant management judgment is required to determine the amount of recoveries that are probable of collection under the Company’s various insurance programs.Retirement BenefitsThe Company maintains qualified and non-qualified defined benefit pension and defined contribution plans for its eligible U.S. employees and a variety of defined benefit and defined contribution plans for its eligible non-U.S. employees. The Company’s policy for funding its tax-qualified defined benefit retirement plans is to contribute amounts at least sufficient to meet the funding requirements set forth in U.S. and applicable foreign laws.The Company recognizes the funded status of its over-funded defined benefit pension and retiree medical plans as a net benefit plan asset and its unfunded and underfunded plans as a net benefit plan liability. The gains or losses and prior service costs or credits that have not been recognized as components of net periodic costs are recorded as a component of Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income (""AOCI""), net of tax, in the Company’s consolidated balance sheets. The gains and losses that exceed specified corridors are amortized prospectively out of AOCI over a period that approximates the remaining life expectancy of participants in plans where substantially all participants are inactive or the average remaining service period of active participants for plans with active participants. The vast majority of unrecognized losses relate to inactive plans and are amortized over the remaining life expectancy of the participants.The determination of net periodic pension cost is based on a number of assumptions, including an expected long-term rate of return on plan assets, the discount rate, mortality and assumed rate of salary increase. The assumptions used in the calculation of net periodic pension costs and pension liabilities are disclosed in Note 7 to the consolidated financial statements. The assumptions for expected rate of return on plan assets and the discount rate are discussed in more detail below.The long-term rate of return on plan assets assumption is determined for each plan based on the facts and circumstances that exist as of the measurement date, and the specific portfolio mix of each plan’s assets. The Company utilizes a model developed by Mercer, a subsidiary of the Company, to assist in the determination of this assumption. The model takes into account several factors, including: actual and target portfolio allocation; investment, administrative and trading expenses incurred directly by the plan trust; historical portfolio performance; relevant forward-looking economic analysis; and expected returns, variances and correlations for different asset classes. These measures are used to determine probabilities using standard statistical techniques to calculate a range of expected returns on the portfolio. The target asset allocation for the U.S. Plans is 64% equities and equity alternatives and 36% fixed income. At December 31, 2017, the actual allocation for the U.S. Plans was 63% equities and equity alternatives and 37% fixed income. At the end of 2016, the target asset allocation for the U.K. Plans, which comprise approximately 81% of non-U.S. Plan assets, was 48% equities and equity alternatives and 52% fixed income. During 2017, due to improvement in the funded status of the U.K. Plans, the Trustee revised the target asset allocation to 34% equities and equity alternatives and 66% fixed income. At December 31, 2017, the actual allocation for the U.K. Plans was 48% equities and equity alternatives and 52% fixed income and the Company expects to continue to move the actual portfolio allocation toward the revised targets during 2018.The discount rate selected for each U.S. Plan is based on a model bond portfolio with coupons and redemptions that closely match the expected liability cash flows from the plan. Discount rates for non-U.S. plans are based on appropriate bond indices adjusted for duration; in the U.K., the plan duration is reflected using the Mercer yield curve.46The table below shows the weighted average assumed rate of return and the discount rate at the December 31, 2017 measurement date (for measuring pension expense in 2018) for the total Company, the U.S. and the Rest of World (""ROW"").

It does not contemplate nor include potential future impacts a change in the interest rate environment and discount rates might cause, such as the impact on the market value of the plans’ assets. Changing the discount rate and leaving the other assumptions constant also may not be representative of the impact on expense, because the long-term rates of inflation and salary increases are often correlated with the discount rate. Changes in these assumptions will not necessarily have a linear impact on the net periodic pension cost.The Company contributes to certain health care and life insurance benefits provided to its retired employees. The cost of these post-retirement benefits for employees in the U.S. is accrued during the period up to the date employees are eligible to retire, but is funded by the Company as incurred. The key assumptions and sensitivity to changes in the assumed health care cost trend rate are discussed in Note 7 to the consolidated financial statements.Income TaxesThe Company's tax rate reflects its income, statutory tax rates and tax planning in the various jurisdictions in which it operates. In 2017, the Company's tax expense was significantly impacted by the enactment of the TCJA, which is discussed in more detail in Note 6 to the consolidated financial statements included in this report. Significant judgment is required in determining the annual effective tax rate and in evaluating uncertain tax positions. The Company reports a liability for unrecognized tax benefits resulting from uncertain tax positions taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. The evaluation of a tax position is a two-step process. The first step involves recognition. The Company determines whether it is more likely than not that a tax position will be sustained upon tax examination, including resolution of any related appeals or litigation, based on only the technical merits of the position. The technical merits of a tax position derive from both statutory and judicial authority (legislation and statutes, legislative intent, regulations, rulings, and case law) and their applicability to the facts and circumstances of the tax position. If a tax position does not meet the more-likely-than-not recognition threshold, the benefit of that position is not recognized in the financial statements. The second step is measurement. A tax position that meets the more-likely-than-not recognition threshold is measured to determine the amount of benefit to recognize in the financial statements. The tax position is measured as the largest amount of benefit that is greater than 50 percent likely of being realized upon ultimate resolution with a taxing authority.Uncertain tax positions are evaluated based upon the facts and circumstances that exist at each reporting period and involve significant management judgment. Subsequent changes in judgment based upon new information may lead to changes in recognition, derecognition, and measurement. Adjustments may result, for example, upon resolution of an issue with the taxing authorities, or expiration of a statute of limitations barring an assessment for an issue.47Certain items are included in the Company's tax returns at different times than the items are reflected in the financial statements. As a result, the annual tax expense reflected in the consolidated statements of income is different than that reported in the tax returns. Some of these differences are permanent, such as expenses that are not deductible in the returns, and some differences are temporary and reverse over time, such as depreciation expense. Temporary differences create deferred tax assets and liabilities, which are measured at existing tax rates. Deferred tax liabilities generally represent tax expense recognized in the financial statements for which payment has been deferred, or expense for which a deduction has been taken already in the tax return but the expense has not yet been recognized in the financial statements. Deferred tax assets generally represent items that can be used as a tax deduction or credit in tax returns in future years for which a benefit has already been recorded in the financial statements. The Company evaluates all significant available positive and negative evidence, including the existence of losses in recent years and its forecast of future taxable income by jurisdiction, in assessing the need for a valuation allowance. The Company also considers tax planning strategies that would result in realization of deferred tax assets, and the presence of taxable income in prior period tax filings in jurisdictions that allow for the carryback of tax attributes pursuant to the applicable tax law. The underlying assumptions the Company uses in forecasting future taxable income require significant judgment and take into account the Company's recent performance. The ultimate realization of deferred tax assets is dependent on the generation of future taxable income during the periods in which temporary differences or carry-forwards are deductible or creditable. Valuation allowances are established for deferred tax assets when it is estimated that it is more likely than not that future taxable income will be insufficient to fully use a deduction or credit in that jurisdiction.Fair Value DeterminationsGoodwill Impairment Testing—The Company is required to assess goodwill and any indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment annually, or more frequently if circumstances indicate impairment may have occurred. The Company performs the annual impairment test for each of its reporting units during the third quarter of each year. In accordance with applicable accounting guidance, the Company assesses qualitative factors to determine whether it is necessary to perform the two-step goodwill impairment test. The Company considered numerous factors, which included that the fair value of each reporting unit exceeded its carrying value by a substantial margin in its most recent estimate of reporting unit fair values, whether significant acquisitions or dispositions occurred which might alter the fair value of its reporting units, macroeconomic conditions and their potential impact on reporting unit fair values, actual performance compared with budget and prior projections used in its estimation of reporting unit fair values, industry and market conditions, and the year-over-year change in the Company’s share price.The Company completed its qualitative assessment in the third quarter of 2017 and concluded that a two-step goodwill impairment test was not required in 2017 and that goodwill was not impaired.Share-Based PaymentThe guidance for accounting for share-based payments requires, among other things, that the estimated fair value of stock options be charged to earnings. Significant management judgment is required to determine the appropriate assumptions for inputs such as volatility and expected term necessary to estimate option values. In addition, management judgment is required to analyze the terms of the plans and awards granted thereunder to determine if awards will be treated as equity awards or liability awards, as defined by the accounting guidance.As of December 31, 2017, there was $14.9 million of unrecognized compensation cost related to stock option awards. The weighted-average period over which the costs are expected to be recognized is 1.36 years. Also as of December 31, 2017, there was $197.4 million of unrecognized compensation cost related to the Company’s restricted stock, restricted stock unit and performance stock unit awards. The weighted-average period over which that cost is expected to be recognized is approximately 1.08 years.See Note 8 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding accounting for share-based payments.48New Accounting PronouncementsNote 1 to the consolidated financial statements contains a summary of the Company’s significant accounting policies, including a discussion of recently issued accounting pronouncements and their impact or potential future impact on the Company’s financial results, if determinable, under the sub-heading ""New Accounting Pronouncements"".49Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market RiskMarket Risk and Credit RiskCertain of the Company’s revenues, expenses, assets and liabilities are exposed to the impact of interest rate changes and fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates and equity markets.Interest Rate Risk and Credit RiskInterest income generated from the Company’s cash investments as well as invested fiduciary funds will vary with the general level of interest rates.The Company had the following investments subject to variable interest rates: (In millions of dollars)December 31, 2017Cash and cash equivalents invested in money market funds, certificates of deposit and time deposits$1,205Fiduciary cash and investments$4,847Based on the above balances, if short-term interest rates increased or decreased by 10%, or 11 basis points, over the full year, annual interest income, including interest earned on fiduciary funds, would increase or decrease by approximately $4 million.In addition to interest rate risk, our cash investments and fiduciary fund investments are subject to potential loss of value due to counter-party credit risk. To minimize this risk, the Company and its subsidiaries invest pursuant to a Board approved investment policy. The policy mandates the preservation of principal and liquidity and requires broad diversification with counter-party limits assigned based primarily on credit rating and type of investment. The Company carefully monitors its cash and fiduciary fund investments and will further restrict the portfolio as appropriate to market conditions. The majority of cash and fiduciary fund investments are invested in short-term bank deposits and liquid money market funds.Foreign Currency RiskThe translated values of revenue and expense from the Company’s international operations are subject to fluctuations due to changes in currency exchange rates. The non-U.S. based revenue that is exposed to foreign exchange fluctuations is approximately 50% of total revenue. We periodically use forward contracts and options to limit foreign currency exchange rate exposure on net income and cash flows for specific, clearly defined transactions arising in the ordinary course of business. Although the Company has significant revenue generated in foreign locations which is subject to foreign exchange rate fluctuations, in most cases both the foreign currency revenue and expenses are in the functional currency of the foreign location. As such, under normal circumstances, the U.S. dollar translation of both the revenues and expenses, as well as the potentially offsetting movements of various currencies against the U.S. dollar, generally tends to mitigate the impact on net operating income of foreign currency risk. However, there have been periods where the impact was not mitigated due to external market factors, and external macroeconomic events, such as the vote on ""Brexit"" in the United Kingdom, may result in greater foreign exchange rate fluctuations in the future. If foreign exchange rates of major currencies (Euro, Sterling, Australian dollar and Canadian dollar) moved 10% in the same direction against the U.S. dollar compared with the foreign exchange rates in 2017, the Company estimates net operating income would increase or decrease by approximately $60 million. The Company has exposure to approximately 80 foreign currencies overall. In Continental Europe, the largest amount of revenue from renewals for the Risk & Insurance Services segment occurs in the first quarter. Equity Price RiskThe Company holds investments in both public and private companies as well as private equity funds. Investments of approximately $97 million are classified as available for sale, which includes the Company's investment in Benefitfocus. Approximately $62 million are accounted for using the cost method and $405 million are accounted for using the equity method, which includes the Company's 50investments in Alexander Forbes. The investments are subject to risk of changes in market value, which, if determined to be other than temporary, could result in realized impairment losses. The Company periodically reviews the carrying value of such investments to determine if any valuation adjustments are appropriate under the applicable accounting pronouncements.As of December 31, 2017, the carrying value of the Company’s investment in Alexander Forbes was $266 million. As of December 31, 2017, the market value of the approximately 443 million shares of Alexander Forbes owned by the Company, based on the December 31, 2017 closing share price of 6.87 South African Rand per share, was approximately $239 million.

Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations GeneralMarsh & McLennan Companies, Inc. and its consolidated subsidiaries (the ""Company"") is a global professional services firm offering clients advice and solutions in risk, strategy and people. Its businesses include: Marsh, the insurance broker, intermediary and risk advisor; Guy Carpenter, the risk and reinsurance specialist; Mercer, the provider of HR and Investment related financial advice and services; and Oliver Wyman Group, the management, economic and brand consultancy. With over 65,000 colleagues worldwide and annual revenue of $15 billion, the Company provides analysis, advice and transactional capabilities to clients in more than 130 countries.The Company conducts business through two segments:•Risk and Insurance Services includes risk management activities (risk advice, risk transfer and risk control and mitigation solutions) as well as insurance and reinsurance broking and services. The Company conducts business in this segment through Marsh and Guy Carpenter.•Consulting includes health, wealth and career consulting services and products, and specialized management, economic and brand consulting services. The Company conducts business in this segment through Mercer and Oliver Wyman Group.We describe the primary sources of revenue and categories of expense for each segment below, in our discussion of segment financial results. A reconciliation of segment operating income to total operating income is included in Note 17 to the consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8 in this report. The accounting policies used for each segment are the same as those used for the consolidated financial statements.Pending AcquisitionOn September 18, 2018, the Company announced that it had reached agreement on the terms of a recommended cash acquisition of Jardine Lloyd Thompson Group plc (""JLT""), a public company organized under the laws of England and Wales (the ""JLT Transaction""). Under the terms of the Transaction, JLT shareholders will receive £19.15 in cash for each JLT share, which values JLT’s existing issued and to be issued share capital at approximately £4.3 billion (or approximately $5.6 billion based on an exchange rate of U.S. $1.31:£1). The Company intends to implement the Transaction by way of a scheme of arrangement under Part 26 of the United Kingdom Companies Act 2006, as amended. In addition, the Company expects to repay existing JLT debt in connection with the closing of the Transaction.The Transaction was approved by JLT shareholders on November 7, 2018. The Transaction remains subject to conditions and certain further terms, including, among others, (i) the sanction of the Transaction by the High Court of Justice in England and Wales, (ii) completion of the transaction no later than December 31, 2019 and (iii) the receipt of certain antitrust, regulatory and other approvals. Subject to the satisfaction or waiver of all relevant conditions, the Transaction is expected to be completed in the spring of 2019.This Management's Discussion & Analysis (""MD&A"") contains forward-looking statements as that term is defined in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.

The FX Contract is discussed in Note 11 to the consolidated financial statements. An unrealized loss of $325 million related to the fair value changes to this derivative has been recognized in the consolidated statement of income for the year ended December 31, 2018, largely due to the depreciation of the GBP from September 2018. The Company expects to record fair value gains and losses, which may be significant, through its income statement until the completion of the Transaction.•To secure funding for the Transaction, the Company entered into a bridge loan agreement with aggregate commitments of £5.2 billion in September 2018. The Company paid approximately $35 million of customary upfront fees related to the bridge loan, which are being amortized as interest expense based on the period of time the facility is expected to be in effect. The Company recorded interest expense of approximately $30 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 related to the amortization of the bridge loan fees. The commitments under the bridge loan agreement were reduced by £3.79 billion as a result of a $5 billion aggregate amount of senior notes issued in January 2019.•In addition, to hedge the economic risk of increases in interest rates prior to its issuance of senior notes in January 2019, in the fourth quarter of 2018, the Company entered into Treasury lock contracts related to $2 billion of the expected debt. These economic hedges were not designated as accounting hedges. The Company recorded an unrealized loss of $116 million related to the changes in the fair value of these derivatives in the consolidated statement of income for the year 34ended December 31, 2018. In January 2019, upon issuance of the $5 billion of senior notes, the Company settled the Treasury lock contracts and made a payment to its counter party for $122 million. An additional charge of $6 million will be recorded in the first quarter of 2019 related to the settlement of the Treasury lock derivatives.•The Company owns approximately 33% of the common stock of Alexander Forbes (""AF""), a South African company listed on the Johannesburg Stock Exchange, which it purchased in 2014 for 7.50 South African Rand per share. Based on the duration of time and the extent to which the shares traded below their cost, the Company concluded the decline in value of the investment was other than temporary and recorded a charge of $83 million in the 2018 consolidated statement of income.•Pension Settlement charge – The Defined Benefit Pension Plans in the U.K. allow participants an option for the payment of a lump sum distribution from plan assets before retirement in full satisfaction of the retirement benefits due to the participant as well as any survivor’s benefit. The Company’s policy under applicable U.S. GAAP is to treat these lump sum payments as a partial settlement of the plan liability if they exceed the sum of service cost plus interest cost components of net period pension cost of a plan for the year (""settlement thresholds""). The amount of lump sum payments through December 31, 2018 exceeded the settlement thresholds in two of the U.K. plans. The Company recorded non-cash settlement charges, primarily related to these plans of $42 million in December 2018 in the consolidated statement of income, of which approximately 90% impacted Risk and Insurance Services.In 2017, the Company’s results of operations and earnings per share were impacted, in part, by two significant items:•U.S. tax reform – On December 22, 2017, the U.S. enacted comprehensive tax legislation commonly referred to as the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the ""TCJA""). The TCJA provides for a reduction in the U.S. corporate tax rate to 21% and the creation of a territorial tax system. The TCJA also changes the deductibility of certain expenses, primarily executive officers compensation. An aggregate charge of $460 million was recorded in the fourth quarter of 2017 as a result of the enactment of the TCJA. The TCJA provides for a transition to the territorial system through a deemed repatriation tax (the ""transition tax"") on undistributed earnings of non-U.S. subsidiaries. The Company recorded a provisional charge of $240 million in the fourth quarter of 2017 as an estimate of U.S. transition taxes and ancillary effects, including state taxes and foreign withholding taxes related to the change in permanent reinvestment status with respect to our pre-2018 foreign earnings. This transition tax is payable over eight years. The reduction of the U.S. corporate tax rate from 35% to 21%, reduces the value of the U.S. deferred tax assets and liabilities, accordingly, a net charge of $220 million was also recorded in the fourth quarter of 2017 in the consolidated statement of income.•Pension Settlement charge – Similar to the item discussed above, the Company recorded a non-cash settlement charge, primarily related to its U.K. plans of $54 million in 2017, of which approximately 85% impacted Risk and Insurance Services.Consolidated operating income increased 4%, to $2.8 billion in 2018 compared with $2.7 billion in 2017, reflecting the impact of 7% increases in both revenue and operating expenses. Income before income taxes decreased 15%, to $2.2 billion. This decrease primarily resulted from the significant items discussed above (the ""significant items""), which reduced income before taxes by 21%, and more than offset the increase in operating income. Net income attributable to the Company (""after tax income"") increased 11%, of which 9% was due to the year-over-year increase in operating earnings and investment income related to the change in fair value of equity securities, partly offset by the significant items discussed above and higher interest expense. The year over year impact of the significant items was 2% of the increase.Diluted earnings per share increased 13% to $3.23 in 2018 compared with $2.87 in 2017. This increase primarily resulted from an increase in operating earnings and investment income related to the change in fair value of equity securities, partly offset by the significant items discussed above and higher interest expense, as well as a 2% decrease in the average number of shares outstanding. The negative earnings per share impact of the significant items was in 2018, largely offset by the year-over-year impact of the 35$460 million charge in 2017 related to U.S. tax reform, which together resulted in a net increase of approximately $.06 in diluted earnings per share.Average diluted shares outstanding for 2018 decreased to 511 million, compared with 519 million during 2017. Share repurchases during the year were partly offset by the shares issued related to vesting of share awards and the exercise of employee stock options.Risk and Insurance Services operating income increased $133 million, or 8%, in 2018 compared with 2017. Revenue increased 8%, reflecting a 5% increase on an underlying basis and a 3% increase from acquisitions. Expense increased 8% or 5% on an underlying basis in 2018 compared with 2017.Consulting operating income decreased $11 million, or 1%, to $1.1 billion in 2018 compared with 2017, reflecting the combined impact of a 5% growth in revenue and 6% in expense.Consolidated operating income increased 9%, to $2.7 billion, in 2017 compared to $2.4 billion in 2016, reflecting the combined impact of a 6% increase in revenue and a 5% increase in expenses as compared to the prior year.Risk and Insurance Services operating income increased $150 million, or 9% in 2017 compared with 2016. Revenue increased 7% reflecting a 3% increase on an underlying basis and a 4% increase from acquisitions. Expense increased 6% compared with 2016.Consulting operating income increased $72 million, or 7%, to $1.1 billion in 2017 compared with 2016, reflecting the combined impact of 5% growth for both revenue and expense.Consolidated Revenue and ExpenseRevenue - Components of ChangeThe Company conducts business in many countries. As a result, foreign exchange rate movements may impact period-to-period comparisons of revenue. Similarly, certain other items such as the revenue impact of acquisitions and dispositions, including transfers among businesses, and the impact of the new revenue standard, ASC 606, may impact period-to-period comparisons of revenue. Underlying revenue measures the change in revenue from one period to another by isolating these impacts.

The Consulting segment's revenue increased 5% compared with 2017, or 3% on an underlying basis. Revenue increased 3% and 5% on an underlying basis at Mercer and Oliver Wyman Group, respectively, as compared with 2017. As discussed in more detail in Note 2 of the consolidated financial statements, the adoption of the new revenue standard shifted income among quarters from historical patterns, but did not have a significant year-over-year impact on annual revenue.Consolidated revenue was $14 billion in 2017, an increase of 6%, or 3% on an underlying basis. Revenue in the Risk and Insurance Services segment increased 7% in 2017 compared with 2016, or 3% on an underlying basis. Revenue increased 3% and 4% on an underlying basis at Marsh and Guy Carpenter, respectively, as compared with 2016. The Consulting segment's revenue increased 5% compared with 2016, or 4% on an underlying basis. Revenue increased 2% and 7% on an underlying basis at Mercer and Oliver Wyman Group, respectively, as compared with 2016.Operating ExpenseConsolidated operating expenses increased 7% in 2018 compared with 2017, or 5% on an underlying basis. The increase in underlying expenses is primarily due to higher base salaries, incentive compensation, asset based fees, recoverable expenses and costs associated with the acquisition of JLT as well as the impact of severance and consulting costs related to the Marsh simplification initiative and Mercer business restructure discussed below under ""Risk and Insurance Services"" and ""Consulting"", respectively.Consolidated operating expenses increased 5% in 2017 compared with 2016, or 2% on an underlying basis. The increase in underlying expenses was primarily due to higher base salaries and incentive compensation costs, partly offset by lower costs related to liabilities for errors and omissions.38Risk and Insurance ServicesIn the Risk and Insurance Services segment, the Company’s subsidiaries and other affiliated entities act as brokers, agents or consultants for insureds, insurance underwriters and other brokers in the areas of risk management, insurance broking and insurance program management services, primarily under the name of Marsh; and engage in reinsurance broking, catastrophe and financial modeling services and related advisory functions, primarily under the name of Guy Carpenter.Marsh and Guy Carpenter are compensated for brokerage and consulting services primarily through fees paid by clients or commissions paid out of premiums charged by insurance and reinsurance companies. Commission rates vary in amount depending upon the type of insurance or reinsurance coverage provided, the particular insurer or reinsurer, the capacity in which the broker acts and negotiates with clients. Revenues can be affected by premium rate levels in the insurance/reinsurance markets, the amount of risk retained by insurance and reinsurance clients themselves and by the value of the risks that have been insured since commission-based compensation is frequently related to the premiums paid by insureds/reinsureds. In many cases, fee compensation may be negotiated in advance, based on the type of risk, coverage required and service provided by the Company and ultimately, the extent of the risk placed into the insurance market or retained by the client. The trends and comparisons of revenue from one period to the next can be affected by changes in premium rate levels, fluctuations in client risk retention and increases or decreases in the value of risks that have been insured, as well as new and lost business, and the volume of business from new and existing clients.Marsh also receives other compensation from insurance companies, separate from retail fees and commissions. This compensation includes, among other things, payment for consulting and analytics services provided to insurers; administrative and other services provided to or on behalf of insurers (including services relating to the administration and management of quota share, panels and other facilities in which insurers participate); and contingent commissions. Marsh and Guy Carpenter also receive interest income on certain funds (such as premiums and claims proceeds) held in a fiduciary capacity for others. The investment of fiduciary funds is regulated by state and other insurance authorities. These regulations typically require segregation of fiduciary funds and limit the types of investments that may be made with them. Interest income from these investments varies depending on the amount of funds invested and applicable interest rates, both of which vary from time to time. For presentation purposes, fiduciary interest is segregated from the other revenues of Marsh and Guy Carpenter and separately presented within the segment, as shown in the revenue by segments charts presented earlier in this MD&A.The results of operations for the Risk and Insurance Services segment are presented below: (In millions of dollars, except percentages)2018 2017 2016Revenue$8,228 $7,630 $7,143Compensation and Benefits4,485 4,171 3,904Other Operating Expenses1,879 1,728 1,658Operating Expenses6,364 5,899 5,562Operating Income$1,864 $1,731 $1,581Operating Income Margin22.7% 22.7% 22.1%RevenueRevenue in the Risk and Insurance Services segment increased 8% in 2018 compared with 2017, due to a 5% growth in underlying revenue and 3% growth from acquisitions. The adoption of the new revenue standard shifted revenue among quarters from historical patterns, but did not have a significant year-over-year impact on annual revenue.In Marsh, revenue increased 7% to $6.9 billion in 2018 as compared with 2017, reflecting a 4% increase on an underlying basis and a 3% increase from acquisitions. U.S./Canada had underlying revenue growth of 6%. International operations increased 2% on an underlying basis, reflecting increases of 5% in Asia Pacific and 6% in Latin America, while growth in EMEA was flat.39Guy Carpenter’s revenue increased 8% to $1.3 billion in 2018 compared with 2017, or 7% on an underlying basis.Fiduciary interest income was $65 million in 2018 compared with $39 million in 2017 due to the combined effect of higher average invested funds and higher interest rates.The Risk and Insurance Services segment completed twelve acquisitions during 2018. Information regarding those acquisitions is included in Note 4 to the consolidated financial statements.Revenue in the Risk and Insurance Services segment increased 7% in 2017 compared with 2016, due to a 3% growth in underlying revenue and 4% growth from acquisitions.In Marsh, revenue increased 7% to $6.4 billion in 2017 as compared with 2016, reflecting a 3% increase on an underlying basis and a 5% increase from acquisitions.

During 2018, Marsh initiated a program to simplify the organization through reduced management layers and more common structures across regions and businesses to more closely align with its more formalized segmentation strategy across large risk management, middle market corporate, and small commercial & personal segments. These efforts are expected to create increased efficiencies and additional capacity for reinvestment in people and technology. The Company incurred restructuring severance and consulting costs related to this initiative of $96 million in 2018. During the year, restructuring and related charges increased underlying expenses by approximately 2%. The remaining increase in underlying expense was primarily due to higher base salaries and incentive compensation.Expense in the Risk and Insurance Services segment increased 6% in 2017 compared with 2016, reflecting a 2% increase on an underlying basis and a 5% increase from acquisitions. The underlying expense increase is primarily due to higher base salaries and incentive compensation costs, partly offset by lower costs related to liabilities for errors and omissions.ConsultingThe Company conducts business in its Consulting segment through two main business groups, Mercer and Oliver Wyman Group. Mercer provides consulting expertise, advice, services and solutions in the areas of health, wealth and career. Oliver Wyman Group provides specialized management, economic and brand consulting services.Effective January 1, 2017, Mercer merged its investment and retirement businesses into a newly-created wealth business. We believe this combination better aligns Mercer’s investment management capabilities globally.The major component of revenue in the Consulting business is fees paid by clients for advice and services. Mercer, principally through its health line of business, also earns revenue in the form of commissions received from insurance companies for the placement of group (and occasionally individual) insurance contracts, primarily life, health and accident coverages. Revenue for Mercer’s investment management business and certain of Mercer’s defined contribution administration services consists principally of fees based on assets under management or administration.40Revenue in the Consulting segment is affected by, among other things, global economic conditions, including changes in clients’ particular industries and markets. Revenue is also affected by competition due to the introduction of new products and services, broad trends in employee demographics, including levels of employment, the effect of government policies and regulations, and fluctuations in interest and foreign exchange rates. Revenues from the provision of investment management services and retirement trust and administrative services are significantly affected by the level of assets under management or administration, which is impacted by securities market performance.For the investment management business, revenues from the majority of funds are included on a gross basis in accordance with U.S. GAAP and include reimbursable expenses incurred by professional staff and sub-advisory fees, and the related expenses are included in other operating expenses.The results of operations for the Consulting segment are presented below: (In millions of dollars, except percentages)2018 2017 2016Revenue$6,779 $6,444 $6,112Compensation and Benefits3,760 3,573 3,450Other Operating Expenses1,920 1,761 1,624Operating Expenses5,680 5,334 5,074Operating Income$1,099 $1,110 $1,038Operating Income Margin16.2% 17.2% 17.0%RevenueConsulting revenue in 2018 increased 5% compared with 2017, reflecting a 3% increase on an underlying basis, 1% growth from acquisitions and a 1% increase from the impact of foreign currency translation. The adoption of the new revenue recognition guidance did not have a significant impact on the timing of revenue recognition or the year-over-year amount of annual revenue in the segment in 2018.Mercer's revenue in 2018 increased 5% over the prior year to $4.7 billion, or 3% on an underlying basis. Mercer's year over year revenue comparison also reflects an increases of 1% from acquisitions and 1% from the impact of foreign currency translation. The underlying revenue growth reflects an increase in Career of 5%, Health of 4% and Wealth of 1%. Within Wealth, Investment Management & Related Services increased 9% while Defined Benefit Consulting & Administration decreased 4% compared with the prior year. Oliver Wyman Group’s revenue increased 7% in 2018 compared with 2017, or 5% on an underlying basis.The Consulting segment completed eight acquisitions during 2018. Information regarding these acquisitions is included in Note 4 to the consolidated financial statements.Consulting revenue in 2017 increased 5% compared with 2016, reflecting a 4% increase on an underlying basis and 2% growth from acquisitions. Mercer’s revenue increased 5% to $4.5 billion over the prior year, or 2% on an underlying basis. Mercer's year over year revenue growth also reflects an increase of 2% from acquisitions. The underlying revenue growth reflects an increase in Career of 5%, Health of 2% and Wealth of 2%. Within Wealth, Investment Management & Related Services increased 10% while Defined Benefit Consulting & Administration decreased 2% compared with the prior year. Oliver Wyman Group’s revenue increased 7% in 2017 compared with 2016, on both a reported and underlying basis.The Consulting segment completed three acquisitions during 2017.ExpenseConsulting expense in 2018 increased 6% compared with 2017, reflecting increases of 5% on an underlying basis, 1% from the impact of acquisitions and 1% from the impact of foreign currency translation. The increase in underlying expense reflects higher base salaries, asset based fees and recoverable expenses and costs incurred of $51 million associated with a business restructuring at Mercer initiated in the fourth quarter of 2018. The Company expects to incur additional costs of approximately $20-30 million in 2019 related to this initiative.Consulting expense in 2017 increased 5% compared with 2016, reflecting an increase of 3% on an underlying basis and a 3% increase from the impact of acquisitions. The increase in underlying expense 41reflects higher base salaries, asset based fees and outside service costs, partly offset by lower severance costs and lower costs related to liabilities for errors and omissions.Corporate and OtherCorporate expense in 2018 was $202 million compared with $186 million in 2017. The increase in expense is primarily due to costs related to the pending acquisition of JLT.Corporate expense in 2017 was $186 million compared with $188 million in 2016. The decrease in expense is primarily due to lower consulting, occupancy and general insurance costs. Other Corporate ItemsInterestInterest income earned on corporate funds amounted to $11 million in 2018 compared with $9 million in 2017. Interest expense in 2018 was $290 million compared with $237 million in 2017. The increase in interest expense was primarily due to higher average debt outstanding in 2018 and bridge loan financing fees related to the pending acquisition of JLT.Interest income earned on corporate funds amounted to $9 million in 2017 compared with $5 million in 2016. The decrease is due to the combined effects of a lower level of invested funds and lower interest rates. Interest expense in 2017 was $237 million compared with $189 million in 2016 due to higher average outstanding debt in 2017.Investment IncomeThe caption ""Investment income"" in the consolidated statements of income comprises realized and unrealized gains and losses from investments. It includes, when applicable, other-than-temporary declines in the value of securities, mark-to-market increases/decreases in equity investments with readily determinable fair values and equity method gains or losses on its investments in private equity funds. The Company's investments may include direct investments in insurance, consulting or other strategically linked companies and investments in private equity funds.As discussed in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements, effective January 1, 2018, the Company prospectively adopted a new accounting standard that requires equity investments (except those accounted for under the equity method of accounting or those that result in consolidation of the investee) to be measured at fair value with changes in fair value recognized in net income. The Company holds certain equity investments that under legacy U.S. GAAP were previously treated as available for sale securities, whereby the mark-to-market change was recorded to other comprehensive income in its consolidated balance sheet. The Company recorded a cumulative-effect adjustment increase to retained earnings as of the beginning of the period of adoption of $14 million, reflecting the reclassification of cumulative unrealized gains, net of tax, as of December 31, 2017 from other comprehensive income to retained earnings. Therefore, prior periods have not been restated.The Company recorded a net investment loss of $12 million in 2018. The net investment loss reflects the impact of an $83 million charge recorded in 2018 related to an other than temporary decline in the Company's equity method investment in Alexander Forbes (see Note 10 to the consolidated financial statements) partly offset by investment gains of $54 million related to mark-to-market changes in equity securities (discussed above) and $17 million related to investments in private equity funds and other investments. The Company recorded net investment income of $15 million in 2017 compared to less than $1 million in 2016. The increase in 2017 versus 2016 was primarily due to a gain on the sale of an investment and higher equity method gains related to the Company's investments in private equity funds.Income TaxesOn December 22, 2017, the U.S. tax legislation commonly known as the ""Tax Cuts and Jobs Act"" (the ""TCJA"") significantly changed the U.S. Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended. The TCJA generally became effective on January 1, 2018. The TCJA provided for a reduction in the U.S. corporate tax rate to 21% and the creation of a new method of taxing non-U.S. based operations. The TCJA also changed the deductibility of certain expenses, primarily executive officers’ compensation and interest. In the fourth quarter of 2017 the Company recorded a provisional charge of $460 million related to the enactment of 42the TCJA. As discussed in Note 7 to the consolidated financial statements, this provisional charge was adjusted in 2018.The TCJA provided for a transition to a new method of taxing non-U.S. based operations via a transition tax on undistributed earnings of non-U.S. subsidiaries. The Company recorded a provisional charge of $240 million in the fourth quarter of 2017 as an estimate of U.S. transition taxes and ancillary effects, including state taxes and foreign withholding taxes related to the change in permanent reinvestment status with respect to our pre-2018 foreign earnings. This transition tax is payable over eight years. The reduction of the U.S. corporate tax rate from 35% to 21% reduced the value of the U.S. deferred tax assets and liabilities; accordingly, a charge of $220 million was recorded. Adjustments during 2018 to the provisional estimates of transition taxes and U.S. deferred tax assets and liabilities decreased income tax expense by $5 million. These amounts are now final, and the Company does not expect further adjustments to the initial provisional charge.The Company's consolidated effective tax rate was 25.6%, 42.9%, and 27.6% in 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively. The rate in 2018 reflects ongoing impacts of the TCJA, primarily the reduced 21% U.S. statutory tax rate and certain tax planning benefits, largely offset by higher estimated costs from the new method of taxing non-U.S. based operations, greater disallowance of compensation and entertainment deductions, the effect of a charge related to the Company’s investment in Alexander Forbes as discussed in Note 10 and a decrease in excess tax benefits related to share compensation primarily due to the lower U.S. tax rate. The rates in 2017 and 2016 reflect foreign operations taxed at rates below the 35% U.S. statutory tax rate, including the effect of repatriation. The tax rates in all periods reflect the impact of discrete tax matters, tax legislation, and nontaxable adjustments to contingent acquisition consideration.The effective tax rate is sensitive to the geographic mix and repatriation of the Company's earnings, which may result in higher or lower tax rates. Thus, a shift in the mix of profits among jurisdictions can affect the effective tax rate. In 2018, pre-tax income in the U.K., Barbados, Canada, Australia, and Ireland accounted for approximately 60% of the Company's total non-U.S. pre-tax income, with effective rates in those countries of 26%, 1%, 28%, 27% and 10%, respectively.The TCJA is expected to provide an ongoing benefit to our effective tax rate and U.S. cash tax liabilities due to the significantly lower U.S. statutory tax rate and the quasi-territorial system.As a U.S. domiciled parent holding company, Marsh & McLennan Companies, Inc. is the issuer of essentially all of the Company's external indebtedness, and incurs the related interest expense in the U.S. Further, most senior executive and oversight functions are conducted in the U.S. and the associated costs are incurred primarily in the United States.The mandatory taxation of accumulated undistributed foreign earnings through the transition tax substantially changed the economic considerations of continued permanent investment of those accumulated earnings, a key component of our global capital strategy. As a result of the transition tax, the Company anticipates repatriating most of the accumulated earnings that was previously intended to be permanently re-invested outside of the U.S. We continue to evaluate our global investment and repatriation strategy in light of expected relief from U.S. tax reform under the new quasi-territorial tax regime for future foreign earnings.The effective tax rate may vary significantly from period to period for the foreseeable future. It is sensitive to the geographic mix of and repatriation of the Company's earnings, which may result in higher or lower effective tax rates. Losses in certain jurisdictions cannot be offset by earnings from other operations, and may require valuation allowances that affect the rate, depending on estimates of the realizability of associated deferred tax assets. The effective tax rate is also sensitive to changes in unrecognized tax benefits, including the impact of settled tax audits and expired statutes of limitation.The realization of deferred tax assets depends on generating future taxable income during the periods in which the tax benefits are deductible or creditable. Tax liabilities are determined and assessed jurisdictionally by legal entity or filing group. Certain taxing jurisdictions allow or require combined or consolidated tax filings. The Company assessed the realizability of its deferred tax assets. The Company considered all available evidence, including the existence of a recent history of losses, placing particular weight on evidence that could be objectively verified. A valuation allowance was recorded to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount that the Company believes is more likely than not to be realized.43Changes in tax laws, rulings, policies or related legal and regulatory interpretations occur frequently and may also have significant favorable or adverse impacts on our effective tax rate.Liquidity and Capital ResourcesThe Company is organized as a legal entity separate and distinct from its operating subsidiaries. As the Company does not have significant operations of its own, the Company is dependent upon dividends and other payments from its operating subsidiaries to pay principal and interest on its outstanding debt obligations, pay dividends to stockholders, repurchase its shares and pay corporate expenses. The Company can also provide financial support to its operating subsidiaries for acquisitions, investments and certain parts of their business that require liquidity, such as the capital markets business of Guy Carpenter. Other sources of liquidity include borrowing facilities discussed below in financing cash flows.The Company derives a significant portion of its revenue and operating profit from operating subsidiaries located outside of the United States. Funds from those operating subsidiaries are regularly repatriated to the United States out of annual earnings. At December 31, 2018, the Company had approximately $917 million of cash and cash equivalents in its foreign operations, which includes $168 million of operating funds required to be maintained for regulatory requirements or as collateral under certain captive insurance arrangements. The Company expects to continue its practice of repatriating available funds from its non-U.S. operating subsidiaries out of current annual earnings. Where appropriate, a portion of the current year earnings will continue to be permanently reinvested. With respect to repatriating 2017 and prior earnings, the Company has evaluated such factors as its short- and long-term capital needs, acquisition and borrowing strategies, and the availability of cash for repatriation for each of its subsidiaries. The Company has determined that, in general, its permanent reinvestment assertions, in light of the enactment of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, should allow the Company to repatriate previously taxed earnings from the deemed repatriations as cash becomes available.During 2018, the Company recorded foreign currency translation adjustments which decreased net equity by $529 million. Continued strengthening of the U.S. dollar against foreign currencies would further reduce the translated U.S. dollar value of the Company’s net investments in its non-U.S. subsidiaries, as well as the translated U.S. dollar value of cash repatriations from those subsidiaries.Cash on our consolidated balance sheets includes funds available for general corporate purposes. Funds held on behalf of clients in a fiduciary capacity are segregated and shown separately in the consolidated balance sheets as an offset to fiduciary liabilities. Fiduciary funds cannot be used for general corporate purposes, and should not be considered as a source of liquidity for the Company.Operating Cash FlowsThe Company generated $2.4 billion of cash from operations in 2018, compared with $1.9 billion in 2017. These amounts reflect the net income of the Company during those periods, excluding gains or losses from investments, adjusted for non-cash charges and changes in working capital which relate primarily to the timing of payments of accrued liabilities or receipts of assets and pension contributions.Pension-Related ItemsContributionsDuring 2018, the Company contributed $30 million to its U.S. pension plans and $82 million to non-U.S. pension plans compared to contributions of $85 million to U.S. plans and $229 million to non-U.S. plans in 2017.In the United States, contributions to the tax-qualified defined benefit plans are based on ERISA guidelines and the Company generally expects to maintain a funded status of 80% or more of the liability determined under the ERISA guidelines. In 2018 the Company made $30 million of contributions to its non-qualified plans. The Company expects to contribute approximately $28 million to its U.S. pension plans in 2019.The Company contributed $21 million to the U.K. plans in 2018, including an expense allowance of approximately $9 million. Based on the funding test carried out at November 1, 2018, the Company contributions to the U.K. plans in 2019 are expected to be approximately $11 million, including the expense allowance.44Outside the United States, the Company has a large number of non-U.S. defined benefit pension plans, the largest of which are in the U.K., which comprise approximately 81% of non-U.S. plan assets at December 31, 2018. Contribution rates for non-U.S. plans are generally based on local funding practices and statutory requirements, which may differ significantly from measurements under U.S. GAAP. In the U.K., the assumptions used to determine pension contributions are the result of legally-prescribed negotiations between the Company and the plans' Trustee that typically occur every three years in conjunction with the actuarial valuation of the plans. Currently, this results in a lower funded status than under U.S. GAAP and may result in contributions irrespective of the U.S. GAAP funded status. In November 2016, the Company and the Trustee of the U.K. Defined Benefits Plans agreed to a funding deficit recovery plan for the U.K. defined benefit pension plans. The current agreement with the Trustee sets out the annual deficit contributions which would be due based on the deficit at December 31, 2015. The funding level is subject to re-assessment, in most cases on November 1 of each year. If the funding level on November 1 is sufficient, no deficit funding contributions will be required in the following year, and the contribution amount will be deferred. The funding level was re-assessed on November 1, 2018 and no deficit funding contributions are required in 2019. The funding level will be re-assessed on November 1, 2019. As part of a long-term strategy, which depends on having greater influence over asset allocation and overall investment decisions, in November 2016 the Company renewed its agreement to support annual deficit contributions by the U.K. operating companies under certain circumstances, up to GBP 450 million over a seven-year period.In the aggregate, the Company expects to contribute approximately $65 million to its non-U.S. defined benefit plans in 2019, comprising approximately $54 million to plans outside of the U.K. and $11 million to the U.K. plans.Changes to Pension PlansIn March 2017, the Company modified its defined benefit pension plans in Canada to discontinue further benefit accruals for participants after December 31, 2017 and replaced them with a defined contribution arrangement. The Company also amended its post-retirement benefits plan in Canada so that individuals who retire after April 1, 2019 will not be eligible to participate, except in certain situations. The Company re-measured the assets and liabilities of the plans, based on assumptions and market conditions on the amendment date.In October 2016, the Company modified its U.S. defined benefit pension plans to discontinue further benefit accruals for participants after December 31, 2016. At the same time, the Company amended its U.S. defined contribution retirement plans for most of its U.S. employees to add an automatic Company contribution equal to 4% of eligible base pay beginning on January 1, 2017. This new Company contribution, together with the Company’s current matching contribution, provides eligible U.S. employees with the opportunity to receive a total contribution of up to 7% of eligible base pay. As required under GAAP, the defined benefit plans that were significantly impacted by the modification were re-measured in October 2016 using market data and assumptions as of the modification date. The net periodic pension expense recognized in 2016 reflects the weighted average costs of the December 31, 2015 measurement and the October 2016 re-measurement. In addition, the U.S. qualified plans were merged effective December 30, 2016, since no participants would be receiving benefit accruals after December 2016.Changes in Funded Status and ExpenseThe year-over-year change in the funded status of the Company's pension plans is impacted by the difference between actual and assumed results, particularly with regard to return on assets, and changes in the discount rate, as well as the amount of Company contributions, if any. Unrecognized actuarial losses were approximately $1.9 billion and $2.6 billion at December 31, 2018 for the U.S. plans and non-U.S. plans, respectively, compared with $1.8 billion and $2.6 billion at December 31, 2017. The increase in the U.S. was primarily due to a decrease in asset values partly offset by the impact of an increase in the discount rate used to measure plan liabilities. The actuarial loss related to the non-U.S. plans was unchanged as a decrease in the value of the plans' assets was offset by the impact of increases in the discount rate used to measure the plans' liabilities, the impact of the U.K. settlement in the fourth quarter of 2018 discussed above and by the impact of foreign exchange translation. In the past several years, the amount of unamortized losses has been significantly impacted, both positively and negatively, by actual asset performance and changes in discount rates. The discount rate used to measure plan liabilities 45increased in both the U.S. and the U.K. (the Company's largest plans) in 2018. The discount rate used to measure plan liabilities decreased in 2017 and in 2016. The decreases in 2017 and 2016 followed an increase in 2015. An increase in the discount rate decreases the measured plan benefit obligation, resulting in actuarial gains, while a decrease in the discount rate increases the measured plan obligation, resulting in actuarial losses. During 2018, the Company's defined benefit pension plan assets had losses of 7.4% and 1.0% in the U.S. and U.K., respectively. During 2017, the Company's defined benefit pension plan assets had actual returns of 19.3% and 9.1% in the U.S. and U.K., respectively. During 2016, the Company's defined benefit pension plan assets had actual returns of 9.8% in the U.S. and 22.1% in the U.K.Overall, based on the measurement at December 31, 2018, expenses related to the Company’s defined benefit plans are expected to decrease in 2019 by approximately $51 million compared to 2018, reflecting an increase in U.S. plans of $8 million and a decrease in non-U.S. plans of approximately $59 million, primarily in the U.K. The decrease in non-U.S. plans is primarily in the U.K., and reflects a lower charge for amortization of the net actuarial loss as well as the reduction in the 2018 net benefit credit by the $42 million settlement charge discussed previously. The recognition of a similar charge in 2019 and the amount of such a charge, if any, is dependent upon whether participant lump sum elections reach or exceed the settlement threshold.Prior to 2016, service and interest costs were estimated using a single weighted average discount rate derived from the yield curves used to measure the benefit obligations at the beginning of the period. In 2016, the Company changed the approach used to estimate the service and interest cost components of net periodic benefit cost for its significant non-U.S. plans. This change in approach was made to improve the correlation between the projected benefit cash flows and the corresponding yield curve spot rates and to provide a more precise measurement of service and interest costs. The change did not impact the measurement of the plans’ total projected benefit obligation. The Company accounted for this change as a change in estimate, that was applied prospectively beginning in 2016 and resulted in pension expense being approximately $45 million lower in 2016 than if the prior approach had been used.The Company’s accounting policies for its defined benefit pension plans, including the selection of and sensitivity to assumptions, are discussed below under Management’s Discussion of Critical Accounting Policies. For additional information regarding the Company’s retirement plans, see Note 8 to the consolidated financial statements.Financing Cash FlowsNet cash used for financing activities was $1.3 billion in 2018 compared with $1.0 billion used in 2017.DebtThe Company increased outstanding debt by approximately $340 million in 2018 and $680 million in 2017.The Company has established a short-term debt financing program of up to $1.5 billion through the issuance of commercial paper. The proceeds from the issuance of commercial paper are used for general corporate purposes. The Company had no commercial paper outstanding at December 31, 2018.In October 2018, the Company repaid $250 million of maturing senior notes.In March 2018, the Company issued $600 million of 4.20% senior notes due 2048. The Company used the net proceeds for general corporate purposes.In January 2017, the Company issued $500 million of 2.75% senior notes due in 2022 and $500 million of 4.35% senior notes due in 2047. The Company used the net proceeds for general corporate purposes, which included the repayment of a $250 million debt maturity in April 2017.In March 2016, the Company issued $350 million of 3.30% seven-year senior notes. The Company used the net proceeds from this issuance for general corporate purposes.Subsequent EventAs part of the Company’s planned financing for the proposed acquisition of JLT, the Company issued $5 billion aggregate amount of senior notes in January 2019. The various tranches consisted of $700 million of 3.50% senior notes due 2020, $1 billion of 3.875% senior notes due 2024, $1.25 billion of 4.375% 46senior notes due 2029, $500 million of 4.75% senior notes due 2039, $1.25 billion of 4.90% senior notes due 2049 and $300 million floating rate senior notes due 2021. The Company intends to use the net proceeds to fund, in part, the pending acquisition of JLT, including the payment of related fees and expenses, and to repay certain JLT indebtedness.Credit FacilitiesOn September 18, 2018, the Company entered into a bridge loan agreement to secure funding for the proposed JLT transaction. The Company paid approximately $35 million of customary upfront fees related to the bridge loan, which are being amortized as interest expense based on the period of time the facility is expected to be in effect (including any loans outstanding). The bridge loan agreement is discussed in more detail in Note 13 of the consolidated financial statements.In October 2018, the Company and certain of its foreign subsidiaries increased its multi-currency five-year unsecured revolving credit facility from $1.5 billion to $1.8 billion. The interest rate on this facility is based on LIBOR plus a fixed margin which varies with the Company's credit ratings. This facility expires in October 2023 and requires the Company to maintain certain coverage and leverage ratios which are tested quarterly. There were no borrowings outstanding under this facility at December 31, 2018.The Company also maintains other credit facilities, guarantees and letters of credit with various banks, aggregating $594 million at December 31, 2018 and $624 million at December 31, 2017. There were no outstanding borrowings under these facilities at December 31, 2018 or December 31, 2017.The Company's senior debt is currently rated A- by Standard & Poor's and Baa1 by Moody's. The Company's short-term debt is currently rated A-2 by Standard & Poor's and P-2 by Moody's. The Company carries a negative outlook from both firms.Share RepurchasesDuring 2018, the Company repurchased 8.2 million shares of its common stock for total consideration of $675 million at an average price per share of $82.61. In November 2016, the Board of Directors authorized an increase in the Company’s share repurchase program, which supersedes any prior authorization, allowing management to buy back up to $2.5 billion of the Company’s common stock. As of December 31, 2018, the Company remained authorized to purchase additional shares of its common stock up to a value of approximately $866 million. There is no time limit on this authorization.During 2017, the Company repurchased 11.5 million shares of its common stock for total consideration of $900 million at an average price per share of $77.93.DividendsThe Company paid total dividends of $807 million in 2018 ($1.58 per share), $740 million in 2017 ($1.43 per share) and $682 million in 2016 ($1.30 per share).Contingent Payments Related To AcquisitionsDuring 2018, the Company paid $91 million of contingent payments related to acquisitions made in prior years. These payments are split between financing and operating cash flows in the consolidated statements of cash flows. Payments of $55 million related to the contingent consideration liability that was recorded on the date of acquisition are reflected as financing cash flows. Payments related to increases in the contingent consideration liability subsequent to the date of acquisition of $36 million are reflected as operating cash flows. Remaining estimated future contingent consideration payments of $183 million for acquisitions completed in 2018 and in prior years are included in accounts payable and accrued liabilities or other liabilities in the consolidated balance sheet at December 31, 2018. The Company paid deferred purchase consideration related to prior years' acquisitions of $62 million, $55 million and $54 million in the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively. Remaining deferred cash payments of approximately $139 million are included in accounts payable and accrued liabilities or other liabilities in the consolidated balance sheet at December 31, 2018.In 2017, the Company paid $108 million of contingent payments related to acquisitions made in prior periods, of which $81 million was reported as financing cash flows and $27 million as operating cash flows. In 2016, the Company made $86 million of contingent payments related to acquisitions made in prior periods, of which $44 million was reported as financing cash flows and $42 million as operating cash flows.47DerivativesIn connection with the JLT Transaction, to hedge the risk of appreciation of the GBP-denominated purchase price relative to the U.S. dollar, on September 20, 2018, the Company entered into the FX Contract to, solely upon consummation of the Transaction, purchase £5.2 billion and sell a corresponding amount of U.S dollars at a contracted exchange rate. The FX Contract is discussed in Note 11 to the consolidated financial statements. An unrealized loss of $325 million related to the change in fair value of this derivative has been recognized in the consolidated statement of income for year ended December 31, 2018, primarily related to the depreciation of the GBP. The FX Contract does not qualify for hedge accounting treatment under applicable accounting guidance. The Company expects to record fair value gains and losses, which may be significant, through its income statement until the completion of the Transaction.In connection with the JLT Transaction, to hedge the risk of increases in future interest rates prior to its issuance of senior notes, in the fourth quarter of 2018, the Company entered into Treasury locks related to $2 billion of the expected debt. The fair value at December 31, 2018 is based on the published treasury rate plus forward premium as of December 31, 2018 compared to the all in rate at the inception of the contract. The contracts were not designated as an accounting hedge.The Company recorded an unrealized loss of $116 million related to the change in the fair value of these derivatives in the consolidated statement of income for the twelve months ended December 31, 2018. In January 2019, upon issuance of the $5 billion of senior notes, the Company settled the treasury lock derivatives and made a payment to its counter party for $122 million. An additional charge of $6 million will be recorded in the first quarter of 2019 related to the settlement of the Treasury lock derivatives.Investing Cash FlowsNet cash used for investing activities amounted to $1.1 billion in 2018 compared with $956 million used for investing activities in 2017.The Company paid $884 million and $655 million, net of cash acquired, for acquisitions it made during 2018 and 2017, respectively.The Company’s additions to fixed assets and capitalized software, which amounted to $314 million in 2018 and $302 million in 2017, primarily relate to computer equipment purchases, the refurbishing and modernizing of office facilities and software development costs.The Company has commitments for potential future investments of approximately $43 million in four private equity funds that invest primarily in financial services companies.Commitments and ObligationsThe following sets forth the Company’s future contractual obligations by the types identified in the table below as of December 31, 2018: Payment due by PeriodContractual Obligations(In millions of dollars)Total Within1 Year 1-3Years 4-5Years After 5YearsCurrent portion of long-term debt$314 $314 $— $— $—Long-term debt5,548 — 1,032 1,132 3,384Interest on long-term debt2,473 224 414 330 1,505Net operating leases2,071 329 574 447 721Service agreements259 189 51 15 4Other long-term obligations359 109 197 53 —Total$11,024 $1,165 $2,268 $1,977 $5,614The chart does not include the senior notes issued in January 2019 discussed above. The above does not include the liability for unrecognized tax benefits of $78 million as the Company is unable to reasonably predict the timing of settlement of these liabilities, other than approximately $3 million that may become payable during 2019. The above does not include net pension liabilities of approximately $1.8 billion because the timing and amount of ultimate payment of such liability is dependent upon future 48events, including, but not limited to, future returns on plan assets and changes in the discount rate used to measure the liabilities. The above does not include the remaining transitional tax payments related to the TCJA of $171 million. The above does not include expected payments related to the pending acquisition of JLT. The amounts of estimated future benefits payments to be made from pension plan assets are disclosed in Note 8 to the consolidated financial statements. In 2019, the Company expects to contribute approximately $28 million and $65 million to its U.S. and non-U.S. defined benefit pension plans, respectively.Management’s Discussion of Critical Accounting PoliciesThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (""GAAP"") requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue and expenses, and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. Management considers the policies discussed below to be critical to understanding the Company’s financial statements because their application places the most significant demands on management’s judgment, and requires management to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain. Actual results may differ from those estimates.Revenue RecognitionThe adoption of the new revenue standard on January 1, 2018 has increased the significance of judgments and estimates management must make to apply the guidance. In particular, in the Risk and Insurance Services segment, judgments related to the amount of variable revenue consideration to ultimately be received on placement of quota share reinsurance treaties and contingent commission from insurers, which was previously recognized when the contingency was resolved, now requires significant judgments and estimates.Under the new standard, certain costs to obtain or fulfill a contract that were previously expensed as incurred have been capitalized. The Company capitalizes the incremental costs to obtain contracts primarily related to commissions or sales bonus payments. These deferred costs are amortized over the expected life of the underlying customer relationships. The Company also capitalizes certain pre-placement costs that are considered fulfillment costs that are amortized at a point in time when the associated revenue is recognized.Management also makes significant judgments and estimates to measure the progress toward completing performance obligations and realization rates for consideration related to contracts as well as potential performance-based fees in the Consulting segment.See Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information.Legal and Other Loss ContingenciesThe Company and its subsidiaries are subject to numerous claims, lawsuits and proceedings including claims for errors and omissions (""E&O""). GAAP requires that a liability be recorded when a loss is both probable and reasonably estimable. Significant management judgment is required to apply this guidance. The Company utilizes case level reviews by inside and outside counsel, an internal actuarial analysis by Oliver Wyman Group, a subsidiary of the Company, and other methods to estimate potential losses. The liability is reviewed quarterly and adjusted as developments warrant. In many cases, the Company has not recorded a liability, other than for legal fees to defend the claim, because we are unable, at the present time, to make a determination that a loss is both probable and reasonably estimable. Given the unpredictability of E&O claims and of litigation that could flow from them, it is possible that an adverse outcome in a particular matter could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s businesses, results of operations, financial condition or cash flow in a given quarterly or annual period.In addition, to the extent that insurance coverage is available, significant management judgment is required to determine the amount of recoveries that are probable of collection under the Company’s various insurance programs.Retirement BenefitsThe Company maintains qualified and non-qualified defined benefit pension and defined contribution plans for its eligible U.S. employees and a variety of defined benefit and defined contribution plans for its eligible non-U.S. employees. The Company’s policy for funding its tax-qualified defined benefit retirement 49plans is to contribute amounts at least sufficient to meet the funding requirements set forth in U.S. and applicable foreign laws.The Company recognizes the funded status of its over-funded defined benefit pension and retiree medical plans as a net benefit plan asset and its unfunded and underfunded plans as a net benefit plan liability. The gains or losses and prior service costs or credits that have not been recognized as components of net periodic costs are recorded as a component of Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income (""AOCI""), net of tax, in the Company’s consolidated balance sheets. The gains and losses that exceed specified corridors are amortized prospectively out of AOCI over a period that approximates the remaining life expectancy of participants in plans where substantially all participants are inactive or the average remaining service period of active participants for plans with active participants. The vast majority of unrecognized losses relate to inactive plans and are amortized over the remaining life expectancy of the participants.The determination of net periodic pension cost is based on a number of assumptions, including an expected long-term rate of return on plan assets, the discount rate, mortality and assumed rate of salary increase. The assumptions used in the calculation of net periodic pension costs and pension liabilities are disclosed in Note 8 to the consolidated financial statements. The assumptions for expected rate of return on plan assets and the discount rate are discussed in more detail below.The long-term rate of return on plan assets assumption is determined for each plan based on the facts and circumstances that exist as of the measurement date, and the specific portfolio mix of each plan’s assets. The Company utilizes a model developed by Mercer, a subsidiary of the Company, to assist in the determination of this assumption. The model takes into account several factors, including: actual and target portfolio allocation; investment, administrative and trading expenses incurred directly by the plan trust; historical portfolio performance; relevant forward-looking economic analysis; and expected returns, variances and correlations for different asset classes. These measures are used to determine probabilities using standard statistical techniques to calculate a range of expected returns on the portfolio.The target asset allocation for the U.S. Plans is 64% equities and equity alternatives and 36% fixed income. At December 31, 2018, the actual allocation for the U.S. Plans was 62% equities and equity alternatives and 38% fixed income. At the end of 2018, the target asset allocation for the U.K. Plans, which comprise approximately 81% of non-U.S. Plan assets, was 34% equities and equity alternatives and 66% fixed income. At December 31, 2018, the actual allocation for the U.K. Plans was 34% equities and equity alternatives and 66% fixed income.The discount rate selected for each U.S. Plan is based on a model bond portfolio with coupons and redemptions that closely match the expected liability cash flows from the plan. Discount rates for non-U.S. plans are based on appropriate bond indices adjusted for duration; in the U.K., the plan duration is reflected using the Mercer yield curve.The table below shows the weighted average assumed rate of return and the discount rate at the December 31, 2018 measurement date (for measuring pension expense in 2019) for the total Company, the U.S. and the Rest of World (""ROW""). Total Company U.S. ROWAssumed Rate of Return on Plan Assets5.74% 7.95% 4.87%Discount Rate3.48% 4.45% 2.89%Holding all other assumptions constant, a half-percentage point change in the rate of return on plan assets and discount rate assumptions would affect net periodic pension cost for the U.S. and U.K. plans, which together comprise approximately 84% of total pension plan liabilities, as follows: 0.5 PercentagePoint Increase 0.5 PercentagePoint Decrease(In millions of dollars)U.S. U.K. U.S. U.K.Assumed Rate of Return on Plan Assets$(22) $(40) $22 $40Discount Rate$(1) $(4) $— $350The impact of discount rate changes shown above relates to the increase or decrease in actuarial gains or losses being amortized through net periodic pension cost, as well as the increase or decrease in interest expense, with all other facts and assumptions held constant. It does not contemplate nor include potential future impacts a change in the interest rate environment and discount rates might cause, such as the impact on the market value of the plans’ assets. Changing the discount rate and leaving the other assumptions constant also may not be representative of the impact on expense, because the long-term rates of inflation and salary increases are often correlated with the discount rate. Changes in these assumptions will not necessarily have a linear impact on the net periodic pension cost.The Company contributes to certain health care and life insurance benefits provided to its retired employees. The cost of these post-retirement benefits for employees in the U.S. is accrued during the period up to the date employees are eligible to retire, but is funded by the Company as incurred. The key assumptions and sensitivity to changes in the assumed health care cost trend rate are discussed in Note 8 to the consolidated financial statements.Income TaxesThe Company's tax rate reflects its income, statutory tax rates and tax planning in the various jurisdictions in which it operates. In 2017, the Company's tax expense was significantly impacted by the enactment of the TCJA, which is discussed in more detail in Note 7 to the consolidated financial statements included in this report. Significant judgment is required in determining the annual effective tax rate and in evaluating uncertain tax positions. The Company reports a liability for unrecognized tax benefits resulting from uncertain tax positions taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. The evaluation of a tax position is a two-step process. The first step involves recognition. The Company determines whether it is more likely than not that a tax position will be sustained upon tax examination, including resolution of any related appeals or litigation, based on only the technical merits of the position. The technical merits of a tax position derive from both statutory and judicial authority (legislation and statutes, legislative intent, regulations, rulings, and case law) and their applicability to the facts and circumstances of the tax position. If a tax position does not meet the more-likely-than-not recognition threshold, the benefit of that position is not recognized in the financial statements. The second step is measurement. A tax position that meets the more-likely-than-not recognition threshold is measured to determine the amount of benefit to recognize in the financial statements. The tax position is measured as the largest amount of benefit that is greater than 50 percent likely of being realized upon ultimate resolution with a taxing authority. Uncertain tax positions are evaluated based upon the facts and circumstances that exist at each reporting period and involve significant management judgment. Subsequent changes in judgment based upon new information may lead to changes in recognition, derecognition, and measurement. Adjustments may result, for example, upon resolution of an issue with the taxing authorities, or expiration of a statute of limitations barring an assessment for an issue.Certain items are included in the Company's tax returns at different times than the items are reflected in the financial statements. As a result, the annual tax expense reflected in the consolidated statements of income is different than that reported in the tax returns. Some of these differences are permanent, such as expenses that are not deductible in the returns, and some differences are temporary and reverse over time, such as depreciation expense. Temporary differences create deferred tax assets and liabilities, which are measured at existing tax rates. Deferred tax liabilities generally represent tax expense recognized in the financial statements for which payment has been deferred, or expense for which a deduction has been taken already in the tax return but the expense has not yet been recognized in the financial statements. Deferred tax assets generally represent items that can be used as a tax deduction or credit in tax returns in future years for which a benefit has already been recorded in the financial statements. The Company evaluates all significant available positive and negative evidence, including the existence of losses in recent years and its forecast of future taxable income by jurisdiction, in assessing the need for a valuation allowance. The Company also considers tax planning strategies that would result in realization of deferred tax assets, and the presence of taxable income in prior period tax filings in jurisdictions that allow for the carryback of tax attributes pursuant to the applicable tax law. The underlying assumptions the Company uses in forecasting future taxable income require significant judgment and take into account the Company's recent performance. The ultimate realization of deferred tax assets is dependent on the generation of future taxable income during the periods in which temporary differences or carry-forwards are deductible or creditable. Valuation allowances are established for deferred tax 51assets when it is estimated that it is more likely than not that future taxable income will be insufficient to fully use a deduction or credit in that jurisdiction.Fair Value DeterminationsGoodwill Impairment Testing – The Company is required to assess goodwill and any indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment annually, or more frequently if circumstances indicate impairment may have occurred. The Company performs the annual impairment test for each of its reporting units during the third quarter of each year. In accordance with applicable accounting guidance, the Company assesses qualitative factors to determine whether it is necessary to perform the two-step goodwill impairment test. The Company considered numerous factors, which included that the fair value of each reporting unit exceeded its carrying value by a substantial margin in its most recent estimate of reporting unit fair values, whether significant acquisitions or dispositions occurred which might alter the fair value of its reporting units, macroeconomic conditions and their potential impact on reporting unit fair values, actual performance compared with budget and prior projections used in its estimation of reporting unit fair values, industry and market conditions, and the year-over-year change in the Company’s share price.The Company completed its qualitative assessment in the third quarter of 2018 and concluded that a two-step goodwill impairment test was not required in 2018 and that goodwill was not impaired.Share-Based PaymentThe guidance for accounting for share-based payments requires, among other things, that the estimated fair value of stock options be charged to earnings. Significant management judgment is required to determine the appropriate assumptions for inputs such as volatility and expected term necessary to estimate option values. In addition, management judgment is required to analyze the terms of the plans and awards granted thereunder to determine if awards will be treated as equity awards or liability awards, as defined by the accounting guidance.As of December 31, 2018, there was $17 million of unrecognized compensation cost related to stock option awards. The weighted-average period over which the costs are expected to be recognized is 1.24 years. Also as of December 31, 2018, there was $238.9 million of unrecognized compensation cost related to the Company’s restricted stock, restricted stock unit and performance stock unit awards. The weighted-average period over which that cost is expected to be recognized is approximately 1.02 years.See Note 9 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding accounting for share-based payments.Investments and DerivativesAlthough not directly recorded in the Company’s consolidated balance sheets, the Company's defined benefit pension plans hold investments of approximately $14.4 billion, which include private equity and other non-liquid investments. The fair value of the plan investments determines, in part, the over-or under-funded status of those plans, which is included in the Company’s consolidated balance sheets. The Company also has minority positions in certain equity securities (primarily Alexander Forbes) as well as approximately $80 million of investments in private equity funds accounted for using the equity method of accounting.The Company reviews the carrying value of its investments (both direct and held through its pension plans) to determine if any valuation adjustments are appropriate under the applicable accounting pronouncements. The Company bases its review on the facts and circumstances as they relate to each investment. In those instances where quoted market prices are not available, particularly for private equity funds, significant management judgment is required to determine the appropriate value of the Company’s investments. Fair value of investments in private equity funds is determined by the funds’ investment managers. Factors considered in determining the fair value of private equity investments include: implied valuation of recently completed financing rounds that included sophisticated outside investors; performance multiples of comparable public companies; restrictions on the sale or disposal of the investments; trading characteristics of the securities; and the relative size of the holdings in comparison to other private investors and the public market float. In connection with the JLT Transaction, the Company entered into several derivative contracts, described in Note 11 to the consolidated financial statements. These derivative contracts are recorded at fair value 52at the end of each period, with the change in fair value recorded in the consolidated statements of income. Determining the fair value of these contracts, in particular the deal contingent foreign exchange contract, requires significant management judgments or estimates about the potential closing dates of the transaction and remaining value of the deal contingency feature.New Accounting PronouncementsNote 1 to the consolidated financial statements contains a summary of the Company’s significant accounting policies, including a discussion of recently issued accounting pronouncements and their impact or potential future impact on the Company’s financial results, if determinable, under the sub-heading ""New Accounting Pronouncements"". 53Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market RiskMarket Risk and Credit RiskCertain of the Company’s revenues, expenses, assets and liabilities are exposed to the impact of interest rate changes and fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates and equity markets.Interest Rate Risk and Credit RiskInterest income generated from the Company’s cash investments as well as invested fiduciary funds will vary with the general level of interest rates.The Company had the following investments subject to variable interest rates: (In millions of dollars)December 31, 2018Cash and cash equivalents invested in money market funds, certificates of deposit and time deposits$1,066Fiduciary cash and investments$5,001Based on the above balances, if short-term interest rates increased or decreased by 10%, or 15 basis points, over the full year, annual interest income, including interest earned on fiduciary funds, would increase or decrease by approximately $6 million.In addition to interest rate risk, our cash investments and fiduciary fund investments are subject to potential loss of value due to counter-party credit risk. To minimize this risk, the Company and its subsidiaries invest pursuant to a Board approved investment policy. The policy mandates the preservation of principal and liquidity and requires broad diversification with counter-party limits assigned based primarily on credit rating and type of investment. The Company carefully monitors its cash and fiduciary fund investments and will further restrict the portfolio as appropriate to market conditions. The majority of cash and fiduciary fund investments are invested in short-term bank deposits and liquid money market funds.Foreign Currency RiskThe translated values of revenue and expense from the Company’s international operations are subject to fluctuations due to changes in currency exchange rates. The non-U.S. based revenue that is exposed to foreign exchange fluctuations is approximately 52% of total revenue. We periodically use forward contracts and options to limit foreign currency exchange rate exposure on net income and cash flows for specific, clearly defined transactions arising in the ordinary course of business. Although the Company has significant revenue generated in foreign locations which is subject to foreign exchange rate fluctuations, in most cases both the foreign currency revenue and expenses are in the functional currency of the foreign location. As such, under normal circumstances, the U.S. dollar translation of both the revenues and expenses, as well as the potentially offsetting movements of various currencies against the U.S. dollar, generally tends to mitigate the impact on net operating income of foreign currency risk. However, there have been periods where the impact was not mitigated due to external market factors, and external macroeconomic events, such as uncertainty regarding the impact of ""Brexit"" in the United Kingdom, may result in greater foreign exchange rate fluctuations in the future. If foreign exchange rates of major currencies (Euro, Sterling, Australian dollar and Canadian dollar) moved 10% in the same direction against the U.S. dollar compared with the foreign exchange rates in 2018, the Company estimates net operating income would increase or decrease by approximately $56 million. The Company has exposure to approximately 80 foreign currencies overall. In Continental Europe, the largest amount of revenue from renewals for the Risk & Insurance Services segment occurs in the first quarter. JLT TransactionThe purchase price of the JLT Transaction is denominated in GBP. To hedge the risk of appreciation in GBP, the Company entered into an FX Contract in September 2018, which is discussed in Note 11 to the consolidated financial statements. For each 1% increase or decrease in the GBP/U.S. dollar exchange rate, the fair value of the FX Contract will increase (dollar weakens) or decrease (dollar strengthens) by approximately $70 million.54Equity Price RiskAs discussed in Note 18 to the consolidated financial statements, effective January 1, 2018, the Company adopted a new accounting standard that requires equity investments with readily determinable market values to be measured at fair value with changes in fair value recognized in net income.The Company holds investments in both public and private companies as well as private equity funds, including investments of approximately $146 million that are valued using readily determinable fair values and approximately $75 million of investments without readily determinable fair values. The Company also has investments of approximately $287 million that are accounted for using the equity method, including the Company's investment in Alexander Forbes. The investments are subject to risk of decline in market value, which, if determined to be other than temporary for assets without readily determinable fair values, could result in realized impairment losses. The Company periodically reviews the carrying value of such investments to determine if any valuation adjustments are appropriate under the applicable accounting pronouncements.The Company owns approximately 33% of the common stock of Alexander Forbes, a South African company listed on the Johannesburg Stock Exchange, which it purchased in 2014 for 7.50 South African Rand per share. The shares of AF have been trading below the Company’s carrying value since November of 2017, but had traded within 10% of the Company’s carrying value through much of the first quarter of 2018. In May 2018, the trading price declined to 30% to 35% below the Company’s cost and remained at the discounted level through the third quarter of 2018. The Company considered several factors in assessing the carrying value of its investment in AF, including its financial position, the near- and long-term prospects of AF and the broader South African economy and capital markets, the length of time and extent to which the market value was below cost and the Company’s intent and ability to retain the investment for a sufficient period of time to allow for anticipated recovery in market value. However, based on the duration of time and the extent to which the shares traded below their cost, the Company could not develop sufficient objective evidence to support a recovery of the price in the relatively near future. As such, the Company concluded the decline in value of the investment was other than temporary and recorded a charge of $83 million in 2018. As of December 31, 2018, the carrying value of the Company’s investment in Alexander Forbes was approximately $144 million. As of December 31, 2018, the market value of the approximately 443 million shares of Alexander Forbes owned by the Company, based on the December 31, 2018 closing share price of 5.14 South African Rand per share, was approximately $159 million.OtherA number of lawsuits and regulatory proceedings are pending.

62709,MMC,"MARSH & MCLENNAN COMPANIES, INC.",2020,"Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations"" of our Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2018.Acquisition of JLTOn April 1, 2019, the Company completed the acquisition (the ""Transaction"") of all of the outstanding shares of Jardine Lloyd Thompson Group plc (""JLT""), a public company organized under the laws of England and Wales. Under the terms of the Transaction, JLT shareholders received £19.15 in cash for each JLT share, which valued JLT’s existing share capital at approximately £4.3 billion (or approximately $5.6 billion based on the exchange rate of U.S. $1.31:£1) on the Transaction closing date.JLT's results of operations for the period April 1, 2019 through December 31, 2019 are included in the Company’s results of operations for 2019. Under applicable accounting guidance, JLT's results of operations for the period January 1 through March 31, 2019 and for the years ended 2018 and 2017 are not included in the Company's results of operations and therefore, affect comparability. Prior to being acquired by the Company, JLT operated in three segments: Specialty, Reinsurance and Employee Benefits. JLT operated in 41 countries, with significant revenue in the United Kingdom, Pacific, Asia and the United States. As of April 1, 2019, the historical JLT businesses were combined into MMC operations as follows: JLT Specialty is included by geography within Marsh, JLT Reinsurance is included in Guy Carpenter and the majority of JLT's Employee Benefits business was included in Mercer Health and Wealth.33Upon the consummation of the acquisition of JLT, the Company assumed the legal liabilities and became responsible for JLT’s litigation and regulatory exposures as of April 1, 2019. Please see the ""Risk Factors"" section of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for risks associated with the acquisition.The Company’s results for the year ended December 31, 2019 were impacted by JLT related acquisition, restructuring and integration costs as well as legacy MMC restructuring programs as discussed in Note 14 to the consolidated financial statements.Acquisitions and dispositions impacting the Risk and Insurance Services and Consulting segments are discussed in Note 5 to the consolidated financial statements.This MD&A contains forward-looking statements as that term is defined in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. See ""Information Concerning Forward-Looking Statements"" at the outset of this report.Consolidated Results of OperationsFor the Years Ended December 31,(In millions, except per share figures)2019 2018 2017Revenue$16,652 $14,950 $14,024Expense Compensation and Benefits9,734 8,605 8,085Other Operating Expenses4,241 3,584 3,284Operating Expenses13,975 12,189 11,369Operating Income$2,677 $2,761 $2,655Income Before Income Taxes$2,439 $2,244 $2,643Income from Continuing Operations$1,773 $1,670 $1,510Discontinued Operations, Net of Tax— — 2Net Income Before Non-Controlling Interests$1,773 $1,670 $1,512Net Income Attributable to the Company$1,742 $1,650 $1,492Basic net income per share – Continuing Operations$3.44 $3.26 $2.91– Net income attributable to the Company$3.44 $3.26 $2.91Diluted net income per share – Continuing operations$3.41 $3.23 $2.87– Net income attributable to the Company$3.41 $3.23 $2.87Average number of shares outstanding – Basic506 506 513– Diluted511 511 519Shares outstanding at December 31,504 504 509Consolidated operating income was $2.7 billion in 2019 compared with $2.8 billion in 2018. Improvements in the Company's ongoing operating results, both legacy and from the inclusion of JLT's results beginning on April 1, 2019 was offset by the year-over-year increase in JLT integration, restructuring and acquisition related costs as per the chart below.Income before income taxes increased 9% to $2.4 billion as compared to $2.2 billion in 2018, reflecting the change in operating income discussed immediately above and the increase in year-over-year interest expense, primarily related to new debt issued to finance the JLT Transaction, partly offset by lower derivative related costs, pension settlement charges and the 2018 impairment charge related to Alexander Forbes.Diluted earnings per share increased 6% to $3.41 in 2019 compared with $3.23 in 2018. This increase is a result of the factors discussed above, and a lower effective tax rate in 2019. Average diluted shares 34outstanding for 2019 remained unchanged from 2018 at 511 million. Share repurchases during the year were offset by the shares issued related to vesting of share awards and the exercise of employee stock options.Risk and Insurance Services operating income decreased $31 million, or 2%, in 2019 compared with 2018. Revenue increased 17%, reflecting a 4% increase on an underlying basis partly offset by a 2% decrease from the impact of foreign currency translation. Expense increased 22% or 5% on an underlying basis in 2019 compared with 2018 primarily due to JLT related integration, restructuring and acquisition related costs.Consulting operating income increased $111 million, or 10%, to $1.2 billion in 2019 compared with 2018, reflecting the combined impact of increases in revenue of 5% and expense of 4%.The following chart summarizes the activity related to the restructuring and noteworthy items discussed in more detail below: Twelve Months Ended December 31,(In millions)2019 2018 2017Restructuring costs, excluding JLT$112 $161 $40JLT integration and restructuring costs335 — —JLT acquisition related costs150 12 —Impact on operating income597 173 40Change in fair value of acquisition related derivative contracts8 441 —Pension settlement charges7 42 54Early extinguishment of JLT debt 32 — —JLT related interest income - pre-acquisition(25) — —JLT related interest expense - pre-acquisition53 30 —Investment loss (impairment loss)— 83 —Impact on income before taxes$672 $769 $94In 2019 and 2018, the Company’s results of operations and earnings per share were significantly impacted by the following items:•Restructuring costs, excluding JLT: Includes severance and related charges from restructuring activities, adjustments to restructuring liabilities for future rent under non-cancellable leases and other real estate costs, and restructuring costs related to the integration of recent acquisitions. These costs are discussed in more detail in Note 14 of the consolidated financial statements. •JLT integration and restructuring costs: Includes costs incurred for staff reductions, lease related exit costs as well as consulting costs related to the JLT Transaction. These costs are discussed in more detail in Note 14 of the consolidated financial statements. •JLT acquisition related costs: Includes advisor fees and stamp duty taxes related to the closing of the JLT Transaction and retention costs. These costs are reflected as part of net operating income. Also includes the loss on the sale of JLT's aerospace business, which is included in revenue. •Change in fair value of acquisition related derivatives: In connection with the JLT Transaction, to hedge the risk of appreciation of the GBP-denominated purchase price relative to the U.S. dollar, in September 2018, the Company entered into a deal contingent foreign exchange contract (the ""FX Contract"") to, solely upon consummation of the JLT Transaction, purchase £5.2 billion and sell a corresponding amount of U.S. dollars at a contracted exchange rate. The FX Contract is discussed in Note 11 to the consolidated financial statements. An unrealized loss of $325 million related to the fair value changes to this derivative was recognized in the consolidated 35statement of income for the year ended December 31, 2018, largely due to the depreciation of the GBP from September 2018. In 2019, the Company recorded a gain of $31 million upon final settlement of the FX Contract. In addition, to hedge the economic risk of increases in interest rates prior to its issuance of senior notes in January 2019, in the fourth quarter of 2018, the Company entered into Treasury lock contracts related to $2 billion of the expected debt issuance. These economic hedges were not designated as accounting hedges. The Company recorded an unrealized loss of $116 million related to the changes in the fair value of these derivatives in the consolidated statement of income for the year ended December 31, 2018. In January 2019, upon issuance of the $5 billion of senior notes, the Company settled the Treasury lock contracts and made a payment to its counter party for $122 million. In 2019, an additional charge of $6 million was recorded to the consolidated statement of income related to the settlement of the Treasury lock derivatives.•JLT related interest income and expense: To secure funding for the Transaction, the Company entered into a bridge loan agreement with aggregate commitments of £5.2 billion in September 2018. The Company paid the customary upfront fees related to the bridge loan, which were amortized as interest expense based on the period of time the facility was expected to be in effect. The Company recorded interest expense of approximately $30 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 related to the amortization of the bridge loan fees and an additional $6 million in 2019 upon termination of the bridge loan agreement in connection with the closing of the JLT Transaction. The Company recorded approximately $47 million of interest expense related to the senior notes issued in the first quarter of 2019 and $25 million of interest income from the investment of the proceeds prior to the closing of the JLT Transaction•Investment loss-impairment charge: The Company owns approximately 34% of the common stock of Alexander Forbes (""AF""), a South African company listed on the Johannesburg Stock Exchange, which it purchased in 2014 for 7.50 South African Rand per share. Based on the duration of time and the extent to which the shares traded below their cost, the Company concluded the decline in value of the investment was other than temporary and recorded a charge of $83 million in the 2018 consolidated statement of income. See Note 5 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding the pending sale of the Company's remaining investment in AF.•Pension settlement charge: The Defined Benefit Pension Plans in the U.K. and certain other countries allow participants an option for the payment of a lump sum distribution from plan assets before retirement in full satisfaction of the retirement benefits due to the participant as well as any survivor’s benefit. The Company’s policy under applicable U.S. GAAP is to treat these lump sum payments as a partial settlement of the plan liability if they exceed the sum of service cost plus interest cost components of net period pension cost of a plan for the year (""settlement thresholds""). The amount of lump sum payments through December 31, 2018 exceeded the settlement thresholds in two of the U.K. plans. The Company recorded non-cash settlement charges, primarily related to these plans of $42 million and $54 million for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively, of which approximately 90% impacted Risk and Insurance Services. In 2019, the Company recorded $7 million of non-cash pension settlement charges related to certain of its non U.S. plans.JLT Integration and Restructuring CostsThe Company is currently integrating JLT, which is discussed in more detail in Note 14 to the consolidated financial statements, and will incur costs in connection with the integration and restructuring of the combined businesses, primarily related to severance, real estate rationalization, technology, consulting fees related to the management of the integration processes and legal fees related to the rationalization of legal entity structures. Based on current estimates, the Company expects to incur pre-tax charges of $700 million, of which approximately $625 million will be cash charges. These costs reflect $335 million incurred in 2019 and projected costs of approximately $365 million, most of which will be incurred in 2020 and the remainder in 2021. Based on further analysis and review during the second half of 2019, the Company identified additional opportunities for further efficiencies that will result in additional future cost savings and is currently tracking ahead of our prior guidance. The Company expects to achieve run rate savings of at least $350 million. The Company has realized cost savings in 2019 of approximately $125 36million and expects to achieve the remainder by the end of 2021. The Company incurred cash charges of approximately $265 million during 2019 and expects most of the remaining cash expenditures to occur in 2020, with a modest amount in 2021, related to this initiative. These integration and restructuring plans are still being finalized, which may change our current cost and related savings estimates, as the Company continues to refine its detailed plans for each business and location.JLT Acquisition Related CostsJLT acquisition related costs include costs directly related to completing the Transaction, such as retention costs, investment banking fees, legal fees and stamp duty tax. It also includes the loss on disposal of JLT's aerospace business.Consolidated Revenue and ExpenseRevenue - Components of ChangeThe Company conducts business in many countries. As a result, foreign exchange rate movements may impact period-to-period comparisons of revenue. Similarly, certain other items such as the revenue impact of acquisitions and dispositions, including transfers among businesses may impact period-to-period comparisons of revenue. Underlying revenue measures the change in revenue from one period to another by isolating these impacts. The calculation of underlying revenue growth for the twelve-month period ended December 31, 2019, is calculated as if MMC and JLT were a combined company a year ago, but excludes the impact of currency and other acquisitions, dispositions, and transfers among businesses. Combined prior year revenue information for MMC and JLT for the twelve-month periods ended December 31, 2018 are presented below. The unaudited 2018 JLT revenue amounts in the ""2018 including JLT"" column reflect historical JLT revenue information following IFRS, adjusted to conform with U.S. GAAP and the Company's specific accounting policies, primarily related to development of constraints and subsequent release of those constraints related to the reinsurance business. The decrease in revenue due to the disposal of JLT's Aerospace business is reflected in the acquisitions/dispositions column beginning in June 2019, when the sale was completed. See the reconciliation of non-GAAP measures on page 55. All other acquisitions/dispositions activity is included in the acquisitions/dispositions column. Underlying expense growth is calculated in a similar manner. The impact of foreign currency exchange fluctuations, acquisitions and dispositions, including transfers among businesses, on the Company’s operating revenues by segment are as follows: Year EndedDecember 31, 2018 Including JLT % Change Including JLT in 2018 Components of Revenue Change Including JLT*(In millions, except percentage figures)2019 2018 % Change GAAPRevenue Currency Impact Acquisitions/Dispositions/ Other Impact Underlying RevenueRisk and Insurance Services Marsh$8,014 $6,877 17% $7,895 2% (2)% — 4%Guy Carpenter1,480 1,286 15% 1,442 3% (1)% (1)% 5%Subtotal9,494 8,163 16% 9,337 2% (2)% — 4%Fiduciary Interest Income105 65 78 Total Risk and Insurance Services9,599 8,228 17% 9,415 2% (2)% — 4%Consulting Mercer5,021 4,732 6% 5,001 — (2)% — 2%Oliver Wyman Group2,122 2,047 4% 2,047 4% (2)% — 6%Total Consulting7,143 6,779 5% 7,048 1% (2)% — 3%Corporate/Eliminations(90) (57) (57) Total Revenue$16,652 $14,950 11% $16,406 2% (2)% — 4%37The following table provides more detailed revenue information for certain of the components presented above: Year EndedDecember 31, 2018 Including JLT % Change Including JLT in 2018 Components of Revenue Change Including JLT*(In millions, except percentage figures)2019 2018 % Change GAAPRevenue Currency Impact Acquisitions/ Dispositions/ Other Underlying RevenueMarsh: EMEA$2,482 $2,132 16% $2,607 (5)% (3)% (2)% 1 %Asia Pacific953 683 39% 948 1 % (3)% (3)% 7 %Latin America460 400 15% 515 (11)% (8)% (6)% 3 %Total International3,895 3,215 21% 4,070 (4)% (4)% (3)% 3 %U.S./Canada4,119 3,662 12% 3,825 8 % — 3 % 5 %Total Marsh$8,014 $6,877 17% $7,895 2 % (2)% — 4 %Mercer: Wealth2,369 2,185 8% 2,394 (1)% (3)% 2 % —Health1,796 1,735 4% 1,793 — (1)% (3)% 5 %Career856 812 5% 814 5 % (2)% 3 % 5 %Total Mercer$5,021 $4,732 6% $5,001 — (2)% — 2 %* Components of revenue change may not add due to rounding.RevenueConsolidated revenue was $17 billion in 2019, an increase of 11%, or 4% on an underlying basis. Revenue in the Risk and Insurance Services segment increased 17% in 2019 compared with 2018, or 4% on an underlying basis. Revenue increased 4% and 5% on an underlying basis at Marsh and Guy Carpenter, respectively, as compared with 2018. The Consulting segment's revenue increased 5% compared with 2018, or 3% on an underlying basis. Revenue increased 2% and 6% on an underlying basis at Mercer and Oliver Wyman Group, respectively, as compared with 2018.Operating ExpenseConsolidated operating expenses increased 15% in 2019 compared with 2018, or 4% on an underlying basis. The increase in underlying expenses is primarily due to the JLT acquisition, integration and restructuring as discussed in more detail in Notes 5 and 14 of the consolidated financial statements, as well as higher incentive compensation. Risk and Insurance ServicesIn the Risk and Insurance Services segment, the Company’s subsidiaries and other affiliated entities act as brokers, agents or consultants for insureds, insurance underwriters and other brokers in the areas of risk management, insurance broking and insurance program management services, primarily under the name of Marsh; and engage in reinsurance broking, catastrophe and financial modeling services and related advisory functions, primarily under the name of Guy Carpenter.Marsh and Guy Carpenter are compensated for brokerage and consulting services primarily through fees paid by clients or commissions paid out of premiums charged by insurance and reinsurance companies. Commission rates vary in amount depending upon the type of insurance or reinsurance coverage provided, the particular insurer or reinsurer, the capacity in which the broker acts and negotiates with clients. Revenues can be affected by premium rate levels in the insurance/reinsurance markets, the amount of risk retained by insurance and reinsurance clients themselves and by the value of the risks that have been insured since commission-based compensation is frequently related to the premiums paid by insureds/reinsureds. In many cases, fee compensation may be negotiated in advance, based on the type of risk, coverage required and service provided by the Company and ultimately, the extent of the risk placed into the insurance market or retained by the client. The trends and comparisons of revenue from one period to the next can be affected by changes in premium rate levels, fluctuations in client risk retention and increases or decreases in the value of risks that have been insured, as well as new and lost business, and the volume of business from new and existing clients.38Marsh also receives other compensation from insurance companies, separate from retail fees and commissions. This compensation includes, among other things, payment for consulting and analytics services provided to insurers; administrative and other services provided to or on behalf of insurers (including services relating to the administration and management of quota share, panels and other facilities in which insurers participate); and contingent commissions. Marsh and Guy Carpenter also receive interest income on certain funds (such as premiums and claims proceeds) held in a fiduciary capacity for others. The investment of fiduciary funds is regulated by state and other insurance authorities. These regulations typically require segregation of fiduciary funds and limit the types of investments that may be made with them. Interest income from these investments varies depending on the amount of funds invested and applicable interest rates, both of which vary from time to time. For presentation purposes, fiduciary interest is segregated from the other revenues of Marsh and Guy Carpenter and separately presented within the segment, as shown in the revenue by segments charts presented earlier in this MD&A.The results of operations for the Risk and Insurance Services segment are presented below: (In millions of dollars, except percentages)2019 2018 2017Revenue$9,599 $8,228 $7,630Compensation and Benefits5,370 4,485 4,171Other Operating Expenses2,396 1,879 1,728Operating Expenses7,766 6,364 5,899Operating Income$1,833 $1,864 $1,731Operating Income Margin19.1% 22.7% 22.7%RevenueRevenue in the Risk and Insurance Services segment increased 17% in 2019 compared with 2018, reflecting the inclusion of JLT for the last three quarters of 2019. Revenue grew 4% on an underlying basis partly offset by a 2% decrease related to the impact of foreign currency translation.In Marsh, revenue increased 4% on an underlying basis, partly offset by a 2% decrease from the impact of foreign currency translation. U.S./Canada had underlying revenue growth of 5%. International operations increased 3% on an underlying basis, reflecting increases of 7% in Asia Pacific, 3% in Latin America and 1% in EMEA.Guy Carpenter’s revenue increased 15% to $1.5 billion in 2019 compared with 2018, or 5% on an underlying basis.Fiduciary interest income was $105 million in 2019 compared with $65 million in 2018 primarily due to the inclusion of JLT's results from April 1 to December 31, 2019.The Risk and Insurance Services segment completed five acquisitions during 2019, other than JLT. Information regarding those acquisitions is included in Note 5 to the consolidated financial statements.ExpenseExpense in the Risk and Insurance Services segment increased 22% in 2019 compared with 2018, reflecting the inclusion of JLT for the last three quarters of 2019. The underlying expense increases of 5% and 3% from acquisitions, were partly offset by a 3% decrease from the impact of foreign currency. The increase in underlying expense reflects the impact of acquisition, restructuring and integration related costs of $326 million, primarily due to severance, lease related exit costs and consulting fees related to the JLT Transaction as well as higher incentive compensation. ConsultingThe Company conducts business in its Consulting segment through two main business groups, Mercer and Oliver Wyman Group. Mercer provides consulting expertise, advice, services and solutions in the areas of health, wealth and career. Oliver Wyman Group provides specialized management, economic and brand consulting services.The major component of revenue in the Consulting business is fees paid by clients for advice and services. Mercer, principally through its health line of business, also earns revenue in the form of 39commissions received from insurance companies for the placement of group (and occasionally individual) insurance contracts, primarily life, health and accident coverages. Revenue for Mercer’s investment management business and certain of Mercer’s defined contribution administration services consists principally of fees based on assets under management or administration.Revenue in the Consulting segment is affected by, among other things, global economic conditions, including changes in clients’ particular industries and markets. Revenue is also affected by competition due to the introduction of new products and services, broad trends in employee demographics, including levels of employment, the effect of government policies and regulations, and fluctuations in interest and foreign exchange rates. Revenues from the provision of investment management services and retirement trust and administrative services are significantly affected by the level of assets under management or administration, which is impacted by securities market performance.For the investment management business, revenues from the majority of funds are included on a gross basis in accordance with U.S. GAAP and include reimbursable expenses incurred by professional staff and sub-advisory fees, and the related expenses are included in other operating expenses.The results of operations for the Consulting segment are presented below: (In millions of dollars, except percentages)2019 2018 2017Revenue$7,143 $6,779 $6,444Compensation and Benefits3,934 3,760 3,573Other Operating Expenses1,999 1,920 1,761Operating Expenses5,933 5,680 5,334Operating Income$1,210 $1,099 $1,110Operating Income Margin16.9% 16.2% 17.2%RevenueConsulting revenue in 2019 increased 5% compared with 2018, reflecting the inclusion of JLT for the last three quarters of 2019. Revenue increased 3% on an underlying basis, partly offset by a 2% decrease from the impact of foreign currency translation.Mercer's revenue in 2019 increased 2% on an underlying basis. Mercer's year-over-year revenue comparison also reflects a 2% decrease from the impact of foreign currency translation. The underlying revenue growth reflects increases in both Career and Health of 5%, while Wealth remained flat. Oliver Wyman Group’s revenue increased 4% in 2019 compared with 2018, or 6% on an underlying basis.ExpenseConsulting expense in 2019 increased 4% compared with 2018, reflecting the inclusion of JLT for the last three quarters of 2019. The underlying expense increases of 2% was offset by a 2% decrease from the impact of foreign currency translation. The increase in underlying expense reflects higher incentive compensation and restructuring-related costs. Consulting expense in 2019 included $56 million related to a business restructuring at Mercer. Corporate and OtherCorporate expense in 2019 was $366 million compared with $202 million in 2018. Expenses increased 54% on an underlying basis, primarily due to acquisition, integration and restructuring costs related to the JLT Transaction of $139 million recorded in 2019 as well as higher incentive compensation.Other Corporate ItemsInterestInterest income earned on corporate funds amounted to $39 million in 2019 compared with $11 million in 2018. Interest expense in 2019 was $524 million compared with $290 million in 2018. During the first quarter of 2019, the Company issued approximately $6.5 billion of senior notes related to the JLT acquisition. The funds were held in escrow and released for payment in April 2019, when the acquisition was completed. The increase in interest income from the prior year is primarily due to interest earned on 40these funds. The increase in interest expense was primarily due to new debt issuances related to the JLT acquisition.Investment IncomeThe caption ""Investment income"" in the consolidated statements of income comprises realized and unrealized gains and losses from investments. It includes, when applicable, other-than-temporary declines in the value of securities, mark-to-market increases/decreases in equity investments with readily determinable fair values and equity method gains or losses on its investments in private equity funds. The Company's investments may include direct investments in insurance, consulting or other strategically linked companies and investments in private equity funds.As discussed in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements, effective January 1, 2018, the Company prospectively adopted a new accounting standard that requires equity investments (except those accounted for under the equity method of accounting or those that result in consolidation of the investee) to be measured at fair value with changes in fair value recognized in net income. The Company holds certain equity investments that under legacy U.S. GAAP were previously treated as available for sale securities, whereby the mark-to-market change was recorded to other comprehensive income in its consolidated balance sheet. The Company recorded a cumulative-effect adjustment increase to retained earnings as of the beginning of the period of adoption of $14 million, reflecting the reclassification of cumulative unrealized gains, net of tax, as of December 31, 2017 from other comprehensive income to retained earnings. Prior periods have not been restated.The Company recorded net investment income of $22 million in 2019 which included $10 million related to mark-to-market changes to equity securities and $12 million of gains related to investments in private equity funds and other investments. The Company recorded a net investment loss of $12 million in 2018, that included an $83 million charge related to an other than temporary decline in the Company's equity method investment in Alexander Forbes (see Note 10 to the consolidated financial statements), partly offset by investment gains of $54 million related to mark-to-market changes in equity securities and $17 million related to investments in private equity funds and other investments. Income TaxesAs noted above, on April 1, 2019, the Company completed the JLT Transaction. The integration of this global organization required intercompany transfers of acquired entities into the Company's country structures and combination of those entities within the equivalent Company businesses. The integration transactions were designed to be tax efficient. The Company's global effective tax rate on JLT's earnings was reduced compared to JLT's pre-acquisition tax rate by utilizing debt for the restructuring transactions to be capital efficient, and reducing the generation of post-acquisition tax losses by merging historically unprofitable JLT entities with profitable Company operations. The provisions for deferred taxes and uncertain tax positions have been established as part of the purchase price allocation as of April 1, 2019.The broader JLT organization is now held under the Company, which makes it part of a U.S.-based multinational company and subjects it to full U.S. taxation.In 2017, the tax reform legislation known as the ""Tax Cuts and Jobs Act"" (the ""TCJA""), significantly changed the U.S. federal income tax regime. It provided for a reduction in the U.S. corporate tax rate to 21% and the creation of a quasi-territorial system to tax non-U.S. based operations, including adding a minimum tax on Global Intangible Low-Taxed Income (""GILTI""). The TCJA also changed the deductibility of certain expenses, primarily meals and entertainment, executive officers’ compensation and interest. As further discussed in Note 7 to the consolidated financial statements, in the fourth quarter of 2017, the Company recorded a provisional charge of $460 million related to the enactment of the TCJA, and this provisional charge was finalized in 2018. State treatment of certain TCJA provisions is still evolving.The Company's consolidated effective tax rate was 27.3%, 25.6%, and 42.9% in 2019, 2018, and 2017, respectively. The rates in 2019 and 2018 reflect ongoing impacts of the TCJA, primarily the reduced 21% U.S. statutory tax rate, and certain tax planning benefits, largely offset by higher U.S. tax costs under the quasi-territorial system, greater disallowance of compensation and entertainment deductions, a decrease in excess tax benefits related to share compensation primarily due to the lower U.S. tax rate, lower federal benefit for State taxes and treatment by States of certain TCJA provisions. The 2019 rate reflects items related to the JLT acquisition, including non-deductible goodwill allocated to the sale of Aerospace 41and non-deductible expenses incurred in relation to the JLT acquisition. The 2018 rate includes the effect of a charge related to the Company’s investment in Alexander Forbes as discussed in Note 10. The tax rates in all periods reflect the impact of discrete tax matters, tax legislation, and nontaxable adjustments to contingent acquisition consideration.The effective tax rate may vary significantly from period to period for the foreseeable future. The effective tax rate is sensitive to the geographic mix and repatriation of the Company's earnings, which may result in higher or lower tax rates. Thus, a shift in the mix of profits among jurisdictions can affect the effective tax rate. In 2019, pre-tax income in Barbados, Canada, Australia, Ireland, Germany, the U.K. and Bermuda accounted for approximately 60% of the Company's total non-U.S. pre-tax income, with effective rates in those countries of 1%, 28%, 32%, 14%, 29%, 105% and 1% respectively.In addition, losses in certain jurisdictions cannot be offset by earnings from other operations, and may require valuation allowances that affect the rate, depending on estimates of the value of associated deferred tax assets which can be realized. A valuation allowance was recorded to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount that the Company believes is more likely than not to be realized. The details are provided in Note 7 of the consolidated financial statements. The effective tax rate is also sensitive to changes in unrecognized tax benefits, including the impact of settled tax audits and expired statutes of limitation. Changes in tax laws, rulings, policies or related legal and regulatory interpretations occur frequently and may also have significant favorable or adverse impacts on our effective tax rate. As a U.S. domiciled parent holding company, the Company is the issuer of essentially all of the Company's external indebtedness, and incurs the related interest expense in the U.S. The Company’s interest expense deductions are not currently limited. Further, most senior executive and oversight functions are conducted in the U.S. and the associated costs are incurred primarily in the United States. Some of these expenses may not be deductible in the U.S., which may impact the effective tax rate.The quasi-territorial tax regime provides an opportunity for the Company to repatriate foreign earnings more tax efficiently and there is less incentive for permanent reinvestment of these earnings. However, permanent reinvestment continues to be a component of the Company’s global capital strategy. The Company revised its permanent reinvestment assertion related to accumulated earnings that were subject to the 2017 transition tax of the TCJA, to facilitate repatriation of most of those accumulated earnings. For post-2017 years, including 2019, the Company continues to evaluate its global investment and repatriation strategy in light of our capital requirements, considering the TCJA and the quasi-territorial tax regime for future foreign earnings.Liquidity and Capital ResourcesThe Company is organized as a legal entity separate and distinct from its operating subsidiaries. As the Company does not have significant operations of its own, the Company is dependent upon dividends and other payments from its operating subsidiaries to pay principal and interest on its outstanding debt obligations, pay dividends to stockholders, repurchase its shares and pay corporate expenses. The Company can also provide financial support to its operating subsidiaries for acquisitions, investments and certain parts of their business that require liquidity, such as the capital markets business of Guy Carpenter. Other sources of liquidity include borrowing facilities discussed below in financing cash flows.The Company derives a significant portion of its revenue and operating profit from operating subsidiaries located outside of the United States. Funds from those operating subsidiaries are regularly repatriated to the United States out of annual earnings. At December 31, 2019, the Company had approximately $1.0 billion of cash and cash equivalents in its foreign operations, which includes $178 million of operating funds required to be maintained for regulatory requirements or as collateral under certain captive insurance arrangements. The Company expects to continue its practice of repatriating available funds from its non-U.S. operating subsidiaries out of current annual earnings. Where appropriate, a portion of the current year earnings will continue to be permanently reinvested. With respect to repatriating 2018 and prior earnings, the Company has evaluated such factors as its short- and long-term capital needs, acquisition and borrowing strategies, and the availability of cash for repatriation for each of its subsidiaries. The Company has determined that, in general, its permanent reinvestment assertions, in light of the enactment of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, should allow the Company to repatriate previously taxed earnings from the deemed repatriations as cash becomes available.42During 2019, the Company recorded foreign currency translation adjustments which increased net equity by $151 million. Continued weakening of the U.S. dollar against foreign currencies would further increase the translated U.S. dollar value of the Company’s net investments in its non-U.S. subsidiaries, as well as the translated U.S. dollar value of cash repatriations from those subsidiaries.Cash on our consolidated balance sheets includes funds available for general corporate purposes. Funds held on behalf of clients in a fiduciary capacity are segregated and shown separately in the consolidated balance sheets as an offset to fiduciary liabilities. Fiduciary funds cannot be used for general corporate purposes, and should not be considered as a source of liquidity for the Company.Operating Cash FlowsThe Company generated $2.4 billion of cash from operations in both 2019 and 2018. These amounts reflect the net income of the Company during those periods, excluding gains or losses from investments, adjusted for non-cash charges and changes in working capital which relate primarily to the timing of payments of accrued liabilities or receipts of assets and pension contributions.Pension-Related ItemsContributionsDuring 2019, the Company contributed $35 million to its U.S. pension plans and $87 million to non-U.S. pension plans compared to contributions of $30 million to U.S. plans and $82 million to non-U.S. plans in 2018.In the United States, contributions to the tax-qualified defined benefit plans are based on ERISA guidelines and the Company generally expects to maintain a funded status of 80% or more of the liability determined under the ERISA guidelines. In 2019, the Company made $31 million of contributions to its non-qualified plans and $4 million to plans acquired in the JLT acquisition. The Company expects to contribute approximately $76 million to its U.S. pension plans in 2020, including $47 million to the US qualified plans to meet ERISA funding requirements and $29 million for its non-qualified plans.The Company contributed $27 million to the U.K. plans in 2019, including an expense allowance of approximately $10 million. The Company's contributions to the U.K. plans in 2020 are expected to be approximately $39 million, including an expense allowance of $10 million.Outside the United States, the Company has a large number of non-U.S. defined benefit pension plans, the largest of which are in the U.K., which comprise approximately 81% of non-U.S. plan assets at December 31, 2019. Contribution rates for non-U.S. plans are generally based on local funding practices and statutory requirements, which may differ significantly from measurements under U.S. GAAP. In the U.K., the assumptions used to determine pension contributions are the result of legally-prescribed negotiations between the Company and the plans' trustee that typically occur every three years in conjunction with the actuarial valuation of the plans. Currently, this results in a lower funded status than under U.S. GAAP and may result in contributions irrespective of the U.S. GAAP funded status. For the MMC U.K. Pension Fund, a new agreement was reached with the trustee in the fourth quarter of 2019 based on the surplus funding position at December 31, 2018. Under the agreement no deficit funding is required until 2023. The funding level will be re-assessed during 2022 to determine if contributions are required in 2023. As part of a long-term strategy, which depends on having greater influence over asset allocation and overall investment decisions, in November 2019 the Company renewed its agreement to support annual deficit contributions by the U.K. operating companies under certain circumstances, up to GBP 450 million over a seven-year period. In addition, in the U.K. the Company assumed responsibility for JLT's Pension Scheme (""JLT U.K. plan""). Deficit funding of approximately $28 million is expected during 2020 with a new funding agreement expected to be reached with the Trustee during 2020.In the aggregate, the Company expects to contribute approximately $84 million to its non-U.S. defined benefit plans in 2020, comprising approximately $45 million to plans outside of the U.K. and $39 million to the U.K. plans.Changes to Pension PlansAs part of the JLT Transaction, the Company assumed responsibility for a number of pension plans throughout the world, with $255 million of net pension liabilities as of December 31, 2019 ($1,003 million in liabilities and $748 million of plan assets as of December 31, 2019). The JLT U.K. plan has a defined 43benefit section which was frozen to future accruals in 2006 and a defined contribution section. The assets of the JLT U.K. plan are held in a trustee administered fund separate from the Company.Changes in Funded Status and ExpenseThe year-over-year change in the funded status of the Company's pension plans is impacted by the difference between actual and assumed results, particularly with regard to return on assets, and changes in the discount rate, as well as the amount of Company contributions, if any. Unrecognized actuarial losses were approximately $2.1 billion and $3.1 billion at December 31, 2019 for the U.S. plans and non-U.S. plans, respectively, compared with losses of $1.9 billion and $2.6 billion at December 31, 2018. The increases in both the U.S. and non-U.S. plans was primarily due to a decrease in the discount rate used to measure plan liabilities partly offset by an increase in asset values. In the past several years, the amount of unamortized losses has been significantly impacted, both positively and negatively, by actual asset performance and changes in discount rates. The discount rate used to measure plan liabilities in 2019 decreased in the U.S. and U.K. (the Company's largest plans) following increases in the U.S. and the U.K. in 2018. The discount rate used to measure plan liabilities decreased in 2017. An increase in the discount rate decreases the measured plan benefit obligation, resulting in actuarial gains, while a decrease in the discount rate increases the measured plan obligation, resulting in actuarial losses. During 2019, the Company's defined benefit pension plan assets had gains of 21.4% and 13.1% in the U.S. and U.K., respectively as compared to losses of 7.4% and 1.0% in the U.S. and U.K., respectively in 2018. During 2017, the Company's defined benefit pension plan assets had actual returns of 19.3% in the U.S. and 9.1% in the U.K.Overall, based on the measurement at December 31, 2019, total benefit credits related to the Company’s defined benefit plans are expected to decrease in 2020 by approximately $5 million compared to 2019, reflecting a decrease in non-U.S. plans of approximately $8 million, offset by an increase in U.S. plans of $3 million. The Company’s accounting policies for its defined benefit pension plans, including the selection of and sensitivity to assumptions, are discussed below under Management’s Discussion of Critical Accounting Policies. For additional information regarding the Company’s retirement plans, see Note 8 to the consolidated financial statements.Financing Cash FlowsNet cash provided by financing activities was $3.3 billion in 2019 compared with $1.3 billion used in 2018.DebtThe Company increased outstanding debt by approximately $6.1 billion in 2019, discussed in more detail below. Outstanding debt increased $340 million in 2018.In January 2019, the Company issued $5 billion aggregate amount of Senior Notes consisting of $700 million of 3.50% Senior Notes due 2020, $1 billion of 3.875% Senior Notes due 2024, $1.25 billion of 4.375% Senior Notes due 2029, $500 million of 4.75% Senior Notes due 2039, $1.25 billion of 4.90% Senior Notes due 2049 and $300 million of Floating Rate Senior Notes due 2021.In March 2019, the Company issued €550 million of 1.349% Senior Notes due 2026 and €550 million of 1.979% Senior Notes due 2030. In addition, the Company issued an additional $250 million of 4.375% Senior Notes due 2029, in March 2019. These notes constitute a further issuance of the 4.375% Senior Notes due 2029, of which $1.25 billion aggregate principal amount was issued in January 2019 (see above). After giving effect to the issuance of the notes, the Company has $1.5 billion aggregate principal amount of 4.375% Senior Notes due 2029. The Company used part of the net proceeds from these offerings, along with the $5 billion of Senior Notes issued in January 2019 (discussed above) to primarily fund the acquisition of JLT, including the payment of related fees and expenses, and to repay certain JLT indebtedness, as well as for general corporate purposes.In connection with the closing of the JLT Transaction, the Company assumed approximately $1 billion of historical JLT indebtedness. In April and June of 2019, the Company repaid approximately $450 million and $553 million, respectively, which represented all of the JLT debt acquired upon the acquisition of JLT. The Company incurred debt extinguishment costs of $32 million in regard to the repayment of this debt.In September 2019, the Company repaid $300 million of maturing senior notes.44The Company has established a short-term debt financing program of up to $1.5 billion through the issuance of commercial paper. The proceeds from the issuance of commercial paper are used for general corporate purposes. The Company had no commercial paper outstanding at December 31, 2019.In October 2018, the Company repaid $250 million of maturing senior notes.In March 2018, the Company issued $600 million of 4.20% senior notes due 2048. The Company used the net proceeds for general corporate purposes.Credit FacilitiesIn January 2020, the Company closed on $500 million one-year and $500 million two-year term loan facilities. The interest rate on these facilities is based on LIBOR plus a fixed margin which varies with the Company's credit ratings. The facilities require the Company to maintain coverage ratios and leverage ratios consistent with the revolving credit facility discussed below. The Company has no current borrowings outstanding under these facilities.In March 2019, the Company closed on $300 million one-year and $300 million three-year term loan facilities. The interest rate on these facilities was based on LIBOR plus a fixed margin which varies with the Company's credit ratings. In August 2019, the Company terminated the $300 million three-year term loan facility. The Company had $300 million of borrowings outstanding under the one-year term facility at September 30, 2019 which was terminated and repaid in December 2019. In September 2018, the Company entered into a bridge loan agreement to finance the proposed JLT transaction. The Company paid approximately $35 million of customary upfront fees related to the bridge loan at the inception of the loan commitment. The bridge loan agreement was terminated on April 1, 2019. In October 2018, the Company and certain of its foreign subsidiaries increased its multi-currency five-year unsecured revolving credit facility from $1.5 billion to $1.8 billion. The interest rate on this facility is based on LIBOR plus a fixed margin which varies with the Company's credit ratings. This facility expires in October 2023 and requires the Company to maintain certain coverage and leverage ratios which are tested quarterly. There were no borrowings outstanding under this facility at December 31, 2019.The Company also maintains other credit facilities, guarantees and letters of credit with various banks, aggregating $598 million at December 31, 2019 and $594 million at December 31, 2018. There were no outstanding borrowings under these facilities at December 31, 2019 or December 31, 2018.The Company's potential exposure to the discontinuance of LIBOR is discussed in Note 13 to the consolidated financial statements.The Company's senior debt is currently rated A- by Standard & Poor's and Baa1 by Moody's. The Company's short-term debt is currently rated A-2 by Standard & Poor's and P-2 by Moody's. The Company carries a Negative outlook from both firms.Share RepurchasesDuring 2019, the Company repurchased 4.8 million shares of its common stock for total consideration of $485 million at an average price per share of $100.48. In November 2019, the Board of Directors authorized an increase in the Company’s share repurchase program, which supersedes any prior authorization, allowing management to buy back up to $2.5 billion of the Company’s common stock. As of December 31, 2019, the Company remained authorized to purchase additional shares of its common stock up to a value of approximately $2.4 billion. There is no time limit on this authorization.During 2018, the Company repurchased 8.2 million shares of its common stock for total consideration of $675 million at an average price per share of $82.61.DividendsThe Company paid total dividends of $890 million in 2019 ($1.74 per share), $807 million in 2018 ($1.58 per share) and $740 million in 2017 ($1.43 per share).Contingent Payments Related To AcquisitionsDuring 2019, the Company paid $63 million of contingent payments related to acquisitions made in prior years. These payments are split between financing and operating cash flows in the consolidated statements of cash flows. Payments of $22 million related to the contingent consideration liability that was 45recorded on the date of acquisition are reflected as financing cash flows. Payments related to increases in the contingent consideration liability subsequent to the date of acquisition of $41 million are reflected as operating cash flows. Remaining estimated future contingent consideration payments of $223 million for acquisitions completed in 2019 and in prior years are included in accounts payable and accrued liabilities or other liabilities in the consolidated balance sheet at December 31, 2019. The Company paid deferred purchase consideration related to prior years' acquisitions of $43 million and $62 million for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively. Remaining deferred cash payments of approximately $193 million are included in accounts payable and accrued liabilities or other liabilities in the consolidated balance sheet at December 31, 2019.In 2018, the Company paid $91 million of contingent payments related to acquisitions made in prior periods, of which $55 million was reported as financing cash flows and $36 million as operating cash flows.DerivativesJLT Fair Value Debt Derivative contractsPrior to the JLT Transaction closing, a significant portion of JLT's outstanding senior notes were denominated in U.S. dollars. In order to hedge its exposure against the risk of fluctuations between the GBP and the U.S. dollar, JLT entered into foreign exchange and interest rate swaps, which were designated as fair value hedges. In June 2019, the Company redeemed these U.S. dollar denominated senior notes and settled the related derivative contracts. Both the change in fair value of the debt and the change in fair value of the derivative contracts were recorded in the consolidated statement of income in the second quarter of 2019. The Company received approximately $112 million upon settlement of these derivative contracts.JLT Cash Flow HedgesJLT also had a number of foreign exchange contracts to hedge the risk of foreign exchange movements between the U.S. dollar and GBP, related to JLT’s U.S. dollar denominated revenue in the U.K. Prior to the acquisition, these derivative contracts were designated as cash flow hedges. Upon acquisition, the derivative contracts were not re-designated as cash flow hedges by the Company. The contracts were settled in June 2019. The change in fair value between the acquisition date and the settlement date resulted in a charge of $26 million in the second quarter of 2019. The charge is recorded as a change in fair value of acquisition related derivative contracts in the consolidated statement of income.Foreign Exchange Forward ContractIn connection with the JLT Transaction, to hedge the risk of appreciation of the GBP-denominated purchase price relative to the U.S. dollar, on September 20, 2018, the Company entered into the FX Contract to, solely upon consummation of the Transaction, purchase £5.2 billion and sell a corresponding amount of U.S. dollars at a contracted exchange rate. The FX Contract, which did not qualify for hedge accounting treatment under applicable accounting guidance, is discussed in Note 11 to the consolidated financial statements. The Company settled the FX Contract on April 1, 2019, recording a realized gain to the consolidated statement of income of approximately $31 million in 2019. The cash outflow related to the settlement of the FX Contract was approximately $294 million in 2019.Foreign Exchange Contract on Euro Debt IssuanceIn March 2019, the Company issued €1.1 billion of senior notes related to the JLT Transaction. See Note 14 for additional information related to the Euro senior note issuances. In connection with the senior note issuances of €1.1 billion, the Company entered into a forward exchange contract to hedge the economic risk of changes in foreign exchange rates from the issuance date to settlement date of the Euro senior notes. This forward exchange contract was settled in March 2019 and the Company recorded a charge of $7 million in the first quarter of 2019 related to the settlement of this contract.Treasury Locks on Senior NotesIn connection with the JLT Transaction, to hedge the risk of increases in future interest rates prior to its issuance of senior notes, in the fourth quarter of 2018, the Company entered into treasury locks related to $2 billion of the expected debt. The fair value at December 31, 2018 was based on the published treasury rate plus forward premium as of December 31, 2018 compared to the all in rate at the inception of the 46contract. The contracts were not designated as an accounting hedge. The Company recorded an unrealized loss of $116 million related to the change in the fair value of these derivatives in the consolidated statement of income for the twelve month period ended December 31, 2018. In January 2019, upon issuance of the $5 billion of senior notes, the Company settled the treasury lock derivatives and made a payment to its counter party for $122 million. An additional charge of $6 million was recorded in the first quarter of 2019 related to the settlement of the Treasury lock derivatives.Net Investment HedgeThe Company has investments in various subsidiaries with Euro functional currencies. As a result, the Company is exposed to the risk of fluctuations between the Euro and U.S. dollar exchange rates. As part of its risk management program to fund the JLT acquisition, the Company issued €1.1 billion senior notes, as discussed above, and designated the debt instruments as a net investment hedge of its Euro denominated subsidiaries. The hedge is re-assessed each quarter to confirm that the designated equity balance at the beginning of each period continues to equal or exceed 80% of the outstanding balance of the Euro debt instrument and that all the critical terms of the hedging instrument and the hedged net investment continue to match. If the Company concludes that the hedge is highly effective, the change in the debt balance related to foreign exchange fluctuations will be recorded in foreign currency translation gains (losses) in the consolidated balance sheet. The U.S. dollar value of the Euro notes decreased by $28 million during 2019 related to the change in foreign exchange rates. Since the Company concluded that the hedge was highly effective, it recorded an increase to foreign currency translation gains (losses) for the twelve months ended December 31, 2019.Investing Cash FlowsNet cash used for investing activities amounted to $5.7 billion in 2019 compared with $1.1 billion used for investing activities in 2018.The Company paid $5,505 million and $884 million, net of cash acquired, for acquisitions it made during 2019 and 2018, respectively.In January 2019, the Company increased its equity ownership in Marsh India from 26% to 49% for approximately $88 million. Marsh India is carried under the equity method.The Company’s additions to fixed assets and capitalized software, which amounted to $421 million in 2019 and $314 million in 2018, primarily relate to computer equipment purchases, the refurbishing and modernizing of office facilities and software development costs.The Company has commitments for potential future investments of approximately $60 million in four private equity funds that invest primarily in financial services companies.Commitments and ObligationsThe following sets forth the Company’s future contractual obligations by the types identified in the table below as of December 31, 2019: Payment due by PeriodContractual Obligations(In millions of dollars)Total Within1 Year 1-3Years 4-5Years After 5YearsCurrent portion of long-term debt$1,217 $1,217 $— $— $—Long-term debt10,808 — 1,334 2,234 7,240Interest on long-term debt5,556 456 807 689 3,604Net operating leases2,610 413 694 529 974Service agreements349 184 89 61 15Other long-term obligations448 195 243 5 5Total$20,988 $2,465 $3,167 $3,518 $11,838The above does not include the liability for unrecognized tax benefits of $86 million as the Company is unable to reasonably predict the timing of settlement of these liabilities, other than approximately $2 million that may become payable during 2020. The above does not include the remaining transitional tax payments related to the TCJA of $69 million. 47Management’s Discussion of Critical Accounting PoliciesThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (""GAAP"") requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue and expenses, and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. Management considers the policies discussed below to be critical to understanding the Company’s financial statements because their application places the most significant demands on management’s judgment, and requires management to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain. Actual results may differ from those estimates.Purchase Price AllocationAssets acquired and liabilities assumed as part of a business acquisition are generally recorded at their fair value at the date of acquisition. The excess of purchase price over the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed is recorded as goodwill. The JLT Transaction has increased the significance of judgments and estimates management must make to complete the purchase price allocation. Determining fair value of identifiable assets, particularly intangibles, and liabilities acquired also requires management to make estimates, which are based on all available information and in some cases assumptions with respect to the timing and amount of future revenues and expenses associated with an asset. These estimates directly impact the amount of identified intangible assets recognized and the related amortization expense in future periods.Revenue RecognitionThe adoption of the new revenue standard on January 1, 2018 has increased the significance of judgments and estimates management must make to apply the guidance. In particular, in the Risk and Insurance Services segment, judgments related to the amount of variable revenue consideration to ultimately be received on placement of quota share reinsurance treaties and contingent commission from insurers, which was previously recognized when the contingency was resolved, now requires significant judgments and estimates.Under the new standard, certain costs to obtain or fulfill a contract that were previously expensed as incurred have been capitalized. The Company capitalizes the incremental costs to obtain contracts primarily related to commissions or sales bonus payments. These deferred costs are amortized over the expected life of the underlying customer relationships. The Company also capitalizes certain pre-placement costs that are considered fulfillment costs that are amortized at a point in time when the associated revenue is recognized.Management also makes significant judgments and estimates to measure the progress toward completing performance obligations and realization rates for consideration related to contracts as well as potential performance-based fees in the Consulting segment.See Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information.Legal and Other Loss ContingenciesThe Company and its subsidiaries are subject to numerous claims, lawsuits and proceedings including claims for errors and omissions (""E&O""). GAAP requires that a liability be recorded when a loss is both probable and reasonably estimable. Significant management judgment is required to apply this guidance. The Company utilizes case level reviews by inside and outside counsel, an internal actuarial analysis by Oliver Wyman Group, a subsidiary of the Company, and other methods to estimate potential losses. The liability is reviewed quarterly and adjusted as developments warrant. In many cases, the Company has not recorded a liability, other than for legal fees to defend the claim, because we are unable, at the present time, to make a determination that a loss is both probable and reasonably estimable. Given the unpredictability of E&O claims and of litigation that could flow from them, it is possible that an adverse outcome in a particular matter could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s businesses, results of operations, financial condition or cash flow in a given quarterly or annual period.In addition, to the extent that insurance coverage is available, significant management judgment is required to determine the amount of recoveries that are probable of collection under the Company’s various insurance programs.48Retirement BenefitsThe Company maintains qualified and non-qualified defined benefit pension and defined contribution plans for its eligible U.S. employees and a variety of defined benefit and defined contribution plans for its eligible non-U.S. employees. The Company’s policy for funding its tax-qualified defined benefit retirement plans is to contribute amounts at least sufficient to meet the funding requirements set forth in U.S. and applicable foreign laws.The Company recognizes the funded status of its over-funded defined benefit pension and retiree medical plans as a net benefit plan asset and its unfunded and underfunded plans as a net benefit plan liability. The gains or losses and prior service costs or credits that have not been recognized as components of net periodic costs are recorded as a component of Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income (""AOCI""), net of tax, in the Company’s consolidated balance sheets. The gains and losses that exceed specified corridors are amortized prospectively out of AOCI over a period that approximates the remaining life expectancy of participants in plans where substantially all participants are inactive or the average remaining service period of active participants for plans with active participants. The vast majority of unrecognized losses relate to inactive plans and are amortized over the remaining life expectancy of the participants.The determination of net periodic pension cost is based on a number of assumptions, including an expected long-term rate of return on plan assets, the discount rate, mortality and assumed rate of salary increase. The assumptions used in the calculation of net periodic pension costs and pension liabilities are disclosed in Note 8 to the consolidated financial statements. The assumptions for expected rate of return on plan assets and the discount rate are discussed in more detail below.The long-term rate of return on plan assets assumption is determined for each plan based on the facts and circumstances that exist as of the measurement date, and the specific portfolio mix of each plan’s assets. The Company utilizes a model developed by Mercer, a subsidiary of the Company, to assist in the determination of this assumption. The model takes into account several factors, including: actual and target portfolio allocation; investment, administrative and trading expenses incurred directly by the plan trust; historical portfolio performance; relevant forward-looking economic analysis; and expected returns, variances and correlations for different asset classes. These measures are used to determine probabilities using standard statistical techniques to calculate a range of expected returns on the portfolio.The target asset allocation for the U.S. plans is 64% equities and equity alternatives and 36% fixed income. At the end of 2019, the actual allocation for the U.S. plans was 64% equities and equity alternatives and 36% fixed income. The target asset allocation for the U.K. plans, which comprise approximately 81% of non-U.S. plan assets, is 34% equities and equity alternatives and 66% fixed income. At the end of 2019, the actual allocation for the U.K. plans was 35% equities and equity alternatives and 65% fixed income. The discount rate selected for each U.S. plan is based on a model bond portfolio with coupons and redemptions that closely match the expected liability cash flows from the plan. Discount rates for non-U.S. plans are based on appropriate bond indices adjusted for duration; in the U.K., the plan duration is reflected using the Mercer yield curve.The table below shows the weighted average assumed rate of return and the discount rate at the December 31, 2019 measurement date (for measuring pension expense in 2020) for the total Company, the U.S. and the Rest of World (""ROW""). Total Company U.S. ROWAssumed Rate of Return on Plan Assets5.31% 7.82% 4.35%Discount Rate2.57% 3.44% 2.09%49Holding all other assumptions constant, a half-percentage point change in the rate of return on plan assets and discount rate assumptions would affect net periodic pension cost for the U.S. and U.K. plans, which together comprise approximately 85% of total pension plan liabilities, as follows: 0.5 PercentagePoint Increase 0.5 PercentagePoint Decrease(In millions of dollars)U.S. U.K. U.S. U.K.Assumed Rate of Return on Plan Assets$(22) $(47) $22 $47Discount Rate$1 $2 $(2) $(3)The impact of discount rate changes shown above relates to the increase or decrease in actuarial gains or losses being amortized through net periodic pension cost, as well as the increase or decrease in interest expense, with all other facts and assumptions held constant. It does not contemplate nor include potential future impacts a change in the interest rate environment and discount rates might cause, such as the impact on the market value of the plans’ assets. In addition, the assumed return on plan assets would likely be impacted by changes in the interest rate environment and other factors, including equity valuations, since these factors reflect the starting point used in the Company’s projection models. For example, a reduction in interest rates may result in a reduction in the assumed return on plan assets. Changing the discount rate and leaving the other assumptions constant also may not be representative of the impact on expense, because the long-term rates of inflation and salary increases are often correlated with the discount rate. Changes in these assumptions will not necessarily have a linear impact on the net periodic pension cost.The Company contributes to certain health care and life insurance benefits provided to its retired employees. The cost of these post-retirement benefits for employees in the U.S. is accrued during the period up to the date employees are eligible to retire, but is funded by the Company as incurred. The key assumptions and sensitivity to changes in the assumed health care cost trend rate are discussed in Note 8 to the consolidated financial statements.Income TaxesSignificant judgment is required in determining the annual effective tax rate and in evaluating uncertain tax positions. The Company reports a liability for unrecognized tax benefits resulting from uncertain tax positions taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. The evaluation of a tax position is a two-step process:•First, the Company determines whether it is more likely than not that a tax position will be sustained upon tax examination, including resolution of any related appeals or litigation, based on only the technical merits of the position. If a tax position does not meet the more-likely-than-not recognition threshold, the benefit of that position is not recognized in the financial statements. •The second step is measurement. A tax position that meets the more-likely-than-not recognition threshold is measured to determine the amount of benefit to recognize in the financial statements. The tax position is measured as the largest amount of benefit that is greater than 50-percent likely of being realized upon ultimate resolution with a taxing authority. Uncertain tax positions are evaluated based upon the facts and circumstances that exist at each reporting period and involve significant management judgment. Subsequent changes in judgment based upon new information may lead to changes in recognition, de-recognition, and measurement. Adjustments may result, for example, upon resolution of an issue with the taxing authorities, or expiration of a statute of limitations barring an assessment for an issue. The Company recognizes interest and penalties, if any, related to unrecognized tax benefits in income tax expense.Certain items are included in the Company's tax returns at different times than the items are reflected in the financial statements. As a result, the annual tax expense reflected in the consolidated statements of income is different than that reported in the tax returns. Some of these differences are permanent, such as non-deductible expenses, and some differences are temporary and reverse over time, such as depreciation expense. Temporary differences create deferred tax assets and liabilities, which are measured at existing tax rates. Deferred tax liabilities generally represent tax expense recognized in the 50financial statements for which payment has been deferred, or expense for which a deduction has been taken already in the tax return but the expense has not yet been recognized in the financial statements. Deferred tax assets generally represent items that can be used as a tax deduction or credit in tax returns in future years for which a benefit has already been recorded in the financial statements. The Company evaluates all significant available positive and negative evidence, including the existence of losses in recent years and its forecast of future taxable income by jurisdiction, in assessing the need for a valuation allowance. The Company also considers tax planning strategies that would result in realization of deferred tax assets, and the presence of taxable income in prior period tax filings in jurisdictions that allow for the carryback of tax attributes pursuant to the applicable tax law. The underlying assumptions the Company uses in forecasting future taxable income require significant judgment and take into account the Company's recent performance. The ultimate realization of deferred tax assets is dependent on the generation of future taxable income during the periods in which temporary differences or carry-forwards are deductible or creditable. Valuation allowances are established for deferred tax assets when it is estimated that it is more likely than not that future taxable income will be insufficient to fully use a deduction or credit in that jurisdiction.Fair Value DeterminationsGoodwill Impairment Testing – The Company is required to assess goodwill and any indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment annually, or more frequently if circumstances indicate impairment may have occurred. The Company performs the annual impairment assessment for each of its reporting units during the third quarter of each year. In accordance with applicable accounting guidance, a company can assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is necessary to perform a goodwill impairment test. Alternatively, the company may elect to proceed directly to the quantitative goodwill impairment test. In 2019, the Company elected to perform a quantitative impairment assessment. Fair values of the reporting units were estimated using a market approach. Carrying values for the reporting units are based on balances at the prior quarter end and include directly identified assets and liabilities as well as an allocation of those assets and liabilities not recorded at the reporting unit level. The Company completed its 2019 annual review in the third quarter and concluded goodwill was not impaired, as the fair value of each reporting unit exceeded its carrying value by a substantial margin.Share-Based PaymentThe guidance for accounting for share-based payments requires, among other things, that the estimated grant date fair value of stock options be charged to earnings. Significant management judgment is required to determine the appropriate assumptions for inputs such as volatility and expected term necessary to estimate option values. In addition, management judgment is required to analyze the terms of the plans and awards granted thereunder to determine if awards will be treated as equity awards or liability awards, as defined by the accounting guidance.As of December 31, 2019, there was $19 million of unrecognized compensation cost related to stock option awards. The weighted-average period over which the costs are expected to be recognized is 1.25 years. Also as of December 31, 2019, there was $357 million of unrecognized compensation cost related to the Company’s restricted stock, restricted stock unit and performance stock unit awards. The weighted-average period over which that cost is expected to be recognized is approximately 1.11 years.See Note 9 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding accounting for share-based payments.Investments and DerivativesAlthough not directly recorded in the Company’s consolidated balance sheets, the Company's defined benefit pension plans hold investments of approximately $17 billion, which include private equity and other non-liquid investments. The fair value of the plan investments determines, in part, the over-or under-funded status of those plans, which is included in the Company’s consolidated balance sheets. The Company also has minority positions in certain equity securities (primarily Alexander Forbes) as well as approximately $107 million of investments in private equity funds accounted for using the equity method of accounting.The Company reviews the carrying value of its investments (both direct and held through its pension plans) to determine if any valuation adjustments are appropriate under the applicable accounting 51pronouncements. The Company bases its review on the facts and circumstances as they relate to each investment. In those instances where quoted market prices are not available, particularly for private equity funds, significant management judgment is required to determine the appropriate value of the Company’s investments. Fair value of investments in private equity funds is determined by the funds’ investment managers. Factors considered in determining the fair value of private equity investments include: implied valuation of recently completed financing rounds that included sophisticated outside investors; performance multiples of comparable public companies; restrictions on the sale or disposal of the investments; trading characteristics of the securities; and the relative size of the holdings in comparison to other private investors and the public market float. In connection with the JLT Transaction, the Company entered into several derivative contracts, described in Note 11 to the consolidated financial statements. These derivative contracts are recorded at fair value at the end of each period, with the change in fair value recorded in the consolidated statements of income. Prior to the settlement, determination of the fair value of these contracts, in particular the deal contingent foreign exchange contract, required significant management judgments or estimates about the potential closing dates of the transaction and remaining value of the deal contingency feature. All derivative contracts related to the JLT Transaction were settled during 2019.New Accounting PronouncementsNote 1 to the consolidated financial statements contains a summary of the Company’s significant accounting policies, including a discussion of recently issued accounting pronouncements and their impact or potential future impact on the Company’s financial results, if determinable, under the sub-heading ""New Accounting Pronouncements"".Reconciliation of Non-GAAP MeasuresOn April 1, 2019, the Company completed its previously announced acquisition of JLT. JLT's results of operations for the three months ended December 31, 2019 are included in the Company’s results of operations for the fourth quarter of 2019. JLT's results of operations from April 1, 2019 are included in the Company's results of operations for the twelve month-period ended December 31, 2019. Prior periods in 2018 do not include JLT’s results. Prior to being acquired by the Company, JLT operated in three segments, Specialty, Reinsurance and Employee Benefits. As of April 1, 2019, the historical JLT businesses were combined into MMC operations as follows: JLT Specialty is included by geography within Marsh, JLT Reinsurance is included within Guy Carpenter and the majority of the JLT Employee Benefits business is included in Mercer Health and Wealth.The JLT Transaction had a significant impact on the Company’s results of operations in 2019. The Company believes that in addition to the change in reported GAAP revenue, a comparison of 2019 GAAP reported revenue to the combined 2018 revenue of MMC and JLT, as if the companies were combined on April 1, 2018, provides investors with meaningful information as to the Company’s year-over-year underlying operating results. Investors should not consider the comparison of these non-GAAP measures in isolation from, or as a substitute for, the financial information that the Company reports in accordance with GAAP.The 2018 Including JLT revenue information set forth in the table below presents revenue information as if the companies were combined on April 1, 2018 and is not necessarily indicative of what the results would have been had we operated the business since April 1, 2018. The MMC revenue amounts are as previously reported by the Company in its quarterly filings on Form 10-Q for the applicable periods. The unaudited 2018 JLT revenue amounts reflect historical JLT revenue information following IFRS, adjusted to conform with U.S. GAAP and MMC’s specific accounting policies, primarily related to the development of constraints and subsequent release of those constraints related to the reinsurance business. The revenue includes JLT’s aerospace business. Additional information can be found in the supplemental information furnished to the SEC on June 6, 2019 on Form 8-K, which is not incorporated by reference in this Form 10-K.52(In millions)Three Months Ended December 31, 2018 Twelve Months Ended December 31, 2018MMC As Previously Reported Risk & Insurance Services Marsh$1,804 $6,877Guy Carpenter102 1,286Subtotal1,906 8,163Fiduciary Interest Income19 65Total Risk & Insurance Services1,925 8,228Consulting Mercer1,228 4,732Oliver Wyman Group577 2,047Total Consulting1,805 6,779Corporate Eliminations(18) (57)Total Revenue$3,712 $14,950JLT 2018 Specialty (Marsh)$407 $1,018Reinsurance (Guy Carpenter)48 156Employee Benefits (Mercer)96 269Subtotal551 1,443Fiduciary Interest Income5 13Total Revenue$556 $1,4562018 Including JLT Marsh$2,211 $7,895Guy Carpenter150 1,442Subtotal2,361 9,337Fiduciary Interest Income24 78Total Risk & Insurance Services2,385 9,415Consulting Mercer1,324 5,001Oliver Wyman Group577 2,047Total Consulting1,901 7,048Corporate Eliminations(18) (57)Total Revenue Including JLT$4,268 $16,406 53Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market RiskMarket Risk and Credit RiskCertain of the Company’s revenues, expenses, assets and liabilities are exposed to the impact of interest rate changes and fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates and equity markets.Interest Rate Risk and Credit RiskInterest income generated from the Company’s cash investments as well as invested fiduciary funds will vary with the general level of interest rates.The Company had the following investments subject to variable interest rates: (In millions of dollars)December 31, 2019Cash and cash equivalents invested in money market funds, certificates of deposit and time deposits$1,155Fiduciary cash and investments$7,344Based on the above balances, if short-term interest rates increased or decreased by 10%, or 15 basis points, over the full year, annual interest income, including interest earned on fiduciary funds, would increase or decrease by approximately $8 million.In addition to interest rate risk, our cash investments and fiduciary fund investments are subject to potential loss of value due to counter-party credit risk. To minimize this risk, the Company and its subsidiaries invest pursuant to a Board approved investment policy. The policy mandates the preservation of principal and liquidity and requires broad diversification with counter-party limits assigned based primarily on credit rating and type of investment. The Company carefully monitors its cash and fiduciary fund investments and will further restrict the portfolio as appropriate to market conditions. The majority of cash and fiduciary fund investments are invested in short-term bank deposits and liquid money market funds.Foreign Currency RiskThe translated values of revenue and expense from the Company’s international operations are subject to fluctuations due to changes in currency exchange rates. The non-U.S. based revenue that is exposed to foreign exchange fluctuations is approximately 53% of total revenue. We periodically use forward contracts and options to limit foreign currency exchange rate exposure on net income and cash flows for specific, clearly defined transactions arising in the ordinary course of business. Although the Company has significant revenue generated in foreign locations which is subject to foreign exchange rate fluctuations, in most cases both the foreign currency revenue and expenses are in the functional currency of the foreign location. As such, under normal circumstances, the U.S. dollar translation of both the revenues and expenses, as well as the potentially offsetting movements of various currencies against the U.S. dollar, generally tends to mitigate the impact on net operating income of foreign currency risk. However, there have been periods where the impact was not mitigated due to external market factors, and external macroeconomic events, such as the impact of ""Brexit"" in the United Kingdom, may result in greater foreign exchange rate fluctuations in the future. If foreign exchange rates of major currencies (Euro, Sterling, Australian dollar and Canadian dollar) moved 10% in the same direction against the U.S. dollar compared with the foreign exchange rates in 2019, the Company estimates net operating income would increase or decrease by approximately $53 million. The Company has exposure to approximately 85 foreign currencies overall. In Continental Europe, the largest amount of revenue from renewals for the Risk & Insurance Services segment occurs in the first quarter. Equity Price RiskAs discussed in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements, effective January 1, 2018, the Company adopted a new accounting standard that requires equity investments with readily determinable market values to be measured at fair value with changes in fair value recognized in net income.54The Company holds investments in both public and private companies as well as private equity funds, including investments of approximately $19 million that are valued using readily determinable fair values and approximately $67 million of investments without readily determinable fair values. The Company also has investments of approximately $434 million that are accounted for using the equity method, including the Company's investment in Alexander Forbes. The investments are subject to risk of decline in market value, which, if determined to be other than temporary for assets without readily determinable fair values, could result in realized impairment losses. The Company periodically reviews the carrying value of such investments to determine if any valuation adjustments are appropriate under the applicable accounting pronouncements.The Company owns approximately 34% of the common stock of Alexander Forbes, a South African company listed on the Johannesburg Stock Exchange, which it purchased in 2014 for 7.50 South African Rand per share. In the third quarter of 2018, the Company concluded the decline in value of the investment was other than temporary and recorded an impairment charge of $83 million in 2018. As of December 31, 2019, the carrying value of the Company’s investment in Alexander Forbes was approximately $144 million. As of December 31, 2019, the market value of the approximately 443 million shares of Alexander Forbes owned by the Company, based on the December 31, 2019 closing share price of 5.55 South African Rand per share, was approximately $173 million. See Note 5 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding the pending sale of the Company's remaining investment in AF.OtherA number of lawsuits and regulatory proceedings are pending.

62709,MMC,"MARSH & MCLENNAN COMPANIES, INC.",2021,"Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations"" of our Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2019.This MD&A contains forward-looking statements as that term is defined in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. See ""Information Concerning Forward-Looking Statements"" at the outset of this report.Business Update Related To COVID-19In March 2020, the World Health Organization declared the Coronavirus (COVID-19) a pandemic. The pandemic has impacted essentially every geography in which the Company operates. Governments implemented various restrictions around the world, including closure of non-essential businesses, travel, shelter-in-place requirements for citizens and other restrictions. The Company has taken a number of precautionary steps to safeguard its businesses and colleagues from COVID-19, including implementing travel restrictions, arranging work from home capabilities and flexible work policies. In the second and third quarters of 2020, the Company began re-opening offices in various locations around the world, while ensuring that it continued to adhere to guidelines and orders issued by national, state and local governments. The timing of additional office re-openings will vary based on the conditions and restrictions in each location. In the fourth quarter, there was a surge in COVID-19 infections in many parts of the world, leading to renewed lock-downs and increased government restrictions. The safety and well-being of our colleagues continues to be our first priority. Several vaccines have been or are in various stages of approval. However, the speed of distribution and the impact on colleagues' ability to return to the office remains uncertain. The vast majority of the Company’s colleagues have continued and will continue working in a remote work environment for most of 2021. The Company expects it will continue its ability to service clients effectively while colleagues remain in a remote work environment. 37For the year ended December 31, 2020, the COVID-19 pandemic had an adverse impact on the Company’s revenue growth, primarily in our businesses that are discretionary in nature, which was partly mitigated through disciplined expense management by implementing restrictions on travel and other cost containment measures. However, the ultimate extent of the COVID-19 impact to the Company will depend on numerous evolving factors and future developments that it is not able to predict. Factors that could adversely affect the Company’s financial statements related to the financial and operational impact of COVID-19 are outlined in the ""Risk Factors” section of this report.Acquisition of JLTOn April 1, 2019, the Company completed the acquisition (the ""Transaction"") of all of the outstanding shares of Jardine Lloyd Thompson Group plc (""JLT""), a public company organized under the laws of England and Wales. In accordance with the terms of the Transaction, JLT shareholders received £19.15 in cash for each JLT share, which valued JLT’s existing share capital at approximately £4.3 billion (or approximately $5.6 billion based on the exchange rate of U.S. $1.31:£1) on the Transaction closing date. As of December 31, 2020, the Company has substantially integrated JLT into all of its business operations.After the acquisition of JLT, the Company assumed the legal liabilities of JLT’s litigation and regulatory exposures as of April 1, 2019. Please see the ""Risk Factors"" section of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for risks associated with the acquisition and Note 16 to the consolidated financial statements which discusses certain errors and omission matters related to the acquisition.JLT's results of operations for the period April 1, 2019 through December 31, 2019 are included in the Company’s results of operations for 2019. In accordance with applicable accounting guidance, JLT's results of operations for the period January 1 through March 31, 2019 and for the year ended 2018 are not included in the Company's results of operations and therefore, affect comparability. The Company’s results for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019 were impacted by JLT related acquisition, restructuring and integration costs as well as legacy MMC restructuring programs as discussed in Note 14 to the consolidated financial statements.Consolidated Results of OperationsFor the Years Ended December 31,(In millions, except per share figures)202020192018Revenue$17,224 $16,652 $14,950 ExpenseCompensation and benefits10,129 9,734 8,605 Other operating expenses4,029 4,241 3,584 Operating expenses14,158 13,975 12,189 Operating income$3,066 $2,677 $2,761 Income before income taxes$2,793 $2,439 $2,244 Net income before non-controlling interests$2,046 $1,773 $1,670 Net income attributable to the Company$2,016 $1,742 $1,650 Net income per share attributable to the Company– Basic$3.98 $3.44 $3.26 – Diluted$3.94 $3.41 $3.23 Average number of shares outstanding– Basic506 506 506 – Diluted512 511 511 Shares outstanding at December 31,508 504 504 Consolidated operating income was $3.1 billion in 2020 compared with $2.7 billion in 2019, reflecting the impact of a 3% increase in revenue and an increase in expenses of 1%. On an underlying basis, revenue increased 1%, reflecting an increase of 3% in Risk & Insurance Services offset by a decrease in Consulting of 2%. On an underlying basis, expenses decreased 2%, reflecting a decrease in JLT 38integration and restructuring and acquisition-related costs and savings realized from the completion of integration efforts to date. The expense decrease also reflects lower travel and entertainment, meeting costs and outside services resulting from the Company’s restrictions on travel and cost containment measures taken in light of COVID-19 and lower expenses recoverable from clients. These decreases were partly offset by higher incentive compensation, severance and a JLT legacy E&O provision of $161 million recorded in 2020, which is discussed in Note 16 of the consolidated financial statements.Income before income taxes increased 14% to $2.8 billion as compared to $2.4 billion in 2019, reflecting the change in operating income discussed in the preceding paragraph, partially offset by lower investment income.Diluted earnings per share increased 16% to $3.94 in 2020 compared with $3.41 in 2019. This increase is a result of the factors discussed above, and a lower effective tax rate in 2020.Risk and Insurance Services operating income increased $513 million, or 28%, in 2020 compared with 2019. Revenue increased 8%, reflecting increases of 3% on an underlying basis and 1% from acquisitions, partly offset by a 1% decrease from the impact of foreign currency translation. Expense increased 3% reflecting decreases of 2% on an underlying basis and 1% from the impact of foreign currency translation, partly offset by an increase of 2% from acquisitions. The decrease in underlying expenses is primarily due to lower JLT integration, restructuring and acquisition related costs and savings realized from the completion of integration efforts to date. The decrease also reflects lower travel and entertainment and meeting costs resulting from the Company’s restrictions on travel and cost containment measures taken in light of COVID-19, partly offset by higher severance.Consulting operating income decreased $216 million, or 18%, to $1.0 billion in 2020 compared with 2019, reflecting the impact of a decrease in revenue of 2% and an increase in expense of 1%. Revenue decreased 2% on an underlying basis and 1% from the impact of dispositions. On an underlying basis, expense increased 1% primarily due to a JLT legacy E&O provision of $161 million recorded in 2020, higher JLT integration and restructuring related costs as well as higher severance, partly offset by lower travel, entertainment and meeting costs resulting from the Company’s restrictions on travel and cost containment measures taken in light of COVID-19 and lower expenses recoverable from clients.The following chart summarizes the activity related to the restructuring and noteworthy items discussed in more detail below:For the Years Ended December 31,(In millions)202020192018Restructuring costs, excluding JLT$89 $112 $161 JLT integration and restructuring costs251 335 — JLT acquisition related costs54 150 12 JLT legacy E&O provision161 — — Impact on operating income555 597 173 Change in fair value of acquisition related derivative contracts— 8 441 Pension settlement charges3 7 42 Early extinguishment of JLT debt — 32 — JLT related interest income - pre-acquisition— (25)— JLT related interest expense - pre-acquisition— 53 30 Investment and impairment loss — — 83 Impact on income before taxes$558 $672 $769 39In 2020, 2019 and 2018, the Company’s results of operations and earnings per share were impacted by the following items:•Restructuring costs, excluding JLT: Includes severance, adjustments to restructuring liabilities for future rent under non-cancellable leases and other real estate exit costs, and restructuring costs related to the integration of recent acquisitions. These costs are discussed in more detail in Note 14 of the consolidated financial statements. •JLT integration and restructuring costs: Includes severance, lease related exit costs as well as consulting costs from the JLT Transaction. These costs are discussed in more detail in Note 14 of the consolidated financial statements. •JLT acquisition related costs: Includes advisor fees and stamp duty taxes related to the closing of the JLT Transaction and retention costs. Also includes the loss on the sale of JLT's aerospace business, which is included in revenue. •JLT legacy E&O provision: In 2020, reflects a provision for a legacy JLT E&O relating to suitability of financial advice provided to individuals for defined benefit pension transfers. This provision is discussed in more detail in Note 16 of the consolidated financial statements.•Change in fair value of acquisition related derivatives: In connection with the JLT Transaction, to hedge the risk of appreciation of the GBP-denominated purchase price relative to the U.S. dollar, in September 2018, the Company entered into a deal contingent foreign exchange contract (the ""FX Contract"") to, solely upon consummation of the JLT Transaction, purchase £5.2 billion and sell a corresponding amount of U.S. dollars at a contracted exchange rate. The FX Contract is discussed in Note 11 to the consolidated financial statements. An unrealized loss of $325 million related to the fair value changes to this derivative was recognized in the consolidated statement of income for the year ended December 31, 2018, largely due to the depreciation of the GBP from September 2018. In 2019, the Company recorded a gain of $31 million upon final settlement of the FX Contract. In addition, to hedge the economic risk of increases in interest rates prior to its issuance of senior notes in January 2019, in the fourth quarter of 2018, the Company entered into treasury lock contracts related to $2 billion of the expected debt issuance. These economic hedges were not designated as accounting hedges. The Company recorded an unrealized loss of $116 million related to the changes in the fair value of these derivatives in the consolidated statement of income for the year ended December 31, 2018. In January 2019, upon issuance of the $5 billion of senior notes, the Company settled the treasury lock contracts and made a payment to its counter party for $122 million.JLT also had a number of foreign exchange contracts to hedge the risk of foreign exchange movements between the U.S. dollar and the GBP, related to JLT’s U.S. dollar denominated revenue in the U.K. Prior to the acquisition, these derivative contracts were designated as cash flow hedges. Upon completion of the JLT Transaction, these derivative contracts were not re-designated as cash flow hedges by the Company. The contracts were settled in June 2019. The change in fair value between the acquisition date and the settlement date resulted in a charge of $26 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. The charge is recorded as a change in fair value of acquisition related derivative contracts in the consolidated statement of income.•JLT related interest income and expense: To secure funding for the Transaction, the Company entered into a bridge loan agreement with aggregate commitments of £5.2 billion in September 2018. The Company paid the customary upfront fees related to the bridge loan, which were amortized as interest expense based on the period of time the facility was expected to be in effect. The Company recorded interest expense of approximately $30 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 related to the amortization of the bridge loan fees and an additional $6 million in 2019 upon termination of the bridge loan agreement in connection with the closing of the JLT Transaction. The Company recorded approximately $47 million of interest expense related to the senior notes issued in the first quarter of 2019 and $25 million of interest income from the investment of the proceeds prior to the closing of the JLT Transaction.40•Investment loss-Alexander Forbes (""AF""): The Company recorded an impairment charge of $83 million in the 2018 consolidated statement of income for an other than temporary decline in the value of the investment. During 2020, the Company sold approximately 242 million shares of the common stock of AF. Upon completion of the sales of these shares, the investment in AF was accounted at fair value, with investment gains and losses recorded as investment income (loss) in the consolidated statement of income. •Pension settlement charge: The Defined Benefit Pension Plans in the U.K. and certain other countries allow participants an option for the payment of a lump sum distribution from plan assets before retirement in full satisfaction of the retirement benefits due to the participant as well as any survivor’s benefit. The Company’s policy in accordance with applicable U.S. GAAP is to treat these lump sum payments as a partial settlement of the plan liability if they exceed the sum of service cost plus interest cost components of net period pension cost of a plan for the year (""settlement thresholds""). The amount of lump sum payments in 2018 exceeded the settlement thresholds in two of the U.K. plans. The Company recorded non-cash settlement charges, primarily related to these plans of $42 million for the year ended December 31, 2018, of which approximately 90% impacted Risk and Insurance Services. In 2020 and 2019, the Company recorded $3 million and $7 million, respectively, of non-cash pension settlement charges related to certain of its non U.S. plans.JLT Integration and Restructuring CostsThe Company is completing its integration of JLT, which is discussed in more detail in Note 14 to the consolidated financial statements. The costs incurred in connection with the integration and restructuring of the combined businesses, primarily related to severance, real estate rationalization and technology, consulting fees related to the management of the integration processes and legal fees related to the rationalization of legal entity structures. The Company incurred costs of $251 million in 2020 and $335 million in 2019 and expects the remaining costs of $139 million to be incurred in 2021 of which $134 million will be cash expenditures. Through December 31, 2020, the Company has exceeded the initial estimated savings of $350 million. The Company now expects approximately $425 million of annualized savings when the integration is completed in 2021.41Consolidated Revenue and ExpenseRevenue - Components of ChangeThe Company conducts business in many countries. As a result, foreign exchange rate movements may impact period-to-period comparisons of revenue. Similarly, certain other items such as the revenue impact of acquisitions and dispositions, including transfers among businesses, may impact period-to-period comparisons of revenue. Underlying revenue measures the change in revenue from one period to another by isolating these impacts. The calculation of underlying revenue growth for the year ended December 31, 2020 as compared to 2019, is calculated as if MMC and JLT were a combined company as of January 1, 2019, but excludes the impact of currency and other acquisitions, dispositions, and transfers among businesses. Combined prior year revenue information for MMC and JLT for the year ended December 31, 2019 are presented below. The unaudited 2019 JLT revenue amounts in the ""2019 including JLT"" column reflect historical JLT revenue information following IFRS, adjusted to conform with U.S. GAAP and the Company's specific accounting policies, primarily related to development of constraints and subsequent release of those constraints related to the reinsurance business. The decrease in revenue due to the disposal of JLT's Aerospace business is reflected in the acquisitions/dispositions column beginning in June 2019, when the sale was completed. See the reconciliation of non-GAAP measures within MD&A. All other acquisitions/dispositions activity is included in the acquisitions/dispositions column. Underlying expense growth is calculated in a similar manner. The impact of foreign currency exchange fluctuations, acquisitions and dispositions, including transfers among businesses, on the Company’s operating revenues by segment are as follows:Year EndedDecember 31,2019 Including JLT% Change Including JLT in 2019Components of Revenue Change Including JLT*(In millions, except percentage figures)20202019% Change GAAPRevenueCurrency ImpactAcquisitions/Dispositions/ Other ImpactUnderlying RevenueRisk and Insurance ServicesMarsh$8,595 $8,014 7 %$8,246 4 %(1)%2 %3 %Guy Carpenter1,696 1,480 15 %1,598 6 %— — 6 %Subtotal10,291 9,494 8 %9,844 5 %(1)%1 %4 %Fiduciary Interest Income46 105 110 Total Risk and Insurance Services10,337 9,599 8 %9,954 4 %(1)%1 %3 %ConsultingMercer4,928 5,021 (2)%5,094 (3)%— (2)%(1)%Oliver Wyman Group2,048 2,122 (3)%2,122 (3)%— — (4)%Total Consulting6,976 7,143 (2)%7,216 (3)%— (1)%(2)%Corporate/Eliminations(89)(90)(90)Total Revenue$17,224 $16,652 3 %$17,080 1 %— — 1 %42The following table provides more detailed revenue information for certain of the components presented above:Year EndedDecember 31,2019 Including JLT% Change Including JLT in 2019Components of Revenue Change Including JLT*(In millions, except percentage figures)20202019% Change GAAPRevenueCurrency ImpactAcquisitions/ Dispositions/ OtherUnderlying RevenueMarsh:EMEA$2,575 $2,482 4 %$2,589 (1)%— — — Asia Pacific1,059 953 11 %1,019 4 %— — 4 %Latin America424 460 (8)%483 (12)%(10)%(5)%3 %Total International4,058 3,895 4 %4,091 (1)%(1)%(1)%1 %U.S./Canada4,537 4,119 10 %4,155 9 %— 4 %5 %Total Marsh$8,595 $8,014 7 %$8,246 4 %(1)%2 %3 %Mercer:Wealth2,348 2,369 (1)%2,422 (3)%— (2)%(1)%Health1,793 1,796 — 1,815 (1)%(1)%(2)%2 %Career787 856 (8)%857 (8)%— — (8)%Total Mercer$4,928 $5,021 (2)%$5,094 (3)%— (2)%(1)%* Components of revenue change may not add due to rounding.RevenueConsolidated revenue was $17 billion in 2020, an increase of 3%, or 1% on an underlying basis. Revenue in the Risk and Insurance Services segment increased 8% in 2020 compared with 2019, or 3% on an underlying basis. Revenue increased 3% and 6% on an underlying basis at Marsh and Guy Carpenter, respectively, as compared with 2019. The Consulting segment's revenue decreased 2% compared with 2019, as well as on an underlying basis. Revenue decreased 1% and 4% on an underlying basis at Mercer and Oliver Wyman Group, respectively, as compared with 2019.Operating ExpenseConsolidated operating expenses increased 1% in 2020 compared with 2019. Expenses decreased 2% on an underlying basis, reflecting a decrease in JLT integration and restructuring and acquisition-related costs, and savings realized from the completion of integration efforts to date. The decrease also reflects lower travel and entertainment, meeting costs and outside services resulting from the Company’s restrictions on travel and cost containment measures taken in light of COVID-19 and lower expenses recoverable from clients. These decreases were partly offset by a JLT legacy E&O provision of $161 million recorded in 2020, higher incentive compensation and severance.Risk and Insurance ServicesIn the Risk and Insurance Services segment, the Company’s subsidiaries and other affiliated entities act as brokers, agents or consultants for insureds, insurance underwriters and other brokers in the areas of risk management, insurance broking and insurance program management services, primarily under the name of Marsh; and engage in reinsurance broking, catastrophe and financial modeling services and related advisory functions, primarily under the name of Guy Carpenter.Marsh and Guy Carpenter are compensated for brokerage and consulting services primarily through fees paid by clients or commissions paid out of premiums charged by insurance and reinsurance companies. Commission rates vary in amount depending upon the type of insurance or reinsurance coverage provided, the particular insurer or reinsurer and the capacity in which the broker acts and negotiates with clients. Revenues can be affected by premium rate levels in the insurance/reinsurance markets, the amount of risk retained by insurance and reinsurance clients themselves and by the value of the risks that have been insured since commission-based compensation is frequently related to the premiums paid by insureds and reinsureds. In many cases, fee compensation may be negotiated in advance, based on the type of risk, coverage required and service provided by the Company and ultimately, the extent of the risk placed into the insurance market or retained by the client. The trends and comparisons of revenue from one period to the next can be affected by changes in premium rate levels, fluctuations in client risk 43retention and increases or decreases in the value of risks that have been insured, as well as new and lost business, and the volume of business from new and existing clients.Marsh also receives other compensation from insurance companies, separate from retail fees and commissions. This compensation includes, among other things, payment for consulting and analytics services provided to insurers; administrative and other services provided to or on behalf of insurers (including services relating to the administration and management of quota share, panels and other facilities in which insurers participate); and contingent commissions. Marsh and Guy Carpenter also receive interest income on certain funds (such as premiums and claims proceeds) held in a fiduciary capacity for others. The investment of fiduciary funds is regulated by state and other insurance authorities. These regulations typically require segregation of fiduciary funds and limit the types of investments that may be made with them. Interest income from these investments varies depending on the amount of funds invested and applicable interest rates, both of which vary from time to time. For presentation purposes, fiduciary interest is segregated from the other revenues of Marsh and Guy Carpenter and separately presented within the segment, as shown in the revenue by segments charts presented earlier in this MD&A.The results of operations for the Risk and Insurance Services segment are presented below: (In millions of dollars, except percentages)202020192018Revenue$10,337 $9,599 $8,228 Compensation and benefits5,690 5,370 4,485 Other operating expenses2,301 2,396 1,879 Operating expenses7,991 7,766 6,364 Operating income$2,346 $1,833 $1,864 Operating income margin22.7 %19.1 %22.7 %RevenueRevenue in the Risk and Insurance Services segment increased 8% in 2020 compared with 2019. Revenue grew 3% on an underlying basis and 1% from the impact of acquisitions, partly offset by a 1% decrease related to the impact of foreign currency translation.In Marsh, revenue increased 3% on an underlying basis and 2% from the impact of acquisitions, partly offset by a 1% decrease from the impact of foreign currency translation. U.S./Canada had underlying revenue growth of 5%. International operations increased 1% on an underlying basis, reflecting increases of 4% in Asia Pacific and 3% in Latin America, while EMEA was flat compared to prior year.Guy Carpenter’s revenue increased 15% to $1.7 billion in 2020 compared with 2019, or 6% on an underlying basis.Fiduciary interest income was $46 million in 2020 compared with $105 million in 2019. The decrease in 2020 compared to 2019 reflects the impact of lower interest rates partially offset by a higher level of average invested funds. The Risk and Insurance Services segment completed seven acquisitions during 2020. Information regarding those acquisitions is included in Note 5 to the consolidated financial statements.ExpenseExpense in the Risk and Insurance Services segment increased 3% in 2020 compared with 2019, reflecting decreases of 2% on an underlying basis and 1% from the impact of foreign currency, partly offset by a 2% increase from acquisitions. The decrease in underlying expense reflects lower JLT integration, restructuring and acquisition related costs and savings realized from the completion of integration efforts to date. The decrease also reflects lower travel and entertainment and meeting costs resulting from the Company’s restrictions on travel and cost containment measures taken in light of COVID-19 and lower base salaries. These decreases are partly offset by higher incentive compensation and severance.44ConsultingThe Company conducts business in its Consulting segment through two main business groups, Mercer and Oliver Wyman Group. Mercer provides consulting expertise, advice, services and solutions in the areas of health, wealth and career. Oliver Wyman Group provides specialized management, economic and brand consulting services.The major component of revenue in the Consulting business is fees paid by clients for advice and services. Mercer, principally through its health line of business, also earns revenue in the form of commissions received from insurance companies for the placement of group (and occasionally individual) insurance contracts, primarily life, health and accident coverages. Revenue for Mercer’s investment management business and certain of Mercer’s defined contribution administration services consists principally of fees based on assets under management or administration.Revenue in the Consulting segment is affected by, among other things, global economic conditions, including changes in clients’ particular industries and markets. Revenue is also affected by competition due to the introduction of new products and services, broad trends in employee demographics, including levels of employment, the effect of government policies and regulations, and fluctuations in interest and foreign exchange rates. Revenues from the provision of investment management services and retirement trust and administrative services are significantly affected by the level of assets under management or administration, which is impacted by securities market performance.For the investment management business, revenues from the majority of funds are included on a gross basis in accordance with U.S. GAAP and include reimbursable expenses incurred by professional staff and sub-advisory fees, and the related expenses are included in other operating expenses.The results of operations for the Consulting segment are presented below: (In millions of dollars, except percentages)202020192018Revenue$6,976 $7,143 $6,779 Compensation and benefits3,995 3,934 3,760 Other operating expenses1,987 1,999 1,920 Operating expenses5,982 5,933 5,680 Operating income$994 $1,210 $1,099 Operating income margin14.3 %16.9 %16.2 %RevenueConsulting revenue in 2020 decreased 2% compared with 2019, reflecting decreases of 2% on an underlying basis and 1% from the impact of dispositions.Mercer's revenue in 2020 decreased 1% on an underlying basis and 2% from the impact of dispositions. The decrease in underlying revenue reflects decreases in both Career of 8% and Wealth of 1% partly offset by an increase in Health of 2%. Oliver Wyman Group’s revenue decreased 3% in 2020 compared with 2019, or 4% on an underlying basis.ExpenseConsulting expense in 2020 increased 1% compared with 2019. This reflects an increase of 1% on an underlying basis and a decrease of 1% from the impact of dispositions. The increase in underlying expense reflects a JLT legacy E&O provision of $161 million recorded in 2020, higher JLT integration and restructuring costs as well as higher base salaries, incentive compensation and severance. These increases were partly offset by lower travel, entertainment and meeting costs resulting from the Company’s restrictions on travel and cost containment measures taken in light of COVID-19 and lower expenses recoverable from clients.Corporate and OtherCorporate expense in 2020 was $274 million compared with $366 million in 2019. Expenses decreased 17% on an underlying basis due to lower acquisition, integration and restructuring costs primarily related 45to the JLT Transaction and savings realized from the completion of integration efforts to date, partly offset by higher base salaries.Other Corporate ItemsInterestInterest income earned on corporate funds amounted to $7 million in 2020 compared with $39 million in 2019. During the first quarter of 2019, the Company issued approximately $6.5 billion of senior notes related to the JLT acquisition. The funds were held in escrow and released for payment in April 2019, when the acquisition was completed. The decrease in interest income from the prior year is primarily due to interest earned on these funds in 2019. Interest expense in 2020 was $515 million compared with $524 million in 2019. The decrease in interest expense was primarily due to the impact of lower average interest rates on borrowings. Investment (Loss) IncomeThe caption ""Investment (loss) income"" in the consolidated statements of income comprises realized and unrealized gains and losses from investments. It includes, when applicable, other than temporary declines in the value of securities, mark-to-market increases or decreases in equity investments with readily determinable fair values and equity method gains or losses on its investments in private equity funds. The Company's investments may include direct investments in insurance, consulting or other strategically linked companies and investments in private equity funds.The Company recorded a net investment loss of $22 million in 2020, primarily due to the loss from the sale of shares of AF during the second quarter of 2020. The Company recorded net investment income of $22 million in 2019 which included gains of $10 million related to mark-to-market changes to equity securities and gains of $12 million related to investments in private equity funds and other investments.Income TaxesThe Company completed the JLT Transaction on April 1, 2019. During 2020, the integration of this global organization required intercompany transfers of acquired entities into the Company's country structures and the combination of those entities within the equivalent Company businesses. The integration transactions were designed to be tax efficient. The Company's global effective tax rate on JLT's earnings was reduced compared to JLT's pre-acquisition tax rate by utilizing debt for the restructuring transactions to be capital efficient, and reducing the generation of post-acquisition tax losses by merging historically unprofitable JLT entities with profitable Company operations. Provisions for deferred taxes and uncertain tax positions were established as part of the purchase price allocation as of April 1, 2019.The broader JLT organization is now held under the Company's legal entity structure, which makes it part of a U.S.-based multinational company and subjects it to full U.S. taxation.The Company's consolidated effective tax rate was 26.7%, 27.3%, and 25.6% in 2020, 2019, and 2018, respectively. The rates in all periods reflect the effects of tax planning and the ongoing impact of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (""TCJA""), including regulatory and other guidance as it became available. The tax rate in 2020 includes a valuation allowance for certain tax credits, the impact of uncertain tax positions, and certain tax planning benefits. The 2019 rate reflects items related to the JLT acquisition, including non-deductible goodwill allocated to the sale of Aerospace and non-deductible expenses incurred in relation to the JLT acquisition. The 2018 rate includes the effect of a charge related to the Company’s investment in AF as discussed in Note 1. The tax rates in all periods reflect the impact of discrete tax matters, tax legislation, and nontaxable adjustments to contingent acquisition consideration.The effective tax rate may vary significantly from period to period for the foreseeable future. The effective tax rate is sensitive to the geographic mix and repatriation of the Company's earnings, which may result in higher or lower tax rates. A shift in the mix of profits among jurisdictions can also affect the effective tax rate. In 2020, pre-tax income in Barbados, Canada, Ireland, Australia, Japan and Germany accounted for approximately 60% of the Company's total non-U.S. pre-tax income, with effective rates in those countries of 1%, 27%, 15%, 23%, 33.7%, and 32% respectively.In addition, losses in certain jurisdictions cannot be offset by earnings from other operations, and may require valuation allowances that affect the rate, depending on estimates of the value of associated deferred tax assets which can be realized. A valuation allowance was recorded to reduce deferred tax 46assets to the amount that the Company believes is more likely than not to be realized. Details are provided in Note 7 of the consolidated financial statements. The effective tax rate is also sensitive to changes in unrecognized tax benefits, including the impact of settled tax audits and expired statutes of limitation. Changes in tax laws, rulings, policies or related legal and regulatory interpretations occur frequently and may also have significant favorable or adverse impacts on our effective tax rate. As a U.S. domiciled parent holding company, the Company is the issuer of essentially all of the Company's external indebtedness, and incurs the related interest expense in the U.S. The Company’s interest expense deductions are not currently limited. Further, most senior executive and oversight functions are conducted in the U.S. and the associated costs are incurred primarily in the U.S. Some of these expenses may not be deductible in the U.S., which may impact the effective tax rate.The quasi-territorial tax regime provides an opportunity for the Company to repatriate foreign earnings more tax efficiently and there is less incentive for permanent reinvestment of these earnings. However, permanent reinvestment continues to be a component of the Company’s global capital strategy. The Company continues to evaluate its global investment and repatriation strategy in light of our capital requirements and potential costs of repatriation.The Coronavirus Aid, Relief and Economic Security Act (the ""CARES Act"") was signed into law on March 27, 2020. The CARES Act provided over $2 trillion in economic relief to individuals, governmental agencies and companies, to deal with the public health and economic impacts of COVID-19. Pursuant to the CARES Act, payroll taxes due from March 27, 2020 through December 31, 2020 will be deferred until 2021 and 2022 (50% to be paid each year) without interest or penalties.Liquidity and Capital ResourcesThe Company is organized as a legal entity separate and distinct from its operating subsidiaries. As the Company does not have significant operations of its own, the Company is dependent upon dividends and other payments from its operating subsidiaries to pay principal and interest on its outstanding debt obligations, pay dividends to stockholders, repurchase its shares and pay corporate expenses. The Company can also provide financial support to its operating subsidiaries for acquisitions, investments and certain parts of their business that require liquidity, such as the capital markets business of Guy Carpenter. Other sources of liquidity include borrowing facilities in financing cash flows.The Company derives a significant portion of its revenue and operating profit from operating subsidiaries located outside of the U.S. Funds from those operating subsidiaries are regularly repatriated to the U.S. out of annual earnings. At December 31, 2020, the Company had approximately $789 million of cash and cash equivalents in its foreign operations, which includes $249 million of operating funds required to be maintained for regulatory requirements or as collateral under certain captive insurance arrangements. The Company expects to continue its practice of repatriating available funds from its non-U.S. operating subsidiaries out of current annual earnings. Where appropriate, a portion of the current year earnings will continue to be permanently reinvested. With respect to repatriating 2018 and prior earnings, the Company has evaluated such factors as its short- and long-term capital needs, acquisition and borrowing strategies, and the availability of cash for repatriation for each of its subsidiaries. In general, the Company has determined that its permanent reinvestment assertions, in light of the enactment of the TCJA, should allow the Company to repatriate previously taxed earnings from the deemed repatriations as cash becomes available.During 2020, the Company recorded foreign currency translation adjustments which increased net equity by $559 million. Continued weakening of the U.S. dollar against foreign currencies would further increase the translated U.S. dollar value of the Company’s net investments in its non-U.S. subsidiaries, as well as the translated U.S. dollar value of cash repatriations from those subsidiaries. Conversely, strengthening of the U.S. dollar against foreign currencies would decrease the translated U.S. dollar value of the Company’s net investments in its non-U.S. subsidiaries, as well as the translated U.S. dollar value of cash repatriations from those subsidiaries.Cash on our consolidated balance sheets includes funds available for general corporate purposes. Funds held on behalf of clients in a fiduciary capacity are segregated and shown separately in the consolidated 47balance sheets as an offset to fiduciary liabilities. Fiduciary funds cannot be used for general corporate purposes, and should not be considered as a source of liquidity for the Company.Operating Cash FlowsThe Company generated $3.4 billion of cash from operations in 2020 and $2.4 billion in 2019. These amounts reflect the net income of the Company during those periods, excluding gains or losses from investments, adjusted for non-cash charges and changes in working capital which relate primarily to the timing of payments of accrued liabilities or receipts of assets and pension contributions.Pension-Related ItemsContributionsDuring 2020, the Company contributed $65 million to its U.S. pension plans and $78 million to non-U.S. pension plans compared to contributions of $35 million to U.S. plans and $87 million to non-U.S. plans in 2019.In the U.S., contributions to the tax-qualified defined benefit plans are based on ERISA guidelines and the Company generally expects to maintain a funded status of 80% or more of the liability determined in accordance with the ERISA guidelines. In 2020, the Company made $30 million of contributions to non-qualified plans and $35 million to its qualified plans. The Company expects to contribute approximately $37 million to its U.S. pension plans in 2021, including $7 million to the U.S. qualified plans to meet ERISA funding requirements and $30 million to its non-qualified plans.The Company contributed $34 million to its U.K. plans in 2020, including an expense allowance of approximately $5 million. The Company's contributions to its U.K. plans in 2021 are expected to be approximately $47 million, including an expense allowance of $16 million.Outside the U.S., the Company has a large number of non-U.S. defined benefit pension plans, the largest of which are in the U.K., which comprise approximately 81% of non-U.S. plan assets at December 31, 2020. Contribution rates for non-U.S. plans are generally based on local funding practices and statutory requirements, which may differ significantly from measurements under U.S. GAAP. In the U.K., the assumptions used to determine pension contributions are the result of legally-prescribed negotiations between the Company and the plans' trustee that typically occur every three years in conjunction with the actuarial valuation of the plans. Currently, this results in a lower funded status compared to U.S. GAAP and may result in contributions irrespective of the U.S. GAAP funded status. For the MMC U.K. Pension Fund, a new agreement was reached with the trustee in the fourth quarter of 2019 based on the surplus funding position at December 31, 2018. In accordance with the agreement, no deficit funding is required until 2023. The funding level will be re-assessed during 2022 to determine if contributions are required in 2023. In order to have greater influence over asset allocation and overall investment decisions, in November 2019, the Company renewed its agreement to support annual deficit contributions by the U.K. operating companies under certain circumstances, up to GBP 450 million over a seven-year period. In addition, in the U.K., the Company assumed responsibility for JLT's Pension Scheme (""JLT U.K. plan""). We currently expect to pay $29 million of deficit funding in 2021, although we will also reach a new funding agreement with the trustee during 2021.In the aggregate, the Company expects to contribute approximately $87 million to its non-U.S. defined benefit plans in 2021, comprising approximately $40 million to plans outside of the U.K. and $47 million to the U.K. plans.Changes to Pension PlansAs part of the JLT Transaction, the Company assumed responsibility for a number of pension plans throughout the world, the most significant of which is the JLT U.K. plan. The JLT U.K. plan has a defined benefit section which was frozen to future accrual in 2006 and a defined contribution section. The assets of the scheme are held in a trustee administered fund separate from the Company.Changes in Funded Status and ExpenseThe year-over-year change in the funded status of the Company's pension plans is impacted by the 48difference between actual and assumed results, particularly with regard to return on assets, and changes in the discount rate, as well as the amount of Company contributions, if any. Unrecognized actuarial losses were approximately $2.4 billion and $3.5 billion at December 31, 2020 for the U.S. plans and non-U.S. plans, respectively, compared with losses of $2.1 billion and $3.1 billion at December 31, 2019. The increases in both the U.S. and non-U.S. plans was primarily due to a decrease in the discount rate used to measure plan liabilities partly offset by an increase in asset values. In the past several years, the amount of unamortized losses has been significantly impacted, both positively and negatively, by actual asset performance and changes in discount rates. The discount rate used to measure plan liabilities in 2020 and 2019 decreased in the U.S. and U.K. (the Company's largest plans) following increases in the U.S. and the U.K. in 2018. An increase in the discount rate decreases the measured plan benefit obligation, resulting in actuarial gains, while a decrease in the discount rate increases the measured plan obligation, resulting in actuarial losses. During 2020, the Company's defined benefit pension plan assets had gains of 13.1% and 12.0% in the U.S. and U.K., respectively, as compared to gains of 21.4% and 13.1% in the U.S. and U.K., respectively, in 2019. During 2018, the Company's defined benefit pension plan assets had losses of 7.4% in the U.S. and 1.0% in the U.K.Overall, based on the measurement at December 31, 2020, total benefit credits related to the Company’s defined benefit plans are expected to increase in 2021 by approximately $22 million compared to 2020, reflecting an increase in non-U.S. plans of approximately $31 million, offset by a decrease in U.S. plans of $9 million. The Company’s accounting policies for its defined benefit pension plans, including the selection of and sensitivity to assumptions, are discussed below under Management’s Discussion of Critical Accounting Policies. For additional information regarding the Company’s retirement plans, see Note 8 to the consolidated financial statements.Financing Cash FlowsNet cash used for financing activities was $1.9 billion in 2020 compared with $3.3 billion provided by financing activities in 2019.Credit FacilitiesThe Company and certain of its foreign subsidiaries have a multi-currency five-year unsecured revolving credit facility of $1.8 billion. The interest rate on this facility is based on LIBOR plus a fixed margin which varies with the Company's credit ratings. This facility expires in October 2023 and requires the Company to maintain certain coverage and leverage ratios which are tested quarterly. The Company borrowed $1 billion under this facility in the first quarter of 2020, which was repaid in full during the second quarter of 2020. There were no borrowings outstanding under this facility at December 31, 2020.In January 2020, the Company entered into two new term loan facilities: a $500 million one-year facility and a $500 million two-year facility. In the first quarter of 2020, the Company borrowed $1 billion against these facilities. During the third quarter of 2020, the Company repaid $500 million of borrowings from its one-year facility. In December 2020, the Company repaid $500 million of borrowings from the two year facility. These two facilities were terminated as of December 31, 2020 after repayment of the initial draw down.In April 2020, the Company entered into a new 364 day $1 billion unsecured revolving credit facility with a term out option after one year. The facility has similar coverage and leverage ratios as the multi-currency five-year unsecured revolving credit facility. The Company had no borrowings outstanding under this facility at December 31, 2020.The Company also maintains other credit facilities, guarantees and letters of credit with various banks, aggregating $573 million at December 31, 2020 and $598 million at December 31, 2019. There were no outstanding borrowings under these facilities as of December 31, 2020 or as of December 31, 2019.DebtThe Company has established a short-term debt financing program of up to $1.5 billion through the issuance of commercial paper. The proceeds from the issuance of commercial paper were used for general corporate purposes. The Company had no commercial paper outstanding at December 31, 2020.49In December 2020, the Company repaid $700 million of maturing Senior Notes and $300 million of floating rate notes with an original maturity of December 2021.In May 2020, the Company issued $750 million of 2.250% Senior Notes due 2030. The Company used the net proceeds from this offering to pay outstanding borrowings under the revolving credit facility.In March 2020, the Company repaid $500 million of maturing Senior Notes.In September 2019, the Company repaid $300 million of maturing Senior Notes.During 2019, the Company issued approximately $6.5 billion of Senior Notes to primarily fund the acquisition of JLT, including the payment of related fees and expenses, and to repay certain JLT indebtedness, as well as for general corporate purposes.In connection with the closing of the JLT Transaction, the Company assumed approximately $1 billion of historical JLT indebtedness, which it repaid during 2019. The Company incurred debt extinguishment costs of $32 million in regard to the repayment of this debt.The Company's senior debt is currently rated A- by Standard & Poor's and Baa1 by Moody's. The Company's short-term debt is currently rated A-2 by Standard & Poor's and P-2 by Moody's. The Company carries a Stable outlook with S&P and a Negative outlook with Moody's.Share RepurchasesThe Company did not repurchase any shares of its common stock during 2020. In November 2019, the Board of Directors authorized an increase in the Company’s share repurchase program, which supersedes any prior authorization, allowing management to buy back up to $2.5 billion of the Company’s common stock. As of December 31, 2020, the Company remained authorized to purchase shares of its common stock up to a value of approximately $2.4 billion. There is no time limit on this authorization.During 2019, the Company repurchased 4.8 million shares of its common stock for total consideration of $485 million at an average price per share of $100.48.DividendsThe Company paid total dividends of $943 million in 2020 ($1.84 per share), $890 million in 2019 ($1.74 per share) and $807 million in 2018 ($1.58 per share).Contingent Payments Related To AcquisitionsDuring 2020, the Company paid $102 million of contingent payments related to acquisitions made in prior years. These payments are split between financing and operating cash flows in the consolidated statements of cash flows. Payments of $54 million related to the contingent consideration liability that was recorded on the date of acquisition are reflected as financing cash flows. Payments related to increases in the contingent consideration liability subsequent to the date of acquisition of $48 million are reflected as operating cash flows. Remaining estimated future contingent consideration payments of $243 million for acquisitions completed in 2020 and in prior years are included in accounts payable and accrued liabilities or other liabilities in the consolidated balance sheet at December 31, 2020. The Company paid deferred purchase consideration related to prior years' acquisitions of $68 million and $43 million for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively, that is reflected as financing cash flows. Remaining deferred cash payments of approximately $241 million are included in accounts payable and accrued liabilities or other liabilities in the consolidated balance sheet at December 31, 2020.In 2019, the Company paid $63 million of contingent payments related to acquisitions made in prior periods, of which $22 million was reported as financing cash flows and $41 million as operating cash flows.DerivativesNet Investment HedgeThe Company has investments in various subsidiaries with Euro functional currencies. As a result, the Company is exposed to the risk of fluctuations between the Euro and U.S. dollar exchange rates. As part of its risk management program to fund the JLT acquisition, the Company issued €1.1 billion Senior Notes, and designated the debt instruments as a net investment hedge of its Euro denominated subsidiaries. The hedge is re-assessed each quarter to confirm that the designated equity balance at the 50beginning of each period continues to equal or exceed 80% of the outstanding balance of the Euro debt instrument and that all the critical terms of the hedging instrument and the hedged net investment continue to match. If the hedge is highly effective, the change in the debt balance related to foreign exchange fluctuations will be recorded in foreign currency translation gains (losses) in the consolidated balance sheet. The U.S. dollar value of the Euro notes increased by $124 million during 2020 related to the change in foreign exchange rates. The Company concluded that the hedge was highly effective and recorded an increase to accumulated other comprehensive loss for the year ended December 31, 2020.JLT Fair Value Debt Derivative ContractsPrior to the JLT Transaction closing, a significant portion of JLT's outstanding senior notes were denominated in U.S. dollars. In order to hedge its exposure against the risk of fluctuations between the British Pound (""GBP"") and the U.S. dollar, JLT entered into foreign exchange and interest rate swaps, which were designated as fair value hedges. In June 2019, the Company redeemed these U.S. dollar denominated senior notes and settled the related derivative contracts. Both the change in fair value of the debt and the change in fair value of the derivative contracts were recorded in the consolidated statement of income in the second quarter of 2019. The Company received approximately $112 million upon settlement of these derivative contracts.JLT Cash Flow HedgesJLT also had a number of foreign exchange contracts to hedge the risk of foreign exchange movements between the U.S. dollar and the GBP, related to JLT’s U.S. dollar denominated revenue in the U.K. Prior to the acquisition, these derivative contracts were designated as cash flow hedges. Upon acquisition, the derivative contracts were not re-designated as cash flow hedges by the Company. The contracts were settled in June 2019. The change in fair value between the acquisition date and the settlement date resulted in a charge of $26 million in the second quarter of 2019. The charge is recorded as a change in fair value of acquisition related derivative contracts in the consolidated statement of income.Foreign Exchange Forward ContractIn connection with the JLT Transaction, to hedge the risk of appreciation of the GBP-denominated purchase price relative to the U.S. dollar, on September 20, 2018, the Company entered into the FX Contract to, solely upon consummation of the Transaction, purchase £5.2 billion and sell a corresponding amount of U.S. dollars at a contracted exchange rate. The FX Contract, which did not qualify for hedge accounting treatment under applicable accounting guidance, is discussed in Note 11 to the consolidated financial statements. The Company settled the FX Contract on April 1, 2019, recording a realized gain to the consolidated statement of income of approximately $31 million in 2019. The cash outflow related to the settlement of the FX Contract was approximately $294 million in 2019.Foreign Exchange Contract on Euro Debt IssuanceIn March 2019, the Company issued €1.1 billion of senior notes related to the JLT Transaction. See Note 13 for additional information related to the Euro senior note issuances. In connection with the senior note issuances of €1.1 billion, the Company entered into a forward exchange contract to hedge the economic risk of changes in foreign exchange rates from the issuance date to settlement date of the Euro senior notes. This forward exchange contract was settled in March 2019 and the Company recorded a charge of $7 million in the first quarter of 2019 related to the settlement of this contract.Treasury Locks on Senior NotesIn connection with the JLT Transaction and to hedge the risk of increases in future interest rates prior to its issuance of senior notes, the Company entered into treasury locks related to $2 billion of the expected debt in the fourth quarter of 2018. The fair value at December 31, 2018 was based on the published treasury rate plus forward premium as of December 31, 2018 compared to the all in rate at the inception of the contract. The contracts were not designated as an accounting hedge. The Company recorded an unrealized loss of $116 million related to the change in the fair value of these derivatives in the consolidated statement of income for the year ended December 31, 2018. In January 2019, upon issuance of the $5 billion of senior notes, the Company settled the treasury lock derivatives and made a payment to its counter party for $122 million.51Investing Cash FlowsNet cash used for investing activities amounted to $814 million in 2020 compared with $5.7 billion used for investing activities in 2019.The Company paid $668 million and $5.5 billion, net of cash acquired, for acquisitions it made during 2020 and 2019, respectively.During 2020, the Company sold certain businesses primarily in the U.S., U.K. and Canada for cash proceeds of approximately $98 million. At December 31, 2019, the Company owned approximately 443 million shares of the common stock of AF, a South African company listed on the Johannesburg Stock Exchange, which was accounted for under the equity method of accounting. In February 2020, the Company sold approximately 49 million shares, and in May 2020, sold an additional 193 million shares, leaving the Company with an investment of approximately 201 million shares of the common stock of AF at December 31, 2020. Upon completion of the sale of shares in May 2020, the investment in AF was accounted at fair value, with investment gains and losses recorded as investment income in the consolidated statement of income.During the first quarter of 2019, the Company disposed of its investment in Benefitfocus for total proceeds of approximately $132 million. The Company received $115 million in the first quarter of 2019 and $17 million in the second quarter of 2019 as final settlement on the sale.During the second quarter of 2019, the Company disposed of its investment in Payscale and received proceeds of approximately $47 million. In January 2019, the Company increased its equity ownership in Marsh India from 26% to 49% for approximately $88 million. Marsh India is carried under the equity method.The Company’s additions to fixed assets and capitalized software, which amounted to $348 million in 2020 and $421 million in 2019, primarily related to computer equipment purchases, the refurbishing and modernizing of office facilities and software development costs.The Company has commitments for potential future investments of approximately $46 million in four private equity funds that invest primarily in financial services companies.Commitments and ObligationsThe following sets forth the Company’s future contractual obligations by the types identified in the table below as of December 31, 2020:Payment due by PeriodContractual Obligations(In millions of dollars)TotalWithin1 Year1-3Years4-5YearsAfter 5YearsCurrent portion of long-term debt$517 $517 $— $— $— Long-term debt10,866 — 1,135 2,135 7,596 Interest on long-term debt5,454 461 821 674 3,498 Net operating leases2,570 410 711 544 905 Service agreements344 197 101 36 10 Other long-term obligations558 182 329 47 — Total$20,309 $1,767 $3,097 $3,436 $12,009 The above does not include the liability for unrecognized tax benefits of $98 million as the Company is unable to reasonably predict the timing of settlement of these liabilities, other than approximately $20 million that may become payable during 2021. The above does not include the remaining transitional tax payments related to the TCJA of $64.5 million. Management’s Discussion of Critical Accounting PoliciesThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (""GAAP"") requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue and expenses, and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. Management considers the policies discussed below to be critical to understanding the Company’s 52financial statements because their application places the most significant demands on management’s judgment, and requires management to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain. Actual results may differ from those estimates.Revenue RecognitionIn the Risk and Insurance Services segment, judgments related to the amount of variable revenue consideration to ultimately be received on placement of quota share reinsurance treaties and contingent commission from insurers, which was previously recognized when the contingency was resolved, now requires significant judgments and estimates.The Company capitalizes the incremental costs to obtain contracts primarily related to commissions or sales bonus payments. These deferred costs are amortized over the expected life of the underlying customer relationships. The Company also capitalizes certain pre-placement costs that are considered fulfillment costs that are amortized at a point in time when the associated revenue is recognized.Management also makes significant judgments and estimates to measure the progress toward completing performance obligations and realization rates for consideration related to contracts as well as potential performance-based fees in the Consulting segment.See Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information.Legal and Other Loss ContingenciesThe Company and its subsidiaries are subject to numerous claims, lawsuits and proceedings including claims for errors and omissions (""E&O""). GAAP requires that a liability be recorded when a loss is both probable and reasonably estimable. Significant management judgment is required to apply this guidance. The Company utilizes case level reviews by inside and outside counsel, an internal actuarial analysis by Oliver Wyman, a subsidiary of the Company, and other methods to estimate potential losses. The liability is reviewed quarterly and adjusted as developments warrant. In many cases, the Company has not recorded a liability, other than for legal fees to defend the claim, because we are unable, at the present time, to make a determination that a loss is both probable and reasonably estimable. Given the unpredictability of E&O claims and of litigation that could flow from them, it is possible that an adverse outcome in a particular matter could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s businesses, results of operations, financial condition or cash flow in a given quarterly or annual period.In addition, to the extent that insurance coverage is available, significant management judgment is required to determine the amount of recoveries that are probable of collection under the Company’s various insurance programs.Retirement BenefitsThe Company maintains qualified and non-qualified defined benefit pension and defined contribution plans for its eligible U.S. employees and a variety of defined benefit and defined contribution plans for its eligible non-U.S. employees. The Company’s policy for funding its tax-qualified defined benefit retirement plans is to contribute amounts at least sufficient to meet the funding requirements set forth in U.S. and applicable foreign laws.The Company recognizes the funded status of its over-funded defined benefit pension and retiree medical plans as a net benefit plan asset and its unfunded and underfunded plans as a net benefit plan liability. The gains or losses and prior service costs or credits that have not been recognized as components of net periodic costs are recorded as a component of Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income (""AOCI""), net of tax, in the Company’s consolidated balance sheets. The gains and losses that exceed specified corridors, 10 percent of the greater of the projected benefit obligation or the market-related value of plan assets, are amortized prospectively out of AOCI over a period that approximates the remaining life expectancy of participants in plans where substantially all participants are inactive or the average remaining service period of active participants for plans with active participants. The vast majority of unrecognized losses relate to inactive plans and are amortized over the remaining life expectancy of the participants.The determination of net periodic pension cost is based on a number of assumptions, including an expected long-term rate of return on plan assets, the discount rate, mortality and assumed rate of salary increase. The assumptions used in the calculation of net periodic pension costs and pension liabilities are 53disclosed in Note 8 to the consolidated financial statements. The assumptions for expected rate of return on plan assets and the discount rate are discussed in more detail below.The long-term rate of return on plan assets assumption is determined for each plan based on the facts and circumstances that exist as of the measurement date, and the specific portfolio mix of each plan’s assets. The Company utilizes a model developed by Mercer, a subsidiary of the Company, to assist in the determination of this assumption. The model takes into account several factors, including: actual and target portfolio allocation; investment, administrative and trading expenses incurred directly by the plan trust; historical portfolio performance; relevant forward-looking economic analysis; and expected returns, variances and correlations for different asset classes. These measures are used to determine probabilities using standard statistical techniques to calculate a range of expected returns on the portfolio.The target asset allocation for the U.S. plans is 64% equities and equity alternatives and 36% fixed income. At the end of 2020, the actual allocation for the U.S. plans was 64% equities and equity alternatives and 36% fixed income. The target asset allocation for the U.K. plans, which comprise approximately 81% of non-U.S. plan assets, is 32% equities and equity alternatives and 68% fixed income. At the end of 2020, the actual allocation for the U.K. plans was 33% equities and equity alternatives and 67% fixed income. The discount rate selected for each U.S. plan is based on a model bond portfolio with coupons and redemptions that closely match the expected liability cash flows from the plan. Discount rates for non-U.S. plans are based on appropriate bond indices adjusted for duration; in the U.K., the plan duration is reflected using the Mercer yield curve.The table below shows the weighted average assumed rate of return and the discount rate at the December 31, 2020 measurement date (for measuring pension expense in 2021) for the total Company, the U.S. and the Rest of World (""ROW"").Total CompanyU.S.ROWAssumed rate of return on plan assets4.72 %7.02 %3.89 %Discount rate1.92 %2.73 %1.49 %Holding all other assumptions constant, a half-percentage point change in the rate of return on plan assets and discount rate assumptions would affect net periodic pension cost for the U.S. and U.K. plans, which together comprise approximately 85% of total pension plan liabilities, as follows:0.5 PercentagePoint Increase0.5 PercentagePoint Decrease(In millions of dollars)U.S.U.K.U.S.U.K.Assumed rate of return on plan assets$(23)$(51)$23 $51 Discount Rate$3 $5 $(4)$(8)The impact of discount rate changes shown above relates to the increase or decrease in actuarial gains or losses being amortized through net periodic pension cost, as well as the increase or decrease in interest expense, with all other facts and assumptions held constant. It does not contemplate nor include potential future impacts a change in the interest rate environment and discount rates might cause, such as the impact on the market value of the plans’ assets. In addition, the assumed return on plan assets would likely be impacted by changes in the interest rate environment and other factors, including equity valuations, since these factors reflect the starting point used in the Company’s projection models. For example, a reduction in interest rates may result in a reduction in the assumed return on plan assets. Changing the discount rate and leaving the other assumptions constant also may not be representative of the impact on expense, because the long-term rates of inflation and salary increases are often correlated with the discount rate. Changes in these assumptions will not necessarily have a linear impact on the net periodic pension cost.The Company contributes to certain health care and life insurance benefits provided to its retired employees. The cost of these post-retirement benefits for employees in the U.S. is accrued during the period up to the date employees are eligible to retire but is funded by the Company as incurred. The key assumptions and sensitivity to changes in the assumed health care cost trend rate are discussed in Note 8 to the consolidated financial statements. 54Income TaxesSignificant judgment is required in determining the annual effective tax rate and in evaluating uncertain tax positions. The Company reports a liability for unrecognized tax benefits resulting from uncertain tax positions taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. The evaluation of a tax position is a two-step process:•First, the Company determines whether it is more likely than not that a tax position will be sustained upon tax examination, including resolution of any related appeals or litigation, based on only the technical merits of the position. If a tax position does not meet the more-likely-than-not recognition threshold, the benefit of that position is not recognized in the financial statements. •The second step is measurement. A tax position that meets the more-likely-than-not recognition threshold is measured to determine the amount of benefit to recognize in the financial statements. The tax position is measured as the largest amount of benefit that is greater than 50-percent likely of being realized upon ultimate resolution with a taxing authority. Uncertain tax positions are evaluated based upon the facts and circumstances that exist at each reporting period and involve significant management judgment. Subsequent changes in judgment based upon new information may lead to changes in recognition, de-recognition, and measurement. Adjustments may result, for example, upon resolution of an issue with the taxing authorities, or expiration of a statute of limitations barring an assessment for an issue. The Company recognizes interest and penalties, if any, related to unrecognized tax benefits in income tax expense. The Company’s accounting policy follows the portfolio approach that leaves stranded income tax effects in AOCI. Certain items are included in the Company's tax returns at different times than the items are reflected in the financial statements. As a result, the annual tax expense reflected in the consolidated statements of income is different than that reported in the tax returns. Some of these differences are permanent, such as non-deductible expenses, and some differences are temporary and reverse over time, such as depreciation expense. Temporary differences create deferred tax assets and liabilities, which are measured at existing tax rates. Deferred tax liabilities generally represent tax expense recognized in the financial statements for which payment has been deferred, or expense for which a deduction has been taken already in the tax return but the expense has not yet been recognized in the financial statements. Deferred tax assets generally represent items that can be used as a tax deduction or credit in tax returns in future years for which a benefit has already been recorded in the financial statements. The Company evaluates all significant available positive and negative evidence, including the existence of losses in recent years and its forecast of future taxable income by jurisdiction, in assessing the need for a valuation allowance. The Company also considers tax planning strategies that would result in realization of deferred tax assets, and the presence of taxable income in prior period tax filings in jurisdictions that allow for the carry back of tax attributes pursuant to the applicable tax law. The underlying assumptions the Company uses in forecasting future taxable income require significant judgment and take into account the Company's recent performance. The ultimate realization of deferred tax assets is dependent on the generation of future taxable income during the periods in which temporary differences or carry-forwards are deductible or creditable. Valuation allowances are established for deferred tax assets when it is estimated that it is more likely than not that future taxable income will be insufficient to fully use a deduction or credit in that jurisdiction.Fair Value DeterminationsGoodwill Impairment Testing – The Company is required to assess goodwill and any indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment annually, or more frequently if circumstances indicate impairment may have occurred. The Company performs the annual impairment assessment for each of its reporting units during the third quarter of each year. In accordance with applicable accounting guidance, a company can assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is necessary to perform a quantitative goodwill impairment test. Alternatively, the Company may elect to proceed directly to the quantitative goodwill 55impairment test. In 2020, the Company elected to perform a qualitative impairment assessment. As part of its assessment, the Company considered numerous factors, including:•that the fair value of each reporting unit exceeds its carrying value by a substantial margin based on its most recent quantitative assessment in 2019; •whether significant acquisitions or dispositions occurred which might alter the fair value of its reporting units;•macroeconomic conditions and their potential impact on reporting unit fair values;•actual performance compared with budget and prior projections used in its estimation of reporting unit fair values;•industry and market conditions;•and the year-over-year change in the Company’s share price.The Company completed its qualitative assessment in the third quarter of 2020 and concluded that a quantitative goodwill impairment test was not required in 2020 and that goodwill was not impaired.Share-Based PaymentThe accounting guidance for share-based payments requires, among other things, that the estimated grant date fair value of stock options be charged to earnings. Significant management judgment is required to determine the appropriate assumptions for inputs such as volatility and expected term necessary to estimate option values. In addition, management judgment is required to analyze the terms of the plans and awards granted thereunder to determine if awards will be treated as equity awards or liability awards, as defined by the accounting guidance.As of December 31, 2020, there was $17.5 million of unrecognized compensation cost related to stock option awards. The weighted-average period over which the costs are expected to be recognized is 1.23 years. Also as of December 31, 2020, there was $347.7 million of unrecognized compensation cost related to the Company’s restricted stock, restricted stock unit and performance stock unit awards. The weighted-average period over which that cost is expected to be recognized is approximately 1 year.See Note 9 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding accounting for share-based payments.Investments and DerivativesAlthough not directly recorded in the Company’s consolidated balance sheets, the Company's defined benefit pension plans hold investments of approximately $19.1 billion, which include private equity and other non-liquid investments. The fair value of the plan investments determines, in part, the over-or under-funded status of those plans, which is included in the Company’s consolidated balance sheets. The Company also has minority positions in certain equity securities (primarily Alexander Forbes), which are accounted for at fair value with gains or losses recorded as investment gains or losses in the consolidated statement of income. The Company also has approximately $111 million of investments in private equity funds accounted for using the equity method of accounting.The Company reviews the carrying value of its investments (both direct and held through its pension plans) to determine if any valuation adjustments are appropriate under the applicable accounting pronouncements. The Company bases its review on the facts and circumstances as they relate to each investment. In those instances where quoted market prices are not available, particularly for private equity funds, significant management judgment is required to determine the appropriate value of the Company’s investments. Fair value of investments in private equity funds is determined by the funds’ investment managers. Factors considered in determining the fair value of private equity investments include: implied valuation of recently completed financing rounds that included sophisticated outside investors; performance multiples of comparable public companies; restrictions on the sale or disposal of the investments; trading characteristics of the securities; and the relative size of the holdings in comparison to other private investors and the public market float. In connection with the JLT Transaction, the Company entered into several derivative contracts, described in Note 11 to the consolidated financial statements. These derivative contracts are recorded at fair value at the end of each period, with the change in fair value recorded in the consolidated statements of 56income. Prior to their settlement, determination of the fair value of these contracts, in particular the deal contingent foreign exchange contract, required significant management judgments or estimates about the potential closing dates of the transaction and remaining value of the deal contingency feature. All derivative contracts related to the JLT Transaction were settled during 2019.Purchase Price AllocationAssets acquired and liabilities assumed, including contingent consideration, as part of a business acquisition are generally recorded at their fair value at the date of acquisition. The excess of purchase price over the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed is recorded as goodwill. Determining fair value of identifiable assets, particularly intangibles, and liabilities acquired also requires management to make estimates, which are based on all available information and in some cases assumptions with respect to the timing and amount of future revenues and expenses associated with an asset. These estimates directly impact the amount of identified intangible assets recognized and the related amortization expense in future periods.New Accounting PronouncementsNote 1 to the consolidated financial statements contains a summary of the Company’s significant accounting policies, including a discussion of recently issued accounting pronouncements and their impact or potential future impact on the Company’s financial results, if determinable, under the sub-heading ""New Accounting Pronouncements"".Reconciliation of Non-GAAP MeasuresOn April 1, 2019, the Company completed its acquisition of JLT. JLT's results of operations for the year ended December 31, 2020 are included in the Company’s results of operations. JLT's results of operations for the three months ending March 31, 2019 are not included in the Company's results of operations for the twelve month period ended December 31, 2019. Prior to being acquired by the Company, JLT operated in three segments, Specialty, Reinsurance and Employee Benefits. As of April 1, 2019, the historical JLT businesses were combined into MMC operations as follows: JLT Specialty is included by geography within Marsh, JLT Reinsurance is included within Guy Carpenter and the majority of the JLT Employee Benefits business is included in Mercer Health and Wealth.The JLT Transaction had a significant impact on the Company’s results of operations in 2020. The Company believes that in addition to the change in reported GAAP revenue, a comparison of 2020 GAAP reported revenue to the combined 2019 revenue of MMC and JLT, as if the companies were combined on January 1, 2019, provides investors with meaningful information as to the Company’s year-over-year underlying operating results. Investors should not consider the comparison of these non-GAAP measures in isolation from, or as a substitute for, the financial information that the Company reports in accordance with GAAP.The ""2019 Including JLT"" revenue information set forth in the table below presents revenue information as if the companies were combined on January 1, 2019 and is not necessarily indicative of what the results would have been had we operated the business since January 1, 2019. The MMC revenue amounts are as previously reported by the Company in its annual filing of Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2019. JLT 2019 revenue information is derived using the same policies and adjustments as the ""JLT Supplemental Information - Revenue Analysis"" furnished to the SEC on June 6, 2019 on Form 8-K, which is not incorporated by reference in this Form 10-K, and includes the revenue from JLT’s aerospace business.57(In millions)For the Year Ended December 31, 2019MMC As Previously ReportedRisk & Insurance ServicesMarsh$8,014 Guy Carpenter1,480 Subtotal9,494 Fiduciary interest income105 Total Risk & Insurance Services9,599 ConsultingMercer5,021 Oliver Wyman Group2,122 Total Consulting7,143 Corporate eliminations(90)Total revenue$16,652 JLT 2019Specialty (Marsh)$232 Reinsurance (Guy Carpenter)118 Employee Benefits (Mercer)73 Subtotal423 Fiduciary interest income5 Total Revenue$428 2019 including JLTMarsh$8,246 Guy Carpenter1,598 Subtotal9,844 Fiduciary interest income110 Total Risk & Insurance Services9,954 ConsultingMercer5,094 Oliver Wyman Group2,122 Total Consulting7,216 Corporate eliminations(90)Total revenue including JLT$17,080 58Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market RiskMarket Risk and Credit RiskCertain of the Company’s revenues, expenses, assets and liabilities are exposed to the impact of interest rate changes and fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates and equity markets.Interest Rate Risk and Credit RiskInterest income generated from the Company’s cash investments as well as invested fiduciary funds will vary with the general level of interest rates.The Company had the following investments subject to variable interest rates: (In millions of dollars)December 31, 2020Cash and cash equivalents invested in money market funds, certificates of deposit and time deposits$2,089 Fiduciary cash and investments$8,585 Based on the above balances, if short-term interest rates increased or decreased by 10%, or 3 basis points, over the full year, annual interest income, including interest earned on fiduciary funds, would increase or decrease by approximately $2 million.In addition to interest rate risk, our cash investments and fiduciary fund investments are subject to potential loss of value due to counter-party credit risk. To minimize this risk, the Company and its subsidiaries invest pursuant to a Board approved investment policy. The policy mandates the preservation of principal and liquidity and requires broad diversification with counter-party limits assigned based primarily on credit rating and type of investment. The Company carefully monitors its cash and fiduciary fund investments and will further restrict the portfolio as appropriate to market conditions. The majority of cash and fiduciary fund investments are invested in short-term bank deposits and liquid money market funds.Foreign Currency RiskThe translated values of revenue and expense from the Company’s international operations are subject to fluctuations due to changes in currency exchange rates. The non-U.S. based revenue that is exposed to foreign exchange fluctuations is approximately 53% of total revenue. We periodically use forward contracts and options to limit foreign currency exchange rate exposure on net income and cash flows for specific, clearly defined transactions arising in the ordinary course of business. Although the Company has significant revenue generated in foreign locations which is subject to foreign exchange rate fluctuations, in most cases both the foreign currency revenue and expenses are in the functional currency of the foreign location. As such, under normal circumstances, the U.S. dollar translation of both the revenues and expenses, as well as the potentially offsetting movements of various currencies against the U.S. dollar, generally tends to mitigate the impact on net operating income of foreign currency risk. However, there have been periods where the impact was not mitigated due to external market factors, and external macroeconomic events may result in greater foreign exchange rate fluctuations in the future. If foreign exchange rates of major currencies (Euro, Sterling, Australian dollar and Canadian dollar) moved 10% in the same direction against the U.S. dollar compared with the foreign exchange rates in 2020, the Company estimates net operating income would increase or decrease by approximately $39 million. The Company has exposure to approximately 80 foreign currencies overall. In Continental Europe, the largest amount of revenue from renewals for the Risk & Insurance Services segment occurs in the first quarter. Equity Price RiskThe Company holds investments in both public and private companies as well as private equity funds, including investments of approximately $72 million that are valued using readily determinable fair values and approximately $33 million of investments without readily determinable fair values. The Company also has investments of approximately $280 million that are accounted for using the equity method. The investments are subject to risk of decline in market value, which, if determined to be other than temporary for assets without readily determinable fair values, could result in realized impairment losses. The 59Company periodically reviews the carrying value of such investments to determine if any valuation adjustments are appropriate under the applicable accounting pronouncements.At December 31, 2020, the Company owns approximately 14% of the common stock of AF, a South African company listed on the Johannesburg Stock Exchange. The investment in AF is accounted at fair value, with unrealized gains and losses recorded as investment income in the consolidated statement of income. The fair value of this investment at December 31, 2020 was approximately $54 million.OtherA number of lawsuits and regulatory proceedings are pending.

Business Update Related To COVID-19The World Health Organization declared COVID-19 a pandemic in March 2020. For almost two years, the pandemic has impacted businesses globally including virtually every geography in which the Company operates. Our businesses have been resilient throughout the pandemic and demand for our advice and services remains strong as the global economic conditions continue to improve. Although the majority of our colleagues continue to work remotely, the Company has provided guidelines on return to the office depending on the level of virus containment and local health and safety regulations in each geography. The safety and well-being of our colleagues is paramount and the Company expects to continue to service clients effectively in both the remote and in-office environments.The Company had strong revenue growth in 2021 and benefited from the continued recovery of the global economy. However, uncertainty remains in the economic outlook and the ultimate extent of the impact of COVID-19 to the Company will depend on future developments that it is unable to predict, including new ""waves"" of infection from emerging variants of the virus, potential renewed restrictions and mandates by various governments or agencies, and the distribution and uptake of vaccines and vaccine boosters. Acquisition of JLTOn April 1, 2019, the Company completed the acquisition (the ""Transaction"") of all of the outstanding shares of JLT, a public company organized under the laws of England and Wales. As of December 31, 2021, the Company has substantially integrated JLT into all of its business operations.After the acquisition of JLT, the Company assumed the legal liabilities of JLT’s litigation and regulatory exposures as of April 1, 2019. Please see Note 16, Claims, Lawsuits and Other Contingencies, in the notes to the consolidated financial statements, which discusses certain errors and omission matters related to the acquisition.JLT's results of operations for the period April 1, 2019 through December 31, 2019 are included in the Company’s results of operations for 2019. JLT's results of operations for the period January 1 through March 31, 2019 are not included in the Company's results of operations and therefore, affect comparability. The Company’s results for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019 were impacted by JLT related acquisition restructuring and integration costs as discussed in Note 14, Integration and Restructuring Costs, in the notes to the consolidated financial statements.38Consolidated Results of OperationsFor the Years Ended December 31,(In millions, except per share data)202120202019Revenue$19,820 $17,224 $16,652 ExpenseCompensation and benefits11,425 10,129 9,734 Other operating expenses4,083 4,029 4,241 Operating expenses15,508 14,158 13,975 Operating income$4,312 $3,066 $2,677 Income before income taxes$4,208 $2,793 $2,439 Net income before non-controlling interests$3,174 $2,046 $1,773 Net income attributable to the Company$3,143 $2,016 $1,742 Net income per share attributable to the Company– Basic$6.20 $3.98 $3.44 – Diluted$6.13 $3.94 $3.41 Average number of shares outstanding– Basic507 506 506 – Diluted513 512 511 Shares outstanding at December 31,504 508 504 Consolidated operating income increased $1.2 billion, or 41% to $4.3 billion in 2021 compared to $3.1 billion in 2020, reflecting a 15% increase in revenue and a 10% increase in expenses. Revenue growth was driven by increases in the Risk and Insurance Services and Consulting segments of 17% and 12%, respectively, reflecting the strong demand for our advice and services and the improvement in global economic conditions. The increase in expense is primarily due to increased headcount and higher incentive compensation. These increases were partially offset by a reduction in JLT integration costs and the JLT legacy E&O provision recorded in 2020.Diluted earnings per share increased 56% to $6.13 in 2021 compared with $3.94 in 2020. The increase is a result of higher operating income, lower interest expense and higher investment gains in 2021 compared to 2020. Results in 2021 also include a net charge of approximately $110 million related to the re-measurement of deferred tax assets and liabilities due to the enactment of a tax rate increase from 19% to 25% in the U.K. in the second quarter of 2021, offset by no tax impact on the gain from the re-measurement to fair value upon consolidation of the Company's previously held equity method investment in India, tax benefits from share-based compensation and planning that included the utilization of foreign tax credits and postponing the utilization of the losses in the U.K. to a future year when the tax rate will be 25%.39The following table summarizes restructuring and other items discussed in more detail below:For the Years Ended December 31,(In millions)202120202019Restructuring costs, excluding JLT$70 $89 $112 Changes in contingent consideration57 26 68 JLT integration and restructuring costs93 251 335 JLT acquisition-related costs and other81 54 150 JLT legacy E&O provision(69)161 — Legal claims 62 — — Gain on consolidation of business(267)— — Disposal of businesses(49)(8)1 Other— 5 8 Impact on operating income$(22)$578 $674 In 2021 and 2020, the Company’s results of operations and earnings per share were impacted by the following items:•Restructuring costs, excluding JLT: Includes severance, adjustments to restructuring liabilities for future rent under non-cancellable leases and other real estate exit costs, and restructuring costs related to the integration of recent acquisitions. These costs are discussed in more detail in Note 14, Integration and Restructuring, in the notes to the consolidated financial statements. •Changes in contingent consideration: Primarily includes the change in fair value of contingent consideration related to acquisitions and dispositions as measured each quarter. •JLT integration and restructuring costs: Includes severance, real estate and technology rationalization, process management consulting fees, and legal fees for the rationalization of legal entity structures. The Company has incurred JLT integration and restructuring costs of $679 million through 2021 and expects to incur the remaining $46 million in 2022, primarily related to real estate and technology, of which approximately $42 million will be cash expenditures. The Company has realized at least $425 million of annualized savings. These costs are discussed in more detail in Note 14, Integration and Restructuring, in the notes to the consolidated financial statements. The Company expects to complete the integration of JLT during 2022.•JLT acquisition-related costs and other: Includes retention and legal charges related to the acquisition of JLT. •JLT legacy E&O provision: In 2021, the Company recorded a $36 million reduction in the liability as well as $33 million of recoveries under indemnities for a legacy JLT Errors and Omissions (""E&O"") provision relating to suitability of financial advice provided to individuals for defined benefit pension transfers. The reduction in liability primarily reflects lower redress payments than previously estimated, partly offset by higher costs to review and calculate redress. In 2020, the Company recorded an increase in the liability of $161 million related to this matter. See Note 16, Claims, Lawsuits and Other Contingencies, in the notes to the consolidated financial statements.•Legal claims: The Company recorded settlement charges and legal costs related to strategic recruiting.•Gain on consolidation of business: In December 2021, the Company increased its ownership in Marsh India from 49% to 92%. Prior to the increase in ownership, the Company accounted for the investment under the equity method of accounting. In connection with the increased investment in Marsh India, the Company recorded a gain of $267 million, related to the re-measurement of its previously held investment to fair value.40•Disposal of businesses: During 2021, the Company disposed of certain businesses and recognized a net gain of approximately $50 million, primarily related to the commercial networks business in the U.K. that provided broking and back-office solutions for small independent brokers. Results in 2020 include a contingent gain adjustment from the U.S. large market health and defined benefit administration business disposed in 2019. Consolidated Revenue and ExpenseRevenue - Components of ChangeThe Company conducts business in 130 countries. As a result, foreign exchange rate movements may impact period-to-period comparisons of revenue. Similarly, certain other items such as the revenue impact of acquisitions and dispositions, including transfers among businesses, may impact period-to-period comparisons of revenue. Underlying revenue measures the change in revenue from one period to another by isolating these impacts. The impact of foreign currency exchange fluctuations, acquisitions and dispositions, including transfers among businesses, on the Company’s operating revenues by segment are as follows:Year EndedDecember 31,% Change GAAPRevenueComponents of Revenue Change*(In millions, except percentages)20212020Currency ImpactAcquisitions/Dispositions/ Other ImpactUnderlying RevenueRisk and Insurance ServicesMarsh$10,203 $8,595 19 %2 %6 %11 %Guy Carpenter1,867 1,696 10 %1 %— 9 %Subtotal12,070 10,291 17 %2 %5 %11 %Fiduciary Interest Income15 46 Total Risk and Insurance Services12,085 10,337 17 %2 %5 %10 %ConsultingMercer5,254 4,928 7 %3 %(1)%5 %Oliver Wyman Group2,535 2,048 24 %2 %— 21 %Total Consulting7,789 6,976 12 %3 %— 10 %Corporate Eliminations(54)(89)Total Revenue$19,820 $17,224 15 %2 %3 %10 %* Components of revenue change may not add due to rounding.41The following table provides more detailed revenue information for certain of the components presented above:Year EndedDecember 31,% Change GAAPRevenueComponents of Revenue Change*(In millions, except percentages)20212020Currency ImpactAcquisitions/ Dispositions/ Other ImpactUnderlying RevenueMarsh:EMEA$2,946 $2,575 14 %4 %1 %9 %Asia Pacific1,462 1,059 38 %4 %25 %9 %Latin America453 424 7 %(2)%— 9 %Total International4,861 4,058 20 %4 %7 %9 %U.S./Canada5,342 4,537 18 %1 %4 %13 %Total Marsh$10,203 $8,595 19 %2 %6 %11 %Mercer:Wealth2,509 2,348 7 %4 %(1)%4 %Health1,855 1,793 3 %1 %(1)%3 %Career890 787 13 %2 %— 12 %Total Mercer$5,254 $4,928 7 %3 %(1)%5 %* Components of revenue change may not add due to rounding.Consolidated RevenueConsolidated revenue increased $2.6 billion, or 15%, to $19.8 billion in 2021, compared to $17.2 billion in 2020. Consolidated revenue increased 10% on an underlying basis, 2% from the impact of foreign currency translation and 3% from acquisitions. On an underlying basis, revenue increased 10% for the year ended December 31, 2021 in both the Risk and Insurance Services and Consulting segments. Underlying growth in the Risk and Insurance Services and Consulting segments was driven by the strong demand for our advice and services and the improvement in global economic conditions.Consolidated Operating ExpenseConsolidated operating expenses increased $1.3 billion, or 10%, to $15.5 billion in 2021 compared to $14.2 billion in 2020, reflecting increases of 6% on an underlying basis, 2% from the impact of foreign currency translation and 1% from acquisitions. On an underlying basis, expenses increased 8% and 3% in 2021 in the Risk and Insurance Services and Consulting segments, respectively. Underlying expenses in 2021 is primarily due to increased headcount and higher incentive compensation.Risk and Insurance ServicesIn the Risk and Insurance Services segment, the Company’s subsidiaries and other affiliated entities act as brokers, agents or consultants for insureds, insurance underwriters and other brokers in the areas of risk management, insurance broking and insurance program management services, primarily under the name of Marsh, and engage in reinsurance broking, catastrophe and financial modeling services and related advisory functions, primarily under the name of Guy Carpenter.Marsh and Guy Carpenter are compensated for brokerage and consulting services through commissions and fees. Commission rates and fees vary in amount and can depend on a number of factors, including the type of insurance or reinsurance coverage provided, the particular insurer or reinsurer selected, and the capacity in which the broker acts and negotiates with clients. Revenues can be affected by premium rate levels in the insurance/reinsurance markets, the amount of risk retained by insurance and reinsurance clients and by the value of the risks that have been insured since commission-based compensation is frequently related to the premiums paid by insureds and reinsureds. In many cases, fee compensation may be negotiated in advance, based on the type of risk, coverage required and service provided by the Company and ultimately, the extent of the risk placed into the insurance market or retained by the client. The trends and comparisons of revenue from one period to the next can be affected by changes in premium rate levels, fluctuations in client risk retention and increases or decreases in the 42value of risks that have been insured, as well as new and lost business, and the volume of business from new and existing clients.In addition to compensation from its clients, Marsh also receives other compensation, separate from retail fees and commissions, from insurance companies. This other compensation includes, among other things, payment for consulting and analytics services provided to insurers; compensation for administrative and other services (including fees for underwriting services and services provided to or on behalf of insurers relating to the administration and management of quota shares, panels and other facilities in which insurers participate); and contingent commissions, which are paid by insurers based on factors such as volume or profitability of Marsh's placements, primarily driven by MMA and parts of Marsh's international operations. Marsh and Guy Carpenter receive interest income on certain funds (such as premiums and claims proceeds) held in a fiduciary capacity for others. The investment of fiduciary funds is regulated by state and other insurance authorities. These regulations typically require segregation of fiduciary funds and limit the types of investments that may be made with them. Interest income from these investments varies depending on the amount of funds invested and applicable interest rates, both of which vary from time to time. For presentation purposes, fiduciary interest is segregated from the other revenues of Marsh and Guy Carpenter and separately presented within the segment, as shown in the previous revenue by segments tables.The results of operations for the Risk and Insurance Services segment are presented below: (In millions, except percentages)202120202019Revenue$12,085 $10,337 $9,599 Compensation and benefits6,506 5,690 5,370 Other operating expenses2,499 2,301 2,396 Operating expenses9,005 7,991 7,766 Operating income$3,080 $2,346 $1,833 Operating income margin25.5 %22.7 %19.1 %RevenueRevenue in the Risk and Insurance Services segment increased $1.7 billion, or 17%, to $12.1 billion in 2021 compared with $10.3 billion in 2020. Revenue grew 10% on an underlying basis, 5% from the impact of acquisitions, and 2% related to the impact of foreign currency translation. The increase in underlying revenue was primarily due to strong growth in new business, solid retention, and benefits from pricing in the marketplace.In Marsh, revenue increased $1.6 billion, or 19%, to $10.2 billion in 2021 compared to $8.6 billion in 2020. This reflects increases of 11% on an underlying basis, 6% from the impact of acquisitions, and 2% from the impact of foreign currency translation. In 2021, the increase in revenue from acquisitions reflects the gain of $267 million related to the re-measurement of the previously held equity method investment in Marsh India. On an underlying basis, U.S./Canada rose 13%. Total International operations, which includes Asia Pacific, Latin America and EMEA each produced underlying revenue growth of 9% compared to prior year.At Guy Carpenter, revenue increased $171 million, or 10%, to $1.9 billion in 2021 compared with $1.7 billion in 2020. On an underlying basis, revenue increased 9%.The Risk and Insurance Services segment completed eight acquisitions during 2021. Information regarding those acquisitions is included in Note 5, Acquisitions and Dispositions, in the notes to the consolidated financial statements.Operating ExpenseExpense in the Risk and Insurance Services segment increased $1.0 billion, or 13%, to $9.0 billion in 2021 compared with $8.0 billion in 2020. This reflects increases of 8% on an underlying basis, 2% from the impact of foreign currency, and 2% from acquisitions. The increase in underlying expense reflects increased headcount and higher incentive compensation, partly offset by lower JLT integration and restructuring costs.43ConsultingThe Company conducts business in its Consulting segment through Mercer and Oliver Wyman Group. Mercer delivers advice and solutions that help organizations create a dynamic world of work, shaperetirement and investment outcomes, and unlock health and well being for a changing workforce. OliverWyman serves as critical strategic, economic and brand advisor to private sector and governmentalclients.The major component of revenue in the Consulting business is fees paid by clients for advice and services. Mercer, principally through its health line of business, also earns revenue in the form of commissions received from insurance companies for the placement of group (and occasionally individual) insurance contracts, primarily life, health and accident coverages. Revenue for Mercer’s investment management business and certain of Mercer’s defined contribution administration services consists principally of fees based on assets under management or administration. For a majority of the Mercer managed investment funds, revenue is recorded on a gross basis with sub-advisor fees included in other operating expenses.Revenue in the Consulting segment is affected by, among other things, global economic conditions, including changes in clients’ particular industries and markets. Revenue is also affected by competition due to the introduction of new products and services, broad trends in employee demographics, including levels of employment, the effect of government policies and regulations, and fluctuations in interest and foreign exchange rates. Revenues from investment management services and retirement trust and administrative services are significantly affected by the level of assets under management or administration, which is impacted by securities market performance.The results of operations for the Consulting segment are presented below: (In millions, except percentages)202120202019Revenue$7,789 $6,976 $7,143 Compensation and benefits4,435 3,995 3,934 Other operating expenses1,850 1,987 1,999 Operating expenses6,285 5,982 5,933 Operating income$1,504 $994 $1,210 Operating income margin19.3 %14.3 %16.9 %RevenueConsulting revenue increased $813 million, or 12%, to $7.8 billion in 2021 compared with $7.0 billion in 2020. This reflects increases of 10% on an underlying basis and 3% from the impact of foreign currency translation.Mercer's revenue increased $326 million, or 7%, to $5.3 billion in 2021 compared to $4.9 billion in 2020, or 5% on an underlying basis. Revenue also reflects an increase of 3% from the impact of foreign currency translation offset by a decrease of 1% from disposition of businesses. On an underlying basis, revenue for Career, Wealth and Health increased 12%, 4% and 3%, respectively. The increase in underlying revenue at Mercer for the year ended December 31, 2021 was due to higher investment management fees from growth in assets under management and increased demand and retention for Health and Career products and services.Oliver Wyman Group's revenue increased $487 million, or 24%, to $2.5 billion in 2021 compared with $2.0 billion in 2020, reflecting an increase of 21% on an underlying basis and 2% from the impact of foreign currency translation. The increase in underlying revenue at Oliver Wyman for the year ended December 31, 2021 primarily reflects the impact of increased demand for project-based services across all industries.The Consulting segment completed one acquisition during 2021. Information regarding the acquisition is included in Note 5, Acquisitions and Dispositions, in the notes to the consolidated financial statements.44Operating ExpenseConsulting expenses increased $303 million, or 5%, to $6.3 billion in 2021 compared to $6.0 billion in 2020. This reflects an increase of 3% on an underlying basis and 2% from the impact of foreign currency translation. The increase in underlying expense in the Consulting segment in 2021 is primarily due to increased headcount and higher incentive compensation. This is partially offset by a $69 million reduction in the legacy JLT E&O provision including recoveries under indemnities. In 2020, the Company recorded an increase in the liability of $161 million for the same matter. Corporate and OtherCorporate expense in 2021 was $272 million compared with $274 million in 2020. Expenses decreased 1% on an underlying basis due to lower integration and restructuring costs primarily related to the JLT Transaction and savings realized from the completion of integration efforts to date, partly offset by higher headcount and incentive compensation.Other Corporate ItemsInterestInterest expense decreased $71 million to $444 million in 2021 compared to $515 million in 2020 due to lower average debt levels in 2021 compared to the prior year. Investment Income (Loss) The caption ""Investment income (loss)"" in the consolidated statements of income comprises realized and unrealized gains and losses from investments. It includes, when applicable, other than temporary declines in the value of securities, mark-to-market increases or decreases in equity investments with readily determinable fair values and equity method gains or losses on its investments in private equity funds. The Company's investments may include direct investments in insurance, consulting or other strategically linked companies, and private equity funds.The Company recorded net investment income of $61 million in 2021 compared to a net investment loss of $22 million in 2020. The income in 2021 is primarily driven by gains in the Company's private equity investments. The loss in 2020 was primarily due to a loss from the sale of shares of Alexander Forbes (""AF""). Income TaxesThe Company's consolidated effective tax rate was 24.6% and 26.7% in 2021 and 2020, respectively. The rates in all periods reflect the effects of tax planning and the impact of regulatory and other guidance as it became available.The rate for the year ended December 31, 2021 reflects:•The charge for re-measuring the Company’s U.K. deferred tax assets and liabilities upon the enactment of legislation on June 10, 2021, commonly referred to as the ""Finance Act 2021."" The legislation increased the U.K. corporate income tax rate from 19% to 25% effective April 1, 2023. This is the most significant discrete item in the year-to-date period, increasing the Company’s effective tax rate by 2.6% for the year ended December 31, 2021. •The tax effect of the gain from the fair value re-measurement of the Company’s previously held equity method investment in Marsh India upon the Company increasing its ownership interest from 49% to 92%. The Company has indefinitely reinvested this gain, as it has no intent to dispose of the business, and did not record tax on the gain. This decreased the Company’s effective tax rate by 1.5% for the year ended December 31, 2021.•Tax benefits from planning implemented in the period that postponed the utilization of losses in the U.K. to a future year when the tax rate will be 25%.The tax rate in 2020 includes a valuation allowance for certain tax credits, the impact of uncertain tax positions, and certain tax planning benefits. The rate in 2020 also reflects costs of re-measuring the Company’s U.K. deferred tax assets and liabilities upon the enactment of legislation that cancelled a 2% reduction in the U.K. corporate income tax rate, partially offset by tax benefits for the implementation of a new international funding structure to facilitate global staffing and contracting. 45The tax rates in all periods reflect the impact of discrete tax matters such as excess tax benefits related to share-based compensation, enacted tax legislation, changes in uncertain tax positions, deferred tax adjustments and non-taxable adjustments to contingent acquisition consideration. The effective tax rate may vary significantly from period to period for the foreseeable future. The effective tax rate is sensitive to the geographic mix of earnings and repatriation of the Company's earnings, which may result in higher or lower tax rates. In 2021, pre-tax income in the U.K., Barbados, Canada, Ireland, Bermuda, and Australia accounted for approximately 60% of the Company's total non-U.S. pre-tax income, with effective rates in those countries of 21% (excluding the non-cash deferred tax impact of U.K. tax legislation enacted in 2021), 1%, 27%, 17%, 0.3% and 16%, respectively.In addition, losses in certain jurisdictions cannot be offset by earnings from other operations, and may require valuation allowances that affect the rate, depending on estimates of the value of associated deferred tax assets which can be realized. A valuation allowance was recorded to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount that the Company believes is more likely than not to be realized. Details are provided in Note 7, Income Taxes, in the notes to the consolidated financial statements. The effective tax rate is also sensitive to changes in unrecognized tax benefits, including the impact of settled tax audits and expired statutes of limitation. Changes in tax laws, rulings, policies or related legal and regulatory interpretations occur frequently and may also have significant favorable or adverse impacts on our effective tax rate. As a U.S. domiciled parent holding company, the Company is the issuer of essentially all of the Company's external indebtedness, and incurs the related interest expense in the U.S. The Company’s interest expense deductions are not currently limited. Further, most senior executive and oversight functions are conducted in the U.S. and the associated costs are incurred primarily in the U.S. Some of these expenses may not be deductible in the U.S., which may impact the effective tax rate.The quasi-territorial tax regime provides an opportunity for the Company to repatriate foreign earnings more tax efficiently and there is less incentive for permanent reinvestment of these earnings. However, permanent reinvestment continues to be a component of the Company’s global capital strategy. The Company continues to evaluate its global investment and repatriation strategy in light of our capital requirements and potential costs of repatriation.The Coronavirus Aid, Relief and Economic Security Act (the ""CARES Act"") was signed into law on March 27, 2020. The CARES Act provided over $2 trillion in economic relief to individuals, governmental agencies and companies, to deal with the public health and economic impacts of COVID-19. Pursuant to the CARES Act, the Company deferred payroll taxes due from March 27, 2020 through December 31, 2020 and paid 50% in 2021 and will pay the remaining 50% in 2022. Liquidity and Capital ResourcesThe Company is organized as a legal entity separate and distinct from its operating subsidiaries. As the Company does not have significant operations of its own, the Company is dependent upon dividends and other payments from its operating subsidiaries to pay principal and interest on its outstanding debt obligations, pay dividends to stockholders, repurchase its shares and pay corporate expenses. The Company can also provide financial support to its operating subsidiaries for acquisitions, investments and certain parts of their business that require liquidity, such as the capital markets business of Guy Carpenter. Other sources of liquidity include borrowing facilities in financing cash flows.The Company derives a significant portion of its revenue and operating profit from operating subsidiaries located outside of the U.S. Funds from those operating subsidiaries are regularly repatriated to the U.S. out of annual earnings. At December 31, 2021, the Company had approximately $737 million of cash and cash equivalents in its foreign operations, which includes $280 million of operating funds required to be maintained for regulatory requirements or as collateral under certain captive insurance arrangements. The Company expects to continue its practice of repatriating available funds from its non-U.S. operating subsidiaries out of current annual earnings. Where appropriate, a portion of the current year earnings will continue to be permanently reinvested.During 2021, the Company recorded foreign currency translation adjustments which decreased net equity by $389 million. Continued weakening of the U.S. dollar against foreign currencies would further increase the translated U.S. dollar value of the Company’s net investments in its non-U.S. subsidiaries, as well as 46the translated U.S. dollar value of cash repatriations from those subsidiaries. Conversely, strengthening of the U.S. dollar against foreign currencies would decrease the translated U.S. dollar value of the Company’s net investments in its non-U.S. subsidiaries, as well as the translated U.S. dollar value of cash repatriations from those subsidiaries.Cash and cash equivalents on our consolidated balance sheets includes funds available for general corporate purposes. Funds held on behalf of clients in a fiduciary capacity are segregated and shown separately in the consolidated balance sheets as an offset to fiduciary liabilities. Fiduciary funds cannot be used for general corporate purposes, and should not be considered as a source of liquidity for the Company.Operating Cash FlowsThe Company generated $3.5 billion of cash from operations in 2021 and $3.4 billion in 2020. These amounts reflect the net income of the Company during those periods, excluding gains or losses from investments, adjusted for non-cash charges and changes in working capital which relate primarily to the timing of payments of accrued liabilities or receipts of assets and pension contributions. Pension-Related ItemsContributionsDuring 2021, the Company contributed $35 million to its U.S. pension plans and $95 million to non-U.S. pension plans compared to contributions of $65 million to U.S. plans and $78 million to non-U.S. plans in 2020.In the U.S., contributions to the tax-qualified defined benefit plans are based on ERISA guidelines and the Company generally expects to maintain a funded status of 80% or more of the liability determined in accordance with the ERISA guidelines. In 2021, the Company made $30 million of contributions to non-qualified plans and $5 million to its qualified plans. The Company expects to contribute approximately $31 million to its non-qualified U.S. pension plans in 2022. The Company is not required to make any contributions to its U.S. qualified plan in 2022.Outside the U.S., the Company has a large number of non-U.S. defined benefit pension plans, the largest of which are in the U.K., which comprise approximately 81% of non-U.S. plan assets at December 31, 2021. Contribution rates for non-U.S. plans are generally based on local funding practices and statutory requirements, which may differ significantly from measurements under U.S. GAAP. The Company contributed $55 million to its U.K. plans in 2021. The Company's contributions to its U.K. plans in 2022 are expected to be approximately $124 million.In the U.K., the assumptions used to determine pension contributions are the result of legally-prescribed negotiations between the Company and the plans' trustee that typically occur every three years in conjunction with the actuarial valuation of the plans. Currently, this results in a lower funded statuscompared to U.S. GAAP and may result in contributions irrespective of the U.S. GAAP funded status.During 2021, the JLT Pension Scheme was merged into the MMC U.K. Pension Fund with a new segregated JLT section created. The Company made deficit contributions of $38 million to the JLT section in 2021 and is expected to make contributions totaling approximately $112 million in 2022. The funding level of the JLT section will be reassessed during 2022 to determine contributions in 2023 and onwards. For the MMC U.K. Pension Fund, excluding the JLT section, an agreement was reached with the trustee in fourth quarter of 2019 based on the surplus funding position at December 31, 2018. In accordance with the agreement, no deficit funding is required until 2023. The funding level will be re-assessed during 2022 as part of the December 31, 2021 actuarial valuation to determine if contributions are required in 2023. As part of a long-term strategy which depends on having greater influence over asset allocation and overall investment decisions, in November 2019, the Company renewed its agreement to support annual deficit contributions by the U.K. operating companies under certain circumstances, up to £450 million over a seven-year period. In the aggregate, the Company expects to contribute approximately $147 million to its non-U.S. defined benefit plans in 2022, comprising approximately $124 million to the U.K. plans and $23 million to plans outside of the U.K. 47Changes in Funded Status and ExpenseThe year-over-year change in the funded status of the Company's pension plans is impacted by the difference between actual and assumed results, particularly with regard to return on assets, and changes in the discount rate, as well as the amount of Company contributions, if any. Unrecognized actuarial losses were approximately $1.8 billion and $2.9 billion at December 31, 2021 for the U.S. plans and non-U.S. plans, respectively, compared with losses of $2.4 billion and $3.5 billion at December 31, 2020. The decreases in both the U.S. and non-U.S. plans were primarily due to an increase in the discount rate used to measure plan liabilities and an increase in asset values. In the past several years, the amount of unamortized losses has been significantly impacted, both positively and negatively, by actual asset performance and changes in discount rates. The discount rate used to measure plan liabilities in 2021 increased in the U.S. and U.K., the Company's largest plans, following decreases in 2020 and 2019. An increase in the discount rate decreases the measured plan benefit obligation, resulting in actuarial gains, while a decrease in the discount rate increases the measured plan obligation, resulting in actuarial losses. During 2021, the Company's defined benefit pension plan assets had gains of 13.2% and 1.9% in the U.S. and U.K., respectively, as compared to gains of 13.1% and 12.0% in the U.S. and U.K., respectively, in 2020. Overall, based on the measurement at December 31, 2021, net benefit credits related to the Company’s defined benefit plans are expected to decrease in 2022 by approximately $23 million compared to 2021, reflecting a decrease in non-U.S. plans of approximately $40 million, offset by an increase in U.S. plans of $17 million. The Company’s accounting policies for its defined benefit pension plans, including the selection of and sensitivity to assumptions, are discussed in Management’s Discussion of Critical Accounting Policies. For additional information regarding the Company’s retirement plans, see Note 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, and Note 8, Retirement Benefits, in the notes to the consolidated financial statements.Financing Cash FlowsNet cash used for financing activities was $1.3 billion in 2021 compared with $925 million used by financing activities in 2020.Credit FacilitiesOn April 2, 2021, the Company entered into an amended and restated multi-currency unsecured $2.8 billion five-year revolving credit facility (""New Facility""). The interest rate on the New Facility is based on LIBOR plus a fixed margin which varies with the Company’s credit ratings. The New Facility expires in April 2026 and requires the Company to maintain certain coverage and leverage ratios which are tested quarterly. The New Facility includes provisions for determining a LIBOR successor rate in the event LIBOR reference rates are no longer available or in certain other circumstances which are determined to make using an alternative rate desirable. As of December 31, 2021, the Company had no borrowings under this facility. In connection with the New Facility, the Company terminated its previous multicurrency unsecured $1.8 billion five-year revolving credit facility and its unsecured $1.0 billion 364-day unsecured revolving credit facility.In January 2020, the Company entered into two new term loan facilities: a $500 million one-year facility and a $500 million two-year facility. During 2020, the Company borrowed and repaid $1.0 billion against these facilities. These two facilities were terminated as of December 31, 2020 after repayment of the initial draw down.The Company also maintains other credit facilities, guarantees and letters of credit with various banks, aggregating $508 million at December 31, 2021 and $573 million at December 31, 2020. There were no outstanding borrowings under these facilities as of December 31, 2021 or as of December 31, 2020.DebtOn April 9, 2021, the Company increased its short-term commercial paper financing program to $2.0 billion from $1.5 billion. The Company had no commercial paper outstanding at December 31, 2021.In December 2021, the Company issued $400 million of 2.375% senior notes due 2031 and $350 million of 2.90% senior notes due 2051. The Company used the net proceeds from these issuances for general 48corporate purposes and repaid $500 million of 2.75% senior notes with an original maturity date of January 2022 in December 2021.On April 15, 2021, the Company repaid $500 million of senior notes maturing in July 2021.In December 2020, the Company repaid $700 million of maturing senior notes and $300 million of floating rate notes with an original maturity of December 2021.In May 2020, the Company issued $750 million of 2.250% senior notes due 2030. The Company used the net proceeds from this offering to pay outstanding borrowings under the revolving credit facility.In March 2020, the Company repaid $500 million of maturing senior notes.The Company's senior debt is currently rated A- by Standard & Poor's and Baa1 by Moody's. The Company's short-term debt is currently rated A-2 by Standard & Poor's and P-2 by Moody's. The Company carries a Stable outlook with both Standard & Poor's and Moody's.Share RepurchasesIn November 2019, the Board of Directors authorized an increase in the Company’s share repurchase program, which supersedes any prior authorization, allowing management to buy back up to $2.5 billion of the Company’s common stock. During 2021, the Company repurchased 7.9 million shares of its common stock for total consideration of approximately $1.2 billion. As of December 31, 2021, the Company remained authorized to purchase shares of its common stock up to a value of approximately $1.3 billion. There is no time limit on this authorization.The Company did not repurchase any of its common stock during 2020. DividendsThe Company paid total dividends of $1.0 billion in 2021 ($2.00 per share) and $943 million in 2020 ($1.84 per share).Contingent Payments Related To AcquisitionsThe classification of contingent consideration payments in the consolidated statement of cash flows is dependent upon whether the receipt, payment, or adjustment was part of the initial liability established on the acquisition date (financing) or an adjustment to the acquisition date liability (operating). The following amounts are included in the consolidated statements of cash flows as operating and financing activities:For the Years Ended December 31,(In millions)202120202019Operating:Contingent consideration payments$(49)$(48)$(41)Prior years' dispositions cash received19 — — Acquisition related net charge for adjustments57 26 68 Adjustments and payments related to contingent consideration$27 $(22)$27 Financing:Contingent purchase consideration $(28)$(54)$(22)Deferred purchase consideration related to prior years' acquisitions (89)(68)(43)Payments of deferred and contingent consideration for acquisitions$(117)$(122)$(65) Receipt of contingent consideration related to prior years' dispositions$71 $— $— 49DerivativesNet Investment HedgeThe Company has investments in various subsidiaries with Euro functional currencies. As a result, the Company is exposed to the risk of fluctuations between the Euro and U.S. dollar exchange rates. As part of its risk management program to fund the JLT acquisition, the Company issued €1.1 billion Senior Notes, and designated the debt instruments as a net investment hedge of its Euro denominated subsidiaries. The hedge is re-assessed each quarter to confirm that the designated equity balance at the beginning of each period continues to equal or exceed 80% of the outstanding balance of the Euro debt instrument and that all the critical terms of the hedging instrument and the hedged net investment continue to match. If the hedge is highly effective, the change in the debt balance related to foreign exchange fluctuations will be recorded in foreign currency translation gains (losses) in the consolidated balance sheet. The U.S. dollar value of the Euro notes decreased by $100 million during 2021 related to the change in foreign exchange rates. The Company concluded that the hedge was highly effective and recorded a decrease to accumulated other comprehensive loss for the year ended December 31, 2021.Fiduciary LiabilitiesSince cash and cash equivalents held in a fiduciary capacity are not available for corporate use, they are shown in the consolidated balance sheet as an offset to fiduciary liabilities. Financing cash flows reflect an increase of $1.2 billion and $955 million in 2021 and 2020, respectively, related to the increase in fiduciary liabilities.Investing Cash FlowsNet cash used for investing activities amounted to $1.2 billion in 2021 compared with $793 million used for investing activities in 2020.The Company paid $859 million and $647 million, net of cash, cash equivalents and cash and cash equivalents held in a fiduciary capacity acquired, for acquisitions it made during 2021 and 2020, respectively, including the Company's increased ownership interest in Marsh India from 49% to 92% in December 2021.During 2021 and 2020, the Company sold certain businesses, primarily in the U.S. and U.K., for cash proceeds of approximately $84 million and $98 million, respectively. The Company sold 242 million shares of the common stock of AF during 2020.The Company’s additions to fixed assets and capitalized software, which amounted to $406 million in 2021 and $348 million in 2020, primarily related to computer equipment purchases, the refurbishing and modernizing of office facilities, and software development costs.The Company has commitments for potential future investments of approximately $52 million in six private equity funds that invest primarily in financial services companies.Commitments and ObligationsThe following sets forth the Company’s future contractual obligations by the types identified in the table below as of December 31, 2021:Payment due by PeriodContractual Obligations(In millions)TotalWithin1 Year1-3Years4-5YearsAfter 5YearsCurrent portion of long-term debt$17 $17 $— $— $— Long-term debt11,002 — 2,236 1,762 7,004 Interest on long-term debt5,222 412 763 616 3,431 Net operating leases2,499 389 657 529 924 Service agreements325 209 84 26 6 Other long-term obligations631 209 402 18 2 Total$19,696 $1,236 $4,142 $2,951 $11,367 50The above table does not include the liability for unrecognized tax benefits of $94 million as the Company is unable to reasonably predict the timing of settlement of these liabilities, other than approximately $34 million that may become payable during 2022. The above does not include the remaining transitional tax payments related to the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (""TCJA"") of $62 million, which will be paid in installments beginning in 2023 through 2026. Management’s Discussion of Critical Accounting Policies and EstimatesManagement makes estimates and judgments that affect reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue and expenses, and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. Management considers the policies discussed below to be critical to understanding the Company’s financial statements because their application places the most significant demands on management’s judgment, and requires management to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain. Actual results may differ from those estimates.Revenue RecognitionIn the Risk and Insurance Services segment, judgments related to the amount of variable revenue consideration to ultimately be received on placement of quota share reinsurance treaties and contingent commission from insurers, which was previously recognized when the contingency was resolved, now requires significant judgments and estimates.Management also makes significant judgments and estimates to measure the progress toward completing performance obligations and realization rates for consideration related to contracts as well as potential performance-based fees in the Consulting segment.The Company capitalizes the incremental costs to obtain contracts primarily related to commissions or sales bonus payments. These deferred costs are amortized over the expected life of the underlying customer relationships. The Company also capitalizes certain pre-placement costs that are considered fulfillment costs that are amortized at a point in time when the associated revenue is recognized.See Note 2, Revenue, in the notes to the consolidated financial statements for additional information.Legal and Other Loss ContingenciesThe Company and its subsidiaries are subject to numerous claims, lawsuits and proceedings including claims for errors and omissions (""E&O""). The Company records a liability when a loss is both probable and reasonably estimable which requires significant management judgment. The Company utilizes case level reviews by inside and outside counsel, an internal actuarial analysis by Oliver Wyman, a subsidiary of the Company, and other methods to estimate potential losses. The liability is reviewed quarterly and adjusted as developments warrant. In many cases, the Company has not recorded a liability, other than for legal fees to defend the claim, because we are unable, at the present time, to make a determination that a loss is both probable and reasonably estimable. Given the unpredictability of E&O claims and of litigation that could arise from such claims, it is possible that an adverse outcome in a particular matter could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s businesses, results of operations, financial condition or cash flow in a given quarterly or annual period.In addition, to the extent that insurance coverage is available, significant management judgment is required to determine the amount of recoveries that are probable of collection under the Company’s various insurance programs.Retirement BenefitsThe Company maintains qualified and non-qualified defined benefit pension and defined contribution plans for its eligible U.S. employees and a variety of defined benefit and defined contribution plans for its eligible non-U.S. employees. The Company’s policy for funding its tax-qualified defined benefit retirement plans is to contribute amounts at least sufficient to meet the funding requirements set forth in U.S. and applicable foreign laws.The Company recognizes the funded status of its over-funded defined benefit pension and retiree medical plans as a net benefit plan asset and its unfunded and underfunded plans as a net benefit plan liability. The gains or losses and prior service costs or credits that have not been recognized as components of net periodic costs are recorded as a component of Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income (""AOCI""), 51net of tax, in the Company’s consolidated balance sheets. The gains and losses that exceed specified corridors, 10% of the greater of the projected benefit obligation or the market-related value of plan assets, are amortized prospectively out of AOCI over a period that approximates the remaining life expectancy of participants in plans where substantially all participants are inactive or the average remaining service period of active participants for plans with active participants. The vast majority of unrecognized losses relate to inactive plans and are amortized over the remaining life expectancy of the participants.The determination of net periodic pension cost is based on a number of assumptions, including an expected long-term rate of return on plan assets, the discount rate, mortality and assumed rate of salary increase. The assumptions used in the calculation of net periodic pension costs and pension liabilities are disclosed in Note 8, Retirement Benefits, in the notes to the consolidated financial statements. The long-term rate of return on plan assets assumption is determined for each plan based on the facts and circumstances that exist as of the measurement date, and the specific portfolio mix of each plan’s assets. The Company utilizes a model developed by Mercer, a subsidiary of the Company, to assist in the determination of this assumption. The model takes into account several factors, including: target portfolio allocation; investment, administrative and trading expenses incurred directly by the plan trust; historical portfolio performance; relevant forward-looking economic analysis; and expected returns, variances and correlations for different asset classes. These measures are used to determine probabilities using standard statistical techniques to calculate a range of expected returns on the portfolio.The target asset allocation for the U.S. plans is 60% equities and equity alternatives and 40% fixed income. At the end of 2021, the actual allocation for the U.S. plans was 65% equities and equity alternatives and 35% fixed income. The target asset allocation for the U.K. plans, which comprise approximately 81% of non-U.S. plan assets, is 26% equities and equity alternatives and 74% fixed income. At the end of 2021, the actual allocation for the U.K. plans was 28% equities and equity alternatives and 72% fixed income. The discount rate selected for each U.S. plan is based on a model bond portfolio with coupons and redemptions that closely match the expected liability cash flows from the plan. Discount rates for non-U.S. plans are based on appropriate bond indices adjusted for duration; in the U.K., the plan duration is reflected using the Mercer yield curve.The following table shows the weighted average assumed rate of return and the discount rate at the December 31, 2021 measurement date used to measure pension expense in 2022 for the total Company, the U.S. and the Rest of World (""ROW"").Total CompanyU.S.ROWAssumed rate of return on plan assets4.56 %6.88 %3.64 %Discount rate2.28 %3.00 %1.89 %Holding all other assumptions constant, a half-percentage point change in the rate of return on plan assets and discount rate assumptions would affect net periodic pension cost for the U.S. and U.K. plans, which together comprise approximately 86% of total pension plan liabilities, as follows:0.5 PercentagePoint Increase0.5 PercentagePoint Decrease(In millions)U.S.U.K.U.S.U.K.Assumed rate of return on plan assets$(24)$(54)$24 $54 Discount Rate$3 $3 $(4)$(4)The impact of discount rate changes relates to the increase or decrease in actuarial gains or losses being amortized through net periodic pension cost, as well as the increase or decrease in interest expense, with all other facts and assumptions held constant. It does not contemplate nor include potential future impacts a change in the interest rate environment and discount rates might cause, such as the impact on the market value of the plans’ assets. In addition, the assumed return on plan assets would likely be impacted by changes in the interest rate environment and other factors, including equity valuations, since these factors reflect the starting point used in the Company’s projection models. For example, a reduction in interest rates may result in a reduction in the assumed return on plan assets. Changing the discount rate 52and leaving the other assumptions constant also may not be representative of the impact on expense, because the long-term rates of inflation and salary increases are often correlated with the discount rate. Changes in these assumptions will not necessarily have a linear impact on the net periodic pension cost.The Company contributes to certain health care and life insurance benefits provided to its retired employees. The cost of these post-retirement benefits for employees in the U.S. is accrued during the period up to the date employees are eligible to retire but is funded by the Company as incurred. The key assumptions and sensitivity to changes in the assumed health care cost trend rate are discussed in Note 8, Retirement Benefits, in the notes to the consolidated financial statements. Income TaxesSignificant judgment is required in determining the annual effective tax rate and in evaluating uncertain tax positions. The Company reports a liability for unrecognized tax benefits resulting from uncertain tax positions taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. The evaluation of a tax position is a two-step process:•First, the Company determines whether it is more-likely-than-not a tax position will be sustained upon tax examination, including resolution of any related appeals or litigation, based on only the technical merits of the position. If a tax position does not meet the more-likely-than-not recognition threshold, the benefit of that position is not recognized in the financial statements. •The second step is measurement. A tax position that meets the more-likely-than-not recognition threshold is measured to determine the amount of benefit to recognize in the financial statements. The tax position is measured as the largest amount of benefit that is greater than 50-percent likely of being realized upon ultimate resolution with a taxing authority. Uncertain tax positions are evaluated based upon the facts and circumstances that exist at each reporting period and involve significant management judgment. Subsequent changes in judgment based upon new information may lead to changes in recognition, de-recognition, and measurement. Adjustments may result, for example, upon resolution of an issue with the taxing authorities, or expiration of a statute of limitations barring an assessment for an issue. The Company recognizes interest and penalties, if any, related to unrecognized tax benefits in income tax expense. The Company’s accounting policy follows the portfolio approach that leaves stranded income tax effects in AOCI. Certain items are included in the Company's tax returns at different times than the items are reflected in the financial statements. As a result, the annual tax expense reflected in the consolidated statements of income is different than that reported in the tax returns. Some of these differences are permanent, such as non-deductible expenses, and some differences are temporary and reverse over time, such as depreciation expense. Temporary differences create deferred tax assets and liabilities, which are measured at existing tax rates. Deferred tax liabilities generally represent tax expense recognized in the financial statements for which payment has been deferred, or expense for which a deduction has been taken already in the tax return but the expense has not yet been recognized in the financial statements. Deferred tax assets generally represent items that can be used as a tax deduction or credit in tax returns in future years for which a benefit has already been recorded in the financial statements. The Company evaluates all significant available positive and negative evidence, including the existence of losses in recent years and its forecast of future taxable income by jurisdiction, in assessing the need for a valuation allowance. The Company also considers tax planning strategies that would result in realization of deferred tax assets, and the presence of taxable income in prior period tax filings in jurisdictions that allow for the carry back of tax attributes pursuant to the applicable tax law. The underlying assumptions the Company uses in forecasting future taxable income require significant judgment and take into account the Company's recent performance. The ultimate realization of deferred tax assets is dependent on the generation of future taxable income during the periods in which temporary differences or carry-forwards are deductible or creditable. Valuation allowances are established for deferred tax assets when it is estimated that it is more-likely-than-not that future taxable income will be insufficient to fully use a deduction or credit in that jurisdiction.53Fair Value DeterminationsGoodwill Impairment Testing – The Company is required to assess goodwill and any indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment annually, or more frequently if circumstances indicate impairment may have occurred. The Company performs the annual impairment assessment for each of its reporting units during the third quarter of each year. A company can assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is necessary to perform a quantitative goodwill impairment test. Alternatively, the Company may elect to proceed directly to the quantitative goodwill impairment test. In 2021, the Company elected to perform a qualitative impairment assessment. As part of its assessment, the Company considered numerous factors, including:•that the fair value of each reporting unit exceeds its carrying value by a substantial margin based on its most recent quantitative assessment in 2019; •whether significant acquisitions or dispositions occurred which might alter the fair value of its reporting units;•macroeconomic conditions and their potential impact on reporting unit fair values;•actual performance compared with budget and prior projections used in its estimation of reporting unit fair values;•industry and market conditions; and•the year-over-year change in the Company’s share price.The Company completed its qualitative assessment in the third quarter of 2021 and concluded that a quantitative goodwill impairment test was not required in 2021 and that goodwill was not impaired.Purchase Price AllocationAssets acquired and liabilities assumed, including contingent consideration, as part of a business acquisition are generally recorded at their fair value at the date of acquisition. The excess of purchase price over the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed is recorded as goodwill. Determining fair value of identifiable assets, particularly intangibles, and liabilities acquired also requires management to make estimates, which are based on all available information and in some cases assumptions with respect to the timing and amount of future revenues and expenses associated with an asset. These estimates directly impact the amount of identified intangible assets recognized and the related amortization expense in future periods.New Accounting PronouncementsNote 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, in the notes to the consolidated financial statements contains a summary of the Company’s significant accounting policies, including a discussion of recently issued accounting pronouncements and their impact or potential future impact on the Company’s financial results, if determinable, under the sub-heading ""New Accounting Pronouncements.""54Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk.Market Risk and Credit RiskCertain of the Company’s revenues, expenses, assets and liabilities are exposed to the impact of interest rate changes and fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates and equity markets.Interest Rate Risk and Credit RiskInterest income generated from the Company’s cash, cash equivalents, and cash and cash equivalents held in a fiduciary capacity will vary with the general level of interest rates.The Company had the following investments subject to variable interest rates: (In millions)December 31, 2021Cash and cash equivalents$1,752 Cash and cash equivalents held in a fiduciary capacity$9,622 Based on the above balances, if short-term interest rates increased or decreased by 10%, or 1 basis point, over the course of the year, annual interest income, including interest earned on cash and cash equivalents held in a fiduciary capacity, would increase or decrease by approximately $1 million.In addition to interest rate risk, our cash investments and fiduciary cash investments are subject to potential loss of value due to counter-party credit risk. To minimize this risk, the Company and its subsidiaries invest pursuant to a Board approved investment policy. The policy mandates the preservation of principal and liquidity and requires broad diversification with counter-party limits assigned based primarily on credit rating and type of investment. The Company carefully monitors its cash, cash equivalents, and cash and cash equivalents held in a fiduciary capacity, and will further restrict the portfolio as appropriate to market conditions. The majority of cash, cash equivalents and cash and cash equivalents held in a fiduciary capacity are invested in short-term bank deposits and liquid money market funds.Foreign Currency RiskThe translated values of revenue and expense from the Company’s international operations are subject to fluctuations due to changes in currency exchange rates. The non-U.S. based revenue that is exposed to foreign exchange fluctuations is approximately 53% of total revenue. We periodically use forward contracts and options to limit foreign currency exchange rate exposure on net income and cash flows for specific, clearly defined transactions arising in the ordinary course of business. Although the Company has significant revenue generated in foreign locations which is subject to foreign exchange rate fluctuations, in most cases both the foreign currency revenue and expenses are in the functional currency of the foreign location. As such, under normal circumstances, the U.S. dollar translation of both the revenues and expenses, as well as the potentially offsetting movements of various currencies against the U.S. dollar, generally tend to mitigate the impact on net operating income of foreign currency risk. However, there have been periods where the impact was not mitigated due to external market factors, and external macroeconomic events may result in greater foreign exchange rate fluctuations in the future. If foreign exchange rates of major currencies (Euro, Sterling, Australian dollar and Canadian dollar) moved 10% in the same direction against the U.S. dollar compared with the foreign exchange rates in 2021, the Company estimates net operating income would increase or decrease by approximately $57 million. The Company has exposure to approximately 80 foreign currencies overall. In Continental Europe, the largest amount of revenue from renewals for the Risk and Insurance Services segment occurs in the first quarter. Equity Price RiskThe Company holds investments in both public and private companies as well as private equity funds, including investments of approximately $75 million that are valued using readily determinable fair values and approximately $36 million of investments without readily determinable fair values. The Company also has investments of approximately $207 million that are accounted for using the equity method. The investments are subject to risk of decline in market value, which, if determined to be other than temporary for assets without readily determinable fair values, could result in realized impairment losses. The 55Company periodically reviews the carrying value of such investments to determine if any valuation adjustments are appropriate under the applicable accounting pronouncements.At December 31, 2021, the Company owns approximately 14% of the common stock of Alexander Forbes (""AF""), a South African company listed on the Johannesburg Stock Exchange. The investment in AF is accounted at fair value, with unrealized gains and losses recorded as investment income (loss) in the consolidated statement of income. The fair value of this investment at December 31, 2021 was approximately $57 million.OtherA number of lawsuits and regulatory proceedings are pending.

Acquisitions and dispositions impacting the Risk and Insurance Services and Consulting segments are discussed in Note 5, Acquisitions and Dispositions, in the notes to the consolidated financial statements.Deconsolidation of RussiaOn February 24, 2022, Russian forces launched a military invasion of Ukraine. In response, the United States (U.S.), the European Union (E.U.), United Kingdom (U.K.) and other governments have imposed significant economic sanctions on Russia, and Russia has responded with counter-sanctions. The Company concluded that it did not meet the accounting criteria for control over its wholly-owned Russian businesses due to the evolving trade and economic sanctions, and recorded a loss of $52 million on the deconsolidation of the Russian businesses and other related charges. Subsequently, the Company entered into a definitive agreement to exit its businesses in Russia and transfer ownership to local management, pending regulatory approvals. Refer to Note 5, Acquisitions and Dispositions, in the notes to the consolidated financial statements for additional information on the deconsolidation of the Russian businesses.The war in Ukraine has continued to result in worldwide geopolitical and macroeconomic uncertainty. The Company continues to monitor the ongoing situation and its potential impact on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.Business Update related to COVID-19For nearly three years, the COVID-19 pandemic has impacted businesses globally including in every geography in which the Company operates. Our businesses have remained resilient throughout the pandemic and demand for our advice and services remains strong. The ultimate extent of the impact of COVID-19 to the Company will depend on future developments that it is unable to predict. Factors that could adversely affect the Company’s financial statements related to the financial and operational impact of COVID-19 are included in ""Item 1A - Risk Factors"" in Part I of this report.39Consolidated Results of OperationsFor the Years Ended December 31,(In millions, except per share data)202220212020Revenue$20,720 $19,820 $17,224 ExpenseCompensation and benefits12,071 11,425 10,129 Other operating expenses4,369 4,083 4,029 Operating expenses16,440 15,508 14,158 Operating income$4,280 $4,312 $3,066 Income before income taxes$4,082 $4,208 $2,793 Net income before non-controlling interests$3,087 $3,174 $2,046 Net income attributable to the Company$3,050 $3,143 $2,016 Net income per share attributable to the Company– Basic$6.11 $6.20 $3.98 – Diluted$6.04 $6.13 $3.94 Average number of shares outstanding– Basic499 507 506 – Diluted505 513 512 Shares outstanding at December 31,495 504 508 Consolidated operating income decreased $32 million, or 1% to $4.3 billion in 2022, compared to the prior year, reflecting a 5% increase in revenue and a 6% increase in expenses. Revenue growth was driven by increases of 5% in both Risk and Insurance Services and Consulting, reflecting the continued strong demand for our advice and services and the expansion of the global economy. The increase in expenses is primarily due to increased headcount and higher incentive compensation, as well as severance and lease exit charges. Expenses also reflect higher travel and entertainment costs, partially offset by lower depreciation and amortization primarily in the Risk and Insurance Services segment in 2022 compared to the prior year. In 2022, net operating income was also impacted by foreign exchange movements across both segments due to the strengthening of the U.S. dollar.Diluted earnings per share decreased from $6.13 to $6.04, or 1% from the prior year. The decrease is primarily the result of lower operating income, other net benefits credits and investment income, and higher interest expense in 2022, compared to the prior year. The decrease in net income attributable to the Company was offset by lower income taxes in 2022. Income taxes for 2021, included a net charge of $110 million for the re-measurement of deferred tax assets and liabilities due to the enactment of a tax rate increase from 19% to 25% in the U.K, partially offset by no tax impact on the gain related to the consolidation of Marsh India. 40In 2022 and 2021, the Company’s results of operations and earnings per share were impacted by the following items:For the Years Ended December 31,(In millions)202220212020Restructuring, excluding JLT$312 $70 $89 Changes in contingent consideration49 57 26 JLT integration and restructuring costs115 93 251 JLT acquisition-related costs and other28 81 54 JLT legacy legal charges1 (69)161 Legal claims 30 62 — Disposal of businesses(122)(49)(8)Pre-acquisition related costs21 — — Deconsolidation of Russian businesses and other related charges52 — — Gain on consolidation of business— (267)— Other— — 5 Impact on income before taxes$486 $(22)$578 •Restructuring, excluding JLT: Primarily includes severance and lease exit charges for activities focused on workforce actions, rationalization of technology and functional resources, and reductions in real estate. Costs also reflect charges for Marsh's operational excellence program. These costs are discussed in more detail in Note 14, Restructuring Costs, in the notes to the consolidated financial statements.•Changes in contingent consideration: Includes the change in fair value of contingent consideration related to acquisitions and dispositions measured each quarter.•JLT integration and restructuring costs: Primarily reflects lease exit charges for a legacy JLT U.K. location in 2022. In 2021, costs incurred include severance, lease exit charges, technology costs, and consulting services related to the integration of JLT. The Company completed the integration of JLT in 2022. •JLT acquisition-related costs and other: Retention costs and legal charges related to the acquisition of JLT. •JLT legacy legal charges: Charges and recoveries related to legacy JLT legal matters. In 2021, the Company recorded a $36 million reduction in the liability for a legacy JLT errors and omissions (""E&O"") related to the suitability of advice provided to individuals for defined benefit pension transfers in the U.K., as well as $33 million of recoveries under indemnities and insurance. The reduction in liability primarily reflects lower redress payments than previously estimated, partially offset by higher costs to review and calculate redress. Refer to Note 16, Claims, Lawsuits and Other Contingencies, in the notes to the consolidated financial statements.•Legal claims: The Company recorded settlement and legal costs related to strategic recruiting.•Disposal of businesses: Primarily reflects a net gain of $112 million on sale of the Mercer U.S. affinity business in 2022, that provided insurance marketing, brokerage and administration to association and affinity groups. In 2021, the amount primarily reflects a gain on the sale of the U.K. commercial networks business that provided broking and back-office solutions for small independent brokers. These amounts are reflected as a component of revenue in the consolidated statements of income and excluded from the calculations of underlying revenue. •Pre-acquisition related costs: Includes integration costs for the pending Westpac Banking Corporation superannuation fund transaction in Australia, which is expected to close in the first half of 2023. Refer to Note 5, Acquisitions and Dispositions, in the notes to the consolidated financial statements. 41•Deconsolidation of Russian businesses and other related charges: Loss on deconsolidation of Russian businesses of $39 million is included in revenue in the consolidated statements of income and excluded from the calculations of underlying revenue. •Gain on consolidation of business: In 2021, the Company increased its ownership in Marsh India from 49% to 92%. Prior to the increase in ownership, the Company accounted for the investment under the equity method of accounting. In connection with the increased investment in Marsh India, the Company recorded a gain of $267 million, related to the re-measurement of its previously held investment to fair value.42Consolidated Revenue and ExpenseRevenue - Components of ChangeThe Company conducts business in 130 countries. As a result, foreign exchange rate movements may impact period-to-period comparisons of revenue. Similarly, certain other items such as the revenue impact of acquisitions and dispositions, including transfers among businesses, may impact period-to-period comparisons of revenue. Underlying revenue measures the change in revenue from one period to another by isolating these impacts. The impact of foreign currency exchange fluctuations, acquisitions and dispositions, including transfers among businesses, on the Company’s operating revenues by segment is as follows:Year EndedDecember 31,% Change GAAPRevenue% Change Revenue excl.

Consolidated revenue increased 9% on an underlying basis and 1% from acquisitions, partially offset by a decrease of 4% from the impact of foreign currency translation. On an underlying basis, revenue increased 9% and 8% in 2022, in the Risk and Insurance Services and Consulting segments, respectively. Underlying revenue growth in the Risk and Insurance Services and Consulting segments was driven by the continued strong demand for our advice and services, the expansion of the global economy, new business growth, and solid retention including continued benefits from pricing in the market place.Consolidated Operating ExpensesConsolidated operating expenses increased $932 million, or 6%, to $16.4 billion in 2022, compared to $15.5 billion in 2021, reflecting increases of 10% on an underlying basis and 1% from acquisitions, partially offset by a decrease of 4% from the impact of foreign currency translation. On an underlying basis, expenses increased 9% in 2022, in both the Risk and Insurance Services and Consulting segments. The increase in underlying expenses is primarily due to increased headcount and higher incentive compensation, as well as severance and lease exit charges. Expenses also reflect higher travel and entertainment costs, partially offset by lower depreciation and amortization primarily in the Risk and Insurance Services segment in 2022 compared to the prior year. In 2022, the Company incurred $427 million of restructuring costs, primarily severance and lease exit charges, of which $219 million related to the Company's activities focused on workforce actions, rationalization of technology and functional services, and reductions in real estate. These activities were initiated in the fourth quarter of 2022 and the Company expects related estimated savings in 2023 to be in the range of $125 million to $150 million. Based on current estimates, the Company anticipates these activities will continue throughout 2023 and into 2024. However, additional charges are unlikely to exceed costs incurred in 2022. The Company's plans are still being finalized, which may change the expected timing, estimates of expected costs and related savings, as the Company continues to refine its detailed plans for each business and location. Expenses also reflect lease exit charges of $89 million in the Risk and Insurance Services segment for a legacy JLT U.K. location. For additional details, refer to Note 14, Restructuring Costs, in the notes to the consolidated financial statements.Risk and Insurance ServicesIn the Risk and Insurance Services segment, the Company’s subsidiaries and other affiliated entities act as brokers, agents or consultants for insureds, insurance underwriters and other brokers in the areas of risk management, insurance broking, insurance program management, risk consulting, analytical modeling and alternative risk financing services, primarily under the name of Marsh, and engage in specialized reinsurance broking, strategic advisory services and analytics solutions, primarily under the name of Guy Carpenter.Marsh and Guy Carpenter are compensated for brokerage and consulting services through commissions and fees. Commission rates and fees vary in amount and can depend on a number of factors, including the type of insurance or reinsurance coverage provided, the particular insurer or reinsurer selected, and the capacity in which the broker acts and negotiates with clients. Revenues can be affected by premium rate levels in the insurance/reinsurance markets, the amount of risk retained by insurance and reinsurance clients, and by the value of the risks that have been insured since commission-based compensation is frequently related to the premiums paid by insureds and reinsureds. In many cases, fee compensation may be negotiated in advance, based on the type of risk, coverage required and service provided by the Company and ultimately, the extent of the risk placed into the insurance market or retained by the client. The trends and comparisons of revenue from one period to the next can be affected by changes in premium rate levels, fluctuations in client risk retention and increases or decreases in the value of risks that have been insured, as well as new and lost business, and the volume of business from new and existing clients.44In addition to compensation from its clients, Marsh also receives other compensation, separate from retail fees and commissions, from insurance companies. This other compensation includes, among other things, payment for consulting and analytics services provided to insurers; compensation for administrative and other services (including fees for underwriting services and services provided to or on behalf of insurers relating to the administration and management of quota shares, panels and other facilities in which insurers participate); and contingent commissions, which are paid by insurers based on factors such as volume or profitability of Marsh's placements, primarily driven by Marsh McLennan Agency (""MMA"") and parts of Marsh's international operations. Marsh and Guy Carpenter receive interest income on certain funds (such as premiums and claims proceeds) held in a fiduciary capacity for others. The investment of fiduciary funds is regulated by state and other insurance authorities. These regulations typically require segregation of fiduciary funds and limit the types of investments that may be made. Interest income from these investments varies depending on the amount of funds invested and applicable interest rates, both of which vary from time to time. For presentation purposes, fiduciary interest income is segregated from the other revenues of Marsh and Guy Carpenter and separately presented within the segment, as shown in the previous revenue by segments tables.The results of operations for the Risk and Insurance Services segment are as follows: (In millions, except percentages)202220212020Revenue$12,645$12,085$10,337Compensation and benefits6,9386,5065,690Other operating expenses2,6182,4992,301Operating expenses9,5569,0057,991Operating income$3,089$3,080$2,346Operating income margin24.4%25.5%22.7%RevenueRevenue in the Risk and Insurance Services segment increased $560 million, or 5%, to $12.6 billion in 2022, compared with $12.1 billion in 2021. Revenue increased by 7% excluding the Marsh India gain in 2021. This reflects increases of 9% on an underlying basis and 1% from acquisitions, offset by a decrease of 3% from the impact of foreign currency translation. Interest earned on fiduciary funds increased by $105 million to $120 million, compared to $15 million in the prior year. The increase in underlying revenue in the Risk and Insurance Services segment was primarily due to growth in new business from existing clients, investments in talent, and solid retention including continued benefits from pricing in the marketplace. The increase in interest earned on fiduciary funds in 2022 is a result of higher interest rates compared to the prior year. In Marsh, revenue increased $302 million, or 3%, to $10.5 billion in 2022, compared to $10.2 billion in 2021. Revenue increased by 6% excluding the Marsh India gain in 2021. This reflects increases of 8% on an underlying basis and 1% from acquisitions, offset by a decrease of 3% from the impact of foreign currency translation. On an underlying basis, U.S./Canada rose 7%. Total International operations produced underlying revenue growth of 10%, reflecting growth of 13% in Asia Pacific, 11% in Latin America and 8% in EMEA.Results in 2022 also include a charge of $27 million related to the loss on deconsolidation of the Company's Russian businesses. In 2021, revenue from acquisitions reflected a gain of $267 million related to the re-measurement of the previously held equity method investment in Marsh India and a net gain of approximately $50 million related to the disposition of the commercial networks business in the U.K.At Guy Carpenter, revenue increased $153 million, or 8%, to $2.0 billion in 2022, compared with $1.9 billion in 2021. This reflects increases of 9% on an underlying basis and 1% from acquisitions, offset by a decrease of 2% related to the impact of foreign currency translation. The Risk and Insurance Services segment completed 16 acquisitions in 2022. Information regarding these acquisitions is included in Note 5, Acquisitions and Dispositions, in the notes to the consolidated financial statements.45Operating ExpensesExpenses in the Risk and Insurance Services segment increased $551 million, or 6%, to $9.6 billion in 2022, compared with $9.0 billion in 2021. This reflects increases of 9% on an underlying basis and 1% from acquisitions, offset by a decrease of 4% from the impact of foreign currency translation. The increase in underlying expenses in 2022 is primarily due to increased headcount and higher incentive compensation, as well as severance and lease exit charges. In 2022, the Company incurred $254 million for restructuring costs in Risk and Insurance Services, of which $104 million related to the Company's activities focused on workforce actions, rationalization of technology and functional services, and reductions in real estate. Expenses also reflect higher lease related exit costs for a legacy JLT U.K. location of $89 million, and higher travel and entertainment costs, partially offset by lower depreciation and amortization in 2022, compared to the prior year.ConsultingThe Company conducts business in its Consulting segment through Mercer and Oliver Wyman Group. Mercer delivers advice and technology-driven solutions that help organizations redefine the future of work, shape retirement and investment outcomes, and advance health and well-being for a changing workforce. Oliver Wyman serves as a critical strategic, economic and brand advisor to private sector and governmental clients.The major component of revenue in the Consulting business is fees paid by clients for advice and services. Mercer, principally through its health line of business, also earns revenue in the form of commissions received from insurance companies for the placement of group (and occasionally individual) insurance contracts, primarily life, health and accident coverages. Revenue for Mercer’s investment management business and certain of Mercer’s defined benefit and contribution administration services consists principally of fees based on assets under management or administration. For a majority of the Mercer managed investment funds, revenue is recorded on a gross basis with sub-advisor fees included in other operating expenses.Revenue in the Consulting segment is affected by, among other things, global economic conditions, including changes in clients’ particular industries and markets. Revenue is also affected by competition due to the introduction of new products and services, broad trends in employee demographics, including levels of employment and the effect of government policies and regulations. Revenues from investment management services and retirement trust and administrative services are significantly affected by the level of assets under management or administration, which is impacted by securities market performance.The results of operations for the Consulting segment are as follows: (In millions, except percentages)202220212020Revenue$8,139$7,789$6,976Compensation and benefits4,6264,4353,995Other operating expenses1,9601,8501,987Operating expenses6,5866,2855,982Operating income$1,553$1,504$994Operating income margin19.1%19.3%14.3%RevenueConsulting revenue increased $350 million, or 5%, to $8.1 billion in 2022, compared with $7.8 billion in 2021. This reflects increases of 8% on an underlying basis and 1% from acquisitions, partially offset by a decrease of 5% from the impact of foreign currency translation.Mercer's revenue increased $91 million, or 2%, to $5.3 billion in 2022, compared to the prior year. This reflects increases of 6% on an underlying basis and 1% from dispositions, offset by a decrease of 5% from the impact of foreign currency translation. On an underlying basis, revenue for Career and Health increased 14%, and 9%, respectively, while underlying revenue for Wealth remained flat. 46The increase in underlying revenue at Mercer in 2022 was primarily due to continued strong demand for our advice and services and the expansion of the global economy. The increase in Career products and services was due to continued demand for solutions linked to new ways of working, skill gaps, workforce transformation and diversity & inclusion issues. Health continued to benefit from growth in new business, higher retention, increased enrolled lives from a strong labor market, and medical inflation. Underlying revenue in Wealth grew in retirement solutions in 2022, offset by a decrease in investment management fees from the decline in assets under management due to market volatility on investments. Results in 2022 also include a net gain of $112 million from the sale of the Mercer U.S. affinity business. Oliver Wyman Group's revenue increased $259 million, or 10%, to $2.8 billion in 2022, compared with $2.5 billion in 2021, reflecting increases of 13% on an underlying basis and 1% from acquisitions, offset by a decrease of 4% from the impact of foreign currency translation.The increase in underlying revenue at Oliver Wyman in 2022 was primarily due to increased demand for project-based services across all industries. Results in 2022, also include a charge of $12 million related to the loss on deconsolidation of the Company's Russian businesses. The Consulting segment completed 4 acquisitions in 2022. Information regarding these acquisitions is included in Note 5, Acquisitions and Dispositions, in the notes to the consolidated financial statements.Operating ExpensesConsulting expenses increased $301 million, or 5%, to $6.6 billion in 2022, compared to $6.3 billion in 2021. This reflects an increase of 9% on an underlying basis, partially offset by a decrease of 5% from the impact of foreign currency translation. The increase in underlying expenses in the Consulting segment in 2022 is primarily due to increased headcount and higher incentive compensation, as well as severance and lease exit charges. In 2022, the Company incurred $77 million for restructuring costs in Consulting, of which $53 million related to the Company's activities focused on workforce actions, rationalization of technology and functional services, and reductions in real estate. Expenses also reflect higher travel and entertainment costs compared to the prior year. Results in 2021 also included a $69 million reduction in the liability for a legacy JLT E&O, including recoveries under indemnities and insurance, recorded in other expenses. Corporate and OtherCorporate expenses increased $90 million, or 33% to $362 million in 2022, compared with $272 million in 2021. This reflects an increase of 34% on an underlying basis, offset by a decrease of 1% from the impact of foreign currency translation. The increase in underlying expenses is primarily related to $62 million in lease exit charges for reductions in real estate. InterestInterest expense was $469 million in 2022, compared to $444 million in 2021. Interest expense increased $25 million due to higher short term borrowings in 2022 at higher interest rates compared to the prior year. Investment Income (Loss) The caption ""Investment income (loss)"" in the consolidated statements of income comprises realized and unrealized gains and losses from investments. It includes, when applicable, other than temporary declines in the value of securities, mark-to-market increases or decreases in equity investments with readily determinable fair values and equity method gains or losses on its investments in private equity funds. The Company's investments may include direct investments in insurance, consulting or other strategically linked companies and investments in private equity funds.The Company recorded net investment income of $21 million in 2022, compared to $61 million in 2021. Net investment income in 2022 is driven primarily by lower mark-to-market gains from the Company's private equity investments compared to the prior year. Income and Other TaxesThe Company's consolidated effective tax rate for 2022 and 2021 was 24.4% and 24.6%, respectively. 47The tax rates in both years reflect the impact of discrete tax matters such as excess tax benefits related to share-based compensation, enacted tax legislation, changes in uncertain tax positions, deferred tax adjustments, non-taxable adjustments related to contingent consideration for acquisitions, and valuation allowances for certain tax credits. The rates in both years also reflect tax benefits from planning that postponed the utilization of current year losses in the U.K. to a future year when the tax rate will be 25%. The excess tax benefit related to share-based payments is the most significant discrete item in 2022, reducing the effective tax rate by 0.7%. The reduction in 2021 was also 0.7%. The effective tax rate for 2021 reflects a net charge of $100 million related to the re-measuring of the Company's U.K. deferred tax assets and liabilities upon enactment of legislation on June 10, 2021, increasing the U.K. corporate income tax rate from 19% to 25%, effective April 1, 2023. The re-measurement of the Company's U.K. deferred tax assets and liabilities was the most significant discrete item in the prior year, increasing the Company's effective tax rate by 2.6% in 2021.The effective tax rate in 2021 also decreased 1.5% due to the Company not recording a tax on the gain from the fair value re-measurement of the Company’s previously-held equity method investment in Marsh India when the Company increased its ownership interest from 49% to 92%. The Company does not intend to dispose the business and has indefinitely reinvested this gain. The effective tax rate may vary significantly from period to period. The effective tax rate is sensitive to the geographic mix of earnings and the cost to repatriate the Company's earnings, which may result in higher or lower effective tax rates. Therefore, a shift in the mix of profits among jurisdictions, or changes in the Company's repatriation strategy to access offshore cash, can affect the effective tax rate. In 2022, pre-tax income in the U.K., Barbados, Canada, Ireland, Bermuda, Australia, Japan, India, and Germany accounted for approximately 65% of the Company's total non-U.S. pre-tax income, with effective rates in those countries of 17.8%, 1.2%, 26.8%, 11.9%, 3.7%, 29.3%, 32.8%, 24.9%, and 32.6%, respectively.In addition, losses in certain jurisdictions cannot be offset by earnings from other operations and may require valuation allowances that affect the rate in a particular period, depending on estimates of the value of associated deferred tax assets which can be realized. A valuation allowance was recorded to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount that the Company believes is more likely than not to be realized. Details are provided in Note 7, Income Taxes, in the notes to the consolidated financial statements. The effective tax rate is also sensitive to changes in unrecognized tax benefits, including the impact of settled tax audits and expired statutes of limitations. Changes in tax laws, rulings, policies or related legal and regulatory interpretations occur frequently and may also have significant favorable or adverse impacts on our effective tax rate. On August 16, 2022, the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 (""IRA"") was enacted into law. The Company evaluated the provisions of the new legislation, the most significant of which are the corporate alternative minimum tax and the share repurchase tax. The IRA is effective as of January 1, 2023, and will not have a significant impact on the Company's financial results of operations.As a U.S.-domiciled parent holding company, the Company is the issuer of essentially all of the Company's external indebtedness, and incurs the related interest expense in the U.S. The Company’s interest expense deductions are not currently limited. Further, most senior executive and oversight functions are conducted in the U.S. and the associated costs are incurred primarily in the U.S. Some of these expenses may not be deductible in the U.S., which may impact the effective tax rate.Changes to the U.S. tax law in recent years have allowed the Company to repatriate foreign earnings without incurring additional U.S. federal income tax costs as foreign income is generally already taxed in the U.S. However, permanent reinvestment continues to be a component of the Company's global capital strategy. The Company continues to evaluate its global investment and repatriation strategy in light of our capital requirements and potential costs of repatriation, which are generally limited to local country withholding taxes.The Coronavirus Aid, Relief and Economic Security Act (the ""CARES Act"") was signed into law on March 27, 2020. The CARES Act provided over $2 trillion in economic relief to individuals, governmental agencies and companies, to deal with the public health and economic impacts of COVID-19. Pursuant to the CARES Act, the Company deferred payroll taxes due from March 27, 2020 through December 31, 2020, and paid 50% in 2021 and 2022, respectively. 48Liquidity and Capital ResourcesThe Company is organized as a legal entity separate and distinct from its operating subsidiaries. As the Company does not have significant operations of its own, the Company is dependent upon dividends and other payments from its operating subsidiaries to pay principal and interest on its outstanding debt obligations, pay dividends to stockholders, repurchase its shares and pay corporate expenses. The Company can also provide financial support to its operating subsidiaries for acquisitions, investments and certain parts of their business that require liquidity, such as the capital markets business of Guy Carpenter. Other sources of liquidity include borrowing facilities in financing cash flows.The Company derives a significant portion of its revenue and operating profit from operating subsidiaries located outside of the U.S. Funds from those operating subsidiaries are regularly repatriated to the U.S. out of annual earnings. At December 31, 2022, the Company had approximately $921 million of cash and cash equivalents in its foreign operations, which includes $325 million of operating funds required to be maintained for regulatory requirements or as collateral under certain captive insurance arrangements. The Company expects to continue its practice of repatriating available funds from its non-U.S. operating subsidiaries out of current annual earnings. Where appropriate, a portion of the current year earnings will continue to be permanently reinvested.In 2022, the Company recorded foreign currency translation adjustments which decreased net equity by $1 billion. Continued strengthening of the U.S. dollar against foreign currencies would further decrease the translated U.S. dollar value of the Company’s net investments in its non-U.S. subsidiaries, as well as the translated U.S. dollar value of cash repatriations from those subsidiaries.Cash and cash equivalents on our consolidated balance sheets includes funds available for general corporate purposes. Funds held on behalf of clients in a fiduciary capacity are segregated and shown separately in the consolidated balance sheets as an offset to fiduciary liabilities. Fiduciary funds cannot be used for general corporate purposes, and should not be considered as a source of liquidity for the Company.Operating Cash FlowsThe Company provided $3.5 billion of cash from operations in both 2022 and 2021. These amounts reflect the net income of the Company during those periods, excluding gains or losses from investments, adjusted for non-cash charges and changes in working capital which relate primarily to the timing of payments of accrued liabilities, including incentive compensation, or receipts of receivables and pension contributions. The Company used cash of $193 million related to its restructuring activities in 2022, compared to $178 million in 2021. Pension Related ItemsContributionsIn 2022, the Company contributed $30 million to its U.S. defined benefit pension plans and $139 million to its non-U.S. defined benefit pension plans. In 2021, the Company contributed $35 million to its U.S. defined benefit pension plans and $95 million to its non-U.S. defined benefit pension plans. In the U.S., contributions to the tax-qualified defined benefit plans are based on Employee Retirement Income Security Act (""ERISA"") guidelines and the Company generally expects to maintain a funded status of 80% or more of the liability determined in accordance with the ERISA guidelines. In 2022, the Company made contributions of $30 million to its non-qualified plans and expects to contribute approximately $31 million in 2023. The Company was not required to and made no contributions to its U.S. qualified plans in 2022, and is not required to make any contributions in 2023.Outside the U.S., the Company has a large number of non-U.S. defined benefit pension plans, the largest of which are in the U.K., which comprise approximately 79% of non-U.S. plan assets at December 31, 2022. Contribution rates for non-U.S. plans are generally based on local funding practices and statutory requirements, which may differ significantly from measurements in accordance with U.S. GAAP. The Company contributed $113 million to its U.K. plans (including the JLT section) in 2022. The Company's contributions to its U.K. plans (including the JLT section) for 2023 are expected to be approximately $41 million.49In the U.K., the assumptions used to determine pension contributions are the result of legally-prescribed negotiations between the Company and the plans' trustee that typically occur every 3 years in conjunction with the actuarial valuation of the plans. Currently, this results in a lower funded status compared to U.S. GAAP and may result in contributions irrespective of the U.S. GAAP funded status.In 2021, the JLT Pension Scheme was merged into the MMC U.K. Pension Fund with a new segregated JLT section created. The Company made deficit contributions of $103 million to the JLT section in 2022, and is expected to make contributions totaling approximately $39 million in 2023. For the MMC U.K. Pension Fund, excluding the JLT section, an agreement was reached with the trustee in the fourth quarter of 2022, based on the surplus funding position at December 31, 2021. In accordance with the agreement, no deficit funding is required until 2026. The funding level will be re-assessed during 2025 as part of the December 31, 2024 actuarial valuation to determine if contributions are required in 2026. As part of a long-term strategy which depends on having greater influence over asset allocation and overall investment decisions, in December 2022, the Company renewed its agreement to support annual deficit contributions by the U.K. operating companies under certain circumstances, up to £450 million (or $541 million) over a 7-year period. The Company expects to contribute approximately $76 million to its non-U.S. defined benefit plans in 2023, comprising approximately $41 million to the U.K. plans and $35 million to plans outside of the U.K. Changes in Funded Status and ExpenseThe year-over-year change in the funded status of the Company's pension plans is impacted by the difference between actual and assumed results, particularly with regard to return on assets, and changes in the discount rate, as well as the amount of Company contributions, if any. Unrecognized actuarial losses as of December 31, 2022 were approximately $1.4 billion and $2.6 billion for the U.S. plans and non-U.S. plans, respectively, compared with losses of $1.8 billion and $2.9 billion as of December 31, 2021. The decreases in both the U.S. and non-U.S. plans were primarily due to an increase in the discount rate used to measure plan liabilities and the impact of foreign exchange, partially offset by a decrease in asset values. In the past several years, the amount of unamortized losses has been significantly impacted, both positively and negatively, by actual asset performance and changes in discount rates. The discount rate used to measure plan liabilities in 2022 increased in the U.S. and U.K., the Company's largest plans, following an increase in 2021 and a decrease in 2020. An increase in the discount rate decreases the measured plan benefit obligation, resulting in actuarial gains, while a decrease in the discount rate increases the measured plan obligation, resulting in actuarial losses. In 2022, the Company's defined benefit pension plan assets had losses of 18.3% and 29.2% in the U.S. and U.K., respectively, as compared to gains of 13.2% and 1.9% in the U.S. and U.K., respectively, in 2021. Overall, based on the measurement at December 31, 2022, net benefit credits related to the Company’s defined benefit plans are expected to decrease in 2023 by approximately $12 million compared to 2022, reflecting a decrease in the U.S. plans of $40 million, offset by an increase in non-U.S. plans of approximately $28 million. The Company’s accounting policies for its defined benefit pension plans, including the selection of and sensitivity to assumptions, are discussed in Management’s Discussion of Critical Accounting Policies. For additional information regarding the Company’s retirement plans, refer to Note 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, and Note 8, Retirement Benefits, in the notes to the consolidated financial statements.Financing Cash FlowsNet cash used for financing activities was $1.0 billion in 2022, compared with $1.3 billion used by financing activities in 2021.Credit FacilitiesThe Company has a multi-currency unsecured $2.8 billion five-year revolving credit facility (the ""Credit Facility""), entered into in April 2021. The interest rate on the Credit Facility is based on LIBOR plus a fixed margin which varies with the Company’s credit ratings. The Credit Facility expires in April 2026 and requires the Company to maintain certain coverage and leverage ratios which are tested quarterly. The Credit Facility includes provisions for determining a LIBOR successor rate in the event LIBOR reference 50rates are no longer available or in certain other circumstances which are determined to make using an alternative rate desirable. As of December 31, 2022 and 2021, the Company had no borrowings under this facility.In May 2022, the Company secured a $250 million uncommitted revolving credit facility. The facility expires in May 2023, and has similar coverage and leverage ratios as the Credit Facility. The Company had no borrowings outstanding under this facility at December 31, 2022.The Company also maintains other credit facilities, guarantees and letters of credit with various banks aggregating $514 million at December 31, 2022, and $508 million at December 31, 2021. There were no outstanding borrowings under these facilities as of December 31, 2022 or as of December 31, 2021.DebtIn October 2022, the Company issued $500 million of 5.75% senior notes due 2032 and $500 million of 6.25% senior notes due 2052. The Company used the net proceeds from these issuances for general corporate purposes, and repaid $350 million of 3.30% senior notes in November 2022, with an original maturity date of March 2023.In October 2022, the Company increased its short-term commercial paper financing program to $2.8 billion from $2 billion. The Company had no commercial paper outstanding at December 31, 2022.In December 2021, the Company issued $400 million of 2.375% senior notes due 2031 and $350 million of 2.90% senior notes due 2051. The Company used the net proceeds from these issuances for general corporate purposes, and repaid $500 million of 2.75% senior notes with an original maturity date of January 2022, in December 2021.On April 15, 2021, the Company repaid $500 million of senior notes maturing in July 2021.The Company's senior debt is currently rated A- by Standard & Poor's (""S&P""), Baa1 by Moody's and A- by Fitch. The Company's short-term debt is currently rated A-2 by S&P, P-2 by Moody's and F2 by Fitch. The Company carries a Positive outlook with Moody's and a Stable outlook with S&P and Fitch.Share RepurchasesOn March 23, 2022, the Board of Directors of the Company authorized an additional $5 billion in share repurchases. This is in addition to the Company's existing share repurchase program, which had approximately $1.3 billion of remaining authorization as of December 31, 2021. In 2022, the Company repurchased 12.2 million shares of its common stock for $1.9 billion. As of December 31, 2022, the Company remained authorized to repurchase up to approximately $4.3 billion in shares of its common stock. There is no time limit on this authorization. In 2021, the Company repurchased 7.9 million shares of its common stock for $1.2 billion. DividendsThe Company paid dividends on its common stock shares of $1.1 billion ($2.25 per share) in 2022 and $1.0 billion ($2.00 per share) in 2021. 51Contingent Payments Related To AcquisitionsThe classification of contingent consideration in the consolidated statements of cash flows is dependent upon whether the receipt or payment was part of the initial liability established on the acquisition date (financing) or an adjustment to the acquisition date liability (operating). The following amounts are included in the consolidated statements of cash flows as operating and financing activities:For the Years Ended December 31,(In millions)202220212020Operating:Contingent consideration payments for prior year acquisitions$(38)$(49)$(48)Receipt of contingent consideration for dispositions— 19 — Acquisition/disposition related net charges for adjustments49 57 26 Adjustments and payments related to contingent consideration$11 $27 $(22)Financing:Contingent consideration for prior year acquisitions$(32)$(28)$(54)Deferred consideration related to prior year acquisitions (126)(89)(68)Payments of deferred and contingent consideration for acquisitions$(158)$(117)$(122) Receipt of contingent consideration for dispositions$3 $71 $— For acquisitions completed in 2022, and in prior years, remaining estimated future contingent payments of $377 million and deferred consideration payments of $142 million, are recorded in accounts payable and accrued liabilities or other liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets at December 31, 2022.Derivatives - Net Investment HedgeThe Company has investments in various subsidiaries with Euro functional currencies. As a result, the Company is exposed to the risk of fluctuations between the Euro and U.S. dollar exchange rates. As part of its risk management program, the Company issued €1.1 billion senior notes, and designated the debt instruments as a net investment hedge of its Euro denominated subsidiaries. The hedge is re-assessed each quarter to confirm that the designated equity balance at the beginning of each period continues to equal or exceed 80% of the outstanding balance of the Euro debt instrument and that all the critical terms of the hedging instrument and the hedged net investment continue to match. If the hedge is highly effective, the change in the debt balance related to foreign exchange fluctuations is recorded in accumulated other comprehensive loss in the consolidated balance sheets. The U.S. dollar value of the Euro notes decreased by $82 million in 2022 related to the change in foreign exchange rates. The Company concluded that the hedge was highly effective and recorded a gain as a decrease to accumulated other comprehensive loss for the year ended December 31, 2022.Fiduciary LiabilitiesSince cash and cash equivalents held in a fiduciary capacity are not available for corporate use, they are shown in the consolidated balance sheets as an offset to fiduciary liabilities. Financing cash flows reflect an increase of $1.7 billion and $1.2 billion in 2022 and 2021, respectively, related to fiduciary liabilities.Investing Cash FlowsNet cash used for investing activities amounted to $850 million in 2022, compared with $1.2 billion used for investing activities in 2021.The Company paid $572 million and $859 million, net of cash, cash equivalents and cash and cash equivalents held in a fiduciary capacity acquired, for acquisitions it made in 2022 and 2021, respectively, including the Company's increased ownership interest in Marsh India from 49% to 92% in December 2021. 52In 2022, the Company sold certain business, primarily Mercer's U.S. affinity business, for cash proceeds of approximately $155 million, partially offset by $36 million primarily related to cash and cash equivalents held in a fiduciary capacity in the disposed businesses. In 2021, the Company sold certain of its businesses, primarily in the U.S. and U.K., for cash proceeds of approximately $84 million. In the third quarter of 2022, the Company sold the remaining investment in the common stock of Alexander Forbes (""AF""), for cash proceeds of approximately $62 million. The Company’s additions to fixed assets and capitalized software, which amounted to $470 million in 2022 and $406 million in 2021, primarily related to computer equipment purchases, the refurbishing and modernizing of office facilities, and software development costs.The Company has commitments for potential future investments of approximately $160 million in private equity funds that invest primarily in financial services companies, including a $100 million commitment to invest in a private equity fund entered into on April 1, 2022. Commitments and ObligationsThe following sets forth the Company’s future contractual obligations by type as of December 31, 2022:Payment due by Period(In millions)TotalWithin 1 Year1-3Years4-5YearsAfter 5YearsCurrent portion of long-term debt$268 $268 $— $— $— Long-term debt11,304 — 2,138 1,224 7,942 Interest on long-term debt6,021 458 794 692 4,077 Net operating leases2,228 362 615 500 751 Service agreements509 256 194 59 — Other long-term obligations (a)600 253 274 68 5 Total$20,930 $1,597 $4,015 $2,543 $12,775 (a) Primarily reflects future payments of deferred and contingent purchase consideration.The table does not include the liability for unrecognized tax benefits of $97 million as the Company is unable to reasonably predict the timing of settlement of these liabilities, other than approximately $32 million that may become payable within one year. The table also does not include the remaining transitional tax payments related to the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (""TCJA"") of $62 million, which will be paid in installments beginning in 2023 through 2026. 53Management’s Discussion of Critical Accounting Policies and EstimatesManagement makes estimates and judgments that affect reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue and expenses, and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. Management considers the following policies to be critical to understanding the Company’s financial statements because their application places the most significant demands on management’s judgment, and requires management to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain. Actual results may differ from those estimates.Revenue RecognitionIn the Risk and Insurance Services segment, judgments related to the amount of variable revenue consideration to ultimately be received on placement of quota share reinsurance treaties and contingent commission from insurers, which was previously recognized when the contingency was resolved, now requires significant judgments and estimates.Management also makes significant judgments and estimates to measure the progress toward completing performance obligations and realization rates for consideration related to contracts as well as potential performance-based fees in the Consulting segment.The Company capitalizes the incremental costs to obtain contracts primarily related to commissions or sales bonus payments. These deferred costs are amortized over the expected life of the underlying customer relationships. The Company also capitalizes certain pre-placement costs that are considered fulfillment costs that are amortized at a point in time when the associated revenue is recognized.Refer to Note 2, Revenue, in the notes to the consolidated financial statements for additional information.Legal and Other Loss ContingenciesThe Company and its subsidiaries are subject to numerous claims, lawsuits and proceedings including claims for E&O. The Company records a liability when a loss is both probable and reasonably estimable which requires significant management judgment. The Company utilizes case level reviews by inside and outside counsel, an internal actuarial analysis by Oliver Wyman, a subsidiary of the Company, and other methods to estimate potential losses. The liability is reviewed quarterly and adjusted based on claims developments. In many cases, the Company has not recorded a liability, other than for legal fees to defend the claim, because the Company is unable, at present time, to make a determination that a loss is both probable and reasonably estimable. Given the unpredictability of E&O claims and of litigation that could arise from such claims, it is possible that an adverse outcome in a particular matter could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s businesses, results of operations, financial condition or cash flows in a given quarterly or annual period.In addition, to the extent that insurance coverage is available, significant management judgment is required to determine the amount of recoveries that are probable of collection under the Company’s various insurance programs.Retirement BenefitsThe Company maintains qualified and non-qualified defined benefit pension and defined contribution plans for its eligible U.S. employees and a variety of defined benefit and defined contribution plans for its eligible non-U.S. employees. The Company’s policy for funding its tax-qualified defined benefit retirement plans is to contribute amounts at least sufficient to meet the funding requirements set forth in U.S. and applicable foreign laws.The Company recognizes the funded status of its over-funded defined benefit pension and retiree medical plans as a net benefit plan asset and its unfunded and underfunded plans as a net benefit plan liability. The gains or losses and prior service costs or credits that have not been recognized as components of net benefit (credit) costs are recorded as a component of Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income (""AOCI""), net of tax, in the Company’s consolidated balance sheets. The gains and losses that exceed specified corridors, 10% of the greater of the projected benefit obligation or the market-related value of plan assets, are amortized prospectively out of AOCI over a period that approximates the remaining life expectancy of participants in plans where substantially all participants are inactive or the average remaining service period of active participants for plans with active participants. The vast majority of 54unrecognized losses relate to inactive plans and are amortized over the remaining life expectancy of the participants.The determination of net periodic benefit (credit) cost is based on a number of assumptions, including an expected long-term rate of return on plan assets, the discount rate, mortality and assumed rate of salary increase. The assumptions used in the calculation of net periodic pension costs and pension liabilities are disclosed in Note 8, Retirement Benefits, in the notes to the consolidated financial statements. The long-term rate of return on plan assets assumption is determined for each plan based on the facts and circumstances that exist as of the measurement date, and the specific portfolio mix of each plan’s assets. The Company utilizes a model developed by Mercer, a subsidiary of the Company, to assist in the determination of this assumption. The model takes into account several factors, including: target portfolio allocation, investment, administrative and trading expenses incurred directly by the plan trust, historical portfolio performance, relevant forward-looking economic analysis, and expected returns, variances and correlations for different asset classes. These measures are used to determine probabilities using standard statistical techniques to calculate a range of expected returns on the portfolio.The target asset allocation for the U.S. plans is 50% equities and equity alternatives and 50% fixed income. At the end of 2022, the actual allocation for the U.S. plans was 61% equities and equity alternatives and 39% fixed income. The target asset allocation for the U.K. plans, which comprise approximately 79% of non-U.S. plan assets, is 14% equities and equity alternatives and 86% fixed income. At the end of 2022, the actual allocation for the U.K. plans was 16% equities and equity alternatives and 84% fixed income. The discount rate selected for each U.S. plan is based on a model bond portfolio with coupons and redemptions that closely match the expected liability cash flows from the plan. Discount rates for non-U.S. plans are based on appropriate bond indices adjusted for duration. In the U.K., the plan duration is reflected using the Mercer yield curve.The following table shows the weighted average assumed rate of return and the discount rate at the December 31, 2022 measurement date used to measure pension expense in 2023 for the total Company, the U.S. and the Rest of World (""ROW"").Total CompanyU.S.ROWAssumed rate of return on plan assets5.31 %6.49 %4.74 %Discount rate5.16 %5.53 %4.89 %Holding all other assumptions constant, a 0.5 percentage point change in the rate of return on plan assets and discount rate assumptions would affect net periodic pension cost for the U.S. and U.K. plans, which together comprise approximately 85% of total pension plan liabilities, as follows:0.5 PercentagePoint Increase0.5 PercentagePoint Decrease(In millions)U.S.U.K.U.S.U.K.Assumed rate of return on plan assets$(24)$(45)$24 $45 Discount Rate$(1)$6 $1 $(8)The impact of discount rate changes relates to the increase or decrease in actuarial gains or losses being amortized through net periodic pension cost, as well as the increase or decrease in interest expense, with all other facts and assumptions held constant. It does not contemplate nor include potential future impacts a change in the interest rate environment and discount rates might cause, such as the impact on the market value of the plans’ assets. In addition, the assumed return on plan assets would likely be impacted by changes in the interest rate environment and other factors, including equity valuations, since these factors reflect the starting point used in the Company’s projection models. For example, a reduction in interest rates may result in a reduction in the assumed return on plan assets. Changing the discount rate and leaving the other assumptions constant, may also not be representative of the impact on expense, because the long-term rates of inflation and salary increases are often correlated with the discount rate. Changes in these assumptions will not necessarily have a linear impact on the net periodic pension cost.55The Company contributes to certain health care and life insurance benefits provided to its retired employees. The cost of these post-retirement benefits for employees in the U.S. is accrued during the period up to the date employees are eligible to retire but is funded by the Company as incurred. The key assumptions and sensitivity to changes in the assumed health care cost trend rate are discussed in Note 8, Retirement Benefits, in the notes to the consolidated financial statements. Income TaxesSignificant judgment is required in determining the annual effective tax rate and in evaluating uncertain tax positions. The Company reports a liability for unrecognized tax benefits resulting from uncertain tax positions taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. The evaluation of a tax position is a two-step process:•First, the Company determines whether it is more-likely-than-not a tax position will be sustained upon tax examination, including resolution of any related appeals or litigation, based on only the technical merits of the position. If a tax position does not meet the more-likely-than-not recognition threshold, the benefit of that position is not recognized in the financial statements. •The second step is measurement. A tax position that meets the more-likely-than-not recognition threshold is measured to determine the amount of benefit to recognize in the financial statements. The tax position is measured as the largest amount of benefit that is greater than 50% likely to be realized upon ultimate resolution with a taxing authority. Uncertain tax positions are evaluated based upon the facts and circumstances that exist at each reporting period and involve significant management judgment. Subsequent changes in judgment based upon new information may lead to changes in recognition, de-recognition, and measurement. Adjustments may result, for example, upon resolution of an issue with the taxing authorities, or expiration of a statute of limitations barring an assessment for an issue. The Company recognizes interest and penalties, if any, related to unrecognized tax benefits in income tax expense. The Company’s accounting policy follows the portfolio approach that leaves stranded income tax effects in accumulated other comprehensive income. Certain items are included in the Company's tax returns at different times than the items are reflected in the financial statements. As a result, the annual tax expense reflected in the consolidated statements of income is different than that reported in the tax returns. Some of these differences are permanent, such as non-deductible expenses, and some differences are temporary and reverse over time, such as depreciation expense. Temporary differences create deferred tax assets and liabilities, which are measured at existing tax rates. Deferred tax liabilities generally represent tax expense recognized in the financial statements for which payment has been deferred, or expense for which a deduction has been taken already in the tax return but the expense has not yet been recognized in the financial statements. Deferred tax assets generally represent items that can be used as a tax deduction or credit in tax returns in future years for which a benefit has already been recorded in the financial statements. The Company evaluates all significant available positive and negative evidence, including the existence of losses in recent years and its forecast of future taxable income by jurisdiction, in assessing the need for a valuation allowance against deferred tax assets. The Company also considers tax planning strategies that would result in realization of deferred tax assets, and the presence of taxable income in prior period tax filings in jurisdictions that allow for the carry back of tax attributes pursuant to the applicable tax law. The underlying assumptions the Company uses in forecasting future taxable income require significant judgment and take into account the Company's recent performance. The ultimate realization of deferred tax assets is dependent on the generation of future taxable income during the periods in which temporary differences or carry-forwards are deductible or creditable. Valuation allowances are established for deferred tax assets when it is estimated that it is more-likely-than-not that future taxable income will be insufficient to fully use a deduction or credit in that jurisdiction.56Fair Value DeterminationsGoodwill Impairment Testing – The Company is required to assess goodwill and any indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment annually, or more frequently if circumstances indicate impairment may have occurred. The Company performs the annual impairment assessment for each of its reporting units during the third quarter of each year. A company can assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is necessary to perform a quantitative goodwill impairment test. Alternatively, the Company may elect to proceed directly to the quantitative goodwill impairment test. In 2022, the Company elected to perform a qualitative impairment assessment. As part of its assessment, the Company considered numerous factors, including:•that the fair value of each reporting unit exceeds its carrying value by a substantial margin based on its most recent quantitative assessment in 2019; •whether significant acquisitions or dispositions occurred which might alter the fair value of its reporting units;•macroeconomic conditions and their potential impact on reporting unit fair values;•actual performance compared with budget and prior projections used in its estimation of reporting unit fair values;•industry and market conditions; and•the year-over-year change in the Company’s share price.The Company completed its qualitative assessment in the third quarter of 2022 and concluded that a quantitative goodwill impairment test was not required in 2022 and that goodwill was not impaired.Purchase Price AllocationAssets acquired and liabilities assumed, including contingent consideration, as part of a business acquisition are generally recorded at their fair value at the date of acquisition. The excess of purchase price over the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed is recorded as goodwill. Determining fair value of identifiable assets, particularly intangibles, and liabilities acquired also requires management to make estimates, which are based on all available information and in some cases assumptions with respect to the timing and amount of future revenues and expenses associated with an asset. These estimates directly impact the amount of identified intangible assets recognized and the related amortization expense in future periods.New Accounting PronouncementsNote 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, in the notes to the consolidated financial statements contains a summary of the Company’s significant accounting policies, including a discussion of recently issued accounting pronouncements and their impact or potential future impact on the Company’s financial results, if determinable, under the sub-heading ""New Accounting Pronouncements.""57Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk.Market Risk and Credit RiskCertain of the Company’s revenues, expenses, assets and liabilities are exposed to the impact of interest rate changes and fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates and equity markets.Interest Rate Risk and Credit RiskInterest income generated from the Company’s cash, cash equivalents, and cash and cash equivalents held in a fiduciary capacity will vary with the general level of interest rates.The Company had the following investments subject to variable interest rates: For the Years Ended December 31,(In millions)20222021Cash and cash equivalents$1,442 $1,752 Cash and cash equivalents held in a fiduciary capacity$10,660 $9,622 Based on the above balances at December 31, 2022, if short-term interest rates increased or decreased by 10%, or 25 basis points for the year 2023, annual interest income, including interest earned on cash and cash equivalents held in a fiduciary capacity, would increase or decrease by approximately $30 million. At December 31, 2021, a change in short-term interest rates of 10%, or 1 basis point, would have increased or decreased interest income by approximately $1 million. The change in interest rate risk at December 31, 2022 is due to higher short-term interest rates compared to the prior year.In addition to interest rate risk, our cash investments and fiduciary cash investments are subject to potential loss of value due to counter-party credit risk. To minimize this risk, the Company and its subsidiaries invest pursuant to a Board approved investment policy. The policy mandates the preservation of principal and liquidity and requires broad diversification with counter-party limits assigned based primarily on credit rating and type of investment. The Company carefully monitors its cash, cash equivalents, and cash and cash equivalents held in a fiduciary capacity, and will further restrict the portfolio as appropriate to market conditions. The majority of cash, cash equivalents and cash and cash equivalents held in a fiduciary capacity are invested in short-term bank deposits and liquid money market funds.Foreign Currency RiskThe translated values of revenue and expense from the Company’s international operations are subject to fluctuations due to changes in currency exchange rates. The non-U.S. based revenue that is exposed to foreign exchange fluctuations is approximately 51% of total revenue. We periodically use forward contracts and options to limit foreign currency exchange rate exposure on net income and cash flows for specific, clearly defined transactions arising in the ordinary course of business. Although the Company has significant revenue generated in foreign locations which is subject to foreign exchange rate fluctuations, in most cases both the foreign currency revenue and expenses are in the functional currency of the foreign location. As such, under normal circumstances, the U.S. dollar translation of both the revenue and expense, as well as the potentially offsetting movements of various currencies against the U.S. dollar, generally tend to mitigate the impact on net operating income of foreign currency risk. However, there have been periods where the impact was not mitigated due to external market factors, and external macroeconomic events may result in greater foreign exchange rate fluctuations in the future. If foreign exchange rates of major currencies (Euro, Sterling, Australian dollar and Canadian dollar) moved 10% in the same direction against the U.S. dollar compared with the foreign exchange rates in 2022, the Company estimates net operating income would increase or decrease by approximately $74 million. The corresponding increase or decrease in net operating income in 2021 was estimated at $57 million. The Company has exposure to approximately 80 foreign currencies overall. In Continental Europe, the largest amount of revenue from renewals for the Risk and Insurance Services segment occurs in the first quarter. 58Equity Price RiskThe Company holds investments in both public and private companies as well as private equity funds, including investments of approximately $17 million that are valued using readily determinable fair values and approximately $42 million of investments without readily determinable fair values. The Company also has investments of approximately $215 million that are accounted for using the equity method. The Company's investments are subject to risk of decline in market value, which, if determined to be other than temporary, could result in realized impairment losses. The Company periodically reviews the carrying value of such investments to determine if any valuation adjustments are appropriate under the applicable accounting pronouncements.OtherA number of lawsuits and regulatory proceedings are pending.

New Business Model in Risk and Insurance Services Since 2004, MMC has made significant changes to its business model. Our new business model has three main aspects: a commitment to make all fees and other remuneration earned by MMC for the placement of insurance coverage fully transparent to our clients in the U.S. and in major markets around the world; the elimination of contingent compensation or market services agreements with insurers; and an initiative to offset, to the extent possible, lost market services revenue by increasing brokerage commissions and fees. 29 During 2005, MMC made significant progress implementing the requirements of the settlement agreement with the Office of the New York State Attorney General (“NYAG”) and the New York State Insurance Department (“NYSID”). We developed and rolled-out compliance infrastructure and governance processes; developed and rolled-out transparency standards and related policies and procedures; trained employees in core and certain specialty business lines; and established compliance monitoring groups to measure compliance. While Marsh is the MMC subsidiary most directly affected by these settlement-related activities, Guy Carpenter and Mercer’s health and benefits practices are also affected. MMC’s revenue in 2005 was impacted by a $417 million decrease in market services revenue. In 2005, market services revenue of $124 million, related to insurance placements made prior to October 1, 2004, was recognized in the financial statements. It is expected that market services revenue recognized in 2006 will be significantly lower than in 2005. As discussed above, our new business model includes an initiative whereby Marsh seeks to increase revenue through higher commissions and fees that are disclosed to its clients. Management expects that this incremental revenue will affect MMC’s results in 2006. Given the relatively recent launch of Marsh’s compensation initiative and the competitive challenges we currently face in the insurance brokerage market, it is difficult to predict the specific timing and amount of this revenue impact. In addition to the impact on revenue of the elimination of market services agreements (“MSA”), revenues in the risk and insurance services segment were affected by declining commercial insurance premium rates during most of 2005. Premium rate decreases began to abate in the fourth quarter of 2005 due to the initial effects of the major storms that hit the United States. A more significant impact on reinsurance premium rates as a result of the storms is expected in the first quarter of 2006. At December 31, 2005, the balance of accounts receivable related to accrued market services revenue earned prior to October 1, 2004 was approximately $130 million. MMC intends to collect outstanding MSA revenue earned prior to October 1, 2004, and is enforcing its contractual rights to collect amounts due. In December 2005, MMC initiated arbitration proceedings against certain insurance carriers for this purpose. However, there is no assurance that MMC will collect all amounts due. To the extent MMC does not collect accrued amounts, a charge to earnings would result. As discussed in Note 16 to the consolidated financial statements, in connection with the January 2005 settlement agreement with the NYAG and NYSID, MMC established an $850 million policyholder fund. Policyholders representing 88% of the value of the fund, or approximately $750 million, opted to participate and have signed a release related to all matters alleged in the NYAG lawsuit and NYSID amended citation, except for claims which are based on, arise out of, or relate to the purchase or sale of MMC securities. Also as discussed in Note 16 to the consolidated financial statements, on September 21, 2005, working with the National Association of Insurance Commissioners (the “NAIC”), MMC reached a multi-state regulatory settlement. The NAIC settlement agreement adopts the business reforms and the $850 million fund for policyholder clients provided by MMC’s previous settlement with the NYAG and NYSID. The NAIC agreement has been executed by MMC and Marsh, and as of February 17, 2006, has been adopted by insurance commissioners in 33 states and the District of Columbia and Guam. 30 Restructuring In response to MMC’s changed business environment, we initiated restructuring activities in the fourth quarter of 2004 and first quarter of 2005. The restructuring plans are described in more detail in Note 13 to the consolidated financial statements. During 2005, net restructuring expenses were $317 million, primarily related to the 2005 restructuring plan. These charges comprise severance and other termination benefits of $196 million related to the elimination of approximately 2,600 employee positions, future rent under non-cancelable leases of $116 million and other costs of $41 million, partially offset by a $36 million gain from the sale of certain small commercial accounts and other dispositions. In addition, in 2005 MMC incurred incremental expense related to the accelerated amortization of leasehold improvements of $12 million. Additional charges of approximately $50 million are expected to be incurred in 2006, largely in the first half of the year, as the remaining actions contemplated under the 2005 restructuring plan are completed. Annual savings of $375 million are expected when the 2005 plan is fully implemented. Results in 2005 reflect approximately $160 million of savings realized from the 2005 plan, with the remaining savings of approximately $215 million expected in 2006. All of the savings from the 2005 restructuring plan relate to the risk and insurance services segment. Results in 2005 also reflect savings of approximately $400 million resulting from the 2004 restructuring plan. Employee Retention Initiatives In late 2004, and in 2005, MMC initiated a number of actions designed to retain and motivate employees throughout our businesses. Retention awards were granted, primarily in risk and insurance services and consulting, resulting in additional costs of $115 million in 2005. In addition, stock option exchange programs were offered to employees who held deeply underwater MMC or Putnam options. The option exchange programs are discussed in more detail later in this MD&A. MMC also implemented new or expanded long-term incentive programs in several of its businesses. Businesses Exited in 2005 In October 2005, Marsh completed the sale of Crump Group, Inc., its U.S.-based wholesale insurance broker. The gain on the sale of $14 million, net of tax, was recognized in the fourth quarter. In December 2005 MMC agreed to sell its majority interest in Sedgwick CMS Holdings. The sale was completed on January 31, 2006, and we will recognize the associated gain on the sale in the first quarter of 2006. In the fourth quarter of 2005, MMC determined that the Crump and SCMS businesses met the criteria to be classified as discontinued operations. All previously reported financial information has been reclassified to conform with the current presentation. See Note 5 to the consolidated financial statements for further information regarding these dispositions. In May 2005, MMC sold the assets of MMC Capital, which had been MMC’s private equity management subsidiary, to Stone Point Capital LLC (“Stone Point”), an entity controlled by the former managers of MMC Capital for approximately $3 million. At the time of the asset sale, Stone Point assumed responsibility for management of the Trident Funds and other private equity funds previously managed by MMC Capital. MMC does not participate in the investment decisions or management of Stone Point or the private equity funds managed by Stone Point. MMC, through its subsidiary Risk Capital Holdings, continues to own investments in firms such as Ace Ltd., XL Capital Ltd. and Axis Capital Holdings, Ltd., as well as its investments in the Trident Funds and other funds managed by Stone Point, which have a total recorded value at December 31, 2005 of approximately $397 million. MMC no longer receives management fees or origination fees related to Stone Point’s asset management business, but may receive performance fees from Trident Funds II and III based on each fund’s aggregate rate of return. MMC continues to receive dividends and to recognize capital 31 appreciation or depreciation on the investments held by Risk Capital Holdings and has approximately $190 million of remaining capital commitments to funds managed by Stone Point. Long-Term Financings In December 2005, MMC and certain of its foreign subsidiaries entered into a new five-year $1.2 billion multi-currency revolving credit facility. Subsidiary borrowings under the facility are unconditionally guaranteed by MMC. The new facility, which will expire in 2010, replaced MMC’s $1.0 billion and $700 million revolving credit facilities which were scheduled to expire in 2007 and 2009, respectively. In December 2005, certain of MMC’s foreign subsidiaries borrowed approximately $510 million under the new facility, primarily to fund the repatriation of accumulated earnings pursuant to the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004. In connection with the termination of its previous revolving credit facilities, MMC recorded as interest expense a $7 million write-off of unamortized deferred financing costs. In September 2005, MMC completed two financings to enhance liquidity. MMC returned to the public capital markets, issuing $550 million of 5.15% Senior Notes due 2010 and $750 million of 5.75% Senior Notes due 2015. The proceeds from these notes were used to pay down outstanding bank borrowings that were scheduled to mature in December 2006. Also in September 2005, MMC refinanced its headquarters building in New York by entering into a 30-year, $475 million mortgage loan agreement at a fixed annual rate of 5.7%. This replaced the existing $200 million, 9.8% mortgage due in 2009. The incremental proceeds, net of a $34 million prepayment charge, were used to pay down outstanding short-term debt. 32 Consolidated Results of Operations (In millions, except per share figures) 2005 2004 2003 Revenue: Service Revenue $ 11,469 $ 11,561 $ 11,100 Investment Income (Loss) 183 200 100 Operating Revenue 11,652 11,761 11,200 Expense: Compensation and Benefits 6,945 6,706 5,710 Other Operating Expenses 3,811 3,486 3,032 Regulatory and Other Settlements 40 969 10 Operating Expenses 10,796 11,161 8,752 Operating Income $ 856 $ 600 $ 2,448 Income From Continuing Operations $ 369 $ 154 $ 1,516 Discontinued Operations, net of tax 35 22 24 Net Income $ 404 $ 176 $ 1,540 Income from Continuing Operations Per Share: Basic $ 0.69 $ 0.29 $ 2.85 Diluted $ 0.67 $ 0.29 $ 2.77 Net Income Per Share: Basic $ 0.75 $ 0.33 $ 2.89 Diluted $ 0.74 $ 0.33 $ 2.81 Average Number of Shares Outstanding: Basic 538 526 533 Diluted 543 535 548 Consolidated operating income in 2005 increased 43% to $856 million, reflecting significantly lower costs related to regulatory settlements at Marsh and Putnam and savings from restructuring initiatives partly offset by lower revenues in risk and insurance services and investment management, employee retention costs and incremental costs from the implementation of SFAS 123(R). Risk and insurance services results in 2005 include the impact of a $402 million decrease in MSA revenue. The segment’s 2004 results were impacted by an $850 million charge relating to the settlement agreement reached with the NYAG and NYSID. Investment management results in 2005 reflect reduced costs for regulatory settlements and related charges, partly offset by a decline in revenue resulting from lower assets under management. Results for Consulting reflect a 4% increase in revenue and lower costs for restructuring and restructuring-related charges. Results for Risk Consulting and Technology in 2005 reflect a full year of operations for Kroll, which was acquired in July 2004. Corporate results in 2005 include restructuring charges of $59 million, incremental compensation expense of $64 million, primarily related to stock options resulting from the adoption of SFAS 123(R) as of July 1, 2005, and $30 million of settlement and other costs. In 2004, corporate expenses included a credit of $105 million for insurance recoveries related to World Trade Center losses. Consolidated Revenues and Expenses Consolidated revenue for the year ended December 31, 2005 of $11.7 billion was 1% lower than in 2004. Reduced revenue in the risk and insurance services and investment management segments was offset by increases in the risk consulting & technology, and consulting segments. Revenue 33 decreased 6% on an underlying basis, which measures the change in revenue before the impact of acquisitions and dispositions and using constant currency rates. Excluding the impact of the elimination of MSAs, underlying revenue decreased 3%. The impact of foreign currency translation, acquisitions and dispositions on MMC’s operating revenue by segments is as follows: Twelve Months Ended Components of Revenue Change December 31, (In millions, except percentage figures) 2005 2004 % Change GAAP Revenue Currency Impact Acquisitions/ Dispositions Impact Underlying Revenue(a) Risk and Insurance Services Insurance Services (a) $ 4,567 $ 5,166 (12 )% 1 % — (13 )% Reinsurance Services 836 859 (3 )% 1 % — (4 )% Risk Capital Holdings (b) 189 180 5 % — (8 )% 13 % Total Risk and Insurance Services (c) 5,592 6,205 (10 )% 1 % — (11 )% Risk Consulting & Technology (c) 946 405 133 % (1 )% 113 % 21 % Consulting Human Resource Consulting (c) 2,708 2,704 — 1 % — (1 )% Specialty Consulting 909 774 17 % — 1 % 16 % 3,617 3,478 4 % 1 % — 3 % Reimbursed Expenses 185 159 Total Consulting 3,802 3,637 4 % 1 % — 3 % Investment Management 1,506 1,710 (12 )% — — (12 )% Total Operating Segments (c) $ 11,846 $ 11,957 (1 )% 1 % 4 % (6 )% Corporate/Eliminations (194 ) (196 ) Total (c) $ 11,652 $ 11,761 (1 )% 1 % 4 % (6 )% Twelve Months Ended Components of Revenue Change December 31, (In millions, except percentage figures) 2004 2003 % Change GAAP Revenue Underlying Revenue(a) Currency/ Acquisitions Impact Risk and Insurance Services (c) $ 6,205 $ 6,133 1 % (3 )% 4 % Risk Consulting & Technology (c) 405 19 100 +% (18 )% 100+% Consulting (c) 3,637 3,290 11 % 3 % 8 % Investment Management 1,710 1,955 (13 )% (13 )% — Total Operating Segments $ 11,957 $ 11,397 5 % (3 )% 8 % Corporate/Eliminations (196 ) (197 ) Total Revenue (c) $ 11,761 $ 11,200 5 % (3 )% 8 % (a) Underlying revenue measures the change in revenue before the impact of acquisitions and dispositions, using constant currency exchange rates. Underlying revenue for Insurance Services in 2005 decreased 13% in the twelve months, including a 7% decline related to market services agreements, and for the Risk and Insurance Services segment underlying revenue decreased 11% in the twelve months, including a 6% decline related to market services agreements. (b) Risk Capital Holdings owns MMC’s investments in insurance and financial services firms such as Ace Ltd., XL Capital Ltd., and Axis Capital Holdings Ltd., as well as the Trident funds. (c) Certain reclassifications have been made to prior year amounts to conform with current presentation. The data presented above excludes the results of the U.S. wholesale broking and claims management businesses, which are classified as discontinued operations. 34 During 2005, revenue in the risk and insurance services segment decreased 10% from 2004. Underlying revenue declined 11%, resulting from a $402 million decline in market services revenue, lower levels of new business and renewals and the impact of lower insurance premium rates. These declines were partly offset by the impact of foreign currency exchange rates. Risk consulting & technology revenue increased $541 million. Due to the acquisition of Kroll in July 2004, results in 2005 include, for the first time, a full year of revenue for Kroll, compared with six months of revenue in 2004. Underlying growth in risk consulting & technology was 21%, due to growth in Kroll’s technology services, corporate advisory and restructuring, and background screening businesses. Consulting revenue increased 4%, resulting from a 17% increase in Mercer’s specialty consulting businesses. Investment management revenue declined 12% as a result of the decrease in assets under management and lower investment income. Consolidated operating expenses decreased 3% from 2004 to 2005. This was primarily due to savings from restructuring initiatives and lower regulatory and other settlement expenses, partly offset by employee retention costs, the impact of acquisitions, higher benefits costs, and incremental costs, primarily related to stock options, resulting from the implementation of SFAS 123 (R). In addition, Putnam’s expenses in 2005 include a charge of $37 million for the estimated cost necessary to address issues relating to the calculation of certain amounts previously paid to Putnam by the Putnam mutual funds in the form of cost reimbursements to Putnam for transfer agency services relating to defined contribution operations. Expenses in 2004 include an $850 million charge related to the NYAG/NYSID settlement, costs of $224 million related to Putnam’s settlement and agreements with the SEC and Office of the Secretary of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts and restructuring costs of $337 million, partly offset by a $105 million credit from the final insurance settlement related to World Trade Center losses. Consolidated revenue in 2004 increased 5% from 2003. The increase in revenue was primarily due to the impact of acquisitions and foreign exchange. Revenue decreased 3% on an underlying basis, primarily driven by a decrease in investment management revenue due to a decline in average assets under management and a decrease in risk and insurance services revenue resulting from a decision to no longer accept MSA revenue for placements made after September 30, 2004. These revenue declines were partially offset by an increase in underlying revenues in consulting due to higher demand for strategic advice. Consolidated operating expenses increased 27% in 2004 over 2003, of which 10% was due to the effects of acquisitions and foreign exchange. Expenses in 2004 also include an $850 million charge related to the settlement agreement with the NYAG and the NYSID, charges of $224 million related to Putnam’s settlement agreements, costs of $337 million related to restructuring MMC’s businesses, severance of $108 million incurred prior to implementation of the restructuring plan in the fourth quarter and increased pension costs of $93 million. These costs were partially offset by a decrease in amortization expense for prepaid dealer commissions, a credit to compensation expense related to the settlement with Putnam’s former chief executive officer and a credit of $105 million from the final settlement with insurers for claims related to the September 11, 2001 attacks on the World Trade Center. Risk and Insurance Services In the Risk and Insurance Services segment, MMC’s subsidiaries and other affiliated entities act as brokers, agents or consultants for insureds, insurance underwriters and other brokers in the areas of risk management, insurance broking and insurance program management services, primarily under the name of Marsh; and engage in reinsurance broking, catastrophe and financial modeling services and related advisory functions, primarily under the name of Guy Carpenter. 35 Marsh and Guy Carpenter are compensated for brokerage and consulting services primarily through fees paid by clients and commissions paid out of premiums charged by insurance and reinsurance companies. Commission rates vary in amount depending upon the type of insurance or reinsurance coverage provided, the particular insurer or reinsurer, the capacity in which the broker acts and negotiations with clients. Revenues are affected by premium rate levels in the insurance markets, since compensation is frequently related to the premiums paid by insureds. In many cases, compensation may be negotiated in advance on the basis of the estimated value of the services to be performed. Revenue is also affected by fluctuations in the amount of risk retained by insurance and reinsurance clients themselves and by increases or decreases in the value of the risks that have been insured, new and lost business, and the volume of business from new and existing clients. Effective October 1, 2004, Marsh eliminated contingent compensation, or market services agreements with insurers, under which it had earned revenues based upon such factors as the overall volume, growth and, in some cases, profitability, of the total business placed by Marsh with a given insurer. The circumstances under which we terminated our market services agreements, and the related revenue impact in our Risk and Insurance Services segment, are discussed above under “Significant Developments in 2005 — New Business Model in Risk and Insurance Services.” For billing and other administrative services, Marsh and Guy Carpenter receive interest income on certain funds (such as premiums and claims proceeds) held in a fiduciary capacity for others. The investment of fiduciary funds is regulated by state and other insurance authorities. These regulations typically provide for segregation of fiduciary funds and limit the types of investments that may be made with them. Interest income from these investments varies depending on the amount of funds invested and applicable interest rates, both of which vary from time to time. Following the sale of MMC Capital’s business in May 2005, discussed above under “Significant Developments in 2005 — Businesses Exited in 2005,” we no longer receive fees in connection with the private equity investments previously managed by MMC Capital, nor do we receive management fees or origination fees related to this business. We continue to receive dividends and to recognize capital appreciation or depreciation on the investments held by Risk Capital Holdings, as well as revenue on Risk Capital Holding’s sales of investments from time to time. The results of operations for the risk and insurance services segment are presented below: (In millions of dollars) 2005 2004 2003 Revenue $ 5,592 $ 6,205 $ 6,133 Expense 5,287 6,121 4,526 Operating Income $ 305 $ 84 $ 1,607 Operating Income Margin 5.5 % 1.4 % 26.2 % Revenue Revenue in the risk and insurance services segment decreased 10% in 2005 compared with 2004, reflecting decreases in both insurance services and reinsurance services revenue. In insurance services, underlying revenue decreased 13%. Excluding the impact of decreased market services revenue, underlying revenue decreased 6%, reflecting lower new business volume and lower commercial premium rates. The decrease in underlying revenue was most significant in the United States; however, the percentage decline improved in the fourth quarter compared with earlier quarters in 2005 despite continued premium rate declines in the commercial insurance marketplace. Market services revenue declined from $521 million in 2004 to $119 million in 2005. Effective October 1, 2004, Marsh agreed to eliminate contingent compensation agreements with insurers. The 36 market services revenue recognized in 2005 relates to placements made prior to October 1, 2004. Marsh did not accrue a portion of market services revenue earned on those placements because it could not complete its normal process to determine that collection of these amounts was reasonably assured for certain contracts. Any such revenue earned prior to but not accrued at September 30, 2004 is recognized when collected or when confirmation of the amount of payment is received from the carriers. This resulted in the recognition of market services revenue of $119 million in 2005. It is expected that market services revenue in 2006 will be significantly lower than in 2005. Reinsurance premium rates in the U.S. property catastrophe and certain specialty lines appear to be increasing due to the effects of the recent hurricanes on insurance marketplace conditions, and have affected revenue in the first quarter of 2006. However, revenue from sales of investments by Risk Capital Holdings is expected to decline in 2006, and it remains difficult to estimate the amount and timing of the incremental revenue to be generated by Marsh’s commission and fee initiative described above. Revenue for the risk and insurance services segment grew 1% in 2004 over 2003. Underlying revenue declined 3%. In insurance services underlying revenue decreased 6% primarily due to a reduction in MSA revenue from $820 million in 2003 to $521 million in 2004. This excludes the market services revenue of $20 million in 2004 and $25 million in 2003 related to the employee benefits business transferred to Consulting effective April 1, 2005. Client revenue increased approximately 1%, reflecting 3% growth in Europe and 4% growth in other international markets, partially offset by a 2% decline in North America. Underlying revenue in reinsurance broking remained unchanged. Expense Expenses in the risk and insurance services segment decreased 14% in 2005, compared with the prior year. Expenses in 2004 included a $850 million charge related to the settlement with the NYAG and NYSID. Expenses in 2005 include restructuring costs of $255 million related to the restructuring activities we initiated in 2005 (the “2005 Plan”), discussed below, as well as $78 million of costs related to employee retention programs, $88 million related to incremental regulatory and compliance costs, and higher benefit costs due to higher pension expense. Expenses in 2005 also include costs of approximately $2 million related to restructuring activities that began in the fourth quarter of 2004. The expense increases described above more than offset expense savings resulting from the restructuring activities undertaken in 2004 and 2005. In 2005 charges of $255 million related to the 2005 Plan were incurred, primarily for severance and benefits related to staff reductions affecting approximately 2,600 employees and for future rent under non-cancelable leases. Annualized savings of approximately $375 million are expected in the risk and insurance services segment when the 2005 Plan is fully implemented in the first half of 2006. Of this amount, $160 million was realized in 2005 and the remaining $215 million of expected savings should be realized in 2006. Additional restructuring charges related to the 2005 plan of $50 million are expected to be incurred in 2006, largely in the first half of the year. In 2004, risk and insurance services expenses increased 35% over 2003. Approximately 20% of the increase was due to an $850 million charge for the settlement agreement with the NYAG and the NYSID and legal and other costs of $31 million related to this matter. Expenses in 2004 included restructuring charges of $231 million, including severance and other termination benefits, future rent under non-cancelable leases and lease termination costs and incremental amortization of $7 million related to accelerated amortization or abandonment of leasehold improvements. Expenses in 2004 37 also included $8 million for employee retention programs. In connection with accounting guidance issued by the Institute of Chartered Accountants in the U.K., MMC reassessed its obligation to provide future claims handling and certain administrative services for brokerage clients in the European marketplace. MMC determined that under certain circumstances it is obligated to provide such services based on its current business practices and recorded a pre-tax charge of approximately $65 million to reflect the change in estimated cost to provide these services. The effects of acquisitions and foreign exchange increased expenses by 6%. On an underlying basis, and excluding the items previously discussed, expenses increased 4%. Risk Consulting and Technology MMC’s Risk Consulting and Technology segment consists of Kroll and its subsidiaries, acquired by MMC in July 2004. The segment also includes portions of the risk consulting business previously managed by Marsh under the Risk and Insurance Services segment. The services previously managed by Marsh include forensic accounting, insurance claims accounting, and preparation and crisis consulting. Kroll delivers its services through four business groups: consulting services; corporate advisory & restructuring; security; and technology services. Kroll receives compensation for its risk consulting and technology services in the form of fees paid by clients. These fees are typically earned on an hourly, project, fixed fee or per unit basis. Kroll’s revenue is subject to changes in international economic and regulatory conditions. Some of Kroll’s revenue sources are counter-cyclical to the performance of the economy in general. These sources may include, for example, fees from restructuring, turnaround and forensic engagements relating to commercial bankruptcies and bond defaults. Kroll is also subject to normal competitive forces such as pricing pressures, demand for professional staff and new product development on the part of competitors, particularly in technology services. The results of operations for the risk consulting and technology segment are presented below: (In millions of dollars) 2005 2004 2003 Revenue $ 946 $ 405 $ 19 Expense 822 357 27 Operating Income $ 124 $ 48 $ (8 ) Operating Income Margin 13.1 % 11.9 % (42.1 )% Results of Operations The year-to-year comparisons of the segment’s revenue, expense and operating income are significantly impacted by the fact that we acquired Kroll in July 2004. As a result, 2004 results include only six months of Kroll’s operations. Underlying revenue growth in 2005 was 21% due to growth in the technology services, corporate advisory and restructuring and background screening practices. Expenses include amortization of identified intangible assets of $58 million and $24 million in 2005 and 2004, respectively. Consulting MMC conducts business in its Consulting segment through Mercer Inc. and its subsidiaries and affiliates. Mercer operates through two main business groups. Mercer Human Resource Consulting includes practice groups specializing in retirement and investment consulting, human resource services and investments, health and benefits and human capital. The Mercer Specialty Consulting Businesses focus on management consulting, organizational design and change management, and economic consulting. 38 The major component of Mercer’s revenue, in both Mercer Human Resource Consulting and the Mercer Specialty Consulting Businesses, is fees paid by clients for advice and services. Mercer Human Resource Consulting, principally through its Health & Benefits line of business, also earns significant revenue in the form of commissions received from insurance companies for the placement of group (and occasionally individual) insurance contracts, primarily life, health and accident coverages. Revenue for Mercer Global Investment’s discretionary investment management business and certain of Mercer HR Services and Investment’s defined contribution administration services consists principally of fees based on assets under administration. Revenue in the consulting business is affected by, among other things, global economic conditions, including changes in clients’ particular industries and markets. Revenue is also subject to competition due to the introduction of new products and services, broad trends in employee demographics, the effect of government policies and regulations, and fluctuations in interest and foreign exchange rates. Revenues from the provision of discretionary investment management services and retirement trust and administrative services are significantly affected by securities market performance. The results of operations for the consulting segment are presented below: (In millions of dollars) 2005 2004 2003 Revenue $ 3,802 $ 3,637 $ 3,290 Expense 3,351 3,228 2,829 Operating Income $ 451 $ 409 $ 461 Operating Income Margin 11.9 % 11.2 % 14.0 % Revenue Consulting revenue in 2005 increased 4% compared with 2004. On an underlying basis, revenue increased 3%, due to a 16% increase in Mercer’s specialty consulting businesses, partly offset by a 1% decline in human resources consulting. The increase in underlying revenue in specialty consulting reflects increases of 24% in management consulting, reflecting a 25% increase in Mercer Oliver Wyman, and 6% in economic consulting. Within the human resources consulting businesses, underlying revenue decreased 1%, reflecting a decline in the revenue associated with defined contribution plan assets previously administered by Putnam and transferred to Mercer effective January 1, 2005, increased pricing competition on traditional actuarial valuation services, and a decline in the employee benefits business transferred from Marsh to Mercer. These declines were partly offset by strong growth in human capital consulting. Consulting revenue in 2004 increased 11% over 2003. Acquisitions, which accounted for 4% of the revenue growth in 2004, include Synhrgy HR Technologies which closed in January, 2004, and Oliver, Wyman & Company (“OWC”) which closed on April 1, 2003. On an underlying basis, revenue increased 3%. In Mercer HR Consulting, underlying revenue was flat. In Mercer’s specialty consulting businesses, underlying revenue increased 13%. Expense Consulting expenses increased 4% in 2005 compared with 2004. On an underlying basis, expenses increased 3%, as savings from restructuring activity and lower costs for restructuring were offset by employee retention costs, increased benefits costs and higher expenses in specialty consulting due to a higher volume of business. Consulting expenses increased 14% in 2004 compared with 2003. Expenses in 2004 included restructuring charges of $62 million, including severance and other termination benefits and future 39 rent under non-cancelable leases and lease termination costs as well as incremental expense of $7 million related to accelerated amortization or abandonment of leasehold improvements and other assets. Expenses in 2004 also included $4 million for employee retention programs. In addition, the impact of acquisitions and foreign exchange increased expense by 9%. On an underlying basis, and excluding the items discussed above, expenses increased 2%, primarily due to higher employee compensation and benefit costs. Investment Management MMC conducts business in its Investment Management segment through Putnam. Putnam provides investment management and related services through a broad range of investment products, including the Putnam Funds, its own family of mutual funds which are offered to individual and institutional investors. In support of the primary investment management business, Putnam subsidiaries provide other related services including transfer agency, underwriting, distribution, shareholder services, custodial, trustee and other fiduciary services. PFTC serves as transfer agent, dividend disbursing agent, registrar and custodian for the Putnam Funds and provides custody services to several external clients. Putnam’s revenue is derived primarily from investment management and 12b-1 fees (described more fully below) received from the Putnam Funds and investment management fees for institutional accounts. Putnam also receives fees from the Putnam Funds for administrative services performed by PFTC. Putnam companies receive fees for the investment management services provided to the Putnam Funds and institutional accounts pursuant to investment advisory contracts under which the mutual fund or institutional investor pays fees to the Putnam company that manages the fund or account. The amount of the fees varies depending on the individual mutual fund or institutional account. Fees are usually based on a sliding scale in relation to assets under management, and, in some cases are also based on investment performance. These advisory contracts generally may be terminated by either party without penalty, and contracts with the Putnam Funds must be approved annually by the fund’s shareholders or trustees, including a majority who are not affiliated with Putnam. Putnam management and the fund trustees regularly review the Putnam Fund contract fee structures in light of fund performance, the level and range of services provided, and current industry conditions. Investment management revenues depend largely on the total value and composition of Putnam’s assets under management. Assets under management are particularly affected by fluctuations in domestic and international stock and bond market prices, and the net level of investments and withdrawals by current and new mutual fund shareholders and institutional clients. Items affecting revenue also include, but are not limited to, actual and relative investment performance, service to clients, the development and marketing of new investment products, the relative attractiveness of Putnam’s investment styles under prevailing market conditions, changes in the investment patterns of fund shareholders and institutional clients and Putnam’s ability to maintain investment management and administrative fees at current levels. All open-end Putnam funds other than money market funds have adopted distribution plans pursuant to Rule 12b-1 under the Investment Company Act of 1940, commonly referred to as 12b-1 plans. Pursuant to these 12b-1 plans, the Putnam Funds make payments to PRM to cover costs relating to distribution of the Putnam Funds and services provided to shareholders, at rates that differ by class of fund shares. These payments, known as Rule 12b-1 fees, enable PRM to pay service fees and other continuing compensation to firms that distribute shares of the Putnam Funds and provide services to fund shareholders. PRM retains some Rule 12b-1 fees as compensation for the costs of distribution and other services provided by Putnam and its affiliates to shareholders and for commissions advanced by Putnam at the point of sale (and recovered through fees received over 40 time) to firms that distribute shares of the Putnam Funds. These 12b-1 plans, and Rule 12b-1 fees paid by the Putnam Funds thereunder, are subject to annual renewal by the fund trustees and to termination by vote of the fund shareholders or by vote of a majority of the trustees who are not affiliated with Putnam. PFTC receives compensation from the Putnam Funds for its administrative (transfer agency and shareholder services) and custodial services pursuant to, respectively, investor servicing agreements which may be terminated by either party on 90 days’ notice, and pursuant to written custody agreements which may be terminated by either party on 30 days’ notice. These contracts generally provide for compensation on the basis of several factors which vary with the type of service being provided. The transfer agent servicing fee received by PFTC is a fixed rate per account for retail shareholders and a fixed rate service fee based on assets under management for mutual fund defined contribution shareholders. The results of operations for the investment management segment are presented below: (In millions of dollars) 2005 2004 2003 Revenue $ 1,506 $ 1,710 $ 1,955 Expense 1,243 1,612 1,452 Operating Income $ 263 $ 98 $ 503 Operating Income Margin 17.5 % 5.7 % 25.7 % Revenue Putnam’s revenue decreased 12% in 2005, reflecting a decrease in fees due to a decline in assets under management, lower 12b-1 fee revenue, and decreased investment gains. Assets under management averaged $196 billion in 2005, a 10% decline from the $217 billion managed in 2004. Assets under management aggregated $189 billion at December 31, 2005, compared with $213 billion at December 31, 2004. The change in assets under management from December 31, 2004 results primarily from net redemptions of $31 billion, partly offset by the positive impact of market performance. We expect average assets under management to decline in 2006. Putnam receives service fees from the Putnam mutual funds for transfer agent, custody, and other administrative services, as contracted by the Trustees of the Putnam mutual funds. Effective January 2005, the transfer agent service fee agreement was converted to a fixed rate per retail shareholder account and a fixed rate service fee based on average assets under management for mutual fund assets in defined contribution plans. For the first six months of 2004, the transfer agent service fee agreement was based on the reimbursement of the cost of service. For the third and fourth quarters of 2004, transfer agent service fees were based on a fixed fee and recorded as revenue. The change in the service fee agreement resulted in an increase in both service fee revenue and expense of approximately $32 million in 2005 compared with 2004. The change in the service fee contract is expected to have an immaterial impact on operating income in future quarters. At the end of 2005, assets held in equity securities represented 68% of assets under management , compared with 69% in 2004 and 72% in 2003, while investments in fixed income products represented 32%, compared with 31% in 2004 and 28% in 2003. Putnam’s revenue decreased 13% in 2004, reflecting a decrease in fees due to a decline in average assets under management, partially offset by higher investment gains, higher equity income resulting from THL transaction fees related to private equity investments and increased transfer agent fees. Assets under management averaged $217 billion for the year ended December 31, 2004, a 16% decline from the $258 billion managed in 2003. Assets under management aggregated $213 billion at 41 December 31, 2004 compared with $240 billion at December 31, 2003. The change from December 31, 2003 primarily resulted from net redemptions of $51 billion, partly offset by increases due to market appreciation of $16 billion and the consolidation of PanAgora’s $8 billion of assets under management as of July 2004. The change in the service fee calculation mentioned above resulted in an increase in both service fee revenue and expenses of approximately $41 million during the second half of 2004. Year-end and average assets under management are presented below: (In billions of dollars) 2005 2004 2003 Mutual Funds: Growth Equity $ 31 $ 38 $ 46 Value Equity 37 41 43 Blend Equity 26 28 32 Fixed Income 32 36 42 126 143 163 Institutional: Equity 34 40 51 Fixed Income 29 30 26 63 70 77 Year-end Assets $ 189 $ 213 $ 240 Assets from Non-US Investors $ 32 $ 38 $ 39 Average Assets $ 196 $ 217 $ 258 Components of year-to-date change in ending assets under management: Net Redemptions including Dividends Reinvested $ (31 ) $ (51 ) $ (61 ) Impact of PanAgora Acquisition $ — $ 8 $ — Impact of Market/Performance $ 7 $ 16 $ 50 The categories of mutual fund assets reflect style designations aligned with each fund’s prospectus. Expense Expenses for 2005 decreased 23% from 2004. Expenses in 2005 include a $37 million charge for the estimated costs necessary to address issues relating to the calculation of certain amounts previously paid to Putnam by the Putnam mutual funds in the form of cost reimbursements to Putnam for transfer agency services relating to defined contribution operations. Expenses in 2004 include a charge of $224 million related to Putnam’s regulatory settlements with the SEC and the Secretary of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts on market-timing issues. Other expense reductions in 2005 include lower compensation and severance costs, reduced costs related to regulatory issues, a decrease in amortization expense for prepaid dealer commissions and a decrease in restructuring charges. These reductions were partially offset by an increase in expenses previously borne by the funds under the prior transfer agent service agreement. Putnam’s expenses in 2004 include a $25 million credit to compensation expense associated with the settlement with Putnam’s former chief executive officer. Equity awards granted in September 2005 are expected to increase Putnam’s expenses by approximately $26 million in 2006. Expenses in 2004, which increased 11% from 2003, included $224 million for Putnam’s regulatory settlements with the SEC and the Commonwealth of Massachusetts. Restructuring costs totaled 42 $26 million, including $10 million related to a start-up hedge fund management business at MMC that was subsequently discontinued. Other significant items recorded in 2004 were severance of $57 million incurred prior to the fourth quarter restructuring, as well as incremental costs related to regulatory issues and repositioning Putnam, including legal and audit costs of $45 million and communications costs of $16 million. In 2004, Putnam discontinued the practice of directing brokerage commissions and virtually eliminated the use of soft dollars, causing expenses to increase by approximately $40 million. These increases were partially offset by a decrease in amortization expense for prepaid dealer commissions and a $25 million credit to compensation expense associated with the settlement with Putnam’s former chief executive officer. Corporate Items Corporate Expenses Corporate expenses were $287 million in 2005 compared to $39 million in 2004. Expenses in 2005 include $64 million of incremental expenses, primarily related to stock options, resulting from the adoption of SFAS 123 (R) effective July 1, 2005. The incremental cost related to the implementation of SFAS 123 (R) is being charged to corporate and not to the operating segments in 2005 because this expense is excluded from the operating company results reviewed by MMC’s chief operating decision maker for performance measurement. In addition, $6 million was recorded for severance and other termination benefits related to the 2005 Plan, and a charge of $49 million was recorded in the first quarter related to the consolidation of office space in London. Because the office consolidation was initiated by MMC to benefit its London operations as a whole, the related charge was recorded in corporate. Corporate expenses also reflect $30 million of charges in connection with the resolution of certain litigation and related matters which are discussed in Note 16 to the consolidated financial statements. Corporate expenses in 2004 included $18 million of restructuring costs, including severance and other termination benefits, future rent under non-cancelable leases and lease termination costs. The impact of the final settlement for insured losses related to the WTC reduced Corporate expenses in 2004. The replacement value of the assets exceeded their book value by $105 million which was recorded as a reduction of other operating expenses. Integration and Restructuring Charges Note 13 to the consolidated financial statements discusses integration and restructuring costs. The following chart summarizes the costs incurred and the savings realized and projected for MMC’s restructuring activities. (In millions of dollars) Costs Incurred Savings Realized Incremental Savings Expected 2004 2005 2005 2006 2004 Plan $ 337 $ 3 $ 400 — 2005 Plan — 310 160 215 Restructuring activities under the 2005 plan, which we initiated in the first quarter of 2005 are nearing completion. In 2005, MMC incurred expenses in connection with the 2005 plan of $310 million (approximately two-thirds of which was severance cost). Additional expenses of $50 million are expected to be incurred primarily in the first half of 2006. Once the 2005 plan is fully implemented, MMC expects to achieve annualized cost savings of $375 million, all of which is in the Risk and Insurance Services segment. Results in 2005 reflect approximately $160 million of the savings 43 expected under the 2005 plan with the remaining $215 million of savings expected to be realized in 2006. Savings under the 2004 plan were $400 million, substantially all of which was realized in 2005. Restructuring costs in 2005 also include a $4 million increase to the estimated liability for future rent under non-cancellable leases related to the Johnson and Higgins and Sedgwick acquisitions. Stock Option Exchanges At the May 2005 Annual Meeting, MMC’s shareholders approved a stock option exchange offer for MMC options. Under the exchange offer, eligible employees could exchange certain deeply underwater options for new options with an estimated fair value equal to 90% of the value of options surrendered in exchange, calculated using the Black-Scholes pricing model. Effective July 1, 2005, employees elected to exchange 42 million options for 16 million new options. The exchange resulted in the retirement of 26 million options and no incremental compensation expense was incurred in connection with the new option grants. The exercise price of the new options of $27.86 is equal to the market price of MMC’s common stock as of the new grant date. The new options were unvested when granted and will vest on the later of the second anniversary of the new option grant or the vesting date of the tendered option. The other terms and conditions of the new options are substantially similar to those of the tendered options they replaced. On September 29, 2005, certain eligible participants in the Putnam Investments Trust Equity Partnership Plan participated in a voluntary option exchange pursuant to the terms of the Offer to Exchange Certain Outstanding Options (the “Offer to Exchange”), dated August 30, 2005. Under the Offer to Exchange, holders of options on Class B shares meeting certain eligibility requirements could elect to exchange those options for restricted shares with the equivalent value of the exchanged options, as determined using the Black-Scholes valuation model. As a result of the Offer to Exchange, a total of 2,201,850 options were retired and 139,388 restricted shares were issued at a grant price of $28.26 per share. Interest Interest income was $47 million for 2005, an increase of $26 million from 2004. The increase in interest income reflected the combination of higher average corporate cash balances and generally higher average interest rates in 2005 compared with 2004. Interest expense was $332 million in 2005 compared to $219 million in 2004. The increase in interest expense is due to an increase in the amount of average outstanding debt resulting from the acquisition of Kroll and a $34 million charge in 2005 for the prepayment of the $200 million mortgage on MMC’s corporate headquarters in New York. In addition, interest expense in 2005 includes a write-off of $7 million of unamortized deferred financing costs related to MMC’s prior revolving credit agreements which were refinanced in December 2005. Interest income earned on corporate funds was $21 million in 2004 compared with $24 million in 2003. Interest expense increased from $185 million in 2003 to $219 million in 2004. The increase in interest expense was due primarily to an increase in the amount of average outstanding debt, primarily due to the acquisition of Kroll. Income Taxes MMC’s consolidated effective tax rate was 33.6% in 2005, a decrease from 59.4% in 2004. The decrease in the rate was primarily due to the impact in 2004 of the non-deductibility of Putnam’s $224 million in regulatory settlements and of a lower benefit related to Marsh’s $850 million settlement of the NYAG lawsuit; partially offset in 2005 by an increase in valuation allowances 44 provided on net operating losses in certain state and foreign jurisdictions. In 2003 the effective tax rate was 32.8%. The increase in the effective rate in 2004 compared with 2003 results primarily from the tax impact of the aforementioned settlements, and a partially offsetting benefit for foreign earnings taxed at lower rates. The effective tax rate is sensitive to the geographic mix of MMC’s earnings, which may have a favorable or unfavorable impact on the rate. Furthermore, losses in certain jurisdictions cannot be offset by earnings from other operations, and may require valuation allowances affecting the rate, depending on estimates of their realizability. MMC establishes allowances for potential liabilities that may arise out of tax audits and litigation to the extent that such liabilities are probable and can be estimated in accordance with SFAS No. 5. Once established, allowances are evaluated based on the facts and circumstances that exist at each reporting period. Adjustments may result, for example, upon resolution of an issue with the taxing authorities, or expiration of a statute of limitations barring an assessment for an issue for which an allowance had previously been recorded. Such adjustments could have a material impact on MMC’s effective tax rate, net income, and cash flows for a particular future period. Liquidity and Capital Resources MMC’s routine liquidity needs are primarily for servicing debt and paying dividends on outstanding stock. Our primary source for meeting these requirements is cash flows from our operations. Cash on our consolidated balance sheets includes funds available for general corporate purposes. Funds held on behalf of clients in a fiduciary capacity are segregated and shown separately in the consolidated balance sheet as an offset to fiduciary liabilities. Operating Cash Flows MMC generated $399 million of cash from operations in 2005 compared with $2.1 billion in 2004. These amounts reflect the net income earned by MMC during those periods adjusted for non-cash charges and changes in working capital which relate primarily to the timing of payments for accrued liabilities or receipts of assets. In addition to the routine timing of payments and receipts, MMC had several significant events which impacted its cash flow over the past two years, due to differences between when the items are recognized in net income and when they are paid. These include payments in 2005 of approximately $308 million for regulatory settlements accrued in 2004, payment of restructuring costs and discretionary contributions of $235 million to the pension plans in the U.K. As previously discussed, in January 2005 MMC reached a settlement with the NYAG and NYSID that resolved the actions commenced by them against MMC and Marsh. As a result of this agreement, MMC recorded a charge in 2004 for an $850 million policyholder fund. MMC paid the first $255 million to the fund on June 1, 2005. An additional $255 million must be paid on or before June 1, 2006, and $170 million will be paid to the fund on or before each of June 1, 2007 and 2008, respectively. These amounts are included in Regulatory Settlements in the consolidated balance sheets. At December 31, 2005, the balance of accounts receivable related to accrued market services revenue earned prior to October 1, 2004 was $130 million. Following the announcement of the settlement with the NYAG and NYSID, MMC reaffirmed its intention to collect outstanding MSA revenue earned prior to October 1, 2004, and will seek to enforce its rights under the relevant contracts. In December 2005, MMC initiated arbitration proceedings against certain insurance carriers for this purpose. However, there is no assurance that MMC will be successful in collecting all amounts due. To the extent such accrued amounts are not collected, a charge to earnings would result. 45 MMC has funding requirements for the U.S. non-qualified and U.K. plans in 2005 of approximately $19 million and $94 million, respectively. MMC’s policy for funding its tax qualified defined benefit retirement plans is to contribute amounts at least sufficient to meet the funding requirements set forth in U.S. and applicable foreign law. There currently is no ERISA funding requirement for the U.S. qualified plan in 2005 or in 2006. Funding requirements for non-U.S. plans vary country by country. During 2005, MMC contributed approximately $229 million to the U.S. pension plans and $498 million to the significant non-U.S. pension plans, compared with $44 million for U.S. plans and $239 million for significant non-U.S. plans in 2004. The contributions in 2005 include discretionary contributions of 8 million unregistered shares of MMC stock valued at $205 million to the U.S. qualified plan and $235 million of cash to the U.K. plans. These contributions resulted in an increase in prepaid pension expense for certain plans. The minimum pension liability related to any plan is recorded as part of the Pension, postretirement and post-employment liability in the consolidated balance sheets. During 2005, the net funded status of the U.S. and significant non-U.S. pension plans increased by $299 million and $303 million, respectively, due primarily to the discretionary contributions mentioned previously. In addition, changes made to the U.S. pension plan, discussed below under “Management’s Discussion of Critical Accounting Policies — Retirement Benefits”, reduced the benefit obligation of that plan by $138 million and a plan curtailment in the U.K. reduced the benefit obligations of non-U.S. plans by $40 million. Benefit obligations of the U.S. and significant non-U.S. pension plans exceeded the fair value of plan assets by $79 million and $818 million, respectively, at December 31, 2005. Contribution rates are determined by the local foreign actuaries based on local funding practices and requirements. Funding amounts may be influenced by future asset performance, discount rates and other variables impacting the assets and/or liabilities of the plan. In addition, amounts funded in the future, to the extent not required under regulatory requirements, may be affected by alternative uses of MMC’s cash flows, including dividends, investments, and share repurchases. Under generally accepted accounting principles, if the accumulated benefit obligation of a plan exceeds the fair value of that plan’s assets (an “ABO deficit”), an additional minimum liability is recorded for the amount of the ABO deficit. The additional minimum liability, plus the amount of prepaid pension cost recognized for that plan is charged to other comprehensive income (equity), net of applicable taxes. At December 31, 2005, MMC has prepaid pension costs of approximately $1.6 billion, which relate primarily to the U.S. qualified plan and two U.K. plans, as well as some smaller plans in various countries. Financing Cash Flows Net cash provided by financing activities was $128 million in 2005 compared with $1.2 billion in 2004. In December 2005, MMC and certain of its foreign subsidiaries entered into a new $1.2 billion multi-currency revolving credit facility. Subsidiary borrowings under the facility are unconditionally guaranteed by MMC. The facility, which will expire in December 2010, replaces MMC’s $1.0 billion and $700 million revolving credit facilities which were scheduled to expire in 2007 and 2009, respectively. Certain of MMC’s foreign subsidiaries borrowed approximately $510 million under the new facility, primarily to fund the repatriation of accumulated earnings pursuant to the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004. In September 2005, MMC returned to the public capital markets, issuing $550 million of 5.15% Senior Notes due 2010 and $750 million of 5.75% Senior Notes due 2015 (the “2005 Notes”). The net proceeds from the 2005 Notes were used to pay down the $1.3 billion term loan facility, discussed below. 46 Also in September 2005, MMC refinanced its headquarters building in New York city by entering into a 30-year, $475 million mortgage loan agreement at a fixed annual rate of 5.7%. This replaced the existing $200 million, 9.8% mortgage due in 2009. The incremental proceeds, net of a $34 million prepayment charge, were used to pay down outstanding short-term debt. In December 2004, MMC completed financing with respect to a $1.3 billion term loan facility and the amendment of its existing $1 billion revolving credit facility which was scheduled to expire in June 2007 and $700 million revolving credit facility which was scheduled to expire in June 2009. The term loan facility, which was repaid with proceeds from the issuance of the 2005 Notes, was scheduled to mature on December 31, 2006 and replaced revolving credit facilities of $700 million and $355 million, which were scheduled to expire in 2005. MMC’s senior debt is currently rated Baa2 by Moody’s and BBB by Standard & Poor’s. MMC’s short-term debt is currently rated P-2 by Moody’s and A-2 by Standard & Poor’s. MMC carries a negative outlook from both Moody’s and Standard & Poor’s. In July 2004, MMC issued $650 million of 5.375% Senior Notes due 2014 and $500 million of Floating Rate Notes due 2007. The proceeds from these notes were used to repay the commercial paper borrowings that were used to purchase Kroll. MMC paid total dividends of $363 million in 2005 ($0.68 per share) and $681 million ($1.30 per share) in 2004. MMC made no share repurchases in 2005. In 2004, MMC repurchased 11.4 million shares for $524 million, substantially all of which was purchased in the first and second quarters. MMC also maintains other credit facilities, guarantees and letters of credit with various banks, primarily related to operations located outside the United States, aggregating $354 million at December 31, 2005 and $331 million at December 31, 2004. There was $83 million outstanding under these facilities at December 31, 2005. Investing Cash Flows Cash provided by investing activities amounted to $153 million in 2005 compared with cash used for investing activities of $2.6 billion in 2004. Cash used for acquisitions decreased to $74 million from $2.4 billion in 2004. Acquisitions in 2004 included Kroll, Inc., Synhrgy HR Technologies, Corporate Systems, and the Australia and New Zealand operations of Heath Lambert. Remaining deferred cash payments of approximately $48 million related to acquisitions completed in 2005 and prior years are recorded in Accounts payable and accrued liabilities or in Other liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets at December 31, 2005. In addition, cash generated by the sale of securities totaled $333 million in 2005 versus $199 million for 2004. MMC’s additions to fixed assets and capitalized software, which amounted to $345 million in 2005 and $376 million in 2004, primarily relate to computer equipment purchases, the refurbishing and modernizing of office facilities and software development costs. MMC has committed to potential future investments of approximately $295 million in connection with various private equity funds and other MMC investments. Commitments of $112 million relate to Trident III, a private equity fund managed by Stone Point. MMC’s funding commitment to Trident III decreased by approximately $98 million upon the sale of the business of MMC Capital to the management team of Stone Point on May 31, 2005. MMC’s remaining commitments relate to other funds managed by Stone Point (approximately $82 million) and by Putnam through THL and THLPC (approximately $101 million). Trident III closed in December 2003, and has an investment period of six years. MMC does not control or know the timing of capital calls that Stone Point will make on Trident III’s investors. Typically, the investment period for funds of this type has been about four 47 years, which would indicate an expected capital call of approximately $35–$50 million per year. Actual capital calls may occur more quickly. The majority of MMC’s other investment commitments for funds managed by Stone Point are related to Trident II, the investment period for which is now closed for new investments. Any remaining capital calls for Trident II would relate to follow-on investments in existing portfolio companies or for management fees or other partnership expenses. Significant future capital calls related to Trident II are not expected. Although it is anticipated that Trident II will be harvesting its remaining portfolio in 2006 and thereafter, the timing of any portfolio company sales and capital distributions is unknown and not controlled by MMC. Putnam has investment commitments of $101 million for three active THL funds, of which Putnam believes approximately $50 million will not be called. Putnam is authorized to commit to invest up to $187 million in future THL investment funds, but is not required to do so. At December 31, 2005 none of that additional $187 million is committed. Approximately $77 million was invested in 2005 related to all of the commitments discussed above. Commitments and Obligations MMC’s contractual obligations were comprised of the following as of December 31, 2005 (dollars in millions): Payment due by Period Contractual Obligations Total Within 1 Year 1–3 Years 4–5 Years After 5 Years Bank Borrowings-International $ 597 $ 429 $ 168 $ — $ — Current portion of long-term debt 69 69 — — — Long-term debt 4,874 — 1,271 965 2,638 NYAG/NYSID settlement 595 255 340 — — Net operating leases 3,349 466 763 542 1,578 Service agreements 181 65 70 44 2 Other long-term obligations 66 38 28 — — Total $ 9,731 $ 1,322 $ 2,640 $ 1,551 $ 4,218 Market Risk Certain of MMC’s revenues, expenses, assets and liabilities are exposed to the impact of interest rate changes and fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates and equity markets. Interest Rate Risk MMC manages its net exposure to interest rate changes by utilizing a mixture of variable and fixed rate borrowings to finance MMC’s asset base. MMC uses interest rate swaps on a limited basis to manage exposure to interest rate movements on its cash and investments as well as interest expense on borrowings. Rate swaps are only executed with highly creditworthy counterparties. MMC had the following investments and debt instruments subject to variable interest rates: (In millions of dollars) December 31, 2005 Cash and cash equivalents invested in certificates of deposit and time deposits (Note 1) $ 2,020 Fiduciary cash and investments (Note 1) $ 3,795 Variable rate debt outstanding (Note 11) $ 1,076 48 These investments and debt instruments are discussed more fully in the above-indicated notes to the consolidated financial statements. Based on the above balances, if short-term interest rates increase by 10% or 40 basis points over the course of the year, annual interest income, including interest earned on fiduciary funds, would increase by approximately $14 million. However, this would be partially offset by a $3 million increase in interest expense resulting in a net increase to income before income taxes and minority interest of $11 million. Foreign Currency Risk The translated values of revenue and expense from MMC’s international risk and insurance services and consulting operations are subject to fluctuations due to changes in currency exchange rates. We periodically use forward contracts and options to limit foreign currency exchange rate exposure on net income and cash flows for specific, clearly defined transactions arising in the ordinary course of business. Equity Price Risk MMC holds investments in public and private companies, as well as in certain private equity funds managed by Stone Point, including Trident II and Trident III. Publicly traded investments of $143 million are classified as available for sale under SFAS No. 115. Non-publicly traded investments of $54 million and $365 million are accounted for under APB Opinion No. 18, “The Equity Method of Accounting for Investments in Common Stock”, using the cost method and the equity method, respectively. Changes in value of trading securities are recognized in income when they occur. The investments that are classified as available for sale or that are not publicly traded are subject to risk of changes in market value, which if determined to be other than temporary, could result in realized impairment losses. MMC periodically reviews the carrying value of such investments to determine if any valuation adjustments are appropriate under the applicable accounting pronouncements. Other A significant number of lawsuits and regulatory proceedings are pending. See Note 16 to the consolidated financial statements. Management’s Discussion of Critical Accounting Policies The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (“GAAP”) requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue and expenses, and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. Management considers the policies discussed below to be critical to understanding MMC’s financial statements because their application places the most significant demands on management’s judgment, and requires management to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain. Actual results may differ from those estimates. Legal and Other Loss Contingencies MMC and its subsidiaries are subject to numerous claims, lawsuits and proceedings. GAAP requires that liabilities for contingencies be recorded when it is probable that a liability has been incurred before the balance sheet date and the amount can be reasonably estimated. Significant management judgment is required to comply with this guidance. MMC analyzes its litigation exposure based on available information, including consultation with outside counsel handling the defense of these matters, to assess its potential liability. 49 In addition, to the extent that insurance coverage is available, significant management judgment is required to determine the amount of recoveries that are expected under MMC’s various insurance programs. Retirement Benefits MMC maintains qualified and non-qualified defined benefit pension plans for its U.S. and a variety of defined benefit and defined contribution plans for eligible non-U.S. employees. MMC’s policy for funding its tax qualified defined benefit retirement plans is to contribute amounts at least sufficient to meet the funding requirements set forth in U.S. and applicable foreign laws. The determination of net periodic pension cost is based on a number of actuarial assumptions, including an expected long-term rate of return on plan assets, the discount rate and assumed rate of salary increase. Significant assumptions used in the calculation of net periodic pension costs and pension liabilities are disclosed in Note 8 to the consolidated financial statements. MMC believes the assumptions for each plan are reasonable and appropriate and will continue to evaluate actuarial assumptions at least annually and adjust them as appropriate. Pension expense in 2005 increased by $130 million compared with 2004. Based on its current assumptions, MMC expects pension expense to decrease by approximately $12 million in 2006 and currently expects to contribute approximately $145 million to the plans during the year. During 2005 MMC made changes to the U.S. pension plan that were designed to reduce MMC’s benefits costs going forward. The changes, which are effective January 1, 2006, include changing the benefit formula from a final average salary to a career average salary as well as a change in the calculation for early retirement benefits. These changes do not affect pension benefits earned as of December 31, 2005. Future pension expense or credits will depend on plan provisions, future investment performance, future assumptions, and various other factors related to the populations participating in the pension plans. Holding all other assumptions constant, a half-percentage point change in the rate of return and discount rate assumptions would affect net periodic pension cost for the U.S. and U.K. plans, which comprise approximately 90% of total pension plan liabilities, as follows: 0.5 Percentage Point Increase 0.5 Percentage Point Decrease (In millions of dollars) U.S. U.K. U.S. U.K. Assumed Rate of Return $ (13.2 ) $ (21.1 ) $ 13.2 $ 21.1 Discount Rate $ (29.1 ) $ (54.3 ) $ 31.2 $ 57.3 Changing the discount rate and leaving the other assumptions constant may not be representative of the impact on expense, because the long-term rates of inflation and salary increases are correlated with the discount rate. MMC contributes to certain health care and life insurance benefits provided to its retired employees. The cost of these postretirement benefits for employees in the United States is accrued during the period up to the date employees are eligible to retire, but is funded by MMC as incurred. This postretirement liability is included in Other liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets. The key assumptions and sensitivity to changes in the assumed health care cost trend rate are discussed in Note 8 to the consolidated financial statements. 50 Income Taxes MMC’s tax rate reflects its income, statutory tax rates and tax planning in the various jurisdictions in which it operates. Significant judgment is required in determining the annual tax rate and in evaluating tax positions. Tax allowances are established when, despite the belief that the tax return positions are fully supportable, there is the potential that they may be successfully challenged. These allowances, as well as the related interest, are adjusted to reflect changing facts and circumstances. Tax law requires items be included in MMC’s tax returns at different times than the items are reflected in the financial statements. As a result, the annual tax expense reflected in the consolidated statements of income is different than that reported in the tax returns. Some of these differences are permanent, such as expenses that are not deductible in the returns, and some differences are temporary and reverse over time, such as depreciation expense. Temporary differences create deferred tax assets and liabilities. Deferred tax assets generally represent items that can be used as a tax deduction or credit in tax returns in future years for which benefit has already been recorded in the financial statements. Valuation allowances are established for deferred tax assets when it is estimated that future taxable income will be insufficient to use a deduction or credit in that jurisdiction. Deferred tax liabilities generally represent tax expense recognized in the financial statements for which payment has been deferred, or expense for which a deduction has been taken already in the tax return but the expense has not yet been recognized in the financial statements. Share-based Payment Effective July 1, 2005, MMC adopted SFAS 123(R) “Share-based Payment”, which requires, among other things, that the estimated fair value of stock options be charged to earnings. Significant management judgment is required to determine the appropriate assumptions for inputs such as volatility and expected term necessary to estimate option values. In addition, management judgment is required to analyze the terms of the plans and awards granted thereunder to determine if awards will be treated as equity awards or liability awards, as defined by SFAS 123(R). SFAS 123(R) requires that cost resulting from all share-based transactions be recognized in the financial statements. Although the required effective date of adoption for SFAS 123(R) is the first annual reporting period that begins after June 15, 2005, MMC elected to adopt early. MMC adopted SFAS 123(R) using a modified prospective method of adoption, as permitted. Accordingly, prior period amounts have not been restated. Under this method, MMC is required to record compensation expense for all awards granted after the date of adoption and for the unvested portion of previously granted awards that remain outstanding at the date of adoption. The compensation cost recognized for awards granted prior to July 1, 2005 is based on the estimated grant date fair value and expense attribution methodology originally determined under SFAS 123. Prior to the adoption of SFAS 123(R), MMC applied Accounting Principles Board Opinion No. 25, “Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees” (“APB 25”), to account for its stock-based awards. Under APB 25, MMC generally only recorded stock-based compensation expense related to restricted stock, restricted stock units, and deferred stock units. Under the provisions of APB 25, MMC was not required to recognize compensation expense for the cost of stock options or shares issued under the Company’s Employee Stock Purchase Plan (“ESPP”). With the adoption of SFAS 123(R), MMC will record stock-based compensation expense for the cost of stock options and, as described below, shares issued under the ESPP pertaining to the third quarter 2005. In 2005 MMC incurred incremental compensation costs of $64 million, primarily related to stock options as a result of the early adoption of SFAS 123(R) effective July 1, 2005. This incremental cost was recorded as part of corporate expenses. 51 As of December 31, 2005, there was $152 million of unrecognized compensation cost related to MMC’s option awards and $19 million of unrecognized compensation cost related to Putnam’s option awards. The weighted-average periods over which the costs are expected to be recognized are 1.5 years for MMC and 3.5 years for Putnam. Also as of December 31, 2005, there was $219 million of unrecognized compensation cost related to MMC’s restricted stock, restricted stock unit and deferred stock unit awards and $110 million of unrecognized compensation cost related to Putnam’s restricted stock awards. Effective October 1, 2005, certain features in the MMC ESPP were changed so that shares of MMC common stock will be purchased at a price that is 95% of the average market price of the stock on each quarterly purchase date. In accordance with SFAS 123 (R), the ESPP is no longer compensatory beginning October 1, 2005. See Note 9 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding the adoption of SFAS 123(R). Investment Valuation MMC holds investments in both public and private companies, as well as certain private equity funds managed by Stone Point and T.H. Lee. The majority of the public investments are accounted for as available for sale securities under SFAS No. 115. Where applicable, certain investments are accounted for under APB Opinion No. 18. MMC periodically reviews the carrying value of its investments to determine if any valuation adjustments are appropriate under the applicable accounting pronouncements. MMC bases its review on the facts and circumstances as they relate to each investment. Fair value of private equity investments is determined by the Funds’ investment managers. Factors considered in determining the fair value of private equity investments include: implied valuation of recently completed financing rounds that included sophisticated outside investors; performance multiples of comparable public companies; restrictions on the sale or disposal of the investments; trading characteristics of the securities; and the relative size of the holdings in comparison to other private investors and the public market float. In those instances where quoted market prices are not available, particularly for equity holdings in private companies, or formal restrictions limit the sale of securities, significant management judgment is required to determine the appropriate value of MMC’s investments. MMC reviews the appropriateness of valuation results for significant private equity investments with the fund manager. New Accounting Pronouncements New accounting pronouncements are discussed in Note 1 to MMC’s consolidated financial statements. Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk.

62709,MMC,"MARSH & MCLENNAN COMPANIES, INC.",2008,"Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. General Marsh & McLennan Companies, Inc. and Subsidiaries (“MMC”) is a global professional services firm providing advice and solutions in the areas of risk, strategy, and human capital. MMC’s subsidiaries include Marsh, which provides risk and insurance services; Guy Carpenter, which provides reinsurance services; Kroll, which provides risk consulting and technology services; Mercer, which provides human resource and related financial advice and services; and the Oliver Wyman Group, which provides management consulting and other services. MMC’s approximately 56,000 employees worldwide provide analysis, advice and transactional capabilities to clients in over 100 countries. MMC’s business segments are based on the services provided. Risk and Insurance Services includes risk management and insurance and reinsurance broking and services, provided primarily by Marsh and Guy Carpenter. This segment also includes Risk Capital Holdings, which owns investments in private equity funds and insurance and financial services firms. Consulting, which comprises the activities of Mercer and Oliver Wyman Group, includes human resource consulting and related services, and specialized management and economic and brand consulting services. Risk Consulting & Technology, conducted through Kroll, includes risk consulting and related investigative, intelligence, financial, security and technology services. We describe the primary sources of revenue and categories of expense for each segment below, in our discussion of segment financial results. Management evaluates performance based on segment operating income, which reflects expenses directly related to segment operations, but not MMC corporate-level expenses. A reconciliation of segment operating income to total operating income is included in Note 17 to the consolidated financial statements included under Part II, Item 8 of this report. The accounting policies used for each segment are the same as those used for the consolidated financial statements. This MD&A contains forward-looking statements as that term is defined in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. See “Information Concerning Forward-Looking Statements” at the outset of this report. Significant Developments MMC’s financial results and financial position reflect, among other items: n the disposal of Putnam on August 3, 2007. MMC’s cash proceeds following the payment of taxes approached $2.5 billion. An after-tax gain of $1.9 billion on the sale of Putnam along with its 2007 and comparative results of operations are included in discontinued operations; n the execution of two accelerated share repurchase transactions totaling $1.3 billion. The first transaction, for $500 million, was initiated in May 2007 and completed in July 2007 with MMC receiving a total of 16.02 million shares. The second transaction, for $800 million, was initiated in August 2007. MMC received an initial delivery of 21.32 million shares in August 2007, which were reflected as a reduction in shares outstanding upon receipt. MMC expects to receive an additional 10.7 million shares when the repurchase period for this transaction concludes in March 2008; n restructuring charges and savings related to a number of restructuring initiatives; n the continued decline in market service revenues in the risk and insurance services segment for business placed prior to October 1, 2004. Market services revenue declined to $3 million in 2007 as compared with $43 million and $114 million in 2006 and 2005, respectively; and n compensation charges resulting from the departure of MMC’s former CEO and Marsh’s former CEO. 23 Table of Contents Consolidated Results of Operations For the Years Ended December 31, (In millions, except per share figures) 2007 2006 2005 Revenue: Service revenue $ 11,187 $ 10,350 $ 9,902 Investment income (loss) 163 197 180 Operating revenue 11,350 10,547 10,082 Expense: Compensation and benefits 7,030 6,515 6,327 Other operating expenses 3,301 2,877 3,165 Operating expenses 10,331 9,392 9,492 Operating income $ 1,019 $ 1,155 $ 590 Income from Continuing Operations $ 538 $ 632 $ 201 Discontinued Operations, net of tax 1,937 358 203 Net income $ 2,475 $ 990 $ 404 Income from Continuing Operations Per Share: Basic $ 1.00 $ 1.15 $ 0.37 Diluted $ 0.99 $ 1.14 $ 0.37 Net Income Per Share: Basic $ 4.60 $ 1.80 $ 0.75 Diluted $ 4.53 $ 1.76 $ 0.74 Average number of shares outstanding: Basic 539 549 538 Diluted 546 557 543 Shares outstanding at December 31, 520 552 546 Consolidated operating income was $1 billion in 2007, a decrease of $136 million or 12% from the prior year. An increase in consulting segment operating income of 30% to $606 million was more than offset by decreases in risk and insurance services and risk consulting and technology. In addition, corporate expenses increased $63 million over the prior year, primarily due to a credit of $74 million in the prior year related to the gain on disposal of five floors in MMC’s New York headquarters building, and $14 million of incremental compensation costs in the current year related to the departure of MMC’s former CEO. Consolidated net income increased to $2.5 billion in 2007 compared with $1.0 billion in the prior year, resulting from a $1.9 billion gain on the disposal of Putnam recorded in discontinued operations. In 2006, the net gain from disposals of discontinued operations was $172 million, primarily related to SCMS. 24 Table of Contents Consolidated Revenues and Expenses MMC conducts business in many countries, as a result of which the impact of foreign exchange rate movements may impact period-to-period comparisons of revenue. Similarly, the revenue impact of acquisitions and dispositions may impact period-to-period comparisons of revenue. Underlying revenue measures the change in revenue from one period to another by isolating these impacts. The impact of foreign currency exchange fluctuations, acquisitions and dispositions on MMC’s operating revenues by segment is as follows: Year Ended Components of Revenue Change December 31, % Change Acquisitions/ (In millions, except percentage figures) 2007 2006 GAAP Revenue Currency Impact Dispositions Impact Underlying Revenue Risk and Insurance Services Insurance Services $ 4,500 $ 4,390 3 % 4 % — (1 )% Reinsurance Services 902 880 2 % 1 % — 1 % Risk Capital Holdings (a) 163 193 (16 )% — — (16 )% Total Risk and Insurance Services 5,565 5,463 2 % 3 % — (1 )% Consulting Mercer 3,368 3,021 11 % 4 % — 7 % Oliver Wyman Group 1,516 1,204 26 % 5 % 3 % 18 % Total Consulting 4,884 4,225 16 % 5 % 1 % 10 % Risk Consulting & Technology 995 979 2 % 2 % (1 )% 1 % Total Operating Segments $ 11,444 $ 10,667 7 % 4 % — 3 % Corporate/Eliminations (94 ) (120 ) Total Revenue $ 11,350 $ 10,547 8 % 4 % — 4 % Year Ended Components of Revenue Change December 31, % Change Acquisitions/ (In millions, except percentage figures) 2006 2005 GAAPRevenue Currency Impact Dispositions Impact Underlying Revenue Risk and Insurance Services Insurance Services $ 4,390 $ 4,567 (4 )% — (2 )% (2 )% Reinsurance Services 880 836 5 % — — 5 % Risk Capital Holdings (a) 193 189 2 % — (5 )% 7 % Total Risk and Insurance Services 5,463 5,592 (2 )% — (2 )% — Consulting Mercer 3,021 2,794 8 % 1 % — 7 % Oliver Wyman Group 1,204 1,008 19 % 1 % 2 % 16 % Total Consulting 4,225 3,802 11 % 1 % 1 % 9 % Risk Consulting & Technology 979 872 12 % — 3 % 9 % Total Operating Segments $ 10,667 $ 10,266 4 % — — 4 % Corporate/Eliminations (120 ) (184 ) Total Revenue $ 10,547 $ 10,082 5 % — — 5 % (a) Risk Capital Holdings owns MMC’s investments in private equity funds, insurance and financial services firms. Revenue Consolidated revenue for 2007 increased 8% to $11.4 billion compared with 2006, reflecting a 4% increase in underlying revenue and a 4% positive impact of foreign currency translation. Revenue in the risk and insurance services segment increased 2% compared with 2006. Underlying revenue decreased 1% for the total risk and insurance services segment, reflecting a 1% increase in Reinsurance Services, a 1% decrease in Insurance Services partially reflecting a $40 million decrease 25 Table of Contents in market service revenue, and a 16% decrease in Risk Capital Holdings. Consulting revenue increased 16%, resulting from an 11% increase in Mercer’s businesses and 26% growth in the Oliver Wyman Group businesses. On an underlying basis, revenue increased 7% in Mercer, 18% in Oliver Wyman Group and 10% for the consulting segment in total. Revenue increased 2% in risk consulting & technology, 1% on an underlying basis. In 2006, risk and insurance services revenue decreased 2% compared with 2005 and was flat on an underlying basis. A 5% increase in underlying revenue in reinsurance services was offset by a 2% decrease in insurance services, partly resulting from a $71 million decline in market service revenue. Risk consulting & technology revenue increased 12% due to growth in Kroll’s corporate advisory and restructuring, technology services and security businesses. Consulting revenue increased 11%, resulting from a 19% increase in the Oliver Wyman Group businesses and an 8% increase at Mercer. Operating Expenses Consolidated operating expenses in 2007 increased 10% compared with 2006. Operating expenses increased 5% on an underlying basis in 2007 compared with 2006. The increase in underlying expenses is due to higher compensation and benefit costs driven by consulting due to increased volume across all operating companies, increased advertising, primarily in insurance services, and favorable professional liability experience in 2006. Consolidated operating expenses in 2006 decreased 1% from 2005. The decrease in operating expenses reflects cost savings from restructuring activities; a decrease in net restructuring and related charges; lower settlement, legal and regulatory costs related to proceedings involving MMC and certain of its subsidiaries; and lower costs related to employee retention awards, partly offset by higher compensation costs, primarily in the consulting segment due to increased headcount and higher incentive compensation. Expenses in 2006 also reflect lower costs related to professional liability claims. These decreases in 2006 were partly offset by higher expenses related to stock options. Due to the adoption of SFAS 123(R) on July 1, 2005, expenses related to stock options were recorded for only six months in 2005 while 2006 includes stock option expense for the full year. In 2006, the costs related to stock options are included in segment results. In 2005, the costs related to stock options are included in Corporate. Restructuring and Related Activities MMC initiated restructuring activities in the first quarter of 2005 (the “2005 Plan”) and the third quarter of 2006. In 2007 we incurred net restructuring costs of $98 million and related charges of $21 million, primarily accelerated amortization, from actions taken under these restructuring plans. The costs and annualized savings relating to the plans are discussed below. 2005 Plan MMC’s actions under the 2005 Plan are complete. MMC is currently realizing annualized savings of approximately $400 million attributable to the 2005 Plan relating primarily to the risk and insurance services segment. In early 2006, MMC began implementing its plan to eliminate excess space in its corporate headquarters building in mid-town New York. Costs related to its headquarters building incurred through June 30, 2006 (approximately $40 million) and savings generated from those actions (approximately $10 million) were recognized as part of the 2005 Plan. 2006 Cost-Savings Initiative In September 2006, MMC announced a cost-savings initiative related to firm-wide infrastructure, organization structure and operating company business processes. The first phase of this initiative began in September 2006. As previously reported, MMC’s actions under the first phase are substantially complete, except for certain actions related to MMC’s headquarters building. From inception through December 31, 2007, MMC incurred total costs of $56 million related to the first phase, consisting of $20 million of 26 Table of Contents restructuring charges ($10 million of which were incurred in 2007) and related charges totaling $36 million ($21 million of which were incurred in 2007, primarily related to accelerated amortization of leasehold improvements). The restructuring charges are net of a $74 million gain on the sale of 5 floors of MMC’s New York headquarters building recorded in the fourth quarter of 2006. The actions completed under this first phase of the 2006 cost-savings initiatives have resulted in annualized savings of approximately $135 million. Separate from the 2006 cost-savings initiative, Marsh identified actions that resulted in the elimination of approximately 170 employee positions through staff reductions and attrition. These actions have resulted in annualized savings of approximately $40 million. Through December 31, 2007 these actions by Marsh have resulted in charges of $53 million; $39 million of these charges were recorded in 2007. In the fourth quarter of 2007, Marsh took additional actions that resulted in the elimination of 84 positions and annualized savings of $12 million. These actions resulted in charges of $16 million for severance and related benefits. Putnam Transaction On August 3, 2007, Great-West Lifeco Inc. completed its purchase of Putnam Investments Trust for $3.9 billion in cash. The purchase includes Putnam’s interest in the T.H. Lee private equity business. After the payment of taxes in December 2007, the cash proceeds to MMC after minority interest approached $2.5 billion. The transaction resulted in a pre-tax gain of $3.0 billion ($1.9 billion after tax), which is included in discontinued operations. Putnam’s results of operations through August 2, 2007 and results for prior years are included in discontinued operations in the accompanying consolidated statements of income. Putnam’s assets and liabilities are reported as discontinued operations in the accompanying balance sheet at December 31, 2006. Other Businesses Exited During 2006, MMC completed the sale of several businesses: SCMS in January 2006; Price Forbes in September 2006; and KSI in December 2006. The gain or loss on disposal of these businesses, including any charges to reduce the carrying value to fair value less cost to sell, are included in discontinued operations in 2006. The operating results of each of the businesses, through the date of sale or disposal, are included in discontinued operations in 2005 except for the 2005 results of Price Forbes, which were insignificant to MMC’s results for that year. In 2005, Marsh completed the sale of Crump Group Inc. The gain on disposal of Crump, as well as its results of operations through the date of disposal, are included in discontinued operations in 2005. Risk and Insurance Services In the Risk and Insurance Services segment, MMC’s subsidiaries and other affiliated entities act as brokers, agents or consultants for insureds, insurance underwriters and other brokers in the areas of risk management, insurance broking and insurance program management services, primarily under the name of Marsh; and engage in reinsurance broking, catastrophe and financial modeling services and related advisory functions, primarily under the name of Guy Carpenter. Risk Capital Holdings owns investments in private equity funds and insurance and financial firms. Marsh and Guy Carpenter are compensated for brokerage and consulting services primarily through fees paid by clients and/or commissions paid out of premiums charged by insurance and reinsurance companies. Commission rates vary in amount depending upon the type of insurance or reinsurance coverage provided, the particular insurer or reinsurer, the capacity in which the broker acts and negotiations with clients. Revenues are affected by premium rate levels in the insurance/reinsurance markets, the amount of risk retained by insurance and reinsurance clients themselves and by the value of the risks that have been insured since commission based compensation is frequently related to the premiums paid by insureds/reinsureds. In many cases, compensation may be negotiated in advance, based on the types and amounts of risks to be analyzed by MMC and ultimately placed into the 27 Table of Contents insurance market or retained by the client. The trends and comparisons of revenue from one period to the next will therefore be affected by changes in premium rate levels, fluctuations in client risk retention, and increases or decreases in the value of risks that have been insured, as well as new and lost business, and the volume of business from new and existing clients. Effective October 1, 2004, Marsh eliminated contingent compensation, or market services agreements with insurers, under which it had received revenues based upon such factors as the overall volume, growth and, in some cases, profitability, of the total business placed by Marsh with a given insurer. Marsh and Guy Carpenter receive interest income on certain funds (such as premiums and claims proceeds) held in a fiduciary capacity for others. The investment of fiduciary funds is regulated by state and other insurance authorities. These regulations typically provide for segregation of fiduciary funds and limit the types of investments that may be made with them. Interest income from these investments varies depending on the amount of funds invested and applicable interest rates, both of which vary from time to time. Following the sale of MMC Capital’s business in May 2005, we no longer receive fees in connection with the private equity investments previously managed by MMC Capital, nor do we receive management fees or origination fees related to this business, except that MMC retained the right to receive certain performance fees relating to the Trident II private equity partnership. We continue to receive dividends and to recognize capital appreciation or depreciation on the investments held by Risk Capital Holdings, as well as revenue on Risk Capital Holdings’ sales of investments from time to time. Based on recent security market levels, revenue for Risk Capital Holdings is expected to continue to be volatile on a quarter-to-quarter basis and substantially lower in 2008 as compared to 2007. The results of operations for the risk and insurance services segment are presented below: (In millions of dollars) 2007 2006 2005 Service Revenue $ 5,402 $ 5,267 $ 5,412 Investment Income (loss) 163 196 180 Revenue 5,565 5,463 5,592 Compensation and Benefits 3,353 3,238 3,399 Other Operating Expenses 1,705 1,548 1,888 Expense 5,058 4,786 5,287 Operating Income $ 507 $ 677 $ 305 Operating Margin 9.1 % 12.4 % 5.5 % Revenue Revenue in risk and insurance services increased 2% in 2007 compared with 2006, reflecting the positive impact of foreign currency exchange fluctuations, partly offset by a 1% decrease in underlying revenue. In insurance services, revenue increased 3% from last year, reflecting a 4% positive impact of currency translation and a 1% decrease in underlying revenue. For the full year, Marsh’s new business production increased 5% on an underlying basis in 2007 compared with 2006. Premium rate declines in the commercial insurance marketplace continued to accelerate during the year. On a geographic basis, Marsh revenue included $2.4 billion in the Americas, $1.7 billion in EMEA and $388 million in Asia Pacific, compared with $2.4 billion, $1.6 billion and $348 million in the respective geographies in 2006. Reinsurance services revenue increased 2% in 2007 compared to 2006 and 1% on an underlying basis. These results were achieved despite a significant decline in U.S. property catastrophe rates as well as higher risk retentions by clients. Risk Capital Holdings’ revenue was $163 million in 2007 compared with $193 million in 2006. Risk Capital Holdings’ revenue in 2007 relates primarily to mark-to-market gains on private equity fund investments and gains from the sales of investments. Revenue from Risk Capital Holdings is expected 28 Table of Contents to continue to be volatile on a quarter-to-quarter basis and substantially lower in 2008 as compared to 2007. Effective January 1, 2007, Marsh managed certain businesses (formerly part of Risk Consulting & Technology) which had revenue of $16 million in 2007. Revenue from these businesses was $25 million in 2006, and is reflected as part of Risk Consulting & Technology. Revenue in risk and insurance services decreased 2% in 2006 compared with 2005 and was flat on an underlying basis. Higher revenue in reinsurance services and Risk Capital Holdings was offset by a decrease in insurance services. In December 2006, MMC, through its subsidiary Risk Capital Holdings, contributed its limited partnership interest in Trident III, valued at $182 million, to MMC’s U.K. pension fund. The transaction was recorded at the estimated fair value of MMC’s investment on the date of the contribution. Risk Capital Holdings’ revenue in 2006 included $38 million of mark-to-market gains for Trident III recognized through the date of the contribution. Expense Expenses in the risk and insurance services segment increased 6% in 2007 over the prior year. The increase in expenses reflects higher salary costs due to increased headcount during the second half of the year; the impact of foreign currency exchange fluctuations; costs associated with Marsh’s advertising campaign initiated in the Spring of 2007; incremental expenses related to the departure of Marsh’s former CEO; and the effect of favorable professional liability experience in 2006. These increases were partly offset by lower restructuring and related costs versus 2006 and reduced incentive compensation accruals. In 2006, expenses in the risk and insurance services segment decreased 9% over the prior year. The decrease reflects cost savings from restructuring; a decrease in restructuring charges from $257 million in 2005 to $100 million in 2006; a decrease of $45 million in settlement, legal and regulatory costs related to market services agreements and associated shareholder and policyholder litigation; and a decrease of $78 million related to employee retention awards. In addition, 2006 expenses reflect lower incentive compensation costs and lower costs related to professional liability claims. Partly offsetting these decreases were costs of $47 million in 2006 related to employee stock options which were not charged to the segment in 2005. Consulting MMC conducts business in its Consulting segment through two main business groups. Mercer includes practice groups specializing in retirement and investments, outsourcing, health and benefits and talent. The Oliver Wyman Group provides specialized management and economic and brand consulting services. The major component of Consulting’s revenue, in both Mercer and the Oliver Wyman Group, is fees paid by clients for advice and services. Mercer, principally through its health & benefits line of business, also earns revenue in the form of commissions received from insurance companies for the placement of group (and occasionally individual) insurance contracts, primarily life, health and accident coverages. Revenue for Mercer’s discretionary investment management business and certain of Mercer’s outsourcing business defined contribution administration services consists principally of fees based on assets under administration. Revenue in the consulting segment is affected by, among other things, global economic conditions, including changes in clients’ particular industries and markets. Revenue is also subject to competition due to the introduction of new products and services, broad trends in employee demographics, the effect of government policies and regulations, and fluctuations in interest and foreign exchange rates. Revenues from the provision of discretionary investment management services and retirement trust and administrative services are significantly affected by securities market performance. 29 Table of Contents The results of operations for the consulting segment are presented below: (In millions of dollars) 2007 2006 2005 Service Revenue $ 4,884 $ 4,224 $ 3,802 Investment Income — 1 — Revenue 4,884 4,225 3,802 Compensation and Benefits 2,951 2,647 2,330 Other Operating Expenses 1,327 1,112 1,021 Expense 4,278 3,759 3,351 Operating Income $ 606 $ 466 $ 451 Operating Margin 12.4 % 11.0 % 11.9 % Revenue Consulting revenue in 2007 increased 16% compared with 2006 comprising 11% growth at Mercer and 26% growth at Oliver Wyman Group. Revenue for the segment increased 10% on an underlying basis. Within Mercer, the revenue increase of 11%, reflects growth in retirement and investment of 13%, health and benefits of 6%, outsourcing of 15% and talent of 10%. Mercer grew 7% on an underlying basis. The Oliver Wyman Group grew 26%, or 18% on an underlying basis, compared with the same period last year. Management, economic and brand consulting all produced double digit growth. Consulting revenue in 2006 increased 11% compared with 2005. Revenue for Mercer increased 8%, or 7% on an underlying basis driven by strong growth in retirement and investments, and talent. Oliver Wyman Group revenues grew 19%, 16% on an underlying basis. Each of the Oliver Wyman Group practices contributed to this performance, led by management consulting which increased underlying revenues 18%. Expense Consulting expenses increased 14% in 2007 compared with 2006, reflecting higher compensation costs due to an increased volume of business, higher incentive compensation commensurate with improved operating performance and the impact of foreign currency translation. Consulting expenses increased 12% in 2006 compared with 2005. The expense increase reflects restructuring charges of $27 million, the impact of acquisitions and higher compensation costs due in part to increased staff levels. In addition, expenses in 2006 include costs of $41 million related to employee stock options which were not charged to the segment in 2005. Risk Consulting & Technology MMC’s Risk Consulting & Technology segment primarily consists of Kroll and its subsidiaries. Kroll services fall into two major product lines: consulting services, which includes risk consulting, corporate advisory & restructuring and security; and technology enabled solutions. Kroll receives compensation primarily in the form of fees paid by clients. These fees are typically earned on an hourly, project, fixed fee or per-unit basis. Kroll’s revenue is subject to changes in international economic and regulatory conditions. Some of Kroll’s revenue sources are counter-cyclical to the performance of the economy in general. These sources may include, for example, fees from restructuring, turnaround and forensic engagements relating to commercial bankruptcies and bond defaults. Kroll is also subject to normal competitive forces such as pricing pressures, demand for professional staff and new product development on the part of competitors, particularly in technology services. 30 Table of Contents The results of operations for the risk consulting & technology segment are presented below: (In millions of dollars) 2007 2006 2005 Revenue $ 995 $ 979 $ 872 Compensation and Benefits 506 466 406 Other Operating Expenses 383 364 345 Expense 889 830 751 Operating Income $ 106 $ 149 $ 121 Operating Margin 10.7 % 15.2 % 13.9 % Revenue Risk consulting and technology revenues increased 2% compared with 2006, and 1% on an underlying basis. Revenue in Kroll’s technology operations rose 13% to $569 million, led by the Kroll Ontrack legal technology unit and Kroll’s background screening business. Revenues in Kroll’s consulting business decreased 10% to $426 million. The decline in Kroll’s consulting revenue reflects continued weak demand for Kroll’s corporate restructuring services, including lower client success fees for completed engagements compared with 2006. Risk consulting & technology revenues increased 12% in 2006 compared with 2005, and 9% on an underlying basis. The technology services group, Kroll’s largest business unit, increased revenues by 12%. Effective January 1, 2007, Kroll transferred to Marsh certain businesses which had revenue of $25 million in 2006. Revenue for the risk consulting and technology segment in 2006 has not been restated for this transfer. In the fourth quarter of 2006, Kroll completed the sale of KSI, an international security operation that provided high-risk asset and personal protection services. The financial results of KSI are included in discontinued operations and are not included in the segment’s results for any year presented. Expense Risk consulting and technology expenses in 2007 increased 7% compared with 2006 partially due to the impact of foreign exchange fluctuations. The increase reflects higher compensation related to the increased volume of business for Kroll’s Ontrack and background screening operations, as well as higher compensation in the corporate advisory and restructuring business to retain key professional staff in anticipation of future increased activity. Also, expenses in 2006 included a credit related to the early termination of a licensing agreement. Risk consulting & technology expenses increased 11% in 2006 compared with 2005. Approximately half of the increase results from acquisitions and the impact of foreign currency fluctuation. The remaining increase reflects higher compensation in the corporate advisory and restructuring and the background screening businesses, as well as increased costs for outside services in the background screening business due to a higher volume of business. The increases discussed above are partly offset by a credit in 2006 related to the early termination of a licensing agreement. Discontinued Operations Results of discontinued operations includes the gain on the sale of Putnam as well as Putnam’s operating income through August 2, 2007 and the operating income from Putnam, SCMS, KSI and Price Forbes for 2006 and 2005. The gain on the disposal of Crump and Crump’s operating income are included in discontinued operations in 2005. In addition, discontinued operations in 2006 also includes the gain on disposal of SCMS and a charge to reduce the carrying value of Price Forbes’ assets to fair value. 31 Table of Contents The following depicts the results of discontinued operations including revenue and expense detail for Putnam: (In millions of dollars) 2007 2006 2005 Putnam: Revenue $ 798 $ 1,385 $ 1,506 Expense 636 1,082 1,243 Operating Income 162 303 263 Minority interest and other discontinued operations (2 ) 1 43 Provision for income tax 71 118 117 Income from discontinued operations, net of tax 89 186 189 Gain on disposal of discontinued operations 2,965 298 55 Provision for income tax 1,117 126 41 Gain on disposal of discontinued operations, net of tax 1,848 172 14 Discontinued operations, net of tax $ 1,937 $ 358 $ 203 MMC’s gain on the Putnam transaction increased diluted earnings per share $3.38 for the year ended December 31, 2007. In 2006, discontinued operations included an after-tax net gain of $179 million related to the gain on disposal of SCMS and charges related to Price Forbes and KSI, which increased diluted earnings per share for the year ended December 31, 2007 by approximately $0.32. 32 Table of Contents Corporate Items Corporate Expenses Corporate expenses were $200 million in 2007, compared to $137 million in 2006. These costs include $42 million for restructuring and related charges in 2007, compared with a credit of $31 million of such items in 2006 that included a $74 million gain on the sale of five floors in MMC’s headquarters building. In 2007, corporate expenses included incremental costs of $14 million related to the departure of MMC’s former CEO that were offset by a credit from an accrual adjustment related to the separation of former MMC senior executives. Corporate expenses of $137 million in 2006 were $150 million lower than in 2005. The decrease is primarily due to the impact of stock option expense, which was recorded as a corporate charge in 2005 and was charged to the business segments in 2006, and lower net restructuring charges, largely resulting from a gain on the disposal of five floors in MMC’s headquarters building, partly offset by higher professional services fees. Interest Interest income earned on corporate funds amounted to $95 million in 2007, an increase of $35 million from 2006. The increase in interest income reflects generally higher average interest rates in 2007 compared with 2006, and higher invested balances during the second half of the year resulting from the receipt of proceeds from the Putnam transaction. Interest expense of $267 million in 2007 decreased from $303 million from 2006. The decrease in interest expense is primarily due to a decrease in the average level of debt compared to the prior year. Interest income earned on corporate funds amounted to $60 million in 2006, an increase of $16 million from 2005. The increase in interest income reflected the combination of higher average corporate cash balances and generally higher average interest rates in 2006 compared with the prior year. Interest expense of $303 million in 2006 decreased from $332 million in 2005. The decrease in interest expense is primarily due to $34 million recorded in the third quarter of 2005 for the prepayment charge incurred in connection with the refinancing of the mortgage on MMC’s headquarters building in New York. Income Taxes MMC’s consolidated effective tax rate was 34.9% in 2007 compared to 29.8% in 2006. The change primarily reflects the unfavorable impact of international tax law changes in 2007 and the release of valuation allowances on certain deferred tax assets in 2006. MMC’s consolidated effective tax rate was 29.8% in 2006 compared to 31.4% in 2005. The change primarily reflects the release of valuation allowances on certain deferred tax assets, partly offset by a change in the geographic mix of MMC’s earnings and an adjustment of the 2005 tax provision estimates to the tax return amount. The effective tax rate is sensitive to the geographic mix of MMC’s earnings, which may have a favorable or unfavorable impact on the rate. Furthermore, losses in certain jurisdictions cannot be offset by earnings from other operations, and may result in the need for valuation allowances against deferred taxes which would affect the rate. MMC adopted the provisions of FASB Interpretation No. 48, “Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes – an interpretation of FASB Statement No. 109” (“FIN 48”), which clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income tax positions. Uncertain tax positions are evaluated based upon the facts and circumstances that exist at each reporting period. Subsequent changes in judgment resulting from new information may lead to changes in recognition, derecognition, and measurement. Adjustments may result, for example, upon resolution of an issue with the taxing authorities, or expiration of a statute of limitations barring an assessment for an issue. Such adjustments could have a material impact on MMC’s effective tax rate, net income, and cash flows in a particular future period. 33 Table of Contents Liquidity and Capital Resources MMC’s routine liquidity needs are primarily for current operating expenses, capital expenditures, servicing debt, pension obligations, paying dividends on outstanding stock and funding acquisitions. As a holding company, our primary source for meeting these requirements is cash flows from our operating subsidiaries. Other sources of liquidity include borrowing facilities discussed below in Financing Cash Flows. Cash on our consolidated balance sheets includes funds available for general corporate purposes. Funds held on behalf of clients in a fiduciary capacity are segregated and shown separately in the consolidated balance sheet as an offset to fiduciary liabilities. Fiduciary funds cannot be used for general corporate purposes, and should not be considered as a source of liquidity for MMC. Operating Cash Flows MMC used $231 million of cash for operations in 2007 compared with generating $878 million in 2006. These amounts reflect the net income earned by MMC during those periods, excluding gains or losses from the disposition of businesses and the gain on the sale of five floors from the MMC headquarters building; adjusted for non-cash charges and changes in working capital which relate, primarily, to the timing of payments for accrued liabilities or receipts of assets. Payment of accrued liabilities in 2007 includes approximately $170 million for regulatory settlements and tax payments of $933 million related to the disposition of businesses, primarily Putnam. Comparable items in 2006 include payments of approximately $270 million for regulatory settlements and tax payments of $136 million related to the disposition of businesses. Although the cash proceeds from the Putnam transaction are included in investing cash flows, SFAS 95 specifies that the related payment of taxes be included in operating cash flows and not allocated to other cash flow categories. MMC has funding requirements for its U.S. non-qualified and non-U.S. pension plans in 2008 of approximately $20 million and $255 million, respectively. MMC’s policy for funding its tax qualified defined benefit retirement plans is to contribute amounts at least sufficient to meet the funding requirements set forth in U.S. and applicable foreign law. There currently is no ERISA funding requirement for the U.S. qualified plan in 2007 or in 2008. Funding requirements for non-U.S. plans vary by country. Contribution rates are determined by the local actuaries based on local funding practices and requirements. Funding amounts may be influenced by future asset performance, the level of discount rates and other variables impacting the assets and/or liabilities of the plan. In addition, amounts funded in the future, to the extent not due under regulatory requirements, may be affected by alternative uses of MMC’s cash flows, including dividends, investments, and share repurchases. During 2007, MMC contributed approximately $20 million to the U.S. pension plans and $189 million to the significant non-U.S. pension plans, compared with $20 million for U.S. plans and $319 million for significant non-U.S. plans in 2006. The contribution to the non-U.S. plans in 2006 includes a non-cash contribution of MMC’s investment in Trident III, a private equity limited partnership. The contribution was recorded based on the estimated fair value on the date of the contribution of $182 million. In September 2006, the FASB issued SFAS 158. SFAS 158 requires that MMC recognize on a prospective basis the funded status of its overfunded defined benefit pension and retiree medical plans (the “Plans”) as a net benefit plan asset and its unfunded and underfunded Plans as a net benefit plan liability. The offsetting adjustment to the amount of assets and liabilities required to be recognized is recorded in Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income, net of tax, in MMC’s 2006 year-end balance sheet. Subsequent changes in the funded status will be recognized through the income statement and other comprehensive income in the year in which they occur as appropriate. MMC adopted the provisions of SFAS 158, prospectively, on December 31, 2006. The impact of adopting SFAS 158 resulted in a reduction in assets of $660 million and an increase in liabilities of $245 million, including a related adjustment to tax benefits of $423 million. The net impact of adopting SFAS 158 was a reduction of MMC’s stockholders’ equity of $905 million in 2006 (or $804 million including an adjustment for the impact of recording a reduction to the minimum pension liability prior to the adoption of SFAS 158). In 2007, the improved funded status of the Plans resulted in a net increase to equity of $708 million. The change in funded status of the Plans is impacted by numerous items, including actual 34 Table of Contents results compared with prior estimates and assumptions, contributions to the Plans, and changes in assumptions to reflect information available at the respective measurement dates. In 2007, the funded status of MMC’s Plans was significantly impacted by an increase in the discount rates used in the measurement of the pension liabilities at December 31, 2007, reflecting a general widening of credit spreads on high quality corporate debt obligations and by contributions and asset returns. Financing Cash Flows Net cash used for financing activities was $2.6 billion in 2007 compared with $759 million of net cash used for financing activities in 2006. During 2007, MMC repurchased $1.3 billion of its common stock and reduced outstanding debt by approximately $1.1 billion. These actions are discussed more fully below. Share Repurchases In August 2007, MMC entered into an $800 million accelerated share repurchase agreement with a financial institution counterparty. Under the terms of the agreement, MMC paid the full $800 million purchase price and took delivery from the counterparty of an initial tranche of 21,320,530 shares of MMC common stock, which were reflected as an increase in Treasury shares (a decrease in shares outstanding) on the delivery date. This number of shares was the quotient of the $800 million purchase price divided by a contractual “cap” price of $37.5225 per share. Based on the final average share price during the settlement period less a discount, it is expected that approximately 10.7 million additional shares will be delivered to MMC in March 2008. This transaction was effected under a $1.5 billion share repurchase authorization granted by MMC’s Board of Directors in August 2007. MMC remains authorized to repurchase additional shares of its common stock up to a value of $700 million. There is no time limit on this authorization. In May 2007, MMC entered into a $500 million accelerated share repurchase agreement with a financial institution counterparty. Under the terms of the agreement, MMC paid the full $500 million purchase price and took delivery from the counterparty of an initial tranche of 13,464,749 shares of MMC common stock. Based on the market price of MMC’s common stock over the subsequent settlement period, in July 2007 the counterparty delivered to MMC an additional 2,555,519 shares for no additional payment and the transaction was concluded. MMC thus repurchased a total of 16,020,268 shares in the transaction, for a total cost of $500 million and an average price per share to MMC of $31.2105. The repurchased shares were reflected as an increase in Treasury shares (a decrease in shares outstanding) on the respective delivery dates. This transaction was effected under a $500 million share repurchase authorization granted by MMC’s Board of Directors in May 2007. MMC made no share repurchases in 2006. Debt Repayment During 2007, MMC utilized commercial paper and bank borrowings, as well as cash on hand, to manage liquidity, including the funding of maturing bonds and the repurchase of shares. In the first quarter of 2007, MMC’s 5.375%, five-year $500 million senior notes matured. MMC’s three-year floating rate $500 million senior notes matured in the third quarter of 2007. MMC used a portion of its proceeds from the Putnam transaction to pay down outstanding commercial paper and revolving credit facility borrowings. At December 31, 2007, no commercial paper or revolving credit facility borrowings were outstanding. MMC and certain of its foreign subsidiaries maintain a $1.2 billion multi-currency revolving credit facility. Subsidiary borrowings under the facility are unconditionally guaranteed by MMC. The facility will expire in December 2010. There were no borrowings outstanding under this facility at December 31, 2007. MMC’s senior debt is currently rated Baa2 by Moody’s and BBB- by Standard & Poor’s. MMC’s short-term debt is currently rated P-2 by Moody’s and A-3 by Standard & Poor’s. MMC carries a stable outlook from both Moody’s and Standard & Poor’s. In December 2007, Standard & Poor’s lowered its rating on MMC’s long-term debt from BBB to BBB- and lowered the rating on MMC’s short-term debt from A-2 to A-3. 35 Table of Contents MMC also maintains other credit facilities, guarantees and letters of credit with various banks, primarily related to operations located outside the United States, aggregating $265 million at December 31, 2007 and $269 million at December 31, 2006. There were no outstanding borrowings under these facilities at December 31, 2007. Dividends MMC paid total dividends of $413 million in 2007 ($0.76 per share) and $374 million ($0.68 per share) in 2006. In January 2008, the board of directors approved an increase to MMC’s quarterly cash dividend to 20 cents per share from 19 cents paid previously. Investing Cash Flows Net cash provided by investing activities amounted to $2.8 billion in 2007 primarily due to the Putnam transaction. This compares with $136 million of net cash used for investing activities in 2006. Cash generated by the sale of SCMS totaled $326 million in 2006. Cash used for acquisitions totaled $206 million in 2007 compared with $221 million in 2006. Remaining deferred cash payments of approximately $32 million related to acquisitions completed in 2007 and prior years are recorded in Accounts payable and accrued liabilities or in Other liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets at December 31, 2007. Cash provided by the sale of securities of $78 million in 2007 was partly offset by cash used to purchase investments of $44 million. In 2006, cash used to purchase investments of $193 million was partly offset by the sale of securities of $118 million in 2007. MMC’s additions to fixed assets and capitalized software, which amounted to $378 million in 2007 and $307 million in 2006, primarily relate to computer equipment purchases, the refurbishing and modernizing of office facilities and software development costs. MMC has committed to potential future investments of approximately $81 million in connection with its investments in Trident II and other funds managed by Stone Point Capital, LLC. The majority of MMC’s investment commitments for funds managed by Stone Point Capital, LLC are related to Trident II, the investment period for which is now closed for new investments. Any remaining capital calls for Trident II would relate to follow-on investments in existing portfolio companies or for management fees or other partnership expenses. Significant future capital calls related to Trident II are not expected. Although it is anticipated that Trident II will be harvesting its remaining portfolio in 2008 and thereafter, the timing of any portfolio company sales and capital distributions is unknown and not controlled by MMC. Commitments and Obligations MMC’s contractual obligations of the types identified in the table below were of the following amounts as of December 31, 2007: Payment due by Period Contractual Obligations (In millions of dollars) Total Within 1 Year 1-3Years 4-5 Years After5 Years Current portion of long-term debt $ 260 $ 260 $ — $ — $ — Long-term debt 3,608 — 969 267 2,372 NYAG/NYSID settlement 170 170 — — — Net operating leases 3,028 370 645 520 1,493 Service agreements 133 58 42 24 9 Other long-term obligations 39 26 13 — — Total $ 7,238 $ 884 $ 1,669 $ 811 $ 3,874 The above does not include unrecognized tax benefits of $351 million, accounted for under FIN 48, as MMC is unable to reasonably predict the timing of settlement of these liabilities, other than approximately $86 million that may become payable during 2008. The above does not include liabilities established under FIN 45 as MMC is unable to reasonably predict the timing of settlement of these liabilities. 36 Table of Contents Market Risk and Credit Risk Certain of MMC’s revenues, expenses, assets and liabilities are exposed to the impact of interest rate changes and fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates and equity markets. Interest Rate Risk and Credit Risk MMC has historically managed its net exposure to interest rate changes by utilizing a mixture of variable and fixed rate borrowings to finance MMC’s asset base. During 2007, virtually all of MMC’s variable rate borrowings were repaid. Interest income generated from MMC’s cash investments as well as invested fiduciary funds will vary with the general level of interest rates. MMC had the following investments subject to variable interest rates: (In millions of dollars) December 31, 2007 Cash and cash equivalents invested inmoney market funds, certificates of deposit and time deposits (Note 1) $ 2,133 Fiduciary cash and investments (Note 1) $ 3,612 These investments and debt instruments are discussed more fully in the above-indicated Notes to the consolidated financial statements. Based on the above balances, if short-term interest rates decrease by 10% or 45 basis points over the course of the year, annual interest income, including interest earned on fiduciary funds, would decrease by approximately $14 million. In addition to interest rate risk, our cash investments and fiduciary fund investments are subject to potential loss of value due to counterparty credit risk. To minimize this risk, MMC and its subsidiaries invest pursuant to a Board approved investment policy. The policy mandates the preservation of principal and liquidity and requires broad diversification with counterparty limits assigned based primarily on credit rating and type of investment. MMC carefully monitors its cash and fiduciary fund investments and will further restrict the portfolio as appropriate to market conditions. The majority of cash and fiduciary funds are invested in short-term bank deposits and liquid money market funds. Foreign Currency Risk The translated values of revenue and expense from MMC’s international risk and insurance services and consulting operations are subject to fluctuations due to changes in currency exchange rates. The non-U.S. based revenue that is exposed to foreign exchange fluctuations is approximately 50% of total revenue. Note 17 details revenue by geographic area. We periodically use forward contracts and options to limit foreign currency exchange rate exposure on net income and cash flows for specific, clearly defined transactions arising in the ordinary course of business. Equity Price Risk MMC holds investments in public and private companies, as well as in certain private equity funds managed by Stone Point Capital. Publicly traded investments of $23 million are classified as available for sale under SFAS No. 115. Non-publicly traded investments of $43 million are accounted for using the cost method and $293 million are accounted for using the equity method under APB Opinion No. 18, “The Equity Method of Accounting for Investments in Common Stock”. The investments that are classified as available for sale or that are not publicly traded are subject to risk of changes in market value, which if determined to be other than temporary, could result in realized impairment losses. MMC periodically reviews the carrying value of such investments to determine if any valuation adjustments are appropriate under the applicable accounting pronouncements. 37 Table of Contents Other A significant number of lawsuits and regulatory proceedings are pending. See Note 16 to the consolidated financial statements. Management’s Discussion of Critical Accounting Policies The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (“GAAP”) requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue and expenses, and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. Management considers the policies discussed below to be critical to understanding MMC’s financial statements because their application places the most significant demands on management’s judgment, and requires management to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain. Actual results may differ from those estimates. Legal and Other Loss Contingencies MMC and its subsidiaries are subject to numerous claims, lawsuits and proceedings. GAAP requires that liabilities for contingencies be recorded when it is probable that a liability has been incurred before the balance sheet date and the amount can be reasonably estimated. Significant management judgment is required to comply with this guidance. MMC analyzes its litigation exposure based on available information, including consultation with outside counsel handling the defense of these matters, to assess its potential liability. In addition, to the extent that insurance coverage is available, significant management judgment is required to determine the amount of recoveries that are expected under MMC’s various insurance programs. Retirement Benefits MMC maintains qualified and non-qualified defined benefit pension plans for its eligible U.S. employees and a variety of defined benefit and defined contribution plans for eligible non-U.S. employees. MMC’s policy for funding its tax qualified defined benefit retirement plans is to contribute amounts at least sufficient to meet the funding requirements set forth in U.S. and applicable foreign laws. In September 2006, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) issued SFAS No. 158, “Employers’ Accounting for Defined Benefit Pension and Other Postretirement Plans – an amendment of FASB Statements No. 87, 88, 106, and 132 (R)” (“SFAS 158”). SFAS 158 requires that MMC recognize the funded status of its overfunded defined benefit pension and retiree medical plans (the “Plans”) as a net benefit plan asset and its unfunded and underfunded plans as a net benefit plan liability. The gains or losses and prior service costs or credits that have not been recognized as components of net periodic costs are recorded as a component of Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income (“AOCI”), net of tax, in MMC’s consolidated balance sheets. MMC adopted the provisions of SFAS 158, prospectively, on December 31, 2006. The determination of net periodic pension cost is based on a number of actuarial assumptions, including an expected long-term rate of return on plan assets, the discount rate and assumed rate of salary increase. Significant assumptions used in the calculation of net periodic pension costs and pension liabilities are disclosed in Note 8 to the consolidated financial statements. MMC believes the assumptions for each plan are reasonable and appropriate and will continue to evaluate actuarial assumptions at least annually and adjust them as appropriate. Based on its current assumptions, MMC expects pension expense to decrease by approximately $200 million in 2008 and currently expects to contribute approximately $275 million to the plans during 2008. During 2005 MMC made changes to the U.S. pension plan that were designed to reduce MMC’s benefits costs going forward. The changes, which were effective January 1, 2006, include changing the benefit formula from a final average salary to a career average salary as well as a change in the calculation for early retirement benefits. During 2006, MMC made similar changes to its U.K. pension plans. 38 Table of Contents Future pension expense or credits will depend on plan provisions, future investment performance, future assumptions, and various other factors related to the populations participating in the pension plans. Holding all other assumptions constant, a half-percentage point change in the rate of return and discount rate assumptions would affect net periodic pension cost for the U.S. and U.K. plans, which comprise approximately 89% of total pension plan liabilities, as follows: 0.5 PercentagePoint Increase 0.5 PercentagePoint Decrease (In millions of dollars) U.S. U.K. U.S. U.K. Assumed Rate of Return $ (15.2 ) $ (28.0 ) $ 15.2 $ 28.0 Discount Rate $ (28.5 ) $ (55.4 ) $ 30.7 $ 57.3 Changing the discount rate and leaving the other assumptions constant may not be representative of the impact on expense, because the long-term rates of inflation and salary increases are often correlated with the discount rate. MMC contributes to certain health care and life insurance benefits provided to its retired employees. The cost of these postretirement benefits for employees in the United States is accrued during the period up to the date employees are eligible to retire, but is funded by MMC as incurred. This postretirement liability is included in Other liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets. The key assumptions and sensitivity to changes in the assumed health care cost trend rate are discussed in Note 8 to the consolidated financial statements. Income Taxes MMC’s tax rate reflects its income, statutory tax rates and tax planning in the various jurisdictions in which it operates. Significant judgment is required in determining the annual tax rate and in evaluating uncertain tax positions. On January 1, 2007 MMC adopted the provisions of FIN 48, to account for the uncertainty in income taxes. Accordingly, MMC reports a liability for unrecognized tax benefits resulting from uncertain tax positions taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. The evaluation of a tax position in accordance with FIN 48 is a two-step process, the first step involves recognition. We determine whether it is more likely than not that a tax position will be sustained upon tax examination, including resolution of any related appeals or litigation, based on only the technical merits of the position. The technical merits of a tax position derive from both statutory and judicial authority (legislation and statutes, legislative intent, regulations, rulings, and case law) and their applicability to the facts and circumstances of the tax position. If a tax position does not meet the more likely than not recognition threshold, the benefit of that position is not recognized in the financial statements. The second step is measurement. A tax position that meets the more likely than not recognition threshold is measured to determine the amount of benefit to recognize in the financial statements. The tax position is measured as the largest amount of benefit that is greater than 50 percent likely of being realized upon ultimate resolution with a taxing authority. Uncertain tax positions are evaluated based upon the facts and circumstances that exist at each reporting period and involve significant management judgment. Subsequent changes in judgment based upon new information may lead to changes in recognition, derecognition, and measurement. Adjustments may result, for example, upon resolution of an issue with the taxing authorities, or expiration of a statute of limitations barring an assessment for an issue. Prior to January 1, 2007, MMC estimated its uncertain income tax obligations in accordance with SFAS 109 and SFAS 5. MMC recognizes interest and penalties, if any, related to unrecognized tax benefits in income tax expense. Tax law requires items be included in MMC’s tax returns at different times than the items are reflected in the financial statements. As a result, the annual tax expense reflected in the consolidated statements of income is different than that reported in the tax returns. Some of these differences are permanent, such as expenses that are not deductible in the returns, and some differences are temporary and reverse over time, such as depreciation expense. Temporary differences create deferred tax assets and liabilities. Deferred tax liabilities generally represent tax expense recognized in 39 Table of Contents the financial statements for which payment has been deferred, or expense for which a deduction has been taken already in the tax return but the expense has not yet been recognized in the financial statements. Deferred tax assets generally represent items that can be used as a tax deduction or credit in tax returns in future years for which a benefit has already been recorded in the financial statements. In assessing the need for and amount of a valuation allowance for deferred tax assets, the Company considers whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized and adjusts the valuation allowance accordingly. MMC evaluates all significant available positive and negative evidence, including the existence of losses in recent years and its forecast of future taxable income by jurisdiction, in assessing the need for a valuation allowance. MMC also considers tax-planning strategies that would result in realization of deferred tax assets, and the presence of taxable income in prior carryback years if carryback is permitted under the appropriate tax law. The underlying assumptions MMC uses in forecasting future taxable income require significant judgment and take into account MMC’s recent performance. The ultimate realization of deferred tax assets is dependent on the generation of future taxable income during the periods in which temporary differences are deductible or creditable. Valuation allowances are established for deferred tax assets when it is estimated that it is more likely than not future taxable income will be insufficient to fully use a deduction or credit in that jurisdiction. Fair Value Determinations Investment Valuation – MMC holds investments in both public and private companies, as well as certain private equity funds. The majority of the public investments are accounted for as available for sale securities under SFAS No. 115. Certain investments, primarily investments in private equity funds, are accounted for using the equity method under APB Opinion No. 18. MMC periodically reviews the carrying value of its investments to determine if any valuation adjustments are appropriate under the applicable accounting pronouncements. MMC bases its review on the facts and circumstances as they relate to each investment. Fair value of investments in private equity funds is determined by the Funds’ investment managers. Factors considered in determining the fair value of private equity investments include: implied valuation of recently completed financing rounds that included sophisticated outside investors; performance multiples of comparable public companies; restrictions on the sale or disposal of the investments; trading characteristics of the securities; and the relative size of the holdings in comparison to other private investors and the public market float. In those instances where quoted market prices are not available, particularly for equity holdings in private companies, or formal restrictions limit the sale of securities, significant management judgment is required to determine the appropriate value of MMC’s investments. MMC reviews with the fund manager the appropriateness of valuation results for significant private equity investments. Goodwill Impairment Testing – Under SFAS 142, MMC is required to assess goodwill and any indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment annually, or more frequently if circumstances indicate impairment may have occurred. MMC performs the annual impairment test for each of its reporting units during the third quarter of each year. Fair values of the reporting units are estimated using a market approach or a discounted cash flow model. Carrying values for the reporting units are based on balances at the prior quarter end and include directly identified assets and liabilities, as well as an allocation of those assets and liabilities not recorded at the reporting unit level. MMC completed its 2007 annual review in the third quarter of 2007 and concluded that goodwill is not impaired. The fair value estimates used in this assessment are dependent upon assumptions and estimates about the future profitability and other financial ratios of our reporting units, as well as relevant financial data, recent transactions and market valuations of comparable public companies. If in the future, the performance of our reporting units varies significantly from our projections or our assumptions or estimates about future profitability of our reporting units change, the estimated fair value of our reporting units could change materially and could result in an impairment of goodwill. 40 Table of Contents Share-based Payment Effective July 1, 2005, MMC adopted SFAS 123(R) “Share-based Payment”, which requires, among other things, that the estimated fair value of stock options be charged to earnings. Significant management judgment is required to determine the appropriate assumptions for inputs such as volatility and expected term necessary to estimate option values. In addition, management judgment is required to analyze the terms of the plans and awards granted thereunder to determine if awards will be treated as equity awards or liability awards, as defined by SFAS 123(R). As of December 31, 2007, there was $34 million of unrecognized compensation cost related to stock option awards. The weighted-average periods over which the costs are expected to be recognized is 1.4 years. Also as of December 31, 2007, there was $289 million of unrecognized compensation cost related to MMC’s restricted stock, restricted stock unit and deferred stock unit awards. See Note 9 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding the adoption of SFAS 123(R). New Accounting Pronouncements New accounting pronouncements are discussed in Note 1 to MMC’s consolidated financial statements. On January 1, 2007, MMC adopted the provisions of FASB Interpretation No. 48, “Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes – an interpretation of FASB Statement No. 109” (“FIN 48”), which clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income tax positions. This interpretation requires that MMC recognize in its consolidated financial statements the impact of a tax position when it is more likely than not that the tax position would be sustained upon examination by the tax authorities based on the technical merits of the position. As a result of the implementation of FIN 48, MMC recognized an increase in the liability for unrecognized tax benefits of approximately $13 million, which is accounted for as a reduction to the January 1, 2007 balance of retained earnings. The term “unrecognized tax benefits” in FIN 48 primarily refers to the differences between a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return and the benefit measured and recognized in the financial statements in accordance with the guidelines of FIN 48. Including this increase, MMC had approximately $272 million of total gross unrecognized tax benefits at the beginning of 2007. Of this total, $218 million represents the amount of unrecognized tax benefits that, if recognized, would favorably affect the effective tax rate in any future periods. MMC classifies interest and penalties relating to uncertain tax positions in the financial statements as income taxes. The total gross amount of such accrued interest and penalties, before any applicable federal benefit, at January 1, 2007 was $40 million. See Note 7 to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion of FIN 48 and income taxes. In September 2006, the FASB issued SFAS No. 157, “Fair Value Measurements” (“SFAS 157”), which defines fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value, and expands required disclosures about fair value measurements. The provisions of SFAS 157 are effective as of the beginning of MMC’s 2008 fiscal year. MMC does not expect the adoption of SFAS 157 to have a material impact on its consolidated financial statements. In February 2007, the FASB issued SFAS 159, “The Fair Value Option for Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities” (“SFAS 159”). SFAS 159 permits an entity to measure many financial assets and financial liabilities at fair value. Unrealized gains and losses on items for which the fair value option has been elected are reported in earnings. SFAS 159 is effective for fiscal years beginning after November 15, 2007. The adjustment to reflect the difference between fair value and the carrying amount would be accounted for as a cumulative-effect adjustment to retained earnings as of the date of adoption. MMC did not elect to adopt the fair value option for any financial assets or liabilities as of January 1, 2008. On December 4, 2007, the FASB issued SFAS 141 (revised 2007), “Business Combinations” (“SFAS 141(R)”), and SFAS 160, “Noncontrolling Interests in Consolidated Financial Statements” (“SFAS 160”). 41 Table of Contents SFAS 141(R) requires entities in a business combination to recognize all (and only) the assets acquired and liabilities assumed in the transaction; establishes the acquisition-date fair value as the measurement objective for all assets acquired and liabilities assumed; and requires the acquirer to disclose all information needed by investors and other users to evaluate and understand the nature and financial effect of the business combination. SFAS 160 clarifies that a noncontrolling or minority interest in a subsidiary is considered an ownership interest and accordingly, requires all entities to report such interests in subsidiaries as equity in the consolidated financial statements. Both standards are effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2008. Early adoption is not permitted. Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk.

The 2008 results include the negative impact of a $540 million goodwill impairment charge related to the Risk Consulting & Technology segment and restructuring related items of $388 million in 2008, including the $28 million loss on the sale of the U.K. restructuring businesses, compared with restructuring costs of $105 million in 2007. Excluding these charges, consolidated operating income was $1.2 billion in 2008 compared with $951 million in 2007. Risk and Insurance Services operating income increased $118 million to $460 million in 2008 compared with 2007, or 35%, despite an increase of $149 million in restructuring and related charges. Consulting’s operating income decreased $51 million to $555 million in 2008. Restructuring and related charges in 2008 at Mercer were $40 million compared with $8 million of such charges recorded in 2007. Risk Consulting & Technology incurred an operating loss of $497 million in 2008 compared with $98 million of operating income in 2007. Operating results in 2008 include the $540 million goodwill impairment charge, restructuring and related charges of $17 million and a loss on the disposal of its U.K. restructuring businesses of $28 million. There were no similar charges recognized in this segment in 2007. Corporate expenses increased $55 million to $255 million in 2008. In 2008, corporate expenses include $85 million of restructuring and related charges primarily resulting from estimated future rent and other real estate costs to exit space in MMC’s New York headquarters building and previously vacated space in the U.K. and other locations. Restructuring and related charges were $28 million in 2007. The consolidated net loss was $73 million in 2008, which includes charges of $928 million related to the goodwill impairment and restructuring and related charges, compared with net income of $2.5 billion in the prior year. Results for 2007 include a $1.9 billion gain on the disposal of Putnam, partly offset by restructuring and related charges of $105 million. Discontinued operations in 2007 primarily includes the gain on disposal of Putnam. 28 Table of Contents Consolidated Revenues and Expenses MMC conducts business in many countries, as a result of which the impact of foreign exchange rate movements may impact period-to-period comparisons of revenue. Similarly, the revenue impact of acquisitions and dispositions may impact period-to-period comparisons of revenue. Underlying revenue measures the change in revenue from one period to another by isolating these impacts. The impact of foreign currency exchange fluctuations, acquisitions and dispositions on MMC’s operating revenues by segment is as follows: Year Ended December 31, Components of Revenue Change (In millions, except percentage figures) % Change Revenue Currency Impact Acquisitions/ Dispositions Impact Underlying Revenue 2008 2007 Risk and Insurance Services Marsh $ 4,524 $ 4,369 4 %* 1 % — 2 %* Guy Carpenter 803 854 (6 )% 1 % — (7 )% Fiduciary Interest Income 139 177 (22 )% 1 % — (23 )% Total Risk and Insurance Services 5,466 5,400 1 % 1 % — — Consulting Mercer 3,642 3,368 8 % — 1 % 7 % Oliver Wyman Group 1,554 1,516 2 % 1 % 3 % (2 )% Total Consulting 5,196 4,884 6 % — 2 % 4 % Risk Consulting & Technology Kroll 866 815 6 % — 4 % 2 % Corporate Advisory and Restructuring 127 172 (26 )% (1 )% — (25 )% Total Risk Consulting & Technology 993 987 1 % — 4 % (3 )% Total Operating Segments 11,655 11,271 3 % 1 % 1 % 1 % Corporate/Eliminations (68 ) (94 ) Total Revenue $ 11,587 $ 11,177 4 % 1 % 1 % 2 % Year Ended December 31, Components of Revenue Change (In millions, except percentage figures) % Change Revenue Currency Impact Acquisitions/ Dispositions Impact Underlying Revenue 2008 2007 Marsh: EMEA $ 1,706 $ 1,618 5 % 2 % — 3 % Asia Pacific 412 374 10 % 2 % — 8 % Latin America 252 239 6 % 5 % (5 )% 6 % Total International 2,370 2,231 6 % 2 % — 4 % U.S. and Canada 2,154 2,138 1 % — — 1 % Total Marsh $ 4,524 $ 4,369 4 %* 1 % — 2 %* Mercer: Retirement $ 1,178 $ 1,079 9 % — 4 % 5 % Health and Benefits 898 827 9 % 1 % — 8 % Other Consulting Lines 555 509 9 % 2 % (1 )% 8 % Total Mercer Consulting 2,631 2,415 9 % 1 % 1 % 7 % Outsourcing 702 682 3 % (1 )% — 4 % Investment Consulting & Management 309 271 14 % (2 )% — 16 % Total Mercer $ 3,642 $ 3,368 8 % — 1 % 7 % Kroll: Litigation Support and Data Recovery $ 326 $ 272 20 % — 14 % 6 % Background Screening 263 297 (11 )% — — (11 )% Risk Mitigation and Response 277 246 12 % — — 12 % Total Kroll $ 866 $ 815 6 % — 4 % 2 % * Marsh’s revenue growth and underlying revenue growth were 3.6% and 2.4%, respectively.

Revenue in the Risk and Insurance Services segment increased 1% compared with 2007. Underlying revenue growth was flat for the total Risk and Insurance Services segment, reflecting a 2% increase in Marsh, offset by a 7% decrease in Guy Carpenter, and a 23% decrease in fiduciary interest income. Consulting revenue increased 6%, resulting from an 8% increase at Mercer and 2% growth at Oliver Wyman Group. On an underlying basis, revenue increased 4% reflecting a 7% increase in Mercer, and a decrease of 2% in Oliver Wyman Group. Revenue increased 1% in Risk Consulting & Technology, but decreased 3% on an underlying basis. During the fourth quarter of 2008, MMC disposed of its U.S. and U.K. restructuring businesses, which are included in the Risk Consulting & Technology segment. In 2007, Risk and Insurance Services revenue increased 3% compared with 2006. Underlying revenue decreased 1% for the total Risk and Insurance Services segment, reflecting a 1% decrease in Marsh, which includes a $40 million decrease in market service revenue, partly offset by a 1% increase in Guy Carpenter and a 2% increase in fiduciary interest income. Consulting revenue increased 16%, resulting from a 12% increase in Mercer’s businesses and 26% growth in Oliver Wyman Group. On an underlying basis, revenue increased 7% in Mercer, 18% in Oliver Wyman Group and 10% for the Consulting segment in total. Revenue increased 1% in Risk Consulting & Technology, but growth was flat on an underlying basis. Expenses Consolidated operating expenses in 2008 increased 10%, which included the $540 million goodwill impairment charge recorded in 2008 and a $283 million increase from restructuring and related charges in 2008 as compared with 2007. Excluding these two items, expenses decreased 4% in 2008 compared with 2007 and were essentially flat on an underlying basis. Consolidated operating expenses in 2007 increased 10% compared with 2006. Operating expenses increased 5% on an underlying basis in 2007 compared with 2006. The increase in underlying expenses was due to higher compensation and benefit costs driven by the Consulting segment due to increased volume across all practices, increased advertising, primarily in insurance services, and favorable professional liability experience in 2006. Restructuring and Related Activities Actions Initiated in 2008 In 2008, MMC implemented restructuring actions which resulted in costs totaling $312 million primarily related to severance and benefits costs and the loss on the disposal of our U.K. restructuring businesses. These costs were incurred as follows: Risk and Insurance Services—$218 million, Consulting—$40 million, Risk Consulting & Technology—$45 million, and Corporate—$9 million. These activities resulted in the elimination of approximately 1,660 positions at Marsh, 360 positions at Guy Carpenter, 490 positions at Mercer, 300 positions in Risk Consulting & Technology and 85 positions at Corporate. In addition, Marsh outsourced approximately 700 positions as part of its U.K. back office outsourcing initiative. The annualized cost savings from these actions are expected to be approximately $290 million. MMC expects to incur additional restructuring charges in the first half of 2009. Actions Initiated Prior to 2008 In 2008, MMC recorded $76 million of restructuring charges related to actions initiated in prior years, primarily due to a charge of $62 million for estimated future rent and real estate costs to exit five floors in MMC’s New York headquarters building that was part of the restructuring plan announced in 2006, and $11 million related to changes in the estimated costs for future rent related to previously vacated properties in the U.K. and other locations. These amounts were recorded in Corporate. 31 Table of Contents Putnam Transaction On August 3, 2007, Great-West Lifeco Inc. completed its purchase of Putnam Investments Trust for $3.9 billion in cash. The gain on disposal and Putnam’s results of operations through the date of sale, are included in discontinued operations in the accompanying consolidated statements of income. As described in Note 5 to the consolidated financial statements, MMC provided certain indemnities related to the transaction, and also has established liabilities for uncertain tax positions. As these issues are resolved, or as facts and circumstances related to these issues change in the future, the related liabilities will be adjusted and will be recorded in discontinued operations. Other Businesses Exited During the fourth quarter of 2008, MMC sold its U.S. and U.K. restructuring businesses to their respective management teams in separate leveraged buyouts. Based on the terms and conditions of the disposals, MMC determined it has “continuing involvement” in these businesses, as that term is used in SEC Staff Accounting Bulletin Topic 5e. MMC recorded a loss of $28 million on the disposition of the U.K. Corporate Advisory and Restructuring businesses. The net assets of these U.K. businesses were written-off upon transfer to the new owners. MMC will receive royalties on future revenue of these businesses over the next four years. The royalties will be recognized when earned under the terms of the contract and when collectibility is reasonably assured. The transfer of the U.S. restructuring business was financed with a seller note. If MMC receives interest and principal payments as scheduled for the U.S. business, it will recover the value of the net assets transferred to the new owners and recognize a gain on the disposal of $18 million. Risk and Insurance Services In the Risk and Insurance Services segment, MMC’s subsidiaries and other affiliated entities act as brokers, agents or consultants for insureds, insurance underwriters and other brokers in the areas of risk management, insurance broking and insurance program management services, primarily under the name of Marsh; and engage in reinsurance broking, catastrophe and financial modeling services and related advisory functions, primarily under the name of Guy Carpenter. Marsh and Guy Carpenter are compensated for brokerage and consulting services primarily through fees paid by clients and/or commissions paid out of premiums charged by insurance and reinsurance companies. Commission rates vary in amount depending upon the type of insurance or reinsurance coverage provided, the particular insurer or reinsurer, the capacity in which the broker acts and negotiations with clients. Revenues are affected by premium rate levels in the insurance/reinsurance markets, the amount of risk retained by insurance and reinsurance clients themselves and by the value of the risks that have been insured since commission based compensation is frequently related to the premiums paid by insureds/reinsureds. In many cases, compensation may be negotiated in advance, based on the types and amounts of risks to be analyzed by MMC and ultimately placed into the insurance market or retained by the client. The trends and comparisons of revenue from one period to the next will therefore be affected by changes in premium rate levels, fluctuations in client risk retention, and increases or decreases in the value of risks that have been insured, as well as new and lost business, and the volume of business from new and existing clients. Marsh and Guy Carpenter receive interest income on certain funds (such as premiums and claims proceeds) held in a fiduciary capacity for others. The investment of fiduciary funds is regulated by state and other insurance authorities. These regulations typically provide for segregation of fiduciary funds and limit the types of investments that may be made with them. Interest income from these investments varies depending on the amount of funds invested and applicable interest rates, both of which vary from time to time. For presentation purposes, fiduciary interest is now segregated within the segment from the other revenues of Marsh and Guy Carpenter, as shown in the charts on pages 29 and 30. 32 Table of Contents The results of operations for the Risk and Insurance Services segment are presented below: (In millions of dollars) 2008 2007 2006 Revenue $ 5,466 $ 5,400 $ 5,263 Compensation and Benefits 3,299 3,318 3,207 Other Operating Expenses 1,707 1,740 1,579 Expense 5,006 5,058 4,786 Operating Income $ 460 $ 342 $ 477 Operating Income Margin 8.4 % 6.3 % 9.1 % Revenue Revenue in Risk and Insurance Services increased 1% in 2008 compared with 2007, reflecting the positive impact of foreign currency exchange fluctuations, and was flat on an underlying basis. In Marsh, revenue increased 4% from last year, reflecting a 1% positive impact of currency translation and a 2% increase in underlying revenue. Client revenue retention increased by 3 percentage points over 2007. New business production also remained strong. On a geographic basis, Marsh’s international revenue increased 6% while the U.S. and Canada increased 1% compared with 2007. Guy Carpenter revenue decreased 6% in 2008 compared with 2007 or 7% on an underlying basis. Reinsurance premium rates declined during the year across most coverages. Fiduciary interest income decreased 22% in 2008, or 23% on an underlying basis, primarily due to lower interest rates, and to a lesser extent, lower average invested funds. Revenue in Risk and Insurance Services increased 3% in 2007 compared with 2006 reflecting the positive impact of foreign currency exchange fluctuations partly offset by a decrease in underlying revenue. Expense Expenses in the Risk and Insurance Services segment decreased 1% in 2008 compared with the prior year, reflecting a 2% decrease in underlying expenses, partly offset by a 1% increase related to the impact of foreign exchange. The reduction in compensation and benefits expense in 2008 compared with 2007 reflects a reduction in headcount during the year and a decline in benefits expenses partly offset by increased incentive compensation costs and higher severance costs at both Marsh and Guy Carpenter. The decrease in other expenses reflects the continued focus on expense control and primarily relate to reductions in travel, entertainment, meetings, and marketing and advertising. These decreases were partly offset by higher restructuring and related costs in 2008 compared with 2007, and a $33 million charge in the third quarter of 2008 related to a professional liability claim. In 2007, expenses in the Risk and Insurance Services segment increased 6% over the prior year. The increase in expenses reflected higher salary costs due to increased headcount during the second half of the year; the impact of foreign currency exchange fluctuations; costs associated with Marsh’s advertising campaign initiated in the spring of 2007; incremental expenses related to the departure of Marsh’s former CEO; and the effect of favorable professional liability experience in 2006. These increases were partly offset by lower restructuring and related costs compared with 2006 and reduced incentive compensation accruals. Consulting MMC conducts business in its Consulting segment through two main business groups. Mercer includes practice groups specializing in retirement, health and benefits, outsourcing, and investment consulting and management. Oliver Wyman Group provides specialized management and economic and brand consulting services. The major component of Consulting’s revenue, in both Mercer and Oliver Wyman Group, is fees paid by clients for advice and services. Mercer, principally through its health & benefits line of business, also 33 Table of Contents earns revenue in the form of commissions received from insurance companies for the placement of group (and occasionally individual) insurance contracts, primarily life, health and accident coverages. Revenue for Mercer’s investment management business and certain of Mercer’s outsourcing businesses consists principally of fees based on assets under administration. Revenue in the Consulting segment is affected by, among other things, global economic conditions, including changes in clients’ particular industries and markets. Revenue is also subject to competition due to the introduction of new products and services, broad trends in employee demographics, the effect of government policies and regulations, and fluctuations in interest and foreign exchange rates. Revenues from the provision of investment management services and retirement trust and administrative services are significantly affected by securities market performance. The results of operations for the Consulting segment are presented below: (In millions of dollars) 2008 2007 2006 Revenue $ 5,196 $ 4,884 $ 4,224 Compensation and Benefits 3,204 2,953 2,651 Other Operating Expenses 1,437 1,325 1,108 Expense 4,641 4,278 3,759 Operating Income $ 555 $ 606 $ 465 Operating Income Margin 10.7 % 12.4 % 11.0 % Revenue Consulting revenue in 2008 increased 6% compared with 2007 comprising 8% growth at Mercer and 2% growth at Oliver Wyman Group. Revenue for the segment increased 4% on an underlying basis. Within Mercer, the revenue increase of 8% reflects growth in retirement of 9%, health and benefits of 9%, other consulting lines of 9%, outsourcing of 3% and investment consulting & management of 14%. Mercer’s revenue grew 7% on an underlying basis. Oliver Wyman Group grew 2%, but decreased 2% on an underlying basis, compared with the same period last year. Consulting revenue in 2007 increased 16% compared with 2006. Revenue for Mercer increased 12%, or 7% on an underlying basis driven by strong growth throughout its businesses. Oliver Wyman Group revenues grew 26%, or 18% on an underlying basis, compared with the same period in 2006. Expense Consulting expenses increased 8% in 2008 compared with 2007, or 6% on an underlying basis. Compensation and benefit costs increased due to a higher volume of activity at Mercer, largely in the first three quarters of the year. As part of its ongoing effort to realize operational efficiencies, Mercer reduced its headcount in the fourth quarter of 2008, resulting in a $40 million restructuring charge. The increase in other operating expenses reflects a $70 million increase resulting from expenses that are reimbursable by clients. Consulting expenses increased 14% in 2007 compared with 2006, reflecting higher compensation costs due to an increased volume of business, higher incentive compensation commensurate with improved operating performance and the impact of foreign currency translation. Risk Consulting & Technology MMC’s Risk Consulting & Technology segment which comprises the activity of Kroll and Corporate Advisory and Restructuring, includes risk consulting, and related investigative, intelligence, financial, security and technology services. During the fourth quarter of 2008, MMC sold its U.S. and U.K. restructuring businesses to their respective management teams in separate leveraged buyouts. Based on the terms and conditions of the disposals, MMC determined it has “continuing involvement” in these businesses, as that term is used in SEC Staff Accounting Bulletin Topic 5e. MMC recorded a loss of $28 million on the disposition 34 Table of Contents of the U.K. restructuring businesses. The net assets of the U.K. businesses were written-off upon transfer to the new owners. MMC will receive royalties on future revenue of these businesses over the next four years. The royalties will be recognized when earned under the terms of the contract and when collectibility is reasonably assured. The transfer of the U.S. restructuring business was financed with a seller note. If MMC receives interest and principal payments as scheduled for the U.S. business, it will recover the value of the net assets transferred to the new owners and recognize a gain on the disposal of $18 million. Kroll receives compensation primarily in the form of fees paid by clients. These fees are typically earned on an hourly, project, fixed fee or per-unit basis. Kroll’s revenue is subject to changes in international economic and regulatory conditions, including the levels of mortgage applications and new employment. Kroll is also subject to normal competitive forces such as pricing pressures, demand for professional staff and new product development on the part of competitors, particularly in technology services. The results of operations for the Risk Consulting & Technology segment are presented below: (In millions of dollars) 2008 2007 2006 Revenue $ 993 $ 987 $ 973 Compensation and Benefits 473 467 428 Other Operating Expenses 477 422 402 Goodwill Impairment Charge 540 — — Expense 1,490 889 830 Operating Income (Loss) $ (497 ) $ 98 $ 143 Operating Income Margin N/A 9.9 % 14.7 % Revenue Risk Consulting & Technology revenues increased 1% compared with 2007, but decreased 3% on an underlying basis. Revenue in Kroll’s litigation support and data recovery and risk mitigation and response businesses increased 6% and 12%, respectively, on an underlying basis compared with 2007. Revenues in Kroll’s background screening business decreased 11% due to declines in both employment and mortgage related background screening. Corporate Advisory and Restructuring revenue was $127 million in 2008, compared with $172 million in 2007. Due to the disposal of the U.S. and U.K. restructuring businesses, future results will only include revenue earned by MMC under the royalty arrangements discussed earlier. Risk Consulting & Technology revenues increased 1% in 2007 compared with 2006, and were flat on an underlying basis. Revenue in Kroll’s litigation support and data recovery and background screening increased 14% and 5%, respectively, on an underlying basis compared with 2006. This was offset by a 23% decrease in Corporate Advisory and Restructuring revenue due to weaker demand for these services, including lower client success fees, for completed engagements compared with 2006. Expense Risk Consulting & Technology expenses in 2008 increased 68% compared with 2007. Expenses in 2008 included the $540 million goodwill impairment charge, restructuring charges of $17 million and the $28 million loss on the disposal of the U.K. restructuring businesses. Excluding these items, Risk Consulting & Technology expenses for 2008 increased 2% compared with 2007 and were essentially the same as last year on an underlying basis. Risk Consulting & Technology expenses increased 7% in 2007 compared with 2006. Approximately half of the increase results from acquisitions and the impact of foreign currency fluctuation. The remaining increase reflects higher compensation in the Corporate Advisory and Restructuring and the 35 Table of Contents background screening businesses, as well as increased costs for outside services in the background screening business due to a higher volume of business. In addition, expenses in 2006 included a credit related to the early termination of a licensing agreement. Discontinued Operations Results of discontinued operations in 2008 include the effects of three discontinued operations –Putnam, Mediservice and Kroll Crucible – which are discussed in more detail below. With regard to Putnam, discontinued operations in 2008 includes (1) the impact of immaterial corrections and other adjustments to the fourth quarter of 2007 tax provision related to the transaction, (2) adjustments to the tax provision to reflect differences between tax returns filed in 2008 and the initial estimated provisions, and (3) interest on liabilities for certain tax-related indemnities provided as part of the transaction. In the first quarter of 2008, Marsh completed the sale of Mediservice, a claims administration operation in Brazil. The gain on this disposal, net of tax, is included in discontinued operations in 2008. In the third quarter of 2008, Kroll completed the sale of Kroll Crucible (“Crucible”), a division of its government services operation. The loss on this disposal, net of tax, is included in discontinued operations in 2008. In 2007, discontinued operations include the gain on the sale of Putnam, as well as Putnam’s operating income through August 2, 2007 and, in 2006, include the operating income from Putnam, Sedgwick Claims Management Services (“SCMS”), Kroll Security International (“KSI”) and Price Forbes. Discontinued operations in 2006 also include the gain on disposal of SCMS and a charge to reduce the carrying value of Price Forbes’ assets to fair value. The following depicts the results of discontinued operations including revenue and expense detail for Putnam: (In millions of dollars) 2008 2007 2006 Putnam: Revenue $ — $ 798 $ 1,385 Expense — 636 1,082 Operating Income — 162 303 Minority interest and other discontinued operations — (2 ) 1 Provision for income tax — 71 118 Income from discontinued operations, net of tax — 89 186 Gain on disposal of discontinued operations 29 2,965 298 Provision for income tax 33 1,117 126 (Loss) Gain on disposal of discontinued operations, net of tax (4 ) 1,848 172 Discontinued operations, net of tax $ (4 ) $ 1,937 $ 358 36 Table of Contents Corporate Items Corporate Expenses Corporate expenses were $255 million in 2008, compared to $200 million in 2007. In 2008, expenses include $85 million of restructuring and related charges comprising a $62 million charge related to estimated future rent and other real estate costs to exit five floors in MMC’s New York headquarters building and previously vacated space in the U.K. and other locations. In 2007, restructuring and related items were $28 million. Expenses in 2008 include a $10 million credit for a payment from U.S. Investigative Services, Inc. (“USIS”) in connection with the hiring of MMC’s former CEO, partly offset by costs related to the departure of several senior executives. Corporate expenses were $200 million in 2007, compared to $137 million in 2006. In 2007, corporate expenses included $28 million for restructuring and related charges, including a credit from an accrual adjustment related to the separation of former MMC senior executives, compared with a credit of $31 million of such items in 2006 that included a $74 million gain on the sale of five floors in MMC’s headquarters building. In 2007, corporate expenses also included incremental costs of $14 million related to the departure of MMC’s former CEO. Interest Corporate interest income decreased from $95 million in 2007 to $48 million in 2008. The decrease primarily reflects the combined effect of lower average interest rates and a lower level of invested balances in 2008 compared with the prior year. The invested balances in the second half of 2007 were higher primarily due to proceeds received from the Putnam transaction, which were subsequently used to repurchase MMC shares, pay down debt and pay taxes on the gain on the disposal. Interest expense of $220 million in 2008 decreased from $267 million in 2007. The decrease in interest expense is due to a decrease in the average level of debt outstanding compared to the prior year. Interest income earned on corporate funds was $95 million in 2007, an increase of $35 million over 2006. The increase in interest income reflects generally higher average interest rates in 2007 compared with 2006, and higher invested balances during the second half of the year resulting from the receipt of proceeds from the Putnam transaction, discussed above. Interest expense of $267 million in 2007 decreased from $303 million from 2006. The decrease in interest expense was primarily due to a decrease in the average level of debt compared with the prior year. Investment Income (Loss) In 2008, investment losses were $12 million, primarily due to mark-to-market declines on Risk Capital Holding’s private equity investments. This compared with $173 million of gains in the prior period, primarily related to mark-to-market gains on private equity fund investments and gains from the sale of investments. Income Taxes MMC’s consolidated effective tax rate in 2008 was significantly impacted by the non-deductibility of the goodwill impairment charge. The 2007 consolidated effective tax rate of 34.9% primarily reflects the unfavorable impact of international tax law changes in 2007. MMC’s consolidated effective tax rate was 34.9% in 2007 compared to 29.8% in 2006. The change primarily reflects the unfavorable impact of international tax law changes in 2007 and the release of valuation allowances on certain deferred tax assets in 2006. The effective tax rate is sensitive to the geographic mix and repatriation of MMC’s earnings, which may have a favorable or unfavorable impact on the rate. This also could result in foreign tax credit carryforwards arising in future periods for which a valuation allowance may be required. Furthermore, losses in certain jurisdictions cannot be offset by earnings from other operations, and may result in the need for valuation allowances against deferred tax assets which would affect the rate. 37 Table of Contents In 2007, MMC adopted the provisions of FASB Interpretation No. 48, “Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes—an interpretation of FASB Statement No. 109” (“FIN 48”), which clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income tax positions. Uncertain tax positions are evaluated based upon the facts and circumstances that exist at each reporting period. Subsequent changes in judgment resulting from new information may lead to changes in recognition, derecognition, and measurement. Adjustments may result, for example, upon resolution of an issue with the taxing authorities, or expiration of a statute of limitations barring an assessment for an issue. Such adjustments could have a material impact on MMC’s effective tax rate, net income, and cash flows in a particular future period. It is reasonably possible that the total amount of unrecognized tax benefits will decrease between zero and approximately $135 million within the next 12 months due to settlement of audits and expiration of statutes of limitation. Liquidity and Capital Resources MMC’s liquidity needs are primarily for operating expenses, capital expenditures, servicing debt, funding pension obligations, paying dividends on outstanding stock and funding acquisitions. As a holding company, MMC’s primary source for meeting these requirements is cash flows from operating subsidiaries. Other sources of liquidity include borrowing facilities discussed below in financing cash flows. Cash on our consolidated balance sheets includes funds available for general corporate purposes. Funds held on behalf of clients in a fiduciary capacity are segregated and shown separately in the consolidated balance sheet as an offset to fiduciary liabilities. Fiduciary funds cannot be used for general corporate purposes, and should not be considered as a source of liquidity for MMC. Operating Cash Flows MMC generated $837 million of cash from operations in 2008 compared with a use of cash of $385 million in 2007. These amounts reflect the net income (loss) reported by MMC during those periods, excluding gains or losses from investments and the disposition of businesses, adjusted for non-cash charges and changes in working capital which relate, primarily, to the timing of payments for accrued liabilities or receipts of assets. Cash generated from the disposition of businesses is included in investing cash flows. Payment of accrued liabilities in 2008 includes approximately $170 million for regulatory settlements. This represents the final payment related to the settlement with the NYAG and NYSID as discussed in Note 16 and is consistent with the amount paid in 2007. In 2007, cash outflows included tax payments of $933 million related to the disposition of businesses, primarily Putnam. Although the cash proceeds from the Putnam transaction are included in investing cash flows, SFAS 95 specifies that the related payment of taxes be included in operating cash flows and not allocated to other cash flow categories. MMC’s expected funding for its U.S. non-qualified and non-U.S. pension plans in 2009 is approximately $21 million and $370 million, respectively. MMC’s policy for funding its tax qualified defined benefit retirement plans is to contribute amounts at least sufficient to meet the funding requirements set forth in U.S. and applicable foreign law. There currently is no ERISA funding requirement for the U.S. qualified plan for 2008 or 2009. Funding requirements for non-U.S. plans vary by country. Contribution rates are determined by the local actuaries based on local funding practices and requirements. Funding amounts may be influenced by future asset performance, the level of discount rates and other variables impacting the assets and/or liabilities of the plan. In addition, amounts funded in the future, to the extent not due under regulatory requirements, may be affected by alternative uses of MMC’s cash flows, including dividends, investments and share repurchases. During 2008, MMC’s defined benefit pension plans were negatively impacted by the severe downturn in the global equity markets. Defined benefit assets experienced market declines of approximately 18% in the U.S. and approximately 14% in the U.K., our largest plan. Pension liabilities are largely dependent on the discount rate set as of year end. In the U.S., interest rates declined dramatically over the last two months of 2008, resulting in a lower year-end discount rate than the prior year end. This contributed to a $300 million increase in the projected benefit 38 Table of Contents obligation for the U.S. plans. While our U.S. plans show a funding deficit as of the end of 2008, no contributions to the U.S. plan are required in 2009. Due to an increase in the discount rate and a reduction in inflation expectations, our U.K. plan liabilities decreased slightly in local currency terms in 2008. Although we make scheduled contributions to the U.K. plan throughout the year, in January 2009, we made a discretionary pension contribution of $70 million to the plan. We expect to contribute a similar amount in the second quarter of 2009. These contributions are included in the $370 million of expected contributions noted above. Overall, MMC’s aggregate pension expense in 2009 will be similar to that of 2008. During 2008, MMC contributed approximately $20 million to the U.S. pension plans and $250 million to the significant non-U.S. pension plans, compared with $20 million for U.S. plans and $189 million for significant non-U.S. plans in 2007. In September 2006, the FASB issued SFAS 158. SFAS 158 requires that MMC recognize on a prospective basis the funded status of its overfunded defined benefit pension and retiree medical plans (the “Plans”) as a net benefit plan asset and its unfunded and underfunded Plans as a net benefit plan liability. The offsetting adjustment to the amount of assets and liabilities required to be recognized is recorded in Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income, net of tax, in MMC’s 2006 year-end balance sheet. Subsequent changes in the funded status are recognized through the income statement and other comprehensive income in the year in which they occur as appropriate. MMC adopted the provisions of SFAS 158, prospectively, on December 31, 2006. The impact of adopting SFAS 158 resulted in a reduction in assets of $660 million and an increase in liabilities of $245 million, including a related adjustment to tax benefits of $423 million. The net impact of adopting SFAS 158 was a reduction of MMC’s stockholders’ equity of $905 million in 2006 (or $804 million including an adjustment for the impact of recording a reduction to the minimum pension liability prior to the adoption of SFAS 158). In 2007, the improved funded status of the Plans resulted in a net increase to equity of $708 million. In 2008, the decrease in the funded status of the Plans resulted in a net decrease to equity of $988 million. The change in funded status of the Plans is impacted by numerous items, including actual results compared with prior estimates and assumptions, contributions to the Plans, and changes in assumptions to reflect information available at the respective measurement dates. Significant items impacting the funded status of the U.S. and U.K. plans in 2008 are discussed above. In 2007, the funded status of MMC’s Plans was significantly impacted by an increase in the discount rates used in the measurement of the pension liabilities at December 31, 2007, reflecting a general widening of credit spreads on high quality corporate debt obligations and by contributions and asset returns. Financing Cash Flows Net cash used for financing activities was $540 million in 2008 compared with $2.6 billion of net cash used for financing activities in 2007. During 2008, MMC reduced outstanding debt by approximately $260 million. During 2007, MMC reduced outstanding debt by approximately $1.1 billion and repurchased $1.3 billion of its common stock. These actions are discussed more fully below. Debt Repayment During 2008, MMC’s 3.625% five-year fixed rate $250 million senior notes matured. MMC used cash on hand to manage liquidity, including the repayment of these notes. During 2007, MMC utilized commercial paper and bank borrowings, as well as cash on hand, to manage liquidity, including the funding of maturing bonds and the repurchase of shares. In the first quarter of 2007, MMC’s 5.375%, five-year $500 million senior notes matured. MMC’s three-year floating rate $500 million senior notes matured in the third quarter of 2007. MMC used a portion of its proceeds from the Putnam transaction to pay down outstanding commercial paper and revolving credit facility borrowings. At December 31, 2008, no commercial paper or revolving credit facility borrowings were outstanding. MMC and certain of its foreign subsidiaries maintain a $1.2 billion multi-currency revolving credit facility. Subsidiary borrowings under the facility are unconditionally guaranteed by MMC. The facility will expire in December 2010. There were no borrowings outstanding under this facility at December 31, 2008. 39 Table of Contents MMC’s senior debt is currently rated Baa2 by Moody’s and BBB- by Standard & Poor’s. MMC’s short-term debt is currently rated P-2 by Moody’s and A-3 by Standard & Poor’s. MMC carries a stable outlook from both Moody’s and Standard & Poor’s. In December 2007, Standard & Poor’s lowered its rating on MMC’s long-term debt from BBB to BBB- and lowered the rating on MMC’s short-term debt from A-2 to A-3. MMC also maintains other credit facilities, guarantees and letters of credit with various banks, primarily related to operations located outside the United States, aggregating $285 million at December 31, 2008 and $265 million at December 31, 2007. There were no outstanding borrowings under these facilities at December 31, 2008. Share Repurchases In August 2007, MMC entered into an $800 million accelerated share repurchase agreement with a financial institution counterparty. Under the terms of the agreement, MMC paid the full $800 million purchase price and took delivery from the counterparty of an initial tranche of 21,320,530 shares of MMC common stock, which were reflected as an increase in Treasury shares (a decrease in shares outstanding) on the delivery date. This number of shares was the quotient of the $800 million purchase price divided by a contractual “cap” price of $37.5225 per share. Based on the market price of MMC’s common stock over the subsequent settlement period, in March 2008 the counterparty delivered to MMC an additional 10,751,000 shares for no additional payment and the transaction was concluded. MMC thus repurchased a total of 32,071,630 shares at an average price per share to MMC of $24.9442. The repurchased shares were reflected as an increase in Treasury shares (a decrease in shares outstanding) on the respective delivery dates. This transaction was effected under a $1.5 billion share repurchase authorization granted by MMC’s Board of Directors in August 2007. MMC remains authorized to repurchase additional shares of its common stock up to a value of $700 million. There is no time limit on this authorization. In May 2007, MMC entered into a $500 million accelerated share repurchase agreement with a financial institution counterparty. Under the terms of the agreement, MMC paid the full $500 million purchase price and took delivery from the counterparty of an initial tranche of 13,464,749 shares of MMC common stock. Based on the market price of MMC’s common stock over the subsequent settlement period, in July 2007 the counterparty delivered to MMC an additional 2,555,519 shares for no additional payment and the transaction was concluded. MMC thus repurchased a total of 16,020,268 shares in the transaction, for a total cost of $500 million and an average price per share to MMC of $31.2105. The repurchased shares were reflected as an increase in Treasury shares (a decrease in shares outstanding) on the respective delivery dates. This transaction was effected under a $500 million share repurchase authorization granted by MMC’s Board of Directors in May 2007. MMC did not repurchase any shares in 2008. Dividends MMC paid total dividends of $412 million in 2008 ($0.80 per share), $413 million ($0.76 per share) in 2007 and $374 million ($0.68 per share) in 2006. Investing Cash Flows Net cash used for investing activities amounted to $348 million in 2008. This compares with $3.0 billion of net cash generated from investing activities in 2007, primarily due to the Putnam transaction. Cash used for acquisitions totaled $126 million in 2008 compared with $206 million in 2007. Remaining deferred cash payments of approximately $60 million related to acquisitions completed in 2008 and prior years are recorded in accounts payable and accrued liabilities or in other liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets at December 31, 2008. Cash provided by the sale of securities was $20 million in 2008. In 2007, cash provided by the sale of securities of $78 million was partly offset by cash used to purchase investments of $44 million. MMC’s additions to fixed assets and capitalized software, which amounted to $386 million in 2008 and $378 million in 2007, primarily relate to computer equipment purchases, the refurbishing and modernizing of office facilities and software development costs. 40 Table of Contents MMC has committed to potential future investments of approximately $81 million in connection with its investments in Trident II and other funds managed by Stone Point Capital, LLC. The majority of MMC’s investment commitments for funds managed by Stone Point Capital, LLC are related to Trident II, the investment period for which is now closed for new investments. Any remaining capital calls for Trident II would relate to follow-on investments in existing portfolio companies or for management fees or other partnership expenses. Significant future capital calls related to Trident II are not expected. Although it is anticipated that Trident II will be harvesting its remaining portfolio, the timing of any portfolio company sales and capital distributions is unknown and not controlled by MMC. Commitments and Obligations MMC’s contractual obligations of the types identified in the table below were of the following amounts as of December 31, 2008: Payment due by Period Contractual Obligations (In millions of dollars) Total Within 1 Year 1-3Years 4-5 Years After 5Years Current portion of long-term debt $ 408 $ 408 $ — $ — $ — Long-term debt 3,198 — 567 518 2,113 Net operating leases 2,937 386 682 532 1,337 Service agreements 145 54 46 29 16 Other long-term obligations 60 25 35 — — Total $ 6,748 $ 873 $ 1,330 $ 1,079 $ 3,466 The above does not include unrecognized tax benefits of $293 million, accounted for under FIN 48, as MMC is unable to reasonably predict the timing of settlement of these liabilities, other than approximately $20 million that may become payable during 2009. The above does not include liabilities established under FIN 45 as MMC is unable to reasonably predict the timing of settlement of these liabilities, other than approximately $3 million that may become payable during 2009. Market Risk and Credit Risk Certain of MMC’s revenues, expenses, assets and liabilities are exposed to the impact of interest rate changes and fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates and equity markets. Interest Rate Risk and Credit Risk MMC has historically managed its net exposure to interest rate changes by utilizing a mixture of variable and fixed rate borrowings to finance MMC’s asset base. During 2007, virtually all of MMC’s variable rate borrowings were repaid. Interest income generated from MMC’s cash investments as well as invested fiduciary funds will vary with the general level of interest rates, particularly short-term interest rates. MMC had the following investments subject to variable interest rates: (In millions of dollars) December 31, 2008 Cash and cash equivalents invested inmoney market funds, certificates of deposit and time deposits (Note 1) $ 1,685 Fiduciary cash and investments (Note 1) $ 3,297 These investments and debt instruments are discussed more fully in the above-indicated Notes to the consolidated financial statements. Based on the above balances, if short-term interest rates decrease by 10%, or 13 basis points over the course of the year, annual interest income, including interest earned on fiduciary funds, would decrease by approximately $4 million. In addition to interest rate risk, our cash investments and fiduciary fund investments are subject to potential loss of value due to counterparty credit risk. To minimize this risk, MMC and its subsidiaries 41 Table of Contents invest pursuant to a Board approved investment policy. The policy mandates the preservation of principal and liquidity and requires broad diversification with counterparty limits assigned based primarily on credit rating and type of investment. MMC carefully monitors its cash and fiduciary fund investments and will further restrict the portfolio as appropriate to market conditions. The majority of cash and fiduciary funds are invested in short-term bank deposits and liquid money market funds. Foreign Currency Risk The translated values of revenue and expense from MMC’s international Risk and Insurance Services and Consulting operations are subject to fluctuations due to changes in currency exchange rates. The non-U.S. based revenue that is exposed to foreign exchange fluctuations is approximately 54% of total revenue. Note 17 details revenue by geographic area. We periodically use forward contracts and options to limit foreign currency exchange rate exposure on net income and cash flows for specific, clearly defined transactions arising in the ordinary course of business. Equity Price Risk MMC holds investments in public and private companies, as well as in certain private equity funds managed by Stone Point Capital. Publicly traded investments of $21 million are classified as available for sale under SFAS No. 115. Non-publicly traded investments of $91 million are accounted for using the cost method and $207 million are accounted for using the equity method under APB Opinion No. 18, “The Equity Method of Accounting for Investments in Common Stock”. The investments that are classified as available for sale or that are not publicly traded are subject to risk of changes in market value, which if determined to be other than temporary, could result in realized impairment losses. MMC periodically reviews the carrying value of such investments to determine if any valuation adjustments are appropriate under the applicable accounting pronouncements. Other A significant number of lawsuits and regulatory proceedings are pending. See Note 16 to the consolidated financial statements. Management’s Discussion of Critical Accounting Policies The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (“GAAP”) requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue and expenses, and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. Management considers the policies discussed below to be critical to understanding MMC’s financial statements because their application places the most significant demands on management’s judgment, and requires management to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain. Actual results may differ from those estimates. Legal and Other Loss Contingencies MMC and its subsidiaries are subject to numerous claims, lawsuits and proceedings. GAAP requires that liabilities for contingencies be recorded when it is probable that a liability has been incurred before the balance sheet date and the amount can be reasonably estimated. Significant management judgment is required to comply with this guidance. MMC analyzes its litigation exposure based on available information, including consultation with outside counsel handling the defense of these matters, to assess its potential liability. In addition, to the extent that insurance coverage is available, significant management judgment is required to determine the amount of recoveries that are expected under MMC’s various insurance programs. Retirement Benefits MMC maintains qualified and non-qualified defined benefit pension plans for its eligible U.S. employees and a variety of defined benefit and defined contribution plans for eligible non-U.S. employees. MMC’s policy for funding its tax qualified defined benefit retirement plans is to contribute amounts at least sufficient to meet the funding requirements set forth in U.S. and applicable foreign laws. 42 Table of Contents In September 2006, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) issued SFAS No. 158, “Employers’ Accounting for Defined Benefit Pension and Other Postretirement Plans – an amendment of FASB Statements No. 87, 88, 106, and 132 I” (“SFAS 158”). SFAS 158 requires that MMC recognize the funded status of its overfunded defined benefit pension and retiree medical plans (the “Plans”) as a net benefit plan asset and its unfunded and underfunded plans as a net benefit plan liability. The gains or losses and prior service costs or credits that have not been recognized as components of net periodic costs are recorded as a component of Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income (“AOCI”), net of tax, in MMC’s consolidated balance sheets. MMC adopted the provisions of SFAS 158, prospectively, on December 31, 2006. The determination of net periodic pension cost is based on a number of actuarial assumptions, including an expected long-term rate of return on plan assets, the discount rate and assumed rate of salary increase. Significant assumptions used in the calculation of net periodic pension costs and pension liabilities are disclosed in Note 8 to the consolidated financial statements. MMC believes the assumptions for each plan are reasonable and appropriate and will continue to evaluate actuarial assumptions at least annually and adjust them as appropriate. Based on its current assumptions, MMC expects pension expense in 2009 to be essentially the same as 2008. Future pension expense or credits will depend on plan provisions, future investment performance, future assumptions and various other factors related to the populations participating in the pension plans. Holding all other assumptions constant, a half-percentage point change in the rate of return and discount rate assumptions would affect net periodic pension cost for the U.S. and U.K. plans, which comprise approximately 85% of total pension plan liabilities, as follows: 0.5 Percentage Point Increase 0.5 Percentage Point Decrease (In millions of dollars) U.S. U.K. U.S. U.K. Assumed Rate of Return (16.5 ) (28.9 ) 16.5 28.9 Discount Rate (19.2 ) (41.8 ) 28.7 46.8 Changing the discount rate and leaving the other assumptions constant may not be representative of the impact on expense, because the long-term rates of inflation and salary increases are often correlated with the discount rate. MMC contributes to certain health care and life insurance benefits provided to its retired employees. The cost of these postretirement benefits for employees in the United States is accrued during the period up to the date employees are eligible to retire, but is funded by MMC as incurred. This postretirement liability is included in Other liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets. The key assumptions and sensitivity to changes in the assumed health care cost trend rate are discussed in Note 8 to the consolidated financial statements. Income Taxes MMC’s tax rate reflects its income, statutory tax rates and tax planning in the various jurisdictions in which it operates. Significant judgment is required in determining the annual tax rate and in evaluating uncertain tax positions. On January 1, 2007 MMC adopted the provisions of FIN 48, to account for the uncertainty in income taxes. Accordingly, MMC reports a liability for unrecognized tax benefits resulting from uncertain tax positions taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. The evaluation of a tax position in accordance with FIN 48 is a two-step process, the first step involves recognition. We determine whether it is more likely than not that a tax position will be sustained upon tax examination, including resolution of any related appeals or litigation, based on only the technical merits of the position. The technical merits of a tax position derive from both statutory and judicial authority (legislation and statutes, legislative intent, regulations, rulings, and case law) and their applicability to the facts and circumstances of the tax position. If a tax position does not meet the more likely than not recognition threshold, the benefit of that position is not recognized in the financial statements. The second step is measurement. A tax position that meets the more likely than not recognition threshold is measured to determine the amount of benefit to recognize in the financial statements. The tax position 43 Table of Contents is measured as the largest amount of benefit that is greater than 50 percent likely of being realized upon ultimate resolution with a taxing authority. Uncertain tax positions are evaluated based upon the facts and circumstances that exist at each reporting period and involve significant management judgment. Subsequent changes in judgment based upon new information may lead to changes in recognition, derecognition, and measurement. Adjustments may result, for example, upon resolution of an issue with the taxing authorities, or expiration of a statute of limitations barring an assessment for an issue. Prior to January 1, 2007, MMC estimated its uncertain income tax obligations in accordance with SFAS 109 and SFAS 5. MMC recognizes interest and penalties, if any, related to unrecognized tax benefits in income tax expense. Tax law requires items be included in MMC’s tax returns at different times than the items are reflected in the financial statements. As a result, the annual tax expense reflected in the consolidated statements of income is different than that reported in the tax returns. Some of these differences are permanent, such as expenses that are not deductible in the returns, and some differences are temporary and reverse over time, such as depreciation expense. Temporary differences create deferred tax assets and liabilities. Deferred tax liabilities generally represent tax expense recognized in the financial statements for which payment has been deferred, or expense for which a deduction has been taken already in the tax return but the expense has not yet been recognized in the financial statements. Deferred tax assets generally represent items that can be used as a tax deduction or credit in tax returns in future years for which a benefit has already been recorded in the financial statements. In assessing the need for and amount of a valuation allowance for deferred tax assets, the Company considers whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized and adjusts the valuation allowance accordingly. MMC evaluates all significant available positive and negative evidence, including the existence of losses in recent years and its forecast of future taxable income by jurisdiction, in assessing the need for a valuation allowance. MMC also considers tax-planning strategies that would result in realization of deferred tax assets, and the presence of taxable income in prior carryback years if carryback is permitted under the appropriate tax law. The underlying assumptions MMC uses in forecasting future taxable income require significant judgment and take into account MMC’s recent performance. The ultimate realization of deferred tax assets is dependent on the generation of future taxable income during the periods in which temporary differences or carryforwards are deductible or creditable. Valuation allowances are established for deferred tax assets when it is estimated that it is more likely than not future taxable income will be insufficient to fully use a deduction or credit in that jurisdiction. Fair Value Determinations Investment Valuation—MMC holds investments in both public and private companies, as well as certain private equity funds. The majority of the public investments are accounted for as available for sale securities under SFAS No. 115. Certain investments, primarily investments in private equity funds are accounted for using the equity method under APB Opinion No. 18. Although not directly recorded in MMC’s consolidated balance sheets, MMC’s defined benefit pension plans hold investments of approximately $8 billion. The fair value of these investments determines in part, the over- or under-funded status of those plans, which is included in MMC’s consolidated balance sheets. MMC periodically reviews the carrying value of its investments to determine if any valuation adjustments are appropriate under the applicable accounting pronouncements. MMC bases its review on the facts and circumstances as they relate to each investment. Fair value of investments in private equity funds is determined by the Funds’ investment managers. Factors considered in determining the fair value of private equity investments include: implied valuation of recently completed financing rounds that included sophisticated outside investors; performance multiples of comparable public companies; restrictions on the sale or disposal of the investments; trading characteristics of the securities; and the relative size of the holdings in comparison to other private investors and the public market float. In those instances where quoted market prices are not available, particularly for equity holdings in private companies, or formal restrictions limit the sale of securities, significant management judgment is required to determine the appropriate value of MMC’s investments. MMC reviews with the fund manager the appropriateness of valuation results for significant private equity investments. 44 Table of Contents Goodwill Impairment Testing—Under SFAS 142, MMC is required to assess goodwill and any indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment annually, or more frequently if circumstances indicate impairment may have occurred. MMC performs the annual impairment test for each of its reporting units during the third quarter of each year. Fair values of the reporting units are estimated using a market approach or a discounted cash flow model. Carrying values for the reporting units are based on balances at the prior quarter end and include directly identified assets and liabilities, as well as an allocation of those assets and liabilities not recorded at the reporting unit level. As previously disclosed, MMC performed an interim goodwill impairment assessment in its Risk Consulting & Technology segment which resulted in impairment charges totaling $540 million recorded in the first and second quarters of 2008. MMC completed its 2008 annual review in the third quarter of 2008 and concluded that goodwill was not impaired. The fair value estimates used in this assessment are dependent upon assumptions and estimates about the future profitability and other financial ratios of our reporting units, as well as relevant financial data, recent transactions and market valuations of comparable public companies. If in the future, the performance of our reporting units varies significantly from our projections or our assumptions or estimates about future profitability of our reporting units change, the estimated fair value of our reporting units could change materially and could result in an impairment of goodwill. Share-based Payment SFAS 123R “Share-based Payment”, requires among other things, that the estimated fair value of stock options be charged to earnings. Significant management judgment is required to determine the appropriate assumptions for inputs such as volatility and expected term necessary to estimate option values. In addition, management judgment is required to analyze the terms of the plans and awards granted thereunder to determine if awards will be treated as equity awards or liability awards, as defined by SFAS 123R. As of December 31, 2008, there was $16.8 million of unrecognized compensation cost related to stock option awards. The weighted-average periods over which the costs are expected to be recognized is 1.4 years. Also as of December 31, 2008, there was $288 million of unrecognized compensation cost related to MMC’s restricted stock, restricted stock unit and deferred stock unit awards. See Note 9 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding the adoption of SFAS 123R. New Accounting Pronouncements Note 1 contains a summary of the Company’s significant accounting policies, including a discussion of recently issued accounting pronouncements and their impact or potential future impact on MMC’s financial results, if determinable.

62709,MMC,"MARSH & MCLENNAN COMPANIES, INC.",2010,"Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. General Marsh & McLennan Companies, Inc. and Subsidiaries (“MMC”) is a global professional services firm providing advice and solutions in the areas of risk, strategy, and human capital. MMC’s subsidiaries include Marsh, which provides risk and insurance services; Guy Carpenter, which provides reinsurance services; Mercer, which provides human resource and related financial advice and services; Oliver Wyman Group, which provides management consulting and other services and Kroll, which provides risk consulting and technology services. MMC’s approximately 52,000 employees worldwide provide analysis, advice and transactional capabilities to clients in over 100 countries. MMC’s business segments are based on the services provided. Risk and Insurance Services includes risk management and insurance and reinsurance broking and services, provided primarily by Marsh and Guy Carpenter. Consulting, which comprises the activities of Mercer and Oliver Wyman Group, includes human resource consulting and related investment and outsourcing services, and specialized management, economic and brand consulting services. Risk Consulting & Technology, conducted through Kroll, includes risk consulting and related investigative, intelligence, financial, security and technology services. During the second quarter of 2009, Kroll sold Kroll Government Services (“KGS”), which has been classified as a discontinued operation. In 2008, MMC disposed of its U.S. and U.K. restructuring businesses to their respective management teams in separate leveraged buyouts. We describe the primary sources of revenue and categories of expense for each segment below, in our discussion of segment financial results. A reconciliation of segment operating income to total operating income is included in Note 17 to the consolidated financial statements included in Part II Item 8 in this report. The accounting policies used for each segment are the same as those used for the consolidated financial statements. This MD&A contains forward-looking statements as that term is defined in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. See “Information Concerning Forward-Looking Statements” at the outset of this report. Significant Developments in 2009 MMC’s historical financial information should be viewed in light of the significant developments discussed below. ¡ The settlement in the fourth quarter of 2009 of the securities and ERISA class action lawsuits filed in 2004. As a result, MMC recorded a $205 million charge in December 2009, which is tax deductible. Without admitting any liability or wrongdoing, MMC agreed to pay a total of $435 million to settle both lawsuits and received $230 million from its insurance carriers. A group of stockholders, representing approximately 4% of eligible shares, initially indicated their intent to opt out of this settlement, but subsequently agreed to opt in to the settlement for an additional payment of $25 million. This additional settlement cost has been accrued in the consolidated balance sheet at December 31, 2009. All claims related to these lawsuits are now fully resolved. ¡ Goodwill impairment charges of $315 million and $540 million in 2009 and 2008, respectively, related to MMC’s Risk Consulting & Technology segment. ¡ The impact of several acquisitions in the Risk and Insurance Services segment. In September 2009, Marsh acquired International Advisory Services, Ltd., the largest independent manager of captives and third-party insurance companies in Bermuda. In December 2009, Marsh acquired the NIA Group, LLC, one of the largest independent insurance agencies in the Northeast and the 34th largest agency in the U.S. In April 2009, Guy Carpenter completed the acquisition of John B. Collins Associates, Inc., previously the fifth-largest reinsurance intermediary in the U.S. and seventh-largest in the world. In October 2009, Guy Carpenter completed the acquisition of London-based specialty reinsurance broker Rattner Mackenzie Limited from HCC Insurance Holdings, Inc. 28 Table of Contents ¡ The sale of Kroll Government Services (“KGS”) in the second quarter of 2009. The loss on the disposal and the results of its operations are included in discontinued operations. In January 2005, MMC and its subsidiary Marsh Inc. entered into a settlement agreement with the New York State Attorney General (“NYAG”) and the New York State Insurance Department to settle a civil complaint relating to Marsh’s use of market service agreements with various insurance companies. Effective February 11, 2010, MMC, Marsh and their subsidiaries and affiliates entered into an Amended and Restated Agreement with the NYAG and the Superintendent of Insurance of the State of New York, which replaces the January 2005 Settlement Agreement. MMC, Marsh and their subsidiaries and affiliates are evaluating the potential impact of the changes contained in the Amended and Restated Agreement on their businesses. 29 Table of Contents Consolidated Results of Operations For the Years Ended December 31, (In millions, except per share figures) 2009 2008 2007 Revenue $ 10,493 $ 11,518 $ 11,135 Expense Compensation and benefits 6,484 7,181 6,937 Other operating expenses 3,185 3,549 3,344 Goodwill impairment charges 315 540 – Operating expenses 9,984 11,270 10,281 Operating Income $ 509 $ 248 $ 854 Income (Loss) from Continuing Operations $ 242 $ (69 ) $ 557 Discontinued Operations, net of tax — 7 1,932 Net Income (Loss) $ 242 $ (62 ) $ 2,489 Net Income (Loss) Attributable to MMC $ 227 $ (73 ) $ 2,475 Income (Loss) from Continuing Operations Per Share: Basic $ 0.43 $ (0.14 ) $ 0.98 Diluted $ 0.43 $ (0.15 ) $ 0.98 Net Income (Loss) Per Share Attributable to MMC: Basic $ 0.43 $ (0.13 ) $ 4.49 Diluted $ 0.42 $ (0.14 ) $ 4.45 Average number of shares outstanding: Basic 522 514 539 Diluted 524 514 542 Shares outstanding at December 31, 530 514 520 Consolidated operating income was $509 million in 2009 compared with $248 million in the prior year. The 2009 results include a $315 million goodwill impairment charge related to the Risk Consulting & Technology segment, a $230 million charge, net of insurance recoveries, for the settlement of the securities and ERISA class action lawsuits filed in 2004 and restructuring and other noteworthy items of $271 million. The 2008 operating results include a $540 million goodwill impairment charge and restructuring and noteworthy items of $439 million. Excluding these charges, consolidated operating income was $1.3 billion in 2009 compared with $1.2 billion in 2008. Risk and Insurance Services operating income increased $336 million to $796 million in 2009 compared with 2008, or 73%, resulting from improved results at both Marsh and Guy Carpenter, as well as a decrease of $80 million in restructuring and related charges. Consulting operating income decreased $150 million to $405 million in 2009 primarily due to reduced profitability in the first and second quarters of the year, as both Mercer and Oliver Wyman Group saw revenue declines as a result of the difficult economic environment. The consulting segment was also impacted by currency exchange rate movements, particularly Sterling and the Euro, which reduced the translated amount of 2009 net operating income by approximately $60 million compared with 2008. Risk Consulting & Technology incurred an operating loss of $272 million in 2009 compared with a $512 million operating loss in 2008. Operating results include goodwill impairment charges of $315 million and $540 million in 2009 and 2008, respectively. Results in 2008 also included a loss of $28 million on the disposal of the U.K. corporate restructuring businesses. Corporate expenses were $420 million in 2009 compared to $255 million in 2008. In 2009, corporate expenses include a net charge of $230 million related to settlements of the class action lawsuits described above and $31 million of restructuring charges, compared with $85 million of restructuring charges recorded in 2008. Consolidated net income attributable to MMC was $227 million in 2009, compared with a net loss of $73 million in the prior year. 30 Table of Contents Consolidated Revenues and Expenses MMC conducts business in many countries, as a result of which the impact of foreign exchange rate movements may impact period-to-period comparisons of revenue. Similarly, the revenue impact of acquisitions and dispositions may impact period-to-period comparisons of revenue. Underlying revenue measures the change in revenue from one period to another by isolating these impacts. The impact of foreign currency exchange fluctuations, acquisitions and dispositions on MMC’s operating revenues by segment is as follows: Year EndedDecember 31, Components of Revenue Change* (In millions, except percentage figures) %Change Revenue Currency Impact Acquisitions/ Dispositions Impact Underlying Revenue 2009 2008 Risk and Insurance Services Marsh $ 4,319 $ 4,524 (5 )% (4 )% — (1 )% Guy Carpenter 911 803 13 % (4 )% 9 % 8 % Subtotal 5,230 5,327 (2 )% (4 )% 2 % 0 % Fiduciary Interest Income 54 139 (61 )% (2 )% 1 % (60 )% Total Risk and Insurance Services 5,284 5,466 (3 )% (4 )% 2 % (1 )% Consulting Mercer 3,327 3,642 (9 )% (5 )% — (4 )% Oliver Wyman Group 1,282 1,554 (17 )% (4 )% 1 % (15 )% Total Consulting 4,609 5,196 (11 )% (5 )% — (7 )% Risk Consulting & Technology Kroll 667 797 (16 )% (2 )% (2 )% (12 )% Corporate Advisory and Restructuring 1 127 (99 )% — (99 )% 0 % Total Risk Consulting & Technology 668 924 (28 )% (2 )% (16 )% (10 )% Corporate Eliminations (68 ) (68 ) Total Revenue $ 10,493 $ 11,518 (9 )% (4 )% — (5 )% * Components of revenue change may not add due to rounding.

Revenue in the Risk and Insurance Services segment decreased 3% compared with 2008. Underlying revenue decreased 1% for the total Risk and Insurance Services segment, reflecting an 8% increase in Guy Carpenter, that was more than offset by a 1% decrease in Marsh and a 60% decrease in fiduciary interest income. Consulting revenue decreased 11%, resulting from a 9% decrease at Mercer and 17% decline at the Oliver Wyman Group. On an underlying basis, revenue decreased 7% reflecting a 4% decrease in Mercer, and a 15% decrease in the Oliver Wyman Group. Revenue decreased 28% in Risk Consulting & Technology, or 10% on an underlying basis. In 2008, Risk and Insurance Services revenue increased 1% compared with 2007. Underlying revenue growth was flat for the total Risk and Insurance Services segment, reflecting a 2% increase in Marsh, offset by a 7% decrease in Guy Carpenter, and a 23% decrease in fiduciary interest income. Consulting revenue increased 6%, resulting from an 8% increase in Mercer’s businesses and 2% growth in the Oliver Wyman Group. On an underlying basis, revenue increased 4% reflecting a 7% increase in Mercer, and a decrease of 2% in the Oliver Wyman Group. Revenue decreased 2% in Risk Consulting & Technology, or 6% on an underlying basis. During the fourth quarter of 2008, MMC disposed of its U.S. and U.K. restructuring businesses, which are included in the Risk Consulting & Technology segment. Expenses Consolidated operating expenses decreased 11% in 2009 compared with the same period in 2008. MMC recorded goodwill impairment charges of $315 million and $540 million in 2009 and 2008, respectively. In 2009, MMC recorded a $230 million charge, net of insurance recoveries, for the settlement of the securities and ERISA class action lawsuits filed in 2004. Restructuring and other noteworthy charges in 2009 of $271 million decreased $168 million from charges of $439 million in 2008. Excluding these charges, expenses were $9.2 billion in 2009 compared with $10.3 billion in 2008, or a decrease of 11%. The decrease reflects a 4% decline due to the impact of foreign currency exchange, a 1% decline due to the impact of dispositions and a 6% decline in underlying expenses. The decrease in underlying expenses is due to generally lower expenses, primarily in base salary, employee benefits, travel and entertainment, outside services, facilities, equipment and recoverable expenses from clients. This reflects the Company’s continued effort to monitor and control expenses. Consolidated operating expenses in 2008 increased 10%, which included the $540 million goodwill impairment charge recorded in 2008 and a $283 million increase from restructuring and noteworthy charges in 2008 as compared with 2007. Excluding these two items, expenses increased 2% in 2008 compared with 2007 and were essentially flat on an underlying basis. Restructuring Actions Initiated in 2009 In 2009, MMC implemented restructuring actions which resulted in costs totaling $237 million, primarily related to severance and benefits and costs for future rent and other real estate costs. These costs were incurred as follows: Risk and Insurance Services—$171 million, Consulting—$45 million, Risk Consulting & Technology—$8 million and Corporate—$13 million. These activities resulted in the elimination of approximately 1,500 positions at Marsh, 100 positions at Guy Carpenter, 600 positions at Mercer, 200 positions at Kroll and 40 positions at Corporate. The annualized cost savings from these actions are expected to be approximately $200 million. Actions Initiated Prior to 2009 Prior to 2009, MMC implemented several restructuring and cost-savings initiatives related to firm-wide infrastructure, organization structure and operating company business processes. During 2009, MMC 33 Table of Contents incurred restructuring costs of $14 million in connection with actions initiated in prior years, primarily due to adjustments to the estimated future rent and real estate costs related to previously vacated space in MMC’s New York headquarters building. Putnam Transaction On August 3, 2007, Great-West Lifeco Inc. completed its purchase of Putnam Investments Trust for $3.9 billion in cash. The gain on disposal and Putnam’s results of operations through the date of sale are included in discontinued operations in the accompanying consolidated statements of income. As described in Note 5 to the consolidated financial statements, MMC provided certain indemnities related to the transaction, and also has established liabilities for uncertain tax positions. As these issues are resolved, or as facts and circumstances related to these issues change in the future, the related liabilities will be adjusted and recorded in discontinued operations. Other Businesses Exited During the second quarter of 2009, Kroll sold Kroll Government Services (“KGS”). The financial results of KGS are included in discontinued operations. During the fourth quarter of 2008, MMC sold its U.S. and U.K. restructuring businesses to their respective management teams in separate leveraged buyouts. Based on the terms and conditions of the disposals, MMC determined it has “continuing involvement” in these businesses, as that term is used in SEC Staff Accounting Bulletin Topic 5e. Therefore, the results of these businesses, including the loss on disposal, are included in continuing operations. MMC recorded a loss of $28 million on the disposition of the U.K. Corporate Advisory and Restructuring businesses. The net assets of these U.K. businesses were written-off upon transfer to the new owners. MMC will receive royalties on future revenue of these businesses over the next three years. The royalties will be recognized when earned under the terms of the contract and when collectibility is reasonably assured. The transfer of the U.S. restructuring business was financed with a seller note. If MMC receives interest and principal payments as scheduled for the U.S. business, it will recover the value of the net assets transferred to the new owners and recognize a gain on the disposal of $18 million. Through December 31, 2009, MMC recognized $1 million of royalty payments related to the U.K. businesses and $1 million of the deferred gain related to the U.S. business. In February 2010, Kroll sold Kroll Laboratory Specialists, its substance abuse testing business for $110 million. The disposal transaction will be recorded in MMC’s consolidated financial statements during the first quarter of 2010. Risk and Insurance Services In the Risk and Insurance Services segment, MMC’s subsidiaries and other affiliated entities act as brokers, agents or consultants for insureds, insurance underwriters and other brokers in the areas of risk management, insurance broking and insurance program management services, primarily under the name of Marsh; and engage in reinsurance broking, catastrophe and financial modeling services and related advisory functions, primarily under the name of Guy Carpenter. Marsh and Guy Carpenter are compensated for brokerage and consulting services primarily through fees paid by clients and/or commissions paid out of premiums charged by insurance and reinsurance companies. Commission rates vary in amount depending upon the type of insurance or reinsurance coverage provided, the particular insurer or reinsurer, the capacity in which the broker acts and negotiations with clients. Revenues are affected by premium rate levels in the insurance/reinsurance markets, the amount of risk retained by insurance and reinsurance clients themselves and by the value of the risks that have been insured since commission based compensation is frequently related to the premiums paid by insureds/reinsureds. In many cases, compensation may be negotiated in advance, based on the types and amounts of risks to be analyzed by MMC and ultimately placed into the insurance market or retained by the client. The trends and comparisons of revenue from one period to the next will therefore be affected by changes in premium rate levels, fluctuations in client risk retention, and increases or decreases in the value of risks that have been insured, as well as new and lost business, and the volume of business from new and existing clients. 34 Table of Contents Marsh and Guy Carpenter receive interest income on certain funds (such as premiums and claims proceeds) held in a fiduciary capacity for others. The investment of fiduciary funds is regulated by state and other insurance authorities. These regulations typically provide for segregation of fiduciary funds and limit the types of investments that may be made with them. Interest income from these investments varies depending on the amount of funds invested and applicable interest rates, both of which vary from time to time. For presentation purposes, fiduciary interest is segregated from the other revenues of Marsh and Guy Carpenter and separately presented within the segment, as shown in the revenue by segments charts earlier in this MD&A. The results of operations for the Risk and Insurance Services segment are presented below: (In millions of dollars) 2009 2008 2007 Revenue $ 5,284 $ 5,466 $ 5,400 Compensation and Benefits 3,023 3,299 3,318 Other Operating Expenses 1,465 1,707 1,740 Expense 4,488 5,006 5,058 Operating Income $ 796 $ 460 $ 342 Operating Income Margin 15.1 % 8.4 % 6.3 % Revenue Revenue in Risk and Insurance Services decreased 3% in 2009 compared with 2008, reflecting a 4% negative impact of foreign currency exchange fluctuations, a 1% decrease on an underlying basis partly offset by a 2% increase from acquisitions. In Marsh, revenue decreased 5% from 2008, reflecting a 4% negative impact of currency translation and a 1% decrease in underlying revenue. These results reflect the continued difficult economic environment, in addition to the pressure on insurance premium levels, commissions and fees. Despite these difficult conditions, on a geographic basis, Marsh’s International revenue increased 2% on an underlying basis reflecting a 9% increase in Latin America and a 5% increase in Asia Pacific, reflecting strong new business production on a global basis, offset by a decrease of 4% in the U.S. / Canada region. Guy Carpenter’s revenue of $911 million in 2009 increased 13% compared with the prior year, or 8% on an underlying basis. The increase in underlying revenue was primarily due to higher client revenue retention and an increase in new business. In April 2009, Guy Carpenter completed the acquisition of John B. Collins Associates, Inc., previously the fifth-largest reinsurance intermediary in the U.S. and seventh-largest in the world. In October 2009, Guy Carpenter completed the acquisition of London-based specialty reinsurance broker Rattner Mackenzie Limited from HCC Insurance Holdings, Inc. These acquisitions contributed 7% to the year-over-year revenue growth. Fiduciary interest income for the Risk and Insurance Services segment was $54 million in 2009, a decrease of 61% compared with the same period of 2008, driven by lower interest rates. Revenue in Risk and Insurance Services increased 1% in 2008 compared with 2007, reflecting the positive impact of foreign currency exchange fluctuations, and was flat on an underlying basis. Marsh’s revenue increased 4% in 2008 compared with 2007, reflecting a 1% positive impact of currency translation and a 2% increase in underlying revenue. Client revenue retention increased by 3 percentage points over 2007. New business production was also strong. On a geographic basis, Marsh’s international revenue increased 6% while the U.S. / Canada region increased 1% compared with 2007. Guy Carpenter revenue decreased 6% in 2008 compared with 2007, or 7% on an underlying basis. Reinsurance premium rates declined during the year across most coverages. Fiduciary interest income for the segment decreased 22% in 2008 compared with 2007, or 23% on an underlying basis, primarily due to lower interest rates, and to a lesser extent, lower average invested funds. 35 Table of Contents Expense Expenses in the Risk and Insurance Services segment decreased 10% in 2009, compared with the prior year. Underlying expenses decreased 8% with the remaining reduction due to the impact of foreign currency exchange of 4% partly offset by an increase of 1% due to the impact of acquisitions. The decline in underlying expenses reflects lower compensation and benefit costs and a decrease in other operating cost categories, as the Company continues its efforts to monitor and control expenses. Despite increased variable compensation, total compensation and benefits expense decreased reflecting lower total base compensation due to the reductions in the number of employees as a result of restructuring activities. The decrease in other expenses includes a reduction in professional liability costs reflecting the impact of a $33 million charge recorded in the third quarter of 2008 and a reduction of $39 million in net settlement, legal and regulatory costs (reduced by insurance recoveries in 2009). The expense decrease also reflects lower restructuring and related costs in 2009 as compared with 2008. In 2008, expenses in the Risk and Insurance Services segment decreased 1% compared with the prior year, reflecting a 2% decrease in underlying expenses, partly offset by a 1% increase related to the impact of foreign exchange. The reduction in compensation and benefits expense in 2008 compared with 2007 reflects a reduction in headcount during the year and a decline in benefits expenses partly offset by increased incentive compensation costs and higher severance costs at both Marsh and Guy Carpenter. The decrease in other expenses reflects the continued focus on expense control and primarily relates to reductions in travel, entertainment, meetings, marketing and advertising. These decreases were partly offset by higher restructuring and related costs in 2008 compared with 2007, and a $33 million charge in the third quarter of 2008 related to a professional liability claim. Consulting MMC conducts business in its Consulting segment through two main business groups. Mercer provides consulting expertise, advice, services and solutions in the areas of retirement, health & benefits, rewards, talent & communications, outsourcing, and investment consulting & management. Oliver Wyman Group provides specialized management and economic and brand consulting services. The major component of revenue in the Consulting segment business is fees paid by clients for advice and services. Mercer, principally through its health & benefits line of business, also earns revenue in the form of commissions received from insurance companies for the placement of group (and occasionally individual) insurance contracts, primarily life, health and accident coverages. Revenue for Mercer’s investment management business and certain of Mercer’s outsourcing businesses consists principally of fees based on assets under management or administration. Revenue in the Consulting segment is affected by, among other things, global economic conditions, including changes in clients’ particular industries and markets. Revenue is also subject to competition due to the introduction of new products and services, broad trends in employee demographics, including levels of employment, the effect of government policies and regulations, and fluctuations in interest and foreign exchange rates. Revenues from the provision of investment management services and retirement trust and administrative services are significantly affected by securities market performance. The results of operations for the Consulting segment are presented below: (In millions of dollars) 2009 2008 2007 Revenue $ 4,609 $ 5,196 $ 4,884 Compensation and Benefits 2,917 3,204 2,953 Other Operating Expenses 1,287 1,437 1,325 Expense 4,204 4,641 4,278 Operating Income $ 405 $ 555 $ 606 Operating Income Margin 8.8 % 10.7 % 12.4 % 36 Table of Contents Revenue Consulting revenue in 2009 decreased 11% compared with the same period in 2008, or 7% on an underlying basis. Due to the difficult economic conditions, both Mercer and Oliver Wyman experienced decreased demand for consulting services in 2009. Mercer’s revenue decreased 9%, or 4% on an underlying basis, reflecting decreases in underlying revenue in consulting and outsourcing of 4% and 6%, respectively, partly offset by an increase in investment consulting and management of 6%. Within Mercer’s consulting lines, underlying revenue in retirement decreased 1% versus prior year, health and benefits decreased 1% and rewards, talent & communications decreased 17%. Oliver Wyman’s revenue decreased 17%, or 15% on an underlying basis, compared with the prior year. Consulting revenue in 2008 increased 6% compared with 2007 comprising 8% growth at Mercer and 2% growth at the Oliver Wyman Group. Revenue for the segment increased 4% on an underlying basis. Within Mercer, the revenue increase of 8% reflects growth in retirement of 9%, health and benefits of 9%, other consulting lines of 9%, outsourcing of 3% and investment consulting & management of 14%. Mercer’s revenue grew 7% on an underlying basis. Revenue for the Oliver Wyman Group grew 2%, but decreased 2% on an underlying basis, compared with the same period in 2007. Expense Consulting expenses decreased 9% in 2009 compared with the same period in 2008, reflecting a 4% decrease from the impact of foreign exchange rates and a 6% decrease on an underlying basis. The decline in underlying expenses reflects a decrease in base salaries and employee benefits due to decreased staff levels along with cost reductions in all discretionary expense categories and lower recoverable expenses from clients. These decreases were partly offset by an increase in professional liability costs of approximately $30 million, primarily reflecting a legal settlement at Mercer, and higher severance costs at Oliver Wyman due to capacity reductions. Consulting expenses increased 8% in 2008 compared with 2007, or 6% on an underlying basis. Compensation and benefit costs increased due to a higher volume of activity at Mercer, largely in the first three quarters of the year. As part of its ongoing effort to realize operational efficiencies, Mercer reduced its headcount in the fourth quarter of 2008, resulting in a $40 million restructuring charge. The increase in other operating expenses reflects a $70 million increase resulting from expenses that are reimbursable by clients. Risk Consulting & Technology MMC’s Risk Consulting & Technology segment which comprises the activity of Kroll and Corporate Advisory and Restructuring, includes risk consulting, and related investigative, intelligence, financial, security and technology services. In May 2009, Kroll sold KGS, its government services business. The results of KGS’s operations have been reclassified into discontinued operations for all periods presented in the accompanying income statements. As previously discussed, during the fourth quarter of 2008, MMC disposed of its U.S. and U.K. restructuring businesses to their respective management teams in separate leveraged buyouts. Based on the terms and conditions of the disposals, MMC determined it has “continuing involvement” in these businesses, as that term is used in SEC Staff Accounting Bulletin Topic 5e. Therefore, the results of these businesses, including the loss on disposal, are included in continuing operations. Kroll receives compensation primarily in the form of fees paid by clients. These fees are typically earned on an hourly, project, fixed fee or per-unit basis. Kroll’s revenue is subject to changes in international economic and regulatory conditions, including the levels of mortgage applications and new employment. Kroll is also subject to normal competitive forces such as pricing pressures, demand for professional staff and new product development on the part of competitors, particularly in technology services. 37 Table of Contents The results of operations for the Risk Consulting & Technology segment are presented below: (In millions of dollars) 2009 2008 2007 Revenue $ 668 $ 924 $ 945 Compensation and Benefits 303 447 446 Other Operating Expenses 322 449 393 Goodwill Impairment Charge 315 540 — Expense 940 1,436 839 Operating (Loss) Income $ (272 ) $ (512 ) $ 106 Operating Income Margin N/A N/A 11.2 % Revenue Risk Consulting & Technology revenues in 2009 decreased 28% compared with 2008 primarily reflecting the divestiture of Corporate Advisory and Restructuring, as well as a decrease in underlying revenue at Kroll. Kroll’s revenue was $667 million, a decrease of 16% from the previous year, or 12% on an underlying basis. The underlying revenue decrease was driven by declines in background screening of 9%, risk mitigation and response of 26%, and in litigation support and data recovery of 5%. In May 2009, Kroll sold its government services business, which has been reclassified into discontinued operations for all periods presented. Risk Consulting & Technology revenues in 2008 decreased 2% compared with 2007, or 6% on an underlying basis. Revenue in Kroll’s litigation support and data recovery and risk mitigation and response businesses increased 6% and 2%, respectively, on an underlying basis compared with 2007. Revenues in Kroll’s background screening business decreased 11% due to declines in both employment and mortgage related background screening. Corporate Advisory and Restructuring revenue was $127 million in 2008, compared with $172 million in 2007. Due to the disposal of the U.S. and U.K. restructuring businesses, results in 2009 and in the future will only include revenue earned by MMC under the royalty arrangements discussed above. Expense Risk Consulting & Technology expenses decreased 35% in 2009 compared with 2008 reflecting the impact of goodwill impairment charges of $315 million and $540 million recorded in 2009 and 2008, respectively, and a decrease in restructuring and related charges of $36 million. Excluding these charges, Risk Consulting & Technology expenses for 2009 decreased 28% compared to prior year. On an underlying basis, expenses decreased 18% as compared to prior year. The decrease in expenses reflects lower salaries due to decreased headcount, a lower level of recoverable expenses from Kroll clients and a favorable impact on the year-over-year expense comparison due to the $28 million loss on the disposal of the U.K. corporate and advisory businesses recorded in 2008. Risk Consulting & Technology expenses in 2008 increased 71% compared with 2007. Expenses in 2008 included the $540 million goodwill impairment charge, restructuring charges of $17 million and the $28 million loss on the disposal of the U.K. corporate and advisory businesses. Excluding these items, Risk Consulting & Technology expenses for 2008 increased 1% compared with 2007 but decreased 2% on an underlying basis. Corporate Expenses Corporate expenses in 2009 were $420 million compared to $255 million in 2008. Expenses in 2009 include a $230 million charge related to the settlement of the securities and ERISA class action lawsuits described above. Restructuring and related charges in 2009 were $31 million compared with $85 million in 2008. Excluding these charges, expenses would have decreased 6%. This decrease is due to lower consulting and legal fees in 2009 compared to 2008. 38 Table of Contents Corporate expenses were $255 million in 2008, compared to $200 million in 2007. In 2008, expenses include $85 million of restructuring and related charges comprising a $62 million charge related to estimated future rent and other real estate costs to exit five floors in MMC’s New York headquarters building and previously vacated space in the U.K. and other locations. In 2007, restructuring and related items were $28 million. Expenses in 2008 include a $10 million credit for a payment from U.S. Investigative Services, Inc. (“USIS”) in connection with the hiring of MMC’s former CEO, partly offset by costs related to the departure of several senior executives. Discontinued Operations In the second quarter of 2009, Kroll completed the sale of KGS. The loss on the disposal of KGS and its financial results for 2007 through 2009 are included in discontinued operations. Discontinued operations in 2009 also includes the accretion of interest as well as changes in estimates related to an indemnity for uncertain tax positions provided as part of the Putnam transaction. Results of discontinued operations in 2008 include the effects of four discontinued operations – Putnam, Mediservice, Kroll Government Services and Kroll Crucible – which are discussed in more detail below. With regard to Putnam, discontinued operations in 2008 includes (1) the impact of immaterial corrections and other adjustments to the fourth quarter of 2007 tax provision related to the transaction, (2) adjustments to the tax provision to reflect differences between tax returns filed in 2008 and the initial estimated provisions, and (3) interest on liabilities for certain tax-related indemnities provided as part of the transaction. In the first quarter of 2008, Marsh completed the sale of Mediservice, a claims administration operation in Brazil. The gain on this disposal, net of tax, is included in discontinued operations in 2008. In the third quarter of 2008, Kroll completed the sale of Kroll Crucible (“Crucible”), a division of its government services operation. The loss on this disposal, net of tax, is included in discontinued operations in 2008. In 2007, discontinued operations include the gain on the sale of Putnam, Putnam’s operating income through August 2, 2007 and the operating results for KGS. Summarized Statements of Income data for discontinued operations are as follows: For the Years Ended December 31, (In millions of dollars) 2009 2008 2007 Revenue $ 32 $ 69 $ 840 Income before provision for income tax $ 11 $ 15 $ 152 Provision for income tax 4 4 68 Income from discontinued operations, net of tax 7 11 84 Gain on disposal of discontinued operations 8 29 2,965 Provision for income tax 15 33 1,117 (Loss) Gain on disposal of discontinued operations, net of tax (7 ) (4 ) 1,848 Discontinued operations, net of tax $ — $ 7 $ 1,932 39 Table of Contents Corporate Items Interest Interest income earned on corporate funds amounted to $17 million in 2009, compared with $48 million in 2008. The decrease in interest income is due to lower average interest rates in 2009 compared with the prior year. Interest expense of $241 million in 2009 increased $21 million from the prior year. This increase is primarily due to the pre-funding in the first quarter of the $400 million of senior notes that matured in June 2009, the higher interest rate on the new bonds compared with those that matured, as well as higher interest expense associated with acquisition related liabilities. MMC used the proceeds of the newly issued senior notes to fund the maturity of $400 million of senior notes in June 2009. Corporate interest income decreased from $95 million in 2007 to $48 million in 2008. The decrease primarily reflects the combined effect of lower average interest rates and a lower level of invested balances in 2008 compared with the prior year. The invested balances in the second half of 2007 were higher primarily due to proceeds received from the Putnam transaction, which were subsequently used to repurchase MMC shares, pay down debt and pay taxes on the gain on the disposal. Interest expense of $220 million in 2008 decreased from $267 million in 2007. The decrease in interest expense is due to a decrease in the average level of debt outstanding compared to the prior year. Investment Income (Loss) In 2009, investment losses were $2 million compared with a $12 million loss in the prior year. The decrease reflects lower mark-to-market declines on Risk Capital Holdings’ private equity investments recorded in 2009 compared to 2008 and realized gains relating to the sale of equity securities recorded in 2009. The gains of $173 million recorded in 2007 primarily related to mark-to-market gains on private equity fund investments and gains from the sale of investments. Income Taxes MMC’s consolidated effective tax rate in 2009 was 14.5%. The tax rate reflects reductions relating to a decrease in the liability for unrecognized tax benefits and foreign operations taxed at rates lower than the U.S. statutory tax rate, partially offset by the effect of a nondeductible $315 million non-cash goodwill impairment charge. The decrease in the liability for unrecognized tax benefits resulted from expiring statutes of limitations, audit settlements and changes in estimates. MMC’s consolidated effective tax rate in 2008 was 207.8%. Tax expense exceeded income before taxes and minority interest primarily as a result of a nondeductible goodwill impairment charge of $540 million, partially offset by foreign operations taxed at rates lower than the U.S. statutory rate. Because the impairment charge was not deductible for tax purposes, it reduced pre-tax income without a corresponding decrease in tax. In addition, significantly lower pre-tax income caused the tax components to disproportionately affect the tax rate, magnifying the effect of foreign operations, state taxes, and other permanent differences. The 2007 consolidated effective tax rate of 34.9% primarily reflects the unfavorable impact of international tax law changes in 2007. The lower tax rate generally attributed to MMC’s foreign operations reflects income taxed at rates lower than the 35% U.S. federal tax rate, net of the U.S. tax impact of repatriation of foreign earnings. The reduced effective tax rate primarily reflects lower corporate tax rates that prevail outside of the U.S., enhanced by planning that further reduces the impact of taxes worldwide. Under current U.S. tax law, the Company anticipates its non-U.S. operations will continue to incur taxes at rates under 35%, although the percentage impact on the tax rate is expected to moderate as increases in U.S. pretax income change the geographic mix of income. Nevertheless, the effective tax rate is expected to remain significantly variable for the foreseeable future. The rate is sensitive to the geographic mix and repatriation of MMC’s earnings, which may have a favorable or unfavorable impact on the rate. This also could result in foreign tax credit carryforwards 40 Table of Contents arising in future periods for which a valuation allowance may be required. Losses in certain jurisdictions cannot be offset by earnings from other operations, and may require valuation allowances affecting the rate, depending on estimates of the realizability of associated deferred tax assets. The tax rate is also sensitive to changes in unrecognized tax benefits, including the impact of settled tax audits and expired statutes of limitation. The realization of deferred tax assets is dependent on the generation of future taxable income during the periods in which the tax benefits are deductible or creditable. MMC and Marsh have been profitable globally. However, tax liabilities are determined and assessed on a legal entity and jurisdictional basis. Certain taxing jurisdictions allow or require combined or consolidated tax filings. In the United States, certain groups within MMC, which file on a combined basis, and certain entities within Marsh’s operations, which file on a separate entity basis, incurred losses for the last two years as well as the current year. MMC assessed the realizability of its domestic deferred tax assets, particularly state deferred tax assets of Marsh relating to jurisdictions in which it files separate tax returns, state deferred tax assets of all of MMC’s domestic operations related to jurisdictions in which MMC files a unitary or combined state tax return, and foreign tax credit carryforwards in MMC’s consolidated U.S. federal tax return. When making its assessment about the realization of its domestic deferred tax assets at December 31, 2009, MMC considered all available evidence, placing particular weight on evidence that could be objectively verified. The evidence considered included (i) the nature, frequency, and severity of current and cumulative financial reporting losses, (ii) actions completed that are designed to reduce capacity and adjust to lower demand in the current economic environment, (iii) profit trends evidenced by recent improvements in MMC’s and Marsh’s operating performance, (iv) the nonrecurring nature of some of the items that contributed to the cumulative losses, (v) the carryforward periods for the net operating losses (“NOLs”) and foreign tax credit carryforwards, (vi) the sources and timing of future taxable income, giving weight to sources according to the extent to which they can be objectively verified, and (vii) tax planning strategies that would be implemented, if necessary, to accelerate utilization of NOLs. Based on its assessment, MMC concluded that it is more likely than not that a substantial portion of these deferred tax assets are realizable and a valuation allowance was recorded to reduce the domestic tax assets to the amount that MMC believes is more likely than not to be realized. In the event sufficient taxable income is not generated in future periods, additional valuation allowances of up to $170 million could be required relating to these domestic deferred tax assets. The realization of the remaining U.S. federal deferred tax assets is not as sensitive to U.S. profits because it is supported by anticipated repatriation of future earnings from MMC’s profitable global operations. In addition, when making its assessment about the realization of its domestic deferred tax assets at December 31, 2009, MMC continued to assess the realizability of deferred tax assets of certain other entities with a history of recent losses, including other U.S. entities that file separate state tax returns and foreign subsidiaries, and recorded valuation allowances as appropriate. Changes in tax laws or tax rulings may have a significant adverse impact on our effective tax rate. For example, proposals for fundamental U.S. international tax reform, such as the recent proposal by President Obama’s Administration, if enacted, could have a significant adverse impact on the effective tax rate. Liquidity and Capital Resources MMC’s liquidity needs are primarily for operating expenses, servicing debt, funding pension obligations, paying dividends on outstanding stock, funding acquisitions and capital expenditures. As a holding company, MMC’s primary source for meeting these requirements is cash flows from operating subsidiaries. Other sources of liquidity include borrowing facilities discussed below in financing cash flows. Cash on our consolidated balance sheet includes funds available for general corporate purposes. Funds held on behalf of clients in a fiduciary capacity are segregated and shown separately in the consolidated balance sheet as an offset to fiduciary liabilities. Fiduciary funds cannot be used for general corporate purposes, and should not be considered as a source of liquidity for MMC. 41 Table of Contents Operating Cash Flows MMC generated $640 million of cash from operations in 2009 compared with $940 million in 2008. These amounts reflect the net income (loss) reported by MMC during those periods, excluding gains or losses from investments and the disposition of businesses, adjusted for non-cash charges and changes in working capital which relate, primarily, to the timing of payments for accrued liabilities or receipts of assets. Cash generated from the disposition of businesses is included in investing cash flows. In December 2009, MMC paid $435 million into settlement funds related to the securities and ERISA class action lawsuits described above. Through December 31, 2009, MMC collected $163 million of the total $230 million recovery from its insurers. The remaining $67 million of insurance recoveries, which were received in January 2010, are recorded in other receivables in the consolidated balance sheet at December 31, 2009. As described above, MMC accrued an additional $25 million of settlement costs, which is included in accounts payable and accrued expenses in the consolidated balance sheet at December 31, 2009. In 2007, cash outflows included tax payments of $933 million related to the disposition of businesses, primarily Putnam. Although the cash proceeds from the Putnam transaction are included in investing cash flows, the applicable accounting literature specifies that the related payment of taxes be included in operating cash flows and not allocated to other cash flow categories. MMC’s expected funding for its U.S. non-qualified and non-U.S. pension plans in 2010 is approximately $25 million and $250 million, respectively. MMC’s policy for funding its tax-qualified defined benefit retirement plans is to contribute amounts at least sufficient to meet the funding requirements set forth in U.S. and applicable foreign laws. There currently is no ERISA funding requirement for the U.S. qualified plan for 2009 or 2010. Funding requirements for non-U.S. plans vary by country. Contribution rates are determined by the local actuaries based on local funding practices and requirements. Funding amounts may be influenced by future asset performance, the level of discount rates and other variables impacting the assets and/or liabilities of the plan. In addition, amounts funded in the future, to the extent not due under regulatory requirements, may be affected by alternative uses of MMC’s cash flows, including dividends, investments and share repurchases. During 2009, MMC’s defined benefit pension plan assets experienced investment gains of 13% in the U.S. and 15% in the U.K., our largest plan. In 2008, defined benefit plan assets experienced investment losses of 18% in the U.S. and 14% in the U.K. due to the severe downturn in the global equity markets. Pension liabilities are largely impacted by the discount rate set as of year-end. In the U.S., interest rates used to discount liabilities continued to decline during 2009, resulting in a lower year-end discount rate in 2009 than the prior year-end. This contributed to the increase in the projected benefit obligation for the U.S. plans from 2008 to 2009. While our U.S. plans show a funding deficit as of the end of 2009, no contributions to the U.S. qualified plan are required in 2010. Our U.K. plan liabilities increased in local currency terms in 2009, primarily due to the decrease in the discount rate. In addition to scheduled contributions made to the U.K. plan throughout 2009, in the first half of the year, we made discretionary pension contributions of approximately $150 million to the plan. These contributions are included in the $400 million of contributions to non-U.S. plans noted below. Overall, MMC’s aggregate pension expense in 2010 is expected to increase by approximately $110 million before the partly-offsetting impacts on bonuses and other incentive compensation and possible movement of foreign exchange rates. During 2009, MMC contributed $22 million to the U.S. pension plans and approximately $400 million to the significant non-U.S. pension plans, compared with $20 million for U.S. plans and $250 million for significant non-U.S. plans in 2008. Financing Cash Flows Net cash used for financing activities was $464 million in 2009 compared with $643 million of net cash used for financing activities in 2008. MMC reduced outstanding debt by approximately $10 million and $260 million in 2009 and 2008, respectively. During 2007, MMC reduced outstanding debt by approximately $1.1 billion and repurchased $1.3 billion of its common stock. These actions are discussed more fully below. 42 Table of Contents Debt During 2009, MMC’s 7.125% ten-year $400 million bond matured. MMC used cash on hand as well as the proceeds from the issuance of 9.25% ten-year $400 million senior notes in the first quarter to manage liquidity, including the funding of the maturing notes. During 2008, MMC’s 3.625% five-year fixed rate $250 million senior notes matured. MMC used cash on hand to manage liquidity, including the repayment of these notes. During 2007, MMC utilized commercial paper and bank borrowings, as well as cash on hand, to manage liquidity, including the funding of maturing bonds and the repurchase of shares. In the first quarter of 2007, MMC’s 5.375% five-year $500 million senior notes matured. MMC’s three-year floating rate $500 million senior notes matured in the third quarter of 2007. MMC used a portion of its proceeds from the Putnam transaction to pay down outstanding commercial paper and revolving credit facility borrowings. At December 31, 2008, no commercial paper or revolving credit facility borrowings were outstanding. In the first quarter of 2009, Marsh acquired the remaining minority interest of a previously majority owned entity for total purchase consideration of $47 million reflecting cash paid of $24 million and future consideration of $23 million. On October 23, 2009, MMC and certain of its foreign subsidiaries entered into a new $1.0 billion multi-currency three-year unsecured revolving credit facility, which replaced the $1.2 billion facility that was previously in place. The interest rate on this facility varies based upon MMC’s credit ratings and MMC’s credit default swap levels, subject to floors and caps. The facility requires MMC to maintain certain coverage and leverage ratios which are tested quarterly. There were no borrowings outstanding under this facility at December 31, 2009. MMC’s senior debt is currently rated Baa2 by Moody’s and BBB- by Standard & Poor’s. MMC’s short-term debt is currently rated P-2 by Moody’s and A-3 by Standard & Poor’s. MMC carries a stable outlook from both Moody’s and Standard & Poor’s. MMC also maintains other credit facilities, guarantees and letters of credit with various banks, primarily related to operations located outside the United States, aggregating $250 million at December 31, 2009 and $285 million at December 31, 2008. There were no outstanding borrowings under these facilities at December 31, 2009. Share Repurchases In August 2007, MMC entered into an $800 million accelerated share repurchase agreement with a financial institution counterparty. Under the terms of the agreement, MMC paid the full $800 million purchase price and took delivery from the counterparty of an initial tranche of 21,320,530 shares of MMC common stock, which were reflected as an increase in Treasury shares (a decrease in shares outstanding) on the delivery date. This number of shares was the quotient of the $800 million purchase price divided by a contractual “cap” price of $37.5225 per share. Based on the market price of MMC’s common stock over the subsequent settlement period, in March 2008 the counterparty delivered to MMC an additional 10,751,000 shares for no additional payment and the transaction was concluded. MMC thus repurchased a total of 32,071,630 shares at an average price per share to MMC of $24.9442. The repurchased shares were reflected as an increase in Treasury shares (a decrease in shares outstanding) on the respective delivery dates. This transaction was effected under a $1.5 billion share repurchase authorization granted by MMC’s Board of Directors in August 2007. MMC remains authorized to repurchase additional shares of its common stock up to a value of $700 million. There is no time limit on this authorization. In May 2007, MMC entered into a $500 million accelerated share repurchase agreement with a financial institution counterparty. Under the terms of the agreement, MMC paid the full $500 million purchase price and took delivery from the counterparty of an initial tranche of 13,464,749 shares of MMC common stock. Based on the market price of MMC’s common stock over the subsequent settlement period, in July 2007 the counterparty delivered to MMC an additional 2,555,519 shares for 43 Table of Contents no additional payment and the transaction was concluded. MMC thus repurchased a total of 16,020,268 shares in the transaction, for a total cost of $500 million and an average price per share to MMC of $31.2105. The repurchased shares were reflected as an increase in Treasury shares (a decrease in shares outstanding) on the respective delivery dates. This transaction was effected under a $500 million share repurchase authorization granted by MMC’s Board of Directors in May 2007. Dividends MMC paid total dividends of $431 million in 2009 ($0.80 per share), $412 million ($0.80 per share) in 2008 and $413 million ($0.76 per share) in 2007. Investing Cash Flows Net cash used for investing activities amounted to $236 million in 2009. This compares with $348 million of net cash used for investing activities in 2008. Cash used for acquisitions totaled $73 million in 2009 compared with $126 million in 2008. Remaining deferred cash payments of approximately $119 million related to acquisitions completed in 2009 and prior years are recorded in accounts payable and accrued liabilities or in other liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets at December 31, 2009. Cash provided by the sale of securities was $42 million and $20 million in 2009 and 2008, respectively. MMC’s additions to fixed assets and capitalized software, which amounted to $305 million in 2009 and $386 million in 2008, primarily relate to computer equipment purchases, the refurbishing and modernizing of office facilities and software development costs. In 2007, MMC generated $3.0 billion of cash from investing activities primarily due to the Putnam transaction. MMC has committed to potential future investments of approximately $81 million in connection with its investments in Trident II and other funds managed by Stone Point Capital, LLC. The majority of MMC’s investment commitments for funds managed by Stone Point Capital, LLC are related to Trident II, the investment period for which is now closed for new investments. Any remaining capital calls for Trident II would relate to follow-on investments in existing portfolio companies or for management fees or other partnership expenses. Significant future capital calls related to Trident II are not expected. Although it is anticipated that Trident II will be harvesting its remaining portfolio, the timing of any portfolio company sales and capital distributions is unknown and not controlled by MMC. Commitments and Obligations The following identifies MMC’s future contractual obligations by the types identified in the table below as of December 31, 2009: Payment due by Period Contractual Obligations (In millions of dollars) Total Within 1 Year 1-3 Years 4-5 Years After 5Years Current portion of long-term debt $ 558 $ 558 $ — $ — $ — Long-term debt 3,041 — 267 919 1,855 Interest on long-term debt 1,726 214 362 319 831 Net operating leases 2,413 364 609 436 1,004 Service agreements 435 113 133 89 100 Other long-term obligations 119 43 65 4 7 Total $ 8,292 $ 1,292 $ 1,436 $ 1,767 $ 3,797 The above does not include unrecognized tax benefits of $206 million as MMC is unable to reasonably predict the timing of settlement of these liabilities, other than approximately $16 million that may become payable during 2010. The above does not include the indemnified liabilities discussed in Note 16 as MMC is unable to reasonably predict the timing of settlement of these liabilities. The above does not include pension liabilities of $937 million because the timing and amount of ultimate payment of 44 Table of Contents such liability is dependent upon future events, including, but not limited to, future returns on plan assets, and changes in the discount rate used to measure the liabilities. MMC expects to contribute $25 million and $250 million in 2010 to its U.S. non-qualified and non-U.S. pension plans, respectively. Market Risk and Credit Risk Certain of MMC’s revenues, expenses, assets and liabilities are exposed to the impact of interest rate changes and fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates and equity markets. Interest Rate Risk and Credit Risk MMC has historically managed its net exposure to interest rate changes by utilizing a mixture of variable and fixed rate borrowings to finance MMC’s asset base. During 2007, virtually all of MMC’s variable rate borrowings were repaid. Interest income generated from MMC’s cash investments as well as invested fiduciary funds will vary with the general level of interest rates, particularly short-term interest rates. MMC had the following investments subject to variable interest rates: (In millions of dollars) December 31, 2009 Cash and cash equivalents invested in money market funds,certificates of deposit and time deposits (Note 1) $ 1,777 Fiduciary cash and investments (Note 1) $ 3,559 These investments and debt instruments are discussed more fully in Note1 to the consolidated financial statements appearing in Item 8 of this report. Based on the above balances, if short-term interest rates increase by 10%, or 8 basis points, over the course of the year, annual interest income, including interest earned on fiduciary funds, would increase by approximately $3 million. In addition to interest rate risk, our cash investments and fiduciary fund investments are subject to potential loss of value due to counterparty credit risk. To minimize this risk, MMC and its subsidiaries invest pursuant to a Board-approved investment policy. The policy mandates the preservation of principal and liquidity and requires broad diversification with counterparty limits assigned based primarily on credit rating and type of investment. MMC carefully monitors its cash and fiduciary fund investments and will further restrict the portfolio as appropriate to market conditions. The majority of cash and fiduciary funds are invested in short-term bank deposits and liquid money market funds. Foreign Currency Risk The translated values of revenue and expense from MMC’s international operations are subject to fluctuations due to changes in currency exchange rates. The non-U.S. based revenue that is exposed to foreign exchange fluctuations is approximately 53% of total revenue. Note 17 details revenue by geographic area. We periodically use forward contracts and options to limit foreign currency exchange rate exposure on net income and cash flows for specific, clearly defined transactions arising in the ordinary course of business. Although MMC has significant revenue generated in foreign locations which is subject to foreign exchange rate fluctuations, in nearly all cases both the foreign currency revenue and expenses are in the functional currency of the foreign location. As such, the U.S. dollar translation of both the revenues and expenses, as well as the potentially offsetting movements of various currencies against the U.S. dollar, generally tends to mitigate the impact on net operating income of foreign currency risk. However in 2009, MMC’s consulting segment was impacted by significant currency exchange rate movements, particularly in Sterling and the Euro, which reduced the translated amount of 2009 operating income by approximately $60 million compared with 2008. MMC estimates that a 10% movement of major foreign currencies (Euro, Sterling, Australian dollar and Canadian dollar) in the same direction against the U.S. dollar that held over the course of the year would impact full year net operating income by approximately $40 million. 45 Table of Contents Equity Price Risk MMC holds investments in public and private companies, as well as in certain private equity funds managed by Stone Point Capital. Publicly traded investments of $38 million are classified as available for sale. Non-publicly traded investments of $53 million are accounted for using the cost method and $189 million are accounted for using the equity method. The investments that are classified as available for sale or that are not publicly traded are subject to risk of changes in market value, which if determined to be other than temporary, could result in realized impairment losses. MMC periodically reviews the carrying value of such investments to determine if any valuation adjustments are appropriate under the applicable accounting pronouncements. Other A significant number of lawsuits and regulatory proceedings are pending. See Note 16 to the consolidated financial statements. Management’s Discussion of Critical Accounting Policies The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (“GAAP”) requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue and expenses, and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. Management considers the policies discussed below to be critical to understanding MMC’s financial statements because their application places the most significant demands on management’s judgment, and requires management to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain. Actual results may differ from those estimates. Legal and Other Loss Contingencies MMC and its subsidiaries are subject to numerous claims, lawsuits and proceedings. GAAP requires that liabilities for contingencies be recorded when it is probable that a liability has been incurred before the balance sheet date and the amount can be reasonably estimated. Significant management judgment is required to apply this guidance. MMC analyzes its litigation exposure based on available information, including consultation with outside counsel handling the defense of these matters, to assess its potential liability. In addition, to the extent that insurance coverage is available, significant management judgment is required to determine the amount of recoveries that are probable of collection under MMC’s various insurance programs. Retirement Benefits MMC maintains qualified and non-qualified defined benefit pension and defined contribution plans for its eligible U.S. employees and a variety of defined benefit and defined contribution plans for its eligible non-U.S. employees. MMC’s policy for funding its tax qualified defined benefit retirement plans is to contribute amounts at least sufficient to meet the funding requirements set forth in U.S. and applicable foreign laws. MMC recognizes the funded status of its overfunded defined benefit pension and retiree medical plans as a net benefit plan asset and its unfunded and underfunded plans as a net benefit plan liability. The gains or losses and prior service costs or credits that have not been recognized as components of net periodic costs are recorded as a component of Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income (“AOCI”), net of tax, in MMC’s consolidated balance sheets. The determination of net periodic pension cost is based on a number of actuarial assumptions, including an expected long-term rate of return on plan assets, the discount rate and assumed rate of salary increase. Significant assumptions used in the calculation of net periodic pension costs and pension liabilities are disclosed in Note 8 to the consolidated financial statements. MMC believes the assumptions for each plan are reasonable and appropriate and will continue to evaluate actuarial assumptions at least annually and adjust them as appropriate. Based on its current assumptions, MMC expects pension expense in 2010 to increase approximately $110 million compared with 2009. 46 Table of Contents Future pension expense or credits will depend on plan provisions, future investment performance, future assumptions and various other factors related to the populations participating in the pension plans. Holding all other assumptions constant, a half-percentage point change in the rate of return on plan assets and discount rate assumptions would affect net periodic pension cost for the U.S. and U.K. plans, which together comprise approximately 87% of total pension plan liabilities, as follows: 0.5 Percentage Point Increase 0.5 Percentage Point Decrease (In millions of dollars) U.S. U.K. U.S. U.K. Assumed Rate of Return on Plan Assets $ (17 ) $ (26 ) $ 17 $ 26 Discount Rate $ (26 ) $ (22 ) $ 29 $ 36 Changing the discount rate and leaving the other assumptions constant may not be representative of the impact on expense, because the long-term rates of inflation and salary increases are often correlated with the discount rate. MMC contributes to certain health care and life insurance benefits provided to its retired employees. The cost of these postretirement benefits for employees in the U.S. is accrued during the period up to the date employees are eligible to retire, but is funded by MMC as incurred. The key assumptions and sensitivity to changes in the assumed health care cost trend rate are discussed in Note 8 to the consolidated financial statements. Income Taxes MMC’s tax rate reflects its income, statutory tax rates and tax planning in the various jurisdictions in which it operates. Significant judgment is required in determining the annual tax rate and in evaluating uncertain tax positions. MMC reports a liability for unrecognized tax benefits resulting from uncertain tax positions taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. The evaluation of a tax position is a two-step process. The first step involves recognition. We determine whether it is more likely than not that a tax position will be sustained upon tax examination, including resolution of any related appeals or litigation, based on only the technical merits of the position. The technical merits of a tax position derive from both statutory and judicial authority (legislation and statutes, legislative intent, regulations, rulings, and case law) and their applicability to the facts and circumstances of the tax position. If a tax position does not meet the more likely than not recognition threshold, the benefit of that position is not recognized in the financial statements. The second step is measurement. A tax position that meets the more likely than not recognition threshold is measured to determine the amount of benefit to recognize in the financial statements. The tax position is measured as the largest amount of benefit that is greater than 50 percent likely of being realized upon ultimate resolution with a taxing authority. Uncertain tax positions are evaluated based upon the facts and circumstances that exist at each reporting period and involve significant management judgment. Subsequent changes in judgment based upon new information may lead to changes in recognition, derecognition, and measurement. Adjustments may result, for example, upon resolution of an issue with the taxing authorities, or expiration of a statute of limitations barring an assessment for an issue. Tax law requires items be included in MMC’s tax returns at different times than the items are reflected in the financial statements. As a result, the annual tax expense reflected in the consolidated statements of income is different than that reported in the tax returns. Some of these differences are permanent, such as expenses that are not deductible in the returns, and some differences are temporary and reverse over time, such as depreciation expense. Temporary differences create deferred tax assets and liabilities. Deferred tax liabilities generally represent tax expense recognized in the financial statements for which payment has been deferred, or expense for which a deduction has been taken already in the tax return but the expense has not yet been recognized in the financial statements. Deferred tax assets generally represent items that can be used as a tax deduction or credit in tax returns in future years for which a benefit has already been recorded in the financial statements. In assessing the need for and amount of a valuation allowance for deferred tax assets, the Company considers whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be 47 Table of Contents realized and adjusts the valuation allowance accordingly. MMC evaluates all significant available positive and negative evidence, including the existence of losses in recent years and its forecast of future taxable income by jurisdiction, in assessing the need for a valuation allowance. MMC also considers tax-planning strategies that would result in realization of deferred tax assets, and the presence of taxable income in prior carryback years if carryback is permitted under the appropriate tax law. The underlying assumptions MMC uses in forecasting future taxable income require significant judgment and take into account MMC’s recent performance. The ultimate realization of deferred tax assets is dependent on the generation of future taxable income during the periods in which temporary differences or carryforwards are deductible or creditable. Valuation allowances are established for deferred tax assets when it is estimated that it is more likely than not future taxable income will be insufficient to fully use a deduction or credit in that jurisdiction. Fair Value Determinations Investment Valuation—MMC holds investments in both public and private companies, as well as certain private equity funds. The majority of the public investments are accounted for as available for sale securities. Certain investments, primarily investments in private equity funds, are accounted for using the equity method. Although not directly recorded in MMC’s consolidated balance sheets, MMC’s defined benefit pension plans hold investments of approximately $9 billion. The fair value of these investments determines, in part, the over- or under-funded status of those plans, which is included in MMC’s consolidated balance sheets. MMC periodically reviews the carrying value of its investments to determine if any valuation adjustments are appropriate under the applicable accounting pronouncements. MMC bases its review on the facts and circumstances as they relate to each investment. Fair value of investments in private equity funds is determined by the funds’ investment managers. Factors considered in determining the fair value of private equity investments include: implied valuation of recently completed financing rounds that included sophisticated outside investors; performance multiples of comparable public companies; restrictions on the sale or disposal of the investments; trading characteristics of the securities; and the relative size of the holdings in comparison to other private investors and the public market float. In those instances where quoted market prices are not available, particularly for equity holdings in private companies, or formal restrictions limit the sale of securities, significant management judgment is required to determine the appropriate value of MMC’s investments. MMC reviews with the fund manager the appropriateness of valuation results for significant private equity investments. Goodwill Impairment Testing—MMC is required to assess goodwill and any indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment annually, or more frequently if circumstances indicate impairment may have occurred. MMC performs the annual impairment test for each of its reporting units during the third quarter of each year. Fair values of the reporting units are estimated using a market approach or a discounted cash flow model. Carrying values for the reporting units are based on balances at the prior quarter end and include directly identified assets and liabilities, as well as an allocation of those assets and liabilities not recorded at the reporting unit level. As previously disclosed, MMC performed interim goodwill impairment assessments in its Risk Consulting & Technology segment which resulted in an impairment charge of $315 million recorded in the first quarter of 2009 and impairment charges totaling $540 million recorded in the first and second quarters of 2008. MMC completed its 2009 annual review in the third quarter of 2009 and concluded that the remaining goodwill was not impaired. The fair value estimates used in this assessment are dependent upon assumptions and estimates about the future profitability and other financial ratios of our reporting units, as well as relevant financial data, recent transactions and market valuations of comparable public companies. As noted above, MMC recorded goodwill impairment charges related to the Kroll reporting unit in 2008 and 2009. As such, the estimated fair value of the Kroll reporting unit exceeds its carrying value by only a small percentage. In addition, in the most recent goodwill impairment assessment, the excess of the estimated fair value of the Oliver Wyman reporting unit over its carrying value declined substantially compared with prior years’ valuations. If in the future, the performance of our reporting units varies from our projections, or our assumptions or estimates about future profitability of our reporting units change, the estimated fair value of our reporting units could change materially and could result in an impairment of goodwill, particularly with regard to the Kroll and Oliver Wyman reporting units. 48 Table of Contents Share-based Payment The guidance for accounting for share-based payments requires, among other things, that the estimated fair value of stock options be charged to earnings. Significant management judgment is required to determine the appropriate assumptions for inputs such as volatility and expected term necessary to estimate option values. In addition, management judgment is required to analyze the terms of the plans and awards granted thereunder to determine if awards will be treated as equity awards or liability awards, as defined by the accounting guidance. As of December 31, 2009, there was $15.2 million of unrecognized compensation cost related to stock option awards. The weighted-average periods over which the costs are expected to be recognized is 1.9 years. Also as of December 31, 2009, there was $262 million of unrecognized compensation cost related to MMC’s restricted stock, restricted stock unit and deferred stock unit awards. See Note 9 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding guidance for accounting for share-based payments. New Accounting Pronouncements Note 1 contains a summary of the Company’s significant accounting policies, including a discussion of recently issued accounting pronouncements and their impact or potential future impact on MMC’s financial results, if determinable. Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk. See the information set forth under the heading “Market Risk and Credit Risk” above under Part II, Item 7 (“Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations”). 49 Table of Contents",2023-12-30 19:02:18.639724
62709,MMC,"MARSH & MCLENNAN COMPANIES, INC.",2011,"Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. General Marsh & McLennan Companies, Inc. and Subsidiaries (the “Company”) is a global professional services firm providing advice and solutions in the areas of risk, strategy, and human capital. The Company’s subsidiaries include Marsh, which provides risk and insurance services; Guy Carpenter, which provides reinsurance services; Mercer, which provides human resource and related financial advice and services; and Oliver Wyman Group, which provides management consulting and other services. The Company’s approximately 51,000 employees worldwide provide analysis, advice and transactional capabilities to clients in over 100 countries. The Company’s business segments are based on the services provided. Risk and Insurance Services includes risk management and insurance and reinsurance broking and services, provided primarily by Marsh and Guy Carpenter. Consulting, which comprises the activities of Mercer and Oliver Wyman Group, includes human resource consulting and related investment and outsourcing services, and specialized management, economic and brand consulting services. In the first quarter of 2010, Kroll completed the sale of Kroll Laboratory Specialists (KLS) and on August 3, 2010, the Company completed the sale of Kroll to Altegrity for cash consideration of $1.13 billion. The account balances and activities of Kroll and KLS were segregated and reported as discontinued operations in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets and the accompanying consolidated statements of income. During the second quarter of 2009, Kroll sold Kroll Government Services (“KGS”), which has been classified as a discontinued operation. In 2008, the Company disposed of its U.S. and U.K. restructuring businesses to their respective management teams in separate leveraged buyouts. With the Kroll disposition completed in August 2010, along with the previous disposals of other businesses between 2008 and 2010, the Company has now divested its entire Risk Consulting and Technology segment. As described in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements, based on the terms and conditions of the divestitures of the Corporate Advisory and Restructuring businesses (“CARG”) in 2008, the Company determined it has “continuing involvement” in those businesses, as that term is used in SEC Staff Accounting Bulletin Topic 5e. Therefore classification of CARG as discontinued operations is not appropriate, and their financial results in the current and prior periods are included in operating income. The runoff of the Company’s involvement in the CARG businesses is now managed by the Company’s corporate departments, and consequently, the financial results of these businesses are now included in “Corporate” for segment reporting purposes. We describe the primary sources of revenue and categories of expense for each segment below, in our discussion of segment financial results. A reconciliation of segment operating income to total operating income is included in Note 17 to the consolidated financial statements included in Part II Item 8 in this report. The accounting policies used for each segment are the same as those used for the consolidated financial statements. This MD&A contains forward-looking statements as that term is defined in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. See “Information Concerning Forward-Looking Statements” at the outset of this report. Significant Developments The Company’s historical financial information should be viewed in light of the significant developments discussed below. Ÿ The sale of KLS in the first quarter of 2010 and Kroll in August of 2010. Both businesses have been reclassified as discontinued operations for all periods presented. The sale of Kroll Government Services (“KGS”) in the second quarter of 2009. The loss on the disposal and the results of KGS operations are included in discontinued operations. 26 Table of Contents Ÿ Resolution in June 2010 of the litigation brought by the Alaska Retirement Management Board (“ARMB”) on behalf of two Alaska benefit plans against Mercer, relating to work in the period 1992 to 2004. This settlement, in which Mercer expressly denied liability, resolved all claims against Mercer by the ARMB and State of Alaska related to this matter. Under terms of the settlement, Mercer paid $500 million, of which $100 million was covered by insurance. Ÿ The settlement in the fourth quarter of 2009 of the securities and ERISA class action lawsuits filed in 2004. As a result, the Company recorded a $205 million net charge in December 2009, which is tax deductible. Without admitting any liability or wrongdoing, the Company agreed to pay a total of $435 million to settle both lawsuits and received $230 million from its insurance carriers. A group of stockholders, representing approximately 4% of eligible shares, initially indicated their intent to opt out of this settlement, but subsequently agreed to opt in to the settlement for an additional payment of $25 million. This additional settlement cost was accrued in the consolidated balance sheet at December 31, 2009. All claims related to these lawsuits are now fully resolved. Ÿ The impact of acquisitions in the Risk and Insurance Services segment. In the first quarter of 2010, Marsh acquired Haake Companies, Inc., one of the largest insurance broking firms in the Midwest region and Thomas Rutherfoord, Inc., one of the largest insurance broking firms in the Southeast and mid-Atlantic regions of the U.S. In the second quarter of 2010, Marsh acquired HSBC Insurance Brokers Ltd. (“HIBL”), an international provider of risk intermediary and risk advisory services and the Bostonian Group Insurance Agency, Inc. and Bostonian Solutions, Inc. (collectively the “Bostonian Group”), one of the largest regional insurance brokerages in New England. In the fourth quarter of 2010 Marsh acquired Strategic Benefits Solutions, Inc. (“SBS”), a Georgia-based benefits brokerage and consulting firm and Trion Group, Inc. (“Trion”), an insurance consultant and broker in the United States that was the largest privately held employee benefits specialist in the nation. In September 2009, Marsh acquired International Advisory Services, Ltd., the largest independent manager of captives and third-party insurance companies in Bermuda. In December 2009, Marsh acquired the NIA Group, LLC, one of the largest independent insurance agencies in the Northeast and the 34th largest agency in the U.S. In April 2009, Guy Carpenter completed the acquisition of John B. Collins Associates, Inc., previously the fifth-largest reinsurance intermediary in the U.S. and seventh-largest in the world. In October 2009, Guy Carpenter completed the acquisition of London-based specialty reinsurance broker Rattner Mackenzie Limited from HCC Insurance Holdings, Inc. See Note 4 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Ÿ The impact of acquisitions made in the Consulting segment. In July 2010, Mercer acquired Innovative Process Administration (“IPA”), a provider of health and benefit recordkeeping and employee enrollment technology. In August 2010, Mercer acquired ORC Worldwide, a premier provider of HR knowledge, data and solutions for professionals in numerous industries. In January 2011, Mercer acquired Hammond Associates, the third largest investment consulting company for endowments and foundations in the U.S. 27 Table of Contents Consolidated Results of Operations For the Years Ended December 31, (In millions, except per share figures) 2010 2009 2008 Revenue $ 10,550 $ 9,831 $ 10,730 Expense Compensation and benefits 6,465 6,182 6,830 Other operating expenses 3,146 2,871 3,221 Operating expenses 9,611 9,053 10,051 Operating Income $ 939 $ 778 $ 679 Income from Continuing Operations $ 565 $ 531 $ 381 Discontinued Operations, net of tax 306 (290 ) (443 ) Net Income (Loss) $ 871 $ 241 $ (62 ) Net Income (Loss) Attributable to the Company $ 855 $ 227 $ (73 ) Income from Continuing Operations Per Share: Basic $ 1.01 $ 0.97 $ 0.70 Diluted $ 1.00 $ 0.96 $ 0.70 Net Income (Loss) Per Share Attributable to the Company: Basic $ 1.56 $ 0.43 $ (0.13 ) Diluted $ 1.55 $ 0.42 $ (0.14 ) Average number of shares outstanding: Basic 540 522 514 Diluted 544 524 515 Shares outstanding at December 31, 541 530 514 Consolidated operating income was $939 million in 2010 compared with $778 million in the prior year. The 2010 results include a $400 million charge, net of insurance recoveries, for the resolution of the litigation brought by the ARMB and restructuring and other noteworthy charges of $139 million. The 2009 results include a $230 million charge, net of insurance recoveries, for the settlement of the securities and ERISA class action lawsuits filed in 2004 and restructuring and other noteworthy items of $264 million. Excluding these charges, consolidated operating income was $1.5 billion in 2010 compared with $1.3 billion in 2009. Risk and Insurance Services operating income increased $176 million to $972 million in 2010 compared with 2009, or 22%, resulting from revenue growth at both Marsh and Guy Carpenter, as well as a decrease of $77 million in restructuring and related charges. Consulting operating income decreased $276 million to $129 million in 2010 primarily due to the $400 million net charge related to the ARMB litigation settlements, partly offset by lower restructuring and other noteworthy items of $48 million. Excluding these items, Consulting operating income increased $76 million, or 16%. Corporate and other results were $162 million of expense in 2010 compared to net expense of $423 million in 2009. In 2010, Corporate and other expenses include restructuring and other noteworthy charges of $13 million, partly offset by $10 million of payments received by the Company related to CARG. In 2009, Corporate expenses include a net charge of $230 million related to settlements of the class action lawsuits described above and $33 million of restructuring and other noteworthy charges. Excluding these items, Corporate and other expenses decreased $1 million in 2010 compared with 2009. Discontinued operations include the operating results of Kroll for all years presented, including goodwill impairment charges of $315 million and $504 million in 2009 and 2008, respectively, the gain on the sale of Kroll and KLS in 2010 of $282 million, insurance recoveries of $16 million related to Putnam market-timing related matters in 2010 and the loss on the sale of KGS in 2009. Discontinued operations also include the accretion of interest related to an indemnity for uncertain tax positions provided as part of the purchase by Great-West Life Co. Inc., of Putnam Investments Trust from the Company in August 2007. 28 Table of Contents Consolidated net income attributable to the Company was $855 million in 2010, compared with $227 million in 2009. Consolidated Revenues and Expenses The Company conducts business in many countries, as a result of which the impact of foreign exchange rate movements may impact period-to-period comparisons of revenue. Similarly, the revenue impact of acquisitions and dispositions may impact period-to-period comparisons of revenue. Underlying revenue measures the change in revenue from one period to another by isolating these impacts. The impact of foreign currency exchange fluctuations, acquisitions and dispositions on the Company’s operating revenues is as follows: Year Ended December 31, Components of Revenue Change* (In millions, except percentage figures) 2010 2009 % ChangeRevenue CurrencyImpact Acquisitions/DispositionsImpact UnderlyingRevenue Risk and Insurance Services Marsh $ 4,744 $ 4,319 10 % 1 % 6 % 2 % Guy Carpenter 975 911 7 % 1 % 4 % 2 % Subtotal 5,719 5,230 9 % 1 % 6 % 2 % Fiduciary Interest Income 45 54 (16 )% 3 % 2 % (21 )% Total Risk and Insurance Services 5,764 5,284 9 % 1 % 6 % 2 % Consulting Mercer 3,478 3,327 5 % 2 % 1 % 2 % Oliver Wyman Group 1,357 1,282 6 % (1 )% — 7 % Total Consulting 4,835 4,609 5 % 1 % — 3 % Corporate and Other/Eliminations (49 ) (62 ) Total Revenue $ 10,550 $ 9,831 7 % 1 % 3 % 3 % * Components of revenue change may not add due to rounding.

Revenue Consolidated revenue for 2010 increased 7% to $10.6 billion compared with $9.8 billion in 2009, reflecting a 3% increase in underlying revenue, a 3% increase due to acquisitions and a 1% positive impact of foreign currency translation. Revenue in the Risk and Insurance Services segment increased 9% in 2010 compared with 2009. Underlying revenue increased 2% for the total Risk and Insurance Services segment, reflecting 2% increases in both Marsh and Guy Carpenter, partially offset by a 21% decrease in fiduciary interest income. Consulting revenue increased 5%, resulting from a 5% increase in Mercer and a 6% increase in the Oliver Wyman Group. On an underlying basis, revenue increased 3% reflecting a 2% increase in Mercer and a 7% increase in the Oliver Wyman Group. 30 Table of Contents Consolidated revenue for 2009 decreased 8% to $9.8 billion compared with $10.7 billion in 2008, reflecting a 3% decrease in underlying revenue and a 4% negative impact of foreign currency translation. Revenue in the Risk and Insurance Services segment decreased 3% in 2009 compared with 2008. Underlying revenue decreased 1% for the total Risk and Insurance Services segment, reflecting an 8% increase in Guy Carpenter, which was more than offset by a 1% decrease in Marsh and a 60% decrease in fiduciary interest income. Consulting revenue decreased 11%, resulting from a 9% decrease at Mercer and a 17% decline at the Oliver Wyman Group. On an underlying basis, revenue decreased 7% reflecting a 4% decrease in Mercer, and a 15% decrease in the Oliver Wyman Group. Expenses Consolidated operating expenses increased 6% in 2010 compared with the same period in 2009. Expenses in 2010 include the $400 net settlement at Mercer. In 2009, the Company recorded a $230 million charge, net of insurance recoveries, for the settlement of the securities and ERISA class action lawsuits filed in 2004. Restructuring and other noteworthy charges in 2010 of $139 million decreased $155 million from charges of $294 million in 2009. Excluding these charges, expenses were $9.1 billion in 2010 compared with $8.5 billion in 2009, an increase of 6%. The increase reflects a 1% increase due to the impact of foreign currency exchange, a 3% increase due to the impact of acquisitions and a 2% increase in underlying expenses. The increase in underlying expenses is due to higher pension, travel and entertainment, outsourcing and other outside services costs. Consolidated operating expenses decreased 10% in 2009 compared with the same period in 2008. In 2009, the Company recorded a $230 million charge, net of insurance recoveries, for the settlement of the securities and ERISA class action lawsuits filed in 2004. Restructuring and other noteworthy charges in 2009 of $294 million decreased $138 million from charges of $432 million in 2008. Excluding these charges, expenses were $8.6 billion in 2009 compared with $9.6 billion in 2008, or a decrease of 11%. The decrease reflects a 4% decline due to the impact of foreign currency exchange, a 1% decline due to the impact of dispositions and a 5% decline in underlying expenses. The decrease in underlying expenses is due to generally lower expenses, primarily in base salary, employee benefits, travel and entertainment, outside services, facilities, equipment and recoverable expenses from clients. Restructuring Actions Initiated in 2010 In 2010, the Company implemented restructuring actions which resulted in costs totaling $114 million, primarily related to severance and benefits, and costs for future rent and other real estate costs. Approximately $63 million of these costs related to cost reduction activities for acquisitions made in 2010. These costs were incurred as follows: Risk and Insurance Services—$81 million comprising Marsh—$65 million (acquisition related—$46 million) and Guy Carpenter—$16 million (acquisition related—$6 million); Mercer—$25 million (acquisition related—$11 million); and Corporate—$8 million. These activities resulted in the elimination of approximately 450 positions at Marsh, 80 positions at Guy Carpenter, 240 positions at Mercer and 70 positions at Corporate. The annualized cost savings from these actions are expected to be approximately $100 million. Actions Initiated Prior to 2010 Prior to 2010, the Company implemented several restructuring and cost-savings initiatives related to firm-wide infrastructure, organization structure and operating the Company’s business processes. During 2010, the Company incurred restructuring costs of $27 million in connection with actions initiated in prior years, primarily due to severance and related benefits and adjustments to the estimated future rent and real estate costs related to previously vacated space. Businesses Exited In February 2010, Kroll sold KLS, its substance abuse testing business for $110 million. On August 3, 2010, the Company completed the sale of Kroll to Altegrity for $1.13 billion. The account balances and 31 Table of Contents activities of Kroll and KLS have been segregated and reported as discontinued operations in the accompanying financial statements for all periods presented. The gain on the sale of Kroll and related tax benefits and the after- tax loss on the disposal of KLS, along with Kroll’s and KLS’s 2010 and comparative results of operations are included in discontinued operations. During the second quarter of 2009, Kroll sold KGS. The results of operations and the loss on sale of KGS are included in discontinued operations. During the fourth quarter of 2008, the Company sold its U.S. and U.K. restructuring businesses to their respective management teams in separate leveraged buyouts. Based on the terms and conditions of the disposals, the Company determined it has “continuing involvement” in these businesses, as that term is used in SEC Staff Accounting Bulletin Topic 5e. Therefore, the results of these businesses, including the loss on disposal, are included in continuing operations. The Company recorded a loss of $28 million on the disposition of the U.K. Corporate Advisory and Restructuring businesses. The net assets of these U.K. businesses were written-off upon transfer to the new owners. The Company will earn royalties on future revenue of these businesses over the next two years. The royalties will be recognized when earned under the terms of the contract and when collectability is reasonably assured. Through December 31, 2010, the Company has recognized $11 million of royalty payments related to the U.K. businesses. The transfer of the U.S. restructuring business was financed with a seller note. If the Company receives interest and principal payments as scheduled for the U.S. business, it will recover the value of the net assets transferred to the new owners and recognize a gain on the disposal of $18 million. In March 2010, the Company agreed to suspend collections of interest and principal payments on the seller financed note related to the U.S. restructuring business. The payments received prior to March 2010 were sufficient to allow the Company to recover the value of net assets transferred and recognize $1 million of gain. Although it is uncertain whether future payments will be received under the revised terms of the note, the Company has no remaining net investment in the U.S. restructuring business. Any future collections will be recognized as income, if and when received. Risk and Insurance Services In the Risk and Insurance Services segment, the Company’s subsidiaries and other affiliated entities act as brokers, agents or consultants for insureds, insurance underwriters and other brokers in the areas of risk management, insurance broking and insurance program management services, primarily under the name of Marsh; and engage in reinsurance broking, catastrophe and financial modeling services and related advisory functions, primarily under the name of Guy Carpenter. Marsh and Guy Carpenter are compensated for brokerage and consulting services primarily through fees paid by clients and/or commissions paid out of premiums charged by insurance and reinsurance companies. Commission rates vary in amount depending upon the type of insurance or reinsurance coverage provided, the particular insurer or reinsurer, the capacity in which the broker acts and negotiations with clients. Revenues are affected by premium rate levels in the insurance/reinsurance markets, the amount of risk retained by insurance and reinsurance clients themselves and by the value of the risks that have been insured since commission based compensation is frequently related to the premiums paid by insureds/reinsureds. In many cases, fee compensation may be negotiated in advance, based on the types and amounts of risks to be analyzed by the Company and ultimately placed into the insurance market or retained by the client. The trends and comparisons of revenue from one period to the next will therefore be affected by changes in premium rate levels, fluctuations in client risk retention, and increases or decreases in the value of risks that have been insured, as well as new and lost business, and the volume of business from new and existing clients. Marsh and Guy Carpenter receive interest income on certain funds (such as premiums and claims proceeds) held in a fiduciary capacity for others. The investment of fiduciary funds is regulated by state and other insurance authorities. These regulations typically provide for segregation of fiduciary funds and limit the types of investments that may be made with them. Interest income from these investments varies depending on the amount of funds invested and applicable interest rates, both of 32 Table of Contents which vary from time to time. For presentation purposes, fiduciary interest is segregated from the other revenues of Marsh and Guy Carpenter and separately presented within the segment, as shown in the revenue by segments charts earlier in this MD&A. The results of operations for the Risk and Insurance Services segment are presented below: (In millions of dollars) 2010 2009 2008 Revenue $ 5,764 $ 5,284 $ 5,466 Compensation and Benefits 3,261 3,023 3,299 Other Operating Expenses 1,531 1,465 1,707 Expense 4,792 4,488 5,006 Operating Income $ 972 $ 796 $ 460 Operating Income Margin 16.9 % 15.1 % 8.4 % Revenue Revenue in Risk and Insurance Services increased 9% in 2010 compared with 2009 reflecting a 2% increase on an underlying basis, a 6% increase from acquisitions, and a 1% increase from the impact of foreign currency exchange translation. In Marsh, revenue in 2010 was $4.7 billion, an increase of 10% from the same quarter of the prior year, reflecting 2% growth in underlying revenue, a 6% increase from acquisitions and a 1% increase resulting from the impact of foreign currency translation. The underlying revenue increase of 2% was achieved despite the economic environment and the soft pricing environment in the global property-casualty insurance market. Marsh increased revenues in all its geographies, reflecting new business growth of 8%. Underlying revenue increased 8% in Latin America, 7% in Asia Pacific, 1% in U.S. / Canada and 3% in EMEA. Marsh completed several strategic acquisitions during 2010. In the first quarter of 2010, Marsh acquired Haake Companies, Inc., one of the largest insurance agencies in the Midwest, and Thomas Rutherfoord, Inc., one of the largest insurance broking firms in the Southeast and mid-Atlantic regions of the U.S. In the second quarter of 2010, Marsh completed the acquisition of HIBL, an international provider of risk intermediary and risk advisory services and the Bostonian Group, one of the largest regional insurance brokerages in New England. In the fourth quarter of 2010, Marsh acquired Trion, a large U.S. private benefit specialist and SBS, a Georgia-based benefits brokerage and consulting firm. In January 2011, Marsh acquired RJF Agencies, one of the largest independent insurance agencies in the upper Midwest. All of the acquisitions noted above, except HIBL relate to the Marsh & McLennan Agency. The Marsh & McLennan Agency acquisitions completed in 2010 have added approximately $200 million of annualized revenue. In March 2010, Marsh announced its approach to market remuneration and contingent commissions in the U.S. As previously announced, Marsh and McLennan Agency and Marsh’s affinity, sponsored program and personal lines businesses accept contingent commissions. Marsh does not accept contingent commissions on any placement for any U.S. clients served by the firm’s core brokerage operation. Marsh will continue to collect enhanced commissions with respect to its core brokerage operations, which are fixed in advance of insurance transactions and are not related to volume, retention, growth or profitability. Guy Carpenter’s revenue increased 7% to $975 million in 2010 compared with 2009, or 2% on an underlying basis. The increase in underlying revenue was due to continued strong new business and high client retention over the past two years. In April 2009, Guy Carpenter acquired John B. Collins Associates, Inc., previously the fifth-largest reinsurance intermediary in the U.S. and seventh-largest in the world. In October 2009, Guy Carpenter completed the acquisition of London-based specialty reinsurance broker Rattner Mackenzie Limited from HCC Insurance Holdings, Inc. 33 Table of Contents Fiduciary interest income was $45 million in 2010, a decrease of 16% compared with 2009, driven by lower interest rates. Revenue in Risk and Insurance Services decreased 3% in 2009 compared with 2008, reflecting a 4% negative impact of foreign currency exchange fluctuations, a 1% decrease on an underlying basis partly offset by a 2% increase from acquisitions. In Marsh, revenue in 2009 decreased 5% from 2008, reflecting a 4% negative impact of foreign currency translation and a 1% decrease in underlying revenue. These results reflected the difficult economic environment, in addition to the pressure on insurance premium levels, commissions and fees. On a geographic basis, Marsh’s International revenue increased 2% on an underlying basis reflecting a 9% increase in Latin America and a 5% increase in Asia Pacific, reflecting strong new business growth on a global basis, partly offset by a decrease of 4% in the U.S. / Canada region. Guy Carpenter’s revenue of $911 million in 2009 increased 13% compared with the prior year, or 8% on an underlying basis. The increase in underlying revenue was primarily due to higher client revenue retention and an increase in new business. As noted above, in April 2009, Guy Carpenter completed the acquisition of John B. Collins Associates, Inc. and in October 2009, completed the acquisition of Rattner Mackenzie Limited. These acquisitions contributed 7% to the year-over-year revenue growth in 2009. Fiduciary interest income for the Risk and Insurance Services segment was $54 million in 2009, a decrease of 61% compared with the same period of 2008, driven by lower interest rates. Expense Expenses in the Risk and Insurance Services segment increased 7% in 2010 compared with 2009, reflecting a 6% increase from acquisitions and a 1% increase due to the impact of foreign currency translation. Expenses on an underlying basis were flat, as higher pension related expenses, travel and entertainment, and outsourcing costs were offset by a $77 million decrease in restructuring and related charges. Expenses in the Risk and Insurance Services segment decreased 10% in 2009, compared with the prior year. Underlying expenses decreased 8% with the remaining reduction due to the impact of foreign currency exchange of 4% partly offset by an increase of 1% due to the impact of acquisitions. The decline in underlying expenses reflects lower compensation and benefit costs due to reductions in the number of employees as a result of restructuring activities and a decrease in other operating cost categories. The decrease in other expenses includes a reduction in professional liability costs reflecting the impact of a $33 million charge recorded in the third quarter of 2008 and a reduction of $39 million in net settlement, legal and regulatory costs (reduced by insurance recoveries in 2009). The expense decrease also reflects lower restructuring and related charges in 2009 as compared with 2008. Consulting The Company conducts business in its Consulting segment through two main business groups. Mercer provides consulting expertise, advice, services and solutions in the areas of retirement, health & benefits, rewards, talent & communications, outsourcing, and investment consulting & management. Oliver Wyman Group provides specialized management and economic and brand consulting services. The major component of revenue in the Consulting segment business is fees paid by clients for advice and services. Mercer, principally through its health & benefits line of business, also earns revenue in the form of commissions received from insurance companies for the placement of group (and occasionally individual) insurance contracts, primarily life, health and accident coverages. Revenue for Mercer’s investment management business and certain of Mercer’s outsourcing businesses consists principally of fees based on assets under management or administration. Revenue in the Consulting segment is affected by, among other things, global economic conditions, including changes in clients’ particular industries and markets. Revenue is also affected by competition 34 Table of Contents due to the introduction of new products and services, broad trends in employee demographics, including levels of employment, the effect of government policies and regulations, and fluctuations in interest and foreign exchange rates. Revenues from the provision of investment management services and retirement trust and administrative services, which are expected to increase over time, are significantly affected by securities market performance. The results of operations for the Consulting segment are presented below: (In millions of dollars) 2010 2009 2008 Revenue $ 4,835 $ 4,609 $ 5,196 Compensation and Benefits 2,974 2,917 3,204 Other Operating Expenses 1,732 1,287 1,437 Expense 4,706 4,204 4,641 Operating Income $ 129 $ 405 $ 555 Operating Income Margin 2.7 % 8.8 % 10.7 % Revenue Consulting revenue in 2010 increased 5% compared with 2009, or 3% on an underlying basis. Mercer’s revenue was $3.5 billion in 2010, an increase of 5%. On an underlying basis, Mercer’s revenue increased 2%. Within Mercer’s consulting lines, revenue on an underlying basis in 2010 was flat compared with 2009, reflecting increases of 5% in health and benefits and 2% in rewards, talent & communications, offset by a 4% decline in retirement. The growth in health and benefits was driven by increases in all geographies. The increase in rewards, talent & communications was driven by a resurgence of demand for compensation surveys partially offset by lower rewards and talent consulting assignments concentrated in the first half of the year. Outsourcing revenue increased 3% on an underlying basis, driven by new client wins primarily in Australia. Investment consulting & management revenue increased 16% on an underlying basis, due to strong growth in all geographies. Oliver Wyman’s revenue increased 6% to $1.4 billion in 2010, or 7% on an underlying basis, driven by double-digit revenue growth within its financial services practice. Other areas, including the healthcare, transportation and consumer sectors also generated double-digit revenue growth. Consulting revenue in 2009 decreased 11% compared with the same period in 2008, or 7% on an underlying basis. Due to the difficult economic conditions, both Mercer and Oliver Wyman experienced decreased demand for consulting services in 2009. Mercer’s revenue decreased 9%, or 4% on an underlying basis, reflecting decreases in underlying revenue in consulting and outsourcing of 4% and 6%, respectively, partly offset by an increase in investment consulting and management of 6%. Within Mercer’s consulting lines, underlying revenue in retirement decreased 1% versus prior year, health and benefits decreased 1% and rewards, talent & communications decreased 17%. Oliver Wyman’s revenue decreased 17%, or 15% on an underlying basis, compared with the prior year. Expense Consulting expenses in 2010 increased 12% to $4.7 billion, or 10% on an underlying basis. Mercer recorded a net $400 million charge related to the Alaska settlement in 2010 and in 2009 recorded incremental costs of $30 million related to a professional liability settlement. Excluding these charges, expenses increased 3% on an underlying basis. This increase reflects the impact of higher pension related costs, meeting and training costs, recruitment and asset based fees partly offset by lower severance, restructuring and recoverable expenses from clients. Consulting expenses decreased 9% in 2009 compared with the same period in 2008, reflecting a 4% decrease from the impact of foreign exchange rates and a 6% decrease on an underlying basis. The decline in underlying expenses reflects a decrease in base salaries and employee benefits due to decreased staff levels, along with cost reductions in all discretionary expense categories and lower recoverable expenses from clients. These decreases were partly offset by an increase in professional liability costs of approximately $30 million, primarily reflecting a legal settlement at Mercer, and higher severance costs at Oliver Wyman due to capacity reductions. 35 Table of Contents Corporate and Other With the disposition of Kroll in August 2010, along with previous divestiture transactions between 2008 and 2010, the Company has now divested its entire Risk Consulting and Technology segment. As described in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements, based on the terms and conditions of the divestitures of the CARG businesses in 2008, the Company determined it has “continuing involvement” in those businesses, as that term is used in SEC Staff Accounting Bulletin Topic 5e. Therefore, classification of the CARG businesses as discontinued operations is not appropriate, and their financial results in the current and prior periods are included in operating income. The runoff of the Company’s involvement in the CARG businesses is now managed by the Company’s corporate departments, and consequently, the financial results of these businesses are now included in “Corporate” for segment reporting purposes. The following results of Corporate and Other includes the Corporate Advisory and Restructuring operations: (In millions of dollars) 2010 2009 2008 Corporate and Other: Corporate Advisory and Restructuring Revenue (a) $ 1 $ 1 $ 127 Expense (9 ) 4 208 Operating Income (Loss) 10 (3 ) (81 ) Corporate Expense (172 ) (420 ) (255 ) Total Corporate and Other $ (162 ) $ (423 ) $ (336 ) (a) Before intercompany eliminations Corporate expenses in 2010 were $172 million compared to $420 million in 2009. The decrease is due to the impact of a $230 million net charge incurred in 2009 related to the settlement of the securities and ERISA class action lawsuits. The decrease in Corporate expense in 2010 compared to 2009 also reflects the impact of lower restructuring charges partly offset by higher consulting fees. The decrease in Corporate Advisory and Restructuring expenses in 2010 is due to the impact of $10 million of payments received in 2010 related to the disposal of this unit in 2008 compared with $1 million in 2009. These payments are classified as a recovery of expenses previously incurred as a result of the disposal transaction. Corporate expenses in 2009 were $420 million compared to $255 million in 2008. Expenses in 2009 include a $230 million charge related to the settlement of the securities and ERISA class action lawsuits described above. Restructuring and related charges in 2009 were $31 million compared with $85 million in 2008. Excluding these charges, expenses would have decreased 6%. This decrease is due to lower consulting and legal fees in 2009 compared to 2008. Expenses for the Corporate Advisory and Restructuring business reflect a goodwill impairment charge of $36 million in 2008. Discontinued Operations On August 3, 2010, the Company completed its sale of Kroll to Altegrity for cash proceeds of $1.13 billion. In the first quarter of 2010, Kroll completed the sale of KLS. The account balances and activities of Kroll and KLS have been segregated and reported as discontinued operations in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets at December 31, 2009. The gain on the sale of Kroll and related tax benefits and the after-tax loss on the sale of KLS, along with Kroll’s and KLS’s 2010 and comparative results of operations are included in discontinued operations. Discontinued operations in 2010 and 2009 includes the accretion of interest related to an indemnity for uncertain tax positions provided as part of the purchase by Great-West Lifeco, Inc. of Putnam Investments Trust from the Company in August 2007. Discontinued operations in 2010 includes $16 million for insurance recoveries for costs incurred in prior years related to Putnam. In the second quarter of 2009 Kroll completed the sale of KGS. The loss on the sale of KGS and comparative results of operations are included in discontinued operations. 36 Table of Contents Results of discontinued operations in 2008 include the operating results of Kroll, KLS and KGS and the effects of three other discontinued operations—Putnam, Mediservice and Kroll Crucible—which are discussed in more detail below. With regard to Putnam, discontinued operations in 2008 includes (1) the impact of immaterial corrections and other adjustments to the fourth quarter of 2007 tax provision related to the transaction, (2) adjustments to the tax provision to reflect differences between tax returns filed in 2008 and the initial estimated provisions, and (3) interest on liabilities for certain tax-related indemnities provided as part of the transaction. In the first quarter of 2008, Marsh completed the sale of Mediservice, a claims administration operation in Brazil. The gain on this disposal, net of tax, is included in discontinued operations in 2008. In the third quarter of 2008, Kroll completed the sale of Kroll Crucible (“Crucible”), a division of its government services operation. The loss on this disposal, net of tax, is included in discontinued operations in 2008. Summarized Statements of Income data for discontinued operations is as follows: For the Years Ended December 31, (In millions of dollars) 2010 2009 2008 Kroll Operations Revenue $ 381 $ 699 $ 866 Expense (a) 345 958 1,281 Net operating income 36 (259 ) (415 ) Income tax 16 24 24 Income from Kroll operations, net of tax 20 (283 ) (439 ) Other discontinued operations, net of tax (7 ) — — Income (loss) from discontinued operations, net of tax 13 (283 ) (439 ) Disposals of discontinued operations (b) 58 8 29 Income tax (credit) expense (c) (235 ) 15 33 Disposals of discontinued operations, net of tax 293 (7 ) (4 ) Discontinued operations, net of tax $ 306 $ (290 ) $ (443 ) Discontinued operations, net of tax per share —Basic $ 0.55 $ (0.54 ) $ (0.83 ) —Diluted $ 0.55 $ (0.54 ) $ (0.84 ) (a) Includes goodwill impairment charges of $315 million and $504 million for 2009 and 2008, respectively. (b) Includes gain on sale of Kroll and the gain on the sale of KLS in 2010 and a loss on the sale of Kroll Government Services in 2009. (c) The income tax credit related to the disposal of discontinued operations for 2010 primarily represents the recognition of tax benefits related to the sale of Kroll, partly offset by a tax provision of $36 million related to the sale of KGS. Other Corporate Items Interest Interest income earned on corporate funds amounted to $20 million in 2010 compared with $17 million in 2009. The increase is primarily due to higher non-U.S. interest rate yields in 2010 compared to 2009. Interest expense was $233 million in 2010 compared with $241 million in 2009. The decrease in interest expense is primarily due to the maturity of $550 million of senior notes in the third quarter of 2010. Interest income earned on corporate funds amounted to $17 million in 2009, compared with $47 million in 2008. The decrease in interest income is due to lower average interest rates in 2009 compared with the prior year. Interest expense of $241 million in 2009 increased $21 million from the prior year. This increase is primarily due to the pre-funding in the first quarter of the $400 million of senior notes that matured in June 2009, the higher interest rate on the new bonds compared with those that matured, as well as higher interest expense associated with acquisition related liabilities. The Company used the proceeds of the newly issued senior notes to fund the maturity of $400 million of senior notes in June 2009. 37 Table of Contents Investment Income (Loss) In 2010, investment income was $43 million compared with a loss of $2 million in 2009. The increase reflects the impact of mark-to-market gains in 2010 on Risk Capital Holdings’ private equity investments compared to losses in 2009, and gains realized from the sale of equity securities in 2010. In 2009, investment losses were $2 million compared with a $12 million loss in the prior year. The decrease reflects lower mark-to-market declines on Risk Capital Holdings’ private equity investments recorded in 2009 compared with 2008, and gains realized from the sale of equity securities in 2009. Income Taxes The Company’s consolidated effective tax rate in 2010 was 26.5%. The tax rate reflects foreign operations taxed at rates lower than the U.S. statutory tax rate. The Company’s consolidated effective tax rate in 2009 was 3.8%. The tax rate reflects reductions relating to a decrease in the liability for unrecognized tax benefits and foreign operations taxed at rates lower than the U.S. statutory tax rate. The decrease in the liability for unrecognized tax benefits resulted from expiring statutes of limitations, audit settlements and changes in estimates. The Company’s consolidated effective tax rate in 2008 was 22.9%. The tax rate reflects foreign operations taxed at rates lower than the U.S. rate. It also reflects a federal benefit on deferred state taxes, largely offset by other deferred tax adjustments. The lower tax rate generally attributed to the Company’s foreign operations reflects income taxed at rates lower than the 35% U.S. federal tax rate, net of the U.S. tax impact of repatriation of foreign earnings. The reduced effective tax rate primarily reflects lower corporate tax rates that prevail outside of the U.S., enhanced by planning that further reduces the impact of taxes worldwide. Under current U.S. tax law, the Company anticipates its non-U.S. operations will continue to incur taxes at rates under 35%, although the percentage impact on the tax rate is expected to moderate as increases in U.S. pretax income change the geographic mix of income. Nevertheless, the effective tax rate is expected to remain significantly variable for the foreseeable future. The rate is sensitive to the geographic mix and repatriation of the Company’s earnings, which may have a favorable or unfavorable impact on the rate. This also could result in foreign tax credit carryforwards arising in future periods for which a valuation allowance may be required. Losses in certain jurisdictions cannot be offset by earnings from other operations, and may require valuation allowances affecting the rate, depending on estimates of the realizability of associated deferred tax assets. The tax rate is also sensitive to changes in unrecognized tax benefits, including the impact of settled tax audits and expired statutes of limitation. The realization of deferred tax assets is dependent on the generation of future taxable income during the periods in which the tax benefits are deductible or creditable. The Company and Marsh have been profitable globally. However, tax liabilities are determined and assessed on a legal entity and jurisdictional basis. Certain taxing jurisdictions allow or require combined or consolidated tax filings. In the United States, certain groups within the Company, which file on a combined basis, and certain entities within Marsh’s operations, which file on a separate entity basis, incurred losses for the last two years as well as the current year. The Company assessed the realizability of its domestic deferred tax assets, particularly state deferred tax assets of Marsh relating to jurisdictions in which it files separate tax returns, state deferred tax assets of all of the Company domestic operations related to jurisdictions in which the Company files a unitary or combined state tax return, and foreign tax credit carryforwards in the Company’s consolidated U.S. federal tax return. When making its assessment about the realization of its domestic deferred tax assets at December 31, 2010, the Company considered all available evidence, placing particular weight on evidence that could be objectively verified. The evidence considered included (i) the nature, frequency, and severity of current and cumulative financial reporting losses, (ii) actions completed that are designed to reduce capacity and adjust to lower demand in the current economic environment, (iii) profit trends evidenced by recent improvements in the Company’s and Marsh’s operating performance, (iv) the nonrecurring nature of some of the items 38 Table of Contents that contributed to the losses, (v) the carryforward periods for the net operating losses (“NOLs”) and foreign tax credit carryforwards, (vi) the sources and timing of future taxable income, giving weight to sources according to the extent to which they can be objectively verified, and (vii) tax planning strategies that would be implemented, if necessary, to accelerate utilization of NOLs. Based on its assessment, the Company concluded that it is more likely than not that a substantial portion of these deferred tax assets are realizable and a valuation allowance was recorded to reduce the domestic tax assets to the amount that the Company believes is more likely than not to be realized. In the event sufficient taxable income is not generated in future periods, additional valuation allowances of up to approximately $250 million could be required relating to these domestic deferred tax assets. The realization of the remaining U.S. federal deferred tax assets is not as sensitive to U.S. profits because it is supported by anticipated repatriation of future earnings from the Company’s profitable global operations. In addition, when making its assessment about the realization of its domestic deferred tax assets at December 31, 2010, the Company continued to assess the realizability of deferred tax assets of certain other entities with a history of recent losses, including other U.S. entities that file separate state tax returns and foreign subsidiaries, and recorded valuation allowances as appropriate. Changes in tax laws or tax rulings may have a significant adverse impact on our effective tax rate. For example, proposals for fundamental U.S. international tax reform, such as the recent proposal by President Obama’s Administration, if enacted, could have a significant adverse impact on the effective tax rate. Liquidity and Capital Resources The Company’s liquidity needs are primarily for operating expenses, servicing debt, funding pension obligations, paying dividends on outstanding stock, funding acquisitions and capital expenditures. As a holding company, the Company’s primary source for meeting these requirements is cash flows from operating subsidiaries. Other sources of liquidity include borrowing facilities discussed below in financing cash flows. Cash on our consolidated balance sheet includes funds available for general corporate purposes. Funds held on behalf of clients in a fiduciary capacity are segregated and shown separately in the consolidated balance sheet as an offset to fiduciary liabilities. Fiduciary funds cannot be used for general corporate purposes, and should not be considered as a source of liquidity for the Company. Operating Cash Flows The Company generated $722 million of cash from operations in 2010 compared with $640 million in 2009. These amounts reflect the net income reported by the Company during those periods, excluding gains or losses from investments and the disposition of businesses, adjusted for non-cash charges and changes in working capital which relate, primarily, to the timing of payments for accrued liabilities or receipts of assets. Cash generated from the disposition of businesses is included in investing cash flows. In December 2009, the Company paid $435 million into settlement funds related to the securities and ERISA class action lawsuits described above. Through December 31, 2009, the Company had collected $163 million of the total $230 million recovery from its insurers and the remaining $67 million was collected in January 2010. On June 11, 2010, the Company resolved the litigation brought by the Alaska Retirement Management Board (“ARMB”) on behalf of two Alaska benefit plans against Mercer, relating to work in the period 1992 to 2004. Under the terms of the settlement agreement, Mercer paid $500 million, of which $100 million was covered by insurance. The Company recorded a tax benefit of $277 million related to the disposition of Kroll and a $160 million tax benefit related to the cost of the Alaska Settlement. Approximately $50 million of the tax benefits related to the Kroll disposition were realized during 2010 and approximately $230 million is expected to be realized in the first half of 2011. Pension Related Items During the third quarter of 2010, the Company contributed $200 million to its U.S. Retirement Plan. The Company realized a tax benefit on this contribution of approximately $70 million in 2010. During 2010, 39 Table of Contents the Company contributed $221 million to its U.S. pension plans (including the $200 million discussed above) and approximately $237 million to non-U.S. pension plans, compared with $22 million for U.S. plans and $400 million for non-U.S. plans in 2009. The Company’s expected funding for its U.S. non-qualified and non-U.S. pension plans in 2011 is approximately $20 million and $300 million, respectively. The Company’s policy for funding its tax-qualified defined benefit retirement plans is to contribute amounts at least sufficient to meet the funding requirements set forth in U.S. and applicable foreign laws. There currently is no ERISA funding requirement for the U.S. qualified plan for 2010 or 2011. Funding requirements for non-U.S. plans vary by country. Contribution rates are determined by the local actuaries based on local funding practices and statutory requirements, which may differ from measurements under U.S. GAAP. Funding amounts may be influenced by future asset performance, the level of discount rates and other variables impacting the assets and/or liabilities of the plan. In addition, amounts funded in the future, to the extent not due under regulatory requirements, may be affected by alternative uses of the Company’s cash flows, including dividends, investments and share repurchases. During 2010, the Company’s defined benefit pension plan assets experienced investment gains of 14.4% in the U.S. and 13.5% in the U.K., our largest plan. Pension liabilities are impacted by, among other things, the discount rate set as of year-end. In addition, the year-over-year change in the funded status of the plans is impacted by the variance between actual and assumed results, particularly with regard to return on assets and changes in the discount rate, as well as the amount of Company contributions, if any. Unrecognized actuarial losses at December 31, 2010 were approximately $1.3 billion for the U.S. plans and $2.3 billion for the non-U.S. plans. Over the past several years, the amount of actuarial losses has been significantly impacted, both positively and negatively, by actual asset performance and changes in discount rates. In 2008, severe downturns in the global equity markets resulted in market declines of 18% in the U.S. and 14% in the U.K. (our largest plan). This was partly offset by asset returns which exceeded the assumed rates of return in 2009 and 2010 in both the U.S. and the U.K. In addition, the discount rate used to measure plan liabilities declined in the U.S. in each of the last three years. A decline in the discount rate increases the measured plan liability, resulting in actuarial losses. In the U.K., asset losses in 2008 were partly offset by an increase in the discount rate. However, the discount rate in the U.K. declined in each of the last two years. Overall, the Company’s pension expense is expected to increase in 2011 by approximately $60 million before the partly-offsetting impacts on bonuses and other incentive compensation and possible movements in foreign exchange rates. The Company’s accounting policies for its defined benefit pension plans, including the selection of and sensitivity to assumptions, are discussed below under Management’s Discussion of Critical Accounting Policies. For additional information regarding the Company’s retirement plans, see Note 8 to the consolidated financial statements. Financing Cash Flows Net cash used for financing activities was $1.1 billion in 2010 compared with $464 million of net cash used for financing activities in 2009. The Company reduced outstanding debt by approximately $550 million, $10 million and $260 million in 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively. Debt During 2010, the Company’s 5.15% ten-year fixed rate $550 million senior notes matured. The Company used a portion of the cash received from the Kroll disposition to fund the maturity of those notes. During 2009, the Company’s 7.125% ten-year $400 million bond matured. The Company used cash on hand as well as the proceeds from the issuance of 9.25% ten-year $400 million senior notes in the first quarter to manage liquidity, including the funding of the maturing notes. 40 Table of Contents During 2008, the Company’s 3.625% five-year fixed rate $250 million senior notes matured. The Company used cash on hand to manage liquidity, including the repayment of these notes. In the first quarter of 2009, Marsh acquired the remaining minority interest of a previously majority owned entity for total purchase consideration of $47 million reflecting cash paid of $24 million and future consideration of $23 million, of which $15 million was paid in the first quarter of 2010. On October 23, 2009, the Company and certain of its foreign subsidiaries entered into a new $1.0 billion multi-currency three-year unsecured revolving credit facility, which replaced the $1.2 billion facility that was previously in place. The interest rate on this facility varies based upon the Company’s credit ratings and the Company’s credit default swap levels, subject to floors and caps. The facility requires the Company to maintain certain coverage and leverage ratios which are tested quarterly. There were no borrowings outstanding under this facility at December 31, 2010. The Company’s senior debt is currently rated Baa2 by Moody’s and BBB- by Standard & Poor’s. The Company’s short-term debt is currently rated P-2 by Moody’s and A-3 by Standard & Poor’s. The Company carries a stable outlook from Moody’s and a negative outlook from Standard & Poor’s. The Company also maintains other credit facilities, guarantees and letters of credit with various banks, primarily related to operations located outside the United States, aggregating $272 million at December 31, 2010 and $250 million at December 31, 2009. There were no outstanding borrowings under these facilities at December 31, 2010. Share Repurchases On September 15, 2010, the Company’s Board of Directors authorized a $500 million share repurchase program. During the fourth quarter of 2010, the Company repurchased 3.4 million of its common stock for total consideration of $85.5 million. The repurchase authorization does not have a time limit. Dividends The Company paid total dividends of $452 million in 2010 ($0.81 per share), $431 million in 2009 ($0.80 per share) and $412 million ($0.80 per share) in 2008. Investing Cash Flows Net cash provided by investing activities amounted to $535 million in 2010. This compares with $236 million of net cash used for investing activities in 2009. The Company made eight acquisitions in 2010. Cash used for these acquisitions, net of cash acquired, was $427 million compared with $67 million used for acquisitions in 2009. In addition, the Company issued approximately 7.6 million shares of common stock with an acquisition date value of $183 million, and recorded a liability of $81 million for estimated contingent purchase consideration related to the acquisitions completed in 2010. In 2010, the Company also paid $60 million of deferred purchase consideration, $3 million for other intangible assets and $2 million of contingent purchase consideration related to acquisitions made in prior years. Remaining deferred cash payments of $189 million for acquisitions completed in 2010 and in prior years are recorded in accounts payable and accrued liabilities or other liabilities in the consolidated balance sheet at December 31, 2010. The Company paid contingent consideration of $6 million in 2009. Cash provided by the sale of securities was $32 million and $42 million in 2010 and 2009, respectively. The Company received $1.13 billion from its disposition of Kroll, which closed on August 3, 2010 and $110 million from the disposition of KLS which closed in the second quarter of 2010. In 2009, the Company received $70 million related to the disposition of KGS. The Company’s additions to fixed assets and capitalized software, which amounted to $271 million in 2010 and $305 million in 2009, primarily relate to computer equipment purchases, the refurbishing and modernizing of office facilities and software development costs. These amounts include additions related to Kroll, which is included in discontinued operations, of $13 million and $44 million for 2010 and 2009, respectively. 41 Table of Contents The Company has committed to potential future investments of approximately $81 million in connection with its investments in Trident II and other funds managed by Stone Point Capital, LLC. The majority of the Company’s investment commitments for funds managed by Stone Point Capital, LLC are related to Trident II, the investment period for which is now closed for new investments. No significant future capital calls related to Trident II are expected. Commitments and Obligations The following identifies the Company’s future contractual obligations by the types identified in the table below as of December 31, 2010: Payment due by Period Contractual Obligations (In millions of dollars) Total Within1 Year 1-3Years 4-5Years After 5Years Current portion of long-term debt $ 8 $ 8 $ — $ — $ — Long-term debt 3,034 — 519 1,420 1,095 Interest on long-term debt 1,511 185 340 276 710 Net operating leases 2,596 368 618 445 1,165 Service agreements 433 127 134 71 101 Other long-term obligations 189 46 130 12 1 Total $ 7,771 $ 734 $ 1,741 $ 2,224 $ 3,072 The above does not include unrecognized tax benefits of $199 million as the Company is unable to reasonably predict the timing of settlement of these liabilities, other than approximately $30 million that may become payable during 2010. The above does not include the indemnified liabilities discussed in Note 16 as the Company is unable to reasonably predict the timing of settlement of these liabilities. The above does not include pension liabilities of $935 million because the timing and amount of ultimate payment of such liability is dependent upon future events, including, but not limited to, future returns on plan assets, and changes in the discount rate used to measure the liabilities. The amounts of estimated future benefits payments to be made from plan assets are disclosed in Note 8 to the consolidated financial statements. The Company expects to contribute approximately $20 million and $300 million in 2011 to its U.S. non-qualified and non-U.S. pension plans, respectively. Market Risk and Credit Risk Certain of the Company’s revenues, expenses, assets and liabilities are exposed to the impact of interest rate changes and fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates and equity markets. Interest Rate Risk and Credit Risk The Company has historically managed its net exposure to interest rate changes by utilizing a mixture of variable and fixed rate borrowings to finance the Company’s asset base. During 2007, virtually all of the Company’s variable rate borrowings were repaid. In January 2011, the Company entered into two 3.5 year interest rate swaps to hedge changes in the fair value of the first $250 million of its 5.375% senior notes due in 2014. Under the terms of the swap, the counterparties will pay the Company a fixed rate of 5.375% and the Company will pay interest at a floating rate of three-month LIBOR plus a fixed spread of 3.726%. The swaps are designated as fair value hedging instruments and are deemed to be perfectly effective in accordance with applicable accounting guidance. Interest income generated from the Company’s cash investments as well as invested fiduciary funds will vary with the general level of interest rates, particularly short-term interest rates. The Company had the following investments subject to variable interest rates: (In millions of dollars) December 31, 2010 Cash and cash equivalents invested in money market funds,certificates of deposit and time deposits $ 1,894 Fiduciary cash and investments $ 3,824 42 Table of Contents These investments and debt instruments are discussed more fully in Note1 to the consolidated financial statements appearing in Item 8 of this report. Based on the above balances, if short-term interest rates increased or decreased by 10%, or 13 basis points, over the course of the year, annual interest income, including interest earned on fiduciary funds, would increase or decrease by approximately $5 million. In addition to interest rate risk, our cash investments and fiduciary fund investments are subject to potential loss of value due to counterparty credit risk. To minimize this risk, the Company and its subsidiaries invest pursuant to a Board-approved investment policy. The policy mandates the preservation of principal and liquidity and requires broad diversification with counterparty limits assigned based primarily on credit rating and type of investment. The Company carefully monitors its cash and fiduciary fund investments and will further restrict the portfolio as appropriate to market conditions. The majority of cash and fiduciary funds are invested in short-term bank deposits and liquid money market funds. Foreign Currency Risk The translated values of revenue and expense from the Company’s international operations are subject to fluctuations due to changes in currency exchange rates. The non-U.S. based revenue that is exposed to foreign exchange fluctuations is approximately 56% of total revenue. Note 17 details revenue by geographic area. We periodically use forward contracts and options to limit foreign currency exchange rate exposure on net income and cash flows for specific, clearly defined transactions arising in the ordinary course of business. Although the Company has significant revenue generated in foreign locations which is subject to foreign exchange rate fluctuations, in most cases both the foreign currency revenue and expenses are in the functional currency of the foreign location. As such, the U.S. dollar translation of both the revenues and expenses, as well as the potentially offsetting movements of various currencies against the U.S. dollar, generally tends to mitigate the impact on net operating income of foreign currency risk. The Company estimates that a 10% movement of major foreign currencies (Euro, Sterling, Australian dollar and Canadian dollar) in the same direction against the U.S. dollar that held constant over the course of the year would increase or decrease full year net operating income by approximately $50 million. Equity Price Risk The Company holds investments in public and private companies, as well as in certain private equity funds managed by Stone Point Capital. Publicly traded investments of $23 million are classified as available for sale. Non-publicly traded investments of $39 million are accounted for using the cost method and $168 million are accounted for using the equity method. The investments that are classified as available for sale or that are not publicly traded are subject to risk of changes in market value, which if determined to be other than temporary, could result in realized impairment losses. The Company periodically reviews the carrying value of such investments to determine if any valuation adjustments are appropriate under the applicable accounting pronouncements. Other A number of lawsuits and regulatory proceedings are pending. See Note 16 to the consolidated financial statements. Management’s Discussion of Critical Accounting Policies The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (“GAAP”) requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue and expenses, and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. Management considers the policies discussed below to be critical to understanding the Company’s financial statements because their application places the most significant demands on management’s judgment, and requires management to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain. Actual results may differ from those estimates. 43 Table of Contents Legal and Other Loss Contingencies The Company and its subsidiaries are subject to numerous claims, lawsuits and proceedings including claims for errors and omissions. GAAP requires that liabilities for contingencies be recorded when it is probable that a liability has been incurred before the balance sheet date and the amount can be reasonably estimated. Significant management judgment is required to apply this guidance. The Company analyzes its litigation exposure based on available information, including consultation with internal and external counsel handling the defense of these matters, to assess its potential liability. In addition, to the extent that insurance coverage is available, significant management judgment is required to determine the amount of recoveries that are probable of collection under the Company’s various insurance programs. Retirement Benefits The Company maintains qualified and non-qualified defined benefit pension and defined contribution plans for its eligible U.S. employees and a variety of defined benefit and defined contribution plans for its eligible non-U.S. employees. The Company’s policy for funding its tax qualified defined benefit retirement plans is to contribute amounts at least sufficient to meet the funding requirements set forth in U.S. and applicable foreign laws. The Company recognizes the funded status of its overfunded defined benefit pension and retiree medical plans as a net benefit plan asset and its unfunded and underfunded plans as a net benefit plan liability. The gains or losses and prior service costs or credits that have not been recognized as components of net periodic costs are recorded as a component of Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income (“AOCI”), net of tax, in the Company’s consolidated balance sheets. The determination of net periodic pension cost is based on a number of actuarial assumptions, including an expected long-term rate of return on plan assets, the discount rate and assumed rate of salary increase. Significant assumptions used in the calculation of net periodic pension costs and pension liabilities are disclosed in Note 8 to the consolidated financial statements. The Company believes the assumptions for each plan are reasonable and appropriate and will continue to evaluate actuarial assumptions at least annually and adjust them as appropriate. Based on its current assumptions, the Company expects pension expense in 2011 to increase approximately $60 million compared with 2010 before partly-offsetting impacts of bonuses and other incentive compensation and possible movements in foreign exchange rates. Future pension expense or credits will depend on plan provisions, future investment performance, future assumptions and various other factors related to the populations participating in the pension plans. Holding all other assumptions constant, a half-percentage point change in the rate of return on plan assets and discount rate assumptions would affect net periodic pension cost for the U.S. and U.K. plans, which together comprise approximately 87% of total pension plan liabilities, as follows: 0.5 Percentage Point Increase 0.5 Percentage Point Decrease (In millions of dollars) U.S. U.K. U.S. U.K. Assumed Rate of Return on Plan Assets $ (17 ) $ (27 ) $ 17 $ 27 Discount Rate $ (43 ) $ (41 ) $ 47 $ 43 Changing the discount rate and leaving the other assumptions constant may not be representative of the impact on expense, because the long-term rates of inflation and salary increases are often correlated with the discount rate. The Company contributes to certain health care and life insurance benefits provided to its retired employees. The cost of these postretirement benefits for employees in the U.S. is accrued during the period up to the date employees are eligible to retire, but is funded by the Company as incurred. The key assumptions and sensitivity to changes in the assumed health care cost trend rate are discussed in Note 8 to the consolidated financial statements. 44 Table of Contents Income Taxes The Company tax rate reflects its income, statutory tax rates and tax planning in the various jurisdictions in which it operates. Significant judgment is required in determining the annual tax rate and in evaluating uncertain tax positions. The Company reports a liability for unrecognized tax benefits resulting from uncertain tax positions taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. The evaluation of a tax position is a two-step process. The first step involves recognition. We determine whether it is more likely than not that a tax position will be sustained upon tax examination, including resolution of any related appeals or litigation, based on only the technical merits of the position. The technical merits of a tax position derive from both statutory and judicial authority (legislation and statutes, legislative intent, regulations, rulings, and case law) and their applicability to the facts and circumstances of the tax position. If a tax position does not meet the more likely than not recognition threshold, the benefit of that position is not recognized in the financial statements. The second step is measurement. A tax position that meets the more likely than not recognition threshold is measured to determine the amount of benefit to recognize in the financial statements. The tax position is measured as the largest amount of benefit that is greater than 50 percent likely of being realized upon ultimate resolution with a taxing authority. Uncertain tax positions are evaluated based upon the facts and circumstances that exist at each reporting period and involve significant management judgment. Subsequent changes in judgment based upon new information may lead to changes in recognition, derecognition, and measurement. Adjustments may result, for example, upon resolution of an issue with the taxing authorities, or expiration of a statute of limitations barring an assessment for an issue. Tax law requires items be included in the Company’s tax returns at different times than the items are reflected in the financial statements. As a result, the annual tax expense reflected in the consolidated statements of income is different than that reported in the tax returns. Some of these differences are permanent, such as expenses that are not deductible in the returns, and some differences are temporary and reverse over time, such as depreciation expense. Temporary differences create deferred tax assets and liabilities. Deferred tax liabilities generally represent tax expense recognized in the financial statements for which payment has been deferred, or expense for which a deduction has been taken already in the tax return but the expense has not yet been recognized in the financial statements. Deferred tax assets generally represent items that can be used as a tax deduction or credit in tax returns in future years for which a benefit has already been recorded in the financial statements. In assessing the need for and amount of a valuation allowance for deferred tax assets, the Company considers whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized and adjusts the valuation allowance accordingly. The Company evaluates all significant available positive and negative evidence, including the existence of losses in recent years and its forecast of future taxable income by jurisdiction, in assessing the need for a valuation allowance. The Company also considers tax-planning strategies that would result in realization of deferred tax assets, and the presence of taxable income in prior carryback years if carryback is permitted under the appropriate tax law. The underlying assumptions the Company uses in forecasting future taxable income require significant judgment and take into account the Company’s recent performance. The ultimate realization of deferred tax assets is dependent on the generation of future taxable income during the periods in which temporary differences or carryforwards are deductible or creditable. Valuation allowances are established for deferred tax assets when it is estimated that it is more likely than not future taxable income will be insufficient to fully use a deduction or credit in that jurisdiction. Fair Value Determinations Investment Valuation—The Company holds investments in both public and private companies, as well as certain private equity funds. The majority of the public investments are accounted for as available for sale securities. Certain investments, primarily investments in private equity funds, are accounted for using the equity method. Although not directly recorded in the Company’s consolidated balance sheets, the Company defined benefit pension plans hold investments of approximately $10 billion. The fair value of these investments determines, in part, the over-or under-funded status of those plans, 45 Table of Contents which is included in the Company’s consolidated balance sheets. The Company periodically reviews the carrying value of its investments to determine if any valuation adjustments are appropriate under the applicable accounting pronouncements. The Company bases its review on the facts and circumstances as they relate to each investment. Fair value of investments in private equity funds is determined by the funds’ investment managers. Factors considered in determining the fair value of private equity investments include: implied valuation of recently completed financing rounds that included sophisticated outside investors; performance multiples of comparable public companies; restrictions on the sale or disposal of the investments; trading characteristics of the securities; and the relative size of the holdings in comparison to other private investors and the public market float. In those instances where quoted market prices are not available, particularly for equity holdings in private companies, or formal restrictions limit the sale of securities, significant management judgment is required to determine the appropriate value of the Company’s investments. The Company reviews with the fund manager the appropriateness of valuation results for significant private equity investments. Goodwill Impairment Testing—The Company is required to assess goodwill and any indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment annually, or more frequently if circumstances indicate impairment may have occurred. The Company performs the annual impairment test for each of its reporting units during the third quarter of each year. Fair values of the reporting units are estimated using a market approach or a discounted cash flow model. Carrying values for the reporting units are based on balances at the prior quarter end and include directly identified assets and liabilities, as well as an allocation of those assets and liabilities not recorded at the reporting unit level. The Company performed interim goodwill impairment assessments in its Risk Consulting & Technology segment which resulted in an impairment charge of $315 million recorded in the first quarter of 2009 and impairment charges totaling $540 million recorded in the first and second quarters of 2008. Impairment charges included in discontinued operations were $315 million and $504 million in 2009 and 2008, respectively. The Risk Consulting & Technology segment was effectively disposed of with the sale of Kroll in August of 2010. The Company completed its 2010 annual review in the third quarter of 2010 and concluded that goodwill was not impaired. The fair value of each reporting unit exceeded its carrying value by a substantial margin. The fair value estimates used in this assessment are dependent upon assumptions and estimates about the future profitability and other financial ratios of our reporting units, as well as relevant financial data, recent transactions and market valuations of comparable public companies. Share-based Payment The guidance for accounting for share-based payments requires, among other things, that the estimated fair value of stock options be charged to earnings. Significant management judgment is required to determine the appropriate assumptions for inputs such as volatility and expected term necessary to estimate option values. In addition, management judgment is required to analyze the terms of the plans and awards granted thereunder to determine if awards will be treated as equity awards or liability awards, as defined by the accounting guidance. As of December 31, 2010, there was $23.4 million of unrecognized compensation cost related to stock option awards. The weighted-average periods over which the costs are expected to be recognized is 1.7 years. Also as of December 31, 2010, there was $206 million of unrecognized compensation cost related to the Company’s restricted stock, restricted stock unit and deferred stock unit awards. See Note 9 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding guidance for accounting for share-based payments. New Accounting Pronouncements Note 1 contains a summary of the Company’s significant accounting policies, including a discussion of recently issued accounting pronouncements and their impact or potential future impact on the Company’s financial results, if determinable.

See the information set forth under the heading “Market Risk and Credit Risk” above under Part II, Item 7 (“Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations”). 46 Table of Contents",2023-12-30 19:02:21.440649
62709,MMC,"MARSH & MCLENNAN COMPANIES, INC.",2007,"Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. General Marsh & McLennan Companies, Inc. and Subsidiaries (“MMC”) is a global professional services firm. MMC’s subsidiaries include Marsh Inc. (“Marsh”), which provides risk and insurance services; Guy Carpenter & Company, LLC (“Guy Carpenter”), which provides reinsurance services; Kroll Inc. (“Kroll”), which provides risk consulting and technology services; Mercer Inc. (“Mercer”), which provides human resource and specialty consulting services; and Putnam Investments (“Putnam”), which provides investment management services. MMC’s approximately 55,000 employees worldwide provide analysis, advice and transactional capabilities to clients in over 100 countries. MMC operates in four principal business segments based on the services provided. Risk and Insurance Services includes risk management and insurance and reinsurance broking and services, provided primarily by Marsh and Guy Carpenter. Risk Consulting & Technology, conducted through Kroll, includes risk consulting and related investigative, intelligence, financial, security and technology services. Consulting, which comprises the activities of Mercer Human Resource Consulting and Mercer’s Specialty Consulting Businesses, includes human resource consulting and related services, and specialized management and economic consulting services. We conduct Investment Management through Putnam. Please see Note 18 to the consolidated financial statements, which discusses MMC’s agreement to sell Putnam to Great-West Lifeco Inc. A fuller description of our segments’ business activities is included in Part I, Item 1 of this report. We describe the primary sources of revenue and categories of expense for each segment below, in our discussion of segment financial results. Management evaluates performance based on segment operating income, which reflects expenses directly related to segment operations, but not MMC corporate-level expenses. A reconciliation of segment operating income to total operating income is included in Note 17 to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report. The accounting policies used for each segment are the same as those used for the consolidated financial statements. This MD&A contains forward-looking statements as that term is defined in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. See “Information Concerning Forward-Looking Statements” at the outset of this report. Significant Developments in 2006 MMC’s historical financial information should be viewed in light of the significant developments discussed below. As described more fully below, results of operations in 2006 reflect, among other items: stock option expense under SFAS 123(R) (“Share-Based Payment”), which MMC adopted effective July 1, 2005. MMC’s 2006 results include stock option expense in each segment for the full year. The 2005 results reflect a charge for six months (from the date of adoption on July 1, 2005) recorded in corporate expenses; restructuring savings and charges under MMC’s 2005 and 2006 restructuring plans; the sale of Sedgwick Claims Management Services in the first quarter of 2006, the gain from which appears in discontinued operations; the sale of Price Forbes, MMC’s U.K.-based wholesale brokerage business in the third quarter of 2006, the loss from which, net of current year earnings, is included in discontinued operations; 27 the sale of Kroll Security International (“KSI”), Kroll’s international high-risk asset and personal protection division in the fourth quarter of 2006, the gain from which, net of current year operating loss, is included in discontinued operations; and the continuing decline in market service revenues in the risk and insurance services segment. Consolidated Results of Operations For the Years Ended December 31, (In millions, except per share figures) 2006 2005 2004 Revenue: Service revenue $ 11,699 $ 11,395 $ 11,527 Investment income (loss) 222 183 200 Operating revenue 11,921 11,578 11,727 Expense: Compensation and benefits 7,113 6,897 6,685 Other operating expenses 3,350 3,788 3,476 Settlement and other costs — 40 969 Operating expenses 10,463 10,725 11,130 Operating income $ 1,458 $ 853 $ 597 Income from Continuing Operations $ 818 $ 367 $ 152 Discontinued Operations, net of tax 172 37 24 Net income $ 990 $ 404 $ 176 Income from Continuing Operations Per Share: Basic $ 1.49 $ 0.68 $ 0.29 Diluted $ 1.45 $ 0.67 $ 0.29 Net Income Per Share: Basic $ 1.80 $ 0.75 $ 0.33 Diluted $ 1.76 $ 0.74 $ 0.33 Average number of shares outstanding: Basic 549 538 526 Diluted 557 543 535 Consolidated operating income in 2006 increased 71% to $1.5 billion, resulting from a 3% increase in operating revenue and a 2% decrease in operating expenses. Revenue increases in consulting and risk consulting & technology were partly offset by decreases in risk and insurance services and investment management. The decrease in operating expenses reflects cost savings from restructuring activities, reduced net restructuring and related charges as well as lower costs related to several significant expense items, discussed in more detail below under “Consolidated Revenue and Expense”. These expense savings were partly offset by incremental costs, primarily related to stock options under SFAS 123(R). Results from discontinued operations in 2006 were $172 million net of tax, primarily resulting from the gain on the sale of Sedgwick Claims Management Services in January 2006. In the third quarter of 2006, MMC completed the sale of Price Forbes, its U.K.-based wholesale insurance broker. The loss on the disposal of Price Forbes and net income associated with its 2006 results are included in discontinued operations. The results of Price Forbes were insignificant to MMC’s 2005 results and, therefore, prior year amounts have not been restated. In the fourth quarter of 2006, Kroll completed the sale of Kroll Security International (“KSI”), its international high-risk asset and personal protection division. The gain on the disposal of KSI, and the financial results associated with 2006 and prior periods, are included in discontinued operations. 28 Consolidated Revenues and Expenses Consolidated revenue for the year ended December 31, 2006 was $11.9 billion, a 3% increase over the prior year. Higher revenue in the consulting and risk consulting & technology segments was partly offset by lower revenue in the risk and insurance services and investment management segments. Consolidated revenue increased 3% on an underlying basis, which includes the impact of a $71 million reduction in market services revenue. MMC does business in over 100 countries, as a result of which the impact of foreign exchange rate movements may impact period-to-period comparisons of revenue. Similarly, the revenue impact of acquisitions and dispositions may affect period-over-period comparisons of revenue. Underlying revenue measures the change in revenue from one period to another by identifying these impacts. The impact of foreign currency translations, acquisitions and dispositions on MMC’s operating revenues by segment is as follows: Twelve Months Ended Components of Revenue Change December 31, % Change Acquisitions/ GAAP Currency Dispositions Underlying (In millions, except percentage figures) 2006 2005 Revenue Impact Impact Revenue Risk and Insurance Services Insurance Services $ 4,390 $ 4,567 (4 )% — (2 )% (2 )% Reinsurance Services 880 836 5 % — — 5 % Risk Capital Holdings (a) 193 189 2 % — (5 )% 7 % Total Risk and Insurance Services 5,463 5,592 (2 )% — (2 )% — Risk Consulting & Technology (b) 979 872 12 % — 3 % 9 % Consulting Human Resource Consulting 3,021 2,794 8 % 1 % — 7 % Specialty Consulting 1,204 1,008 19 % 1 % 2 % 16 % Total Consulting 4,225 3,802 11 % 1 % 1 % 9 % Investment Management 1,385 1,506 (8 )% — — (8 )% Total Operating Segments $ 12,052 $ 11,772 2 % — — 2 % Corporate/Eliminations (131 ) (194 ) Total Revenue $ 11,921 $ 11,578 3 % — — 3 % 29 Twelve Months Ended Components of Revenue Change December 31, %Change Acquisitions/ GAAP Currency Dispositions Underlying (In millions, except percentage figures) 2005 2004 Revenue Impact Impact Revenue Risk and Insurance Services Insurance Services $ 4,567 $ 5,166 (12 )% 1 % — (13 )% Reinsurance Services 836 859 (3 )% 1 % — (4 )% Risk Capital Holdings (a) 189 180 5 % — (8 )% 13 % Total Risk and Insurance Services 5,592 6,205 (10 )% 1 % — (11 )% Risk Consulting & Technology (b) 872 371 135 % (1 )% 114 % 22 % Consulting Human Resource Consulting 2,794 2,786 — 1 % — (1 )% Specialty Consulting 1,008 851 19 % — 1 % 18 % Total Consulting 3,802 3,637 4 % 1 % — 3 % Investment Management 1,506 1,710 (12 )% — — (12 )% Total Operating Segments $ 11,772 $ 11,923 (1 )% 1 % 4 % (6 )% Corporate/Eliminations (194 ) (196 ) Total Revenue $ 11,578 $ 11,727 (1 )% 1 % 4 % (6 )% (a) Risk Capital Holdings owns MMC’s investments in private equity funds, insurance and financial services firms. (b) Certain reclassifications have been made to prior year amounts to conform with current presentation. The data presented excludes the KSI division, which is included in discontinued operations. Revenue In 2006, risk and insurance services revenue decreased 2% compared with 2005 and was flat on an underlying basis. A 5% increase in underlying revenue in reinsurance services was offset by a 2% decrease in insurance services, partly resulting from a $71 million decline in market service revenue. Risk consulting & technology revenue increased 12% due to growth in Kroll’s corporate advisory and restructuring, technology services and security businesses. Consulting revenue increased 11%, resulting from a 19% increase in Mercer’s specialty consulting businesses and an 8% increase in Mercer HR consulting. Investment management revenue declined 8%, primarily due to a decrease in assets under management, partly offset by higher investment gains. During 2005, revenue in the risk and insurance services segment decreased 10% from 2004. Underlying revenue declined 11%, resulting from a $407 million decline in market services revenue, lower levels of new business and renewals and the impact of lower insurance premium rates. These declines were partly offset by the impact of foreign currency exchange rates. Risk consulting & technology revenue increased $501 million. Due to the acquisition of Kroll in July 2004, results in 2005 include a full year of revenue for Kroll, compared with six months of revenue in 2004. Underlying growth in risk consulting & technology was 22%, due to growth in technology services, corporate advisory and restructuring, and background screening. Consulting revenue increased 4%, resulting from a 19% increase in Mercer’s specialty consulting businesses. Investment management revenue declined 12% as a result of the decrease in assets under management and lower investment income. 30 Operating Expenses Consolidated operating expenses in 2006 decreased 2% from 2005. The decrease in operating expenses reflects cost savings from restructuring activities; a decrease in net restructuring and related charges; lower settlement, legal and regulatory costs related to proceedings involving MMC and certain of its subsidiaries; and lower costs related to employee retention awards, partly offset by higher compensation costs, primarily in the consulting segment due to increased headcount and higher incentive compensation. Expenses in 2006 also reflect lower amortization of prepaid dealer commissions and lower costs related to professional liability claims. Expenses in 2005 include a charge of $37 million for Putnam’s estimate of costs to address issues relating to the calculation of certain amounts previously paid to Putnam by the Putnam mutual funds in the form of cost reimbursements to Putnam for transfer agency services relating to defined contribution operations. These decreases in 2006 were partly offset by higher expenses related to stock options. Due to the adoption of SFAS 123(R) on July 1, 2005, the prior year includes expenses related to stock options for only six months while 2006 includes stock option expense for the full year. In 2006, the costs related to stock options are included in segment results. In 2005, the costs related to stock options are included in Corporate. Consolidated operating expenses in 2005 decreased 4% from 2004. This was primarily due to savings from restructuring initiatives and lower regulatory and other settlement expenses, partly offset by employee retention costs, the impact of acquisitions, higher benefits costs, and incremental costs, primarily related to stock options, resulting from the implementation of SFAS 123 (R). In addition, Putnam’s expenses in 2005 include a charge of $37 million for the estimated cost necessary to address issues relating to the calculation of certain amounts previously paid to Putnam by the Putnam mutual funds in the form of cost reimbursements to Putnam for transfer agency services relating to defined contribution operations. Expenses in 2004 include an $850 million charge related to the NYAG/NYSID settlement, costs of $224 million related to Putnam’s settlement and agreements with the SEC and Office of the Secretary of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts and restructuring costs of $337 million, partly offset by a $105 million credit from the final insurance settlement related to World Trade Center losses. Restructuring and Related Activities MMC initiated restructuring activities in the first quarter of 2005 (the “2005 Plan”) and the third quarter of 2006 (the “2006 Plan”). In 2006 we incurred net restructuring costs of $87 million and related charges of $38 million from actions taken under these restructuring plans. The costs and annualized savings relating to the plans are discussed below. 2005 Plan MMC’s actions under the 2005 Plan are complete. MMC is currently realizing annualized savings of approximately $400 million attributable to the 2005 Plan relating primarily to the risk and insurance services segment. In early 2006, MMC began implementing its plan to eliminate excess space in its corporate headquarters building in mid-town New York (“headquarters building”). Costs related to its headquarters building incurred through June 30, 2006 (approximately $40 million) and savings generated from those actions (approximately $10 million) were recognized as part of the 2005 Plan. 2006 Plan In September 2006, MMC announced cost savings initiatives related to firm-wide infrastructure, organization structure and operating company business processes which are expected to result in annualized savings of approximately $350 million when fully implemented by the end of 2008, and result in restructuring charges and related costs of approximately $225 million. The cost savings 31 initiatives are expected to be implemented in several phases – Phase 1 began in September 2006, with several additional phases to follow. The discussion below identifies the areas impacted and savings expected from various phases of the 2006 Plan. Phase 1 of the 2006 Plan is expected to result in cost savings of $160 million. The expected savings from this phase comprise $70 million from operating company process improvements and $90 million from corporate infrastructure and process improvements in IT, real estate and corporate functions. Staff reductions of more than 750 are expected. During 2006, MMC recorded a net charge of $10 million in connection with actions taken under Phase 1 that includes a $74 million gain on the sale of five floors in MMC’s headquarters building, more than offset by costs primarily related to severance and exit costs for facilities. Through December 2006, the actions under Phase 1 are expected to result in annualized savings of approximately $110 million beginning in the first quarter of 2007. These actions under Phase 1 are expected to be completed by the second quarter of 2007, except for certain actions related to MMC’s headquarters building, discussed below. As part of its ongoing review of operations, Marsh has identified additional actions that are expected to result in the reduction of 170 positions (“Phase 2”). These actions are expected to increase the expected annualized savings from the 2006 Plan by approximately $40 million and result in additional charges of approximately $40 million related to severance and exit costs for facilities. In the fourth quarter of 2006, MMC incurred costs of $14 million related to this second phase of the 2006 Plan. MMC currently expects additional annualized savings of $190 million under one or more future phases of the 2006 Plan, resulting from infrastructure improvements in information technology, procurement, human resources, finance and real estate, as well as organizational structure and business process improvements. Detailed plans relating to these future phases are not yet complete, and may impact the amount of expected savings, expected costs or both that will result from these planned actions. Savings from these additional phases are expected to be realized as the actions are implemented through the end of 2008. As noted above, MMC has been reducing its occupancy at its headquarters building in New York. Phase 1 of the 2006 Plan includes net costs of $8 million and expected annualized savings of approximately $25 million related to these actions. The expected net costs of $8 million comprise both gains on the sale of owned floors and losses on sub-leases of leased floors, which will be recognized at the earlier of when the floors are vacated or when sub-lease agreements are executed. During the fourth quarter of 2006, MMC sold its condominium interest in five floors of its headquarters building, realizing a gain of $74 million. The disposal of these floors is an integral part of MMC’s overall restructuring plan and the gain from this disposal has been included as a reduction of other operating expenses, consistent with the classification of other costs for actions taken related to this and other facilities MMC has vacated. The sale of the five floors will reduce MMC’s annual facilities costs by approximately $5 million, which is included in the $110 million of savings from Phase 1 of the 2006 Plan, as discussed above. MMC expects to vacate an additional seven floors, five of which it leases and expects to sub-lease and two of which it owns and expects to lease to a third party. Additional costs of $60 million are expected from these remaining actions, which are expected to generate annualized savings of $20 million when completed over the next 12-18 months. Businesses Exited in 2006 and 2005 In December 2006, Kroll completed the sale of KSI, its international security operation that provided high-risk asset and personal protection services. The financial results of KSI are included in discontinued operations. In the first quarter of 2006, MMC determined that Price Forbes, its U.K.-based insurance wholesale operation, met the criteria for classification as a discontinued operation. The 2006 results of Price Forbes, which includes a charge to reduce the carrying amount of its assets to fair value less cost to 32 sell, are included in discontinued operations in the consolidated statement of income. The prior year’s amounts have not been restated because the results of Price Forbes were insignificant to MMC’s 2005 results. MMC completed the sale of Price Forbes in September 2006. In October 2005, Marsh completed the sale of Crump Group, Inc., its U.S.-based wholesale insurance broker. The gain on the sale was recognized in the fourth quarter of 2005. In December 2005 MMC agreed to sell its majority interest in Sedgwick CMS Holdings (“SCMS”). The sale of SCMS was completed on January 31, 2006, and the associated gain on the sale was recognized in the first quarter of 2006. Crump and SCMS are classified as discontinued operations in the accompanying financial statements. In May 2005, MMC sold the assets of MMC Capital, which had been MMC’s private equity management subsidiary, to Stone Point Capital LLC (“Stone Point”), an entity controlled by the former managers of MMC Capital for approximately $3 million. At the time of the asset sale, Stone Point assumed responsibility for management of the Trident Funds and other private equity funds previously managed by MMC Capital. MMC does not participate in the investment decisions or management of Stone Point or the private equity funds managed by Stone Point. MMC, through its subsidiary Risk Capital Holdings, continues to own investments in firms such as Ace Ltd., XL Capital Ltd. and Axis Capital Holdings, Ltd., as well as its investments in the Trident II and other funds managed by Stone Point. Subsequent Event On January 31, 2007, MMC entered into a stock purchase agreement with Great-West Lifeco Inc. (“GWL”), a majority-owned subsidiary of Power Financial Corporation, pursuant to which GWL will purchase Putnam Investments Trust. The sale includes Putnam’s interest in the T.H. Lee private equity business. The after-tax cash proceeds to MMC are expected to be approximately $2.5 billion, subject to possible adjustment based on (i) changes in Putnam’s adjusted stockholders’ equity between September 30, 2006 and closing and (ii) any decline below an agreed threshold in Putnam’s adjusted asset management revenue between December 31, 2006 and closing. For further information and a copy of the stock purchase agreement, please see our Form 8-K filed on February 1, 2007. MMC expects the sale of Putnam to close in mid-2007. Putnam is classified as part of continuing operations in this annual report because the decision to sell Putnam was not made until after December 31, 2006 and Putnam did not meet the criteria to be classified as a discontinued operation in 2006. We expect to classify Putnam as a discontinued operation in the first quarter of 2007. Risk and Insurance Services In the Risk and Insurance Services segment, MMC’s subsidiaries and other affiliated entities act as brokers, agents or consultants for insureds, insurance underwriters and other brokers in the areas of risk management, insurance broking and insurance program management services, primarily under the name of Marsh; and engage in reinsurance broking, catastrophe and financial modeling services and related advisory functions, primarily under the name of Guy Carpenter. Marsh and Guy Carpenter are compensated for brokerage and consulting services primarily through fees paid by clients and/or commissions paid out of premiums charged by insurance and reinsurance companies. Commission rates vary in amount depending upon the type of insurance or reinsurance coverage provided, the particular insurer or reinsurer, the capacity in which the broker acts and negotiations with clients. Revenues are affected by premium rate levels in the insurance/reinsurance markets, since compensation is frequently related to the premiums paid by insureds/reinsureds. In many cases, compensation may be negotiated in advance on the basis of the estimated value of the services to be performed. Revenue is also affected by fluctuations in the amount of risk retained by insurance and reinsurance clients themselves and by increases or decreases in the value of the risks that have been insured, new and lost business, and the volume of business from new and existing clients. 33 Effective October 1, 2004, Marsh eliminated contingent compensation, or market services agreements with insurers, under which it had received revenues based upon such factors as the overall volume, growth and, in some cases, profitability, of the total business placed by Marsh with a given insurer. For billing and other administrative services, Marsh and Guy Carpenter receive interest income on certain funds (such as premiums and claims proceeds) held in a fiduciary capacity for others. The investment of fiduciary funds is regulated by state and other insurance authorities. These regulations typically provide for segregation of fiduciary funds and limit the types of investments that may be made with them. Interest income from these investments varies depending on the amount of funds invested and applicable interest rates, both of which vary from time to time. Following the sale of MMC Capital’s business in May 2005, we no longer receive fees in connection with the private equity investments previously managed by MMC Capital, nor do we receive management fees or origination fees related to this business, except that MMC retained the right to receive certain performance fees relating to the Trident II private equity partnership. We continue to receive dividends and to recognize capital appreciation or depreciation on the investments held by Risk Capital Holdings, as well as revenue on Risk Capital Holdings’ sales of investments from time to time. The results of operations for the risk and insurance services segment are presented below: (In millions of dollars) 2006 2005 2004 Revenue: Service Revenue $ 5,267 $ 5,412 $ 6,056 Investment Income 196 180 149 Operating Revenue 5,463 5,592 6,205 Expense 4,786 5,287 6,121 Operating Income $ 677 $ 305 $ 84 Operating Margin 12.4 % 5.5 % 1.4 % Revenue Revenue in risk and insurance services decreased 2% in 2006 compared with 2005 and was flat on an underlying basis. Higher revenue in reinsurance services and Risk Capital Holdings was offset by a decrease in insurance services. Underlying revenue at Marsh in 2006 was down 2% as compared to 2005. In 2006, Marsh’s new business grew 10 percent globally with solid growth in all major geographies. However, new business growth was more than offset by decreased market service revenues, which declined to $43 million in 2006 from $114 million in the prior year, and the impact of a softer pricing environment in the property and casualty insurance markets. Effective January 1, 2007, Marsh will manage certain businesses (formerly part of Risk Consulting & Technology) which had revenue of approximately $25 million in 2006. Reinsurance services revenue increased 5%, primarily due to new business growth. Although U.S. property catastrophe reinsurance premium rates were higher, reinsurance premium rates for most other lines were stable to down and the market environment for property catastrophe reinsurance continued to be impacted by limited reinsurer capacity and higher risk retention by clients. Risk Capital Holdings revenue in 2006 was 2% higher compared with 2005. Higher mark-to-market gains, primarily from MMC’s investments in the Trident private equity funds were partly offset by lower realized gains from sales of directly held investments and the the elimination of investment management fees following the sale of MMC Capital’s business in May 2005. Revenue in 2006 increased 7% on an underlying basis due to higher investment gains. We expect revenues related to Risk Capital Holdings to decline in 2007. 34 In December 2006, MMC, through its subsidiary Risk Capital Holdings, contributed its limited partnership interest in Trident III, valued at $182 million, to the U.K. Pension Fund. The transaction was recorded at the estimated fair value of MMC’s investment on the date of the contribution. Risk Capital Holdings’ revenue in 2006 included $38 million of mark-to-market gains for Trident III recognized through the date of the contribution. At December 31, 2006, the balance of accounts receivable related to accrued market services revenue earned prior to October 1, 2004 was approximately $43 million, compared with $132 million at December 31, 2005. MMC intends to collect the remaining MSA revenue earned prior to October 1, 2004, and is seeking to enforce its rights under the contracts to collect amounts due. However, there is no assurance that MMC will be successful in collecting all amounts due. To the extent such accrued amounts are not collected, a charge to earnings would result. In 2007, MMC collected an additional $23 million of accrued market service revenue. Revenue in the risk and insurance services segment decreased 10% in 2005 compared with 2004, reflecting decreases in both insurance services and reinsurance services revenue. In insurance services, underlying revenue decreased 13%. Excluding the impact of decreased market services revenue, underlying revenue decreased 6%, reflecting lower new business volume and lower commercial premium rates. The decrease in underlying revenue was most significant in the United States; however, the percentage decline improved in the fourth quarter compared with earlier quarters in 2005 despite continued premium rate declines in the commercial insurance marketplace. Market services revenue declined from $521 million in 2004 to $114 million in 2005. Expense In 2006, expenses in the risk and insurance services segment decreased 9% compared to the prior year. The decrease reflects cost savings from restructuring; a decrease in restructuring charges from $257 million in 2005 to $100 million in 2006; a decrease of $45 million in settlement, legal and regulatory costs related to market services agreements and associated shareholder and policyholder litigation; and a decrease of $78 million related to employee retention awards. In addition, 2006 expenses reflect lower incentive compensation costs and lower costs related to professional liability claims. Partly offsetting these decreases were costs of $47 million in 2006 related to employee stock options. The operating margin for 2006 improved to 12.4% from 5.5% in 2005. Expenses in the risk and insurance services segment decreased 14% in 2005, compared with the prior year. Expenses in 2004 included a $850 million charge related to the settlement with the NYAG and NYSID. Risk Consulting & Technology MMC’s Risk Consulting & Technology segment primarily consists of Kroll and its subsidiaries, acquired by MMC in July 2004. Kroll services fall into two major product lines: consulting services which includes risk consulting, corporate advisory & restructuring and security; and technology enabled solutions. Kroll receives compensation primarily in the form of fees paid by clients. These fees are typically earned on an hourly, project, fixed fee or per-unit basis. Kroll’s revenue is subject to changes in international economic and regulatory conditions. Some of Kroll’s revenue sources are counter-cyclical to the performance of the economy in general. These sources may include, for example, fees from restructuring, turnaround and forensic engagements relating to commercial bankruptcies and bond defaults. Kroll is also subject to normal competitive forces such as pricing pressures, demand for professional staff and new product development on the part of competitors, particularly in technology services. 35 The results of operations for the risk consulting & technology segment are presented below: (In millions of dollars) 2006 2005 2004 Revenue $ 979 $ 872 $ 371 Expense 830 751 326 Operating Income $ 149 $ 121 $ 45 Operating Margin 15.2 % 13.9 % 12.1 % Revenue Risk consulting & technology revenues increased 12% in 2006 compared with 2005, 9% on an underlying basis. The technology services group, Kroll’s largest business unit, increased revenues by 12%. This unit’s Kroll OnTrack electronic discovery business responded successfully to market conditions and continued its improvement from the first quarter of 2006. The consulting services group reported double-digit growth, primarily due to strong operations performance by corporate advisory and restructuring partially due to success fees on several large engagements. Background screening was driven by strong growth in the identity theft business. In the fourth quarter of 2006, Kroll completed the sale of KSI, its international security operation that provides high-risk asset and personal protection services. The financial results of KSI are included in discontinued operations. Effective January 1, 2007, Kroll will transfer to Marsh certain businesses which had revenue of $25 million in 2006. The year-to-year comparisons of the segment’s revenue between 2005 and 2004 are significantly impacted by the fact that we acquired Kroll in July 2004. As a result, 2004 results include only six months of Kroll’s operations. Underlying revenue growth in 2005 was 22% due to growth in the technology services, corporate advisory and restructuring and background screening practices. Expense Risk consulting & technology expenses increased 11% in 2006 compared with 2005. Approximately half of the increase results from acquisitions and the impact of foreign currency fluctuation. The remaining increase reflects higher compensation in the corporate advisory and restructuring and the background screening businesses, as well as increased costs for outside services in the background screening business due to a higher volume of business. Expenses in 2006 include amortization of identified intangibles of $57 million. In addition, expenses in 2006 include a credit related to the early termination of a licensing agreement. The year-to-year comparisons of the segment’s expenses between 2005 and 2004 are significantly impacted by the fact that we acquired Kroll in July 2004. As a result, 2004 results include only six months of Kroll’s operations. Expenses include amortization of identified intangible assets of $58 million and $24 million in 2005 and 2004, respectively. Consulting MMC conducts business in its Consulting segment through Mercer Inc. and its subsidiaries and affiliates. Mercer operates through two main business groups. Mercer Human Resource Consulting (“Mercer HR”) includes practice groups specializing in retirement and investments, outsourcing, health and benefits and talent. The Mercer Specialty Consulting Businesses focus on management consulting, organizational design and change management, and economic consulting. The major component of Mercer’s revenue, in both Mercer HR and the Mercer Specialty Consulting Companies, is fees paid by clients for advice and services. Mercer HR, principally through its health & benefits line of business, also earns significant revenue in the form of commissions received from insurance companies for the placement of group (and occasionally individual) insurance contracts, 36 primarily life, health and accident coverages. Revenue for Mercer global investment’s discretionary investment management business and certain of Mercer HR’s outsourcing business defined contribution administration services consists principally of fees based on assets under administration. Revenue in the consulting business is affected by, among other things, global economic conditions, including changes in clients’ particular industries and markets. Revenue is also subject to competition due to the introduction of new products and services, broad trends in employee demographics, the effect of government policies and regulations, and fluctuations in interest and foreign exchange rates. Revenues from the provision of discretionary investment management services and retirement trust and administrative services are significantly affected by securities market performance. The results of operations for the consulting segment are presented below: (In millions of dollars) 2006 2005 2004 Revenue: Service Revenue $ 4,224 $ 3,802 $ 3,637 Investment Income 1 — — Operating Revenue 4,225 3,802 3,637 Expense 3,759 3,351 3,228 Operating Income $ 466 $ 451 $ 409 Operating Margin 11.0 % 11.9 % 11.2 % Revenue Consulting revenue in 2006 increased 11% compared with 2005. Revenue in Mercer HR increased 8%, or 7% on an underlying basis driven by strong growth in retirement and investments, and talent. Mercer Specialty Consulting revenues grew 19%, 16% on an underlying basis. Each of the Mercer Specialty companies contributed to this performance, led by Mercer Oliver Wyman which increased underlying revenues 22%. Consulting revenue in 2005 increased 4% compared with 2004. On an underlying basis, revenue increased 3%, due to a 18% increase in Mercer Specialty Consulting, while Mercer HR decreased 1% versus prior year. The increase in underlying revenue in Mercer Specialty reflected increases of 24% in management consulting, reflecting a 25% increase in Mercer Oliver Wyman, and 6% in economic consulting. Within Mercer HR, underlying revenue decreased 1%, reflecting a decline in the revenue associated with defined contribution plan assets previously administered by Putnam and transferred to Mercer effective January 1, 2005, increased pricing competition on traditional actuarial valuation services, and a decline in the employee benefits business transferred from Marsh to Mercer. These declines were partly offset by strong growth in talent. Expense Consulting expenses increased 12% in 2006 compared with 2005. The expense increase reflects restructuring charges of $27 million, the impact of acquisitions and higher compensation costs due in part to increased staff levels. In addition, expenses in 2006 include costs of $41 million related to employee stock options. Consulting expenses increased 4% in 2005 compared with 2004. On an underlying basis, expenses increased 3%, as savings from restructuring activity and lower costs for restructuring were offset by employee retention costs, increased benefits costs and higher expenses in Specialty Consulting due to a higher volume of business. 37 Investment Management MMC conducts business in its Investment Management segment through Putnam. Putnam provides investment management and related services through a broad range of investment products, including the Putnam Funds, its own family of mutual funds which are offered to individual and institutional investors. In support of the primary investment management business, Putnam subsidiaries provide other related services including transfer agency, underwriting, distribution, shareholder services, custodial, trustee and other fiduciary services. Putnam Fiduciary Trust Company (“PFTC”) serves as transfer agent, dividend disbursing agent, registrar and custodian for the Putnam Funds and provides custody services to several external clients. On January 31, 2007, MMC entered into a stock purchase agreement with Great-West Lifeco Inc. (“GWL”), a majority-owned subsidiary of Power Financial Corporation, pursuant to which GWL will purchase Putnam Investments Trust. MMC expects the sale of Putnam to close in mid-2007. Putnam is classified as part of continuing operations in this annual report because the decision to sell Putnam was not made until after December 31, 2006 and Putnam did not meet the criteria to be classified as a discontinued operation in 2006. We expect to classify Putnam as a discontinued operation in the first quarter of 2007. Putnam’s revenue is derived primarily from investment management and 12b-1 fees (described more fully below) received from the Putnam Funds and investment management fees for institutional accounts. Putnam also receives fees from the Putnam Funds for administrative services performed by PFTC. Putnam companies receive fees for the investment management services provided to the Putnam Funds and institutional accounts pursuant to investment advisory contracts under which the mutual fund or institutional investor pays fees to the Putnam company that manages the fund or account. The amount of the fees varies depending on the individual mutual fund or institutional account. Fees are usually based on a sliding scale in relation to assets under management, and, in some cases are also based on investment performance. These advisory contracts generally may be terminated by either party without penalty, and contracts with the Putnam Funds must be approved annually by the fund’s shareholders or trustees, including a majority who are not affiliated with Putnam. Putnam management and the fund trustees regularly review the Putnam Fund contract fee structures in light of fund performance, the level and range of services provided, and current industry conditions. Investment management revenues depend largely on the total value and composition of Putnam’s assets under management. Assets under management are particularly affected by fluctuations in domestic and international stock and bond market prices, and the net level of investments and withdrawals by current and new mutual fund shareholders and institutional clients. Items affecting revenue also include, but are not limited to, actual and relative investment performance, service to clients, the development and marketing of new investment products, the relative attractiveness of Putnam’s investment styles under prevailing market conditions, changes in the investment patterns of fund shareholders and institutional clients and Putnam’s ability to maintain investment management and administrative fees at current levels. All open-end Putnam funds other than money market funds have adopted distribution plans pursuant to Rule 12b-1 under the Investment Company Act of 1940, commonly referred to as 12b-1 plans. Pursuant to these 12b-1 plans, the Putnam Funds make payments to Putnam Retail Management (“PRM”) to cover costs relating to distribution of the Putnam Funds and services provided to shareholders, at rates that differ by class of fund shares. These payments, known as Rule 12b-1 fees, enable PRM to pay service fees and other continuing compensation to firms that distribute shares of the Putnam Funds and provide services to fund shareholders. PRM retains some Rule 12b-1 fees as compensation for the costs of distribution and other services provided by Putnam and its affiliates to shareholders and for commissions advanced by Putnam at the point of sale (and recovered through fees received over time) 38 to firms that distribute shares of the Putnam Funds. These 12b-1 plans, and Rule 12b-1 fees paid by the Putnam Funds thereunder, are subject to annual renewal by the fund trustees and to termination by vote of the fund shareholders or by vote of a majority of the trustees who are not affiliated with Putnam. PFTC receives compensation from the Putnam Funds for its administrative (transfer agency and shareholder services) and custodial services pursuant to, respectively, investor servicing agreements which may be terminated by either party on 90 days’ notice, and pursuant to written custody agreements which may be terminated by either party on 30 days’ notice. These contracts generally provide for compensation on the basis of several factors which vary with the type of service being provided. The transfer agent servicing fee received by PFTC is a fixed rate per account for retail shareholders and a fixed rate service fee based on assets under management for mutual fund defined contribution shareholders. The results of operations for the investment management segment are presented below: (In millions of dollars) 2006 2005 2004 Revenue: Service Revenue $ 1,360 $ 1,503 $ 1,659 Investment Income 25 3 51 Operating Revenue 1,385 1,506 1,710 Expense 1,082 1,243 1,612 Operating Income $ 303 $ 263 $ 98 Operating Margin 21.9 % 17.5 % 5.7 % Revenue Putnam’s revenue declined 8% in 2006 compared to 2005 due to a decrease in management fees resulting from a decline in average assets under management, lower 12b-1 fee revenue and lower transfer agency fees, partly offset by higher investment income. Assets under management averaged $186 billion in 2006, a 5% decline from the $196 billion managed in the same period of 2005. Assets under management aggregated $192 billion at December 31, 2006. The increase in assets under management since December 31, 2005 results from a $19 billion positive impact of market and investment performance partly offset by net outflows of $16 billion. Net flows for the fourth quarter of 2006 were neutral. As of February 23, 2007, year-to-date net outflows were approximately $5 billion. At December 31, 2006, assets held in equity securities represented 66% of assets under management compared with 68% in 2005 and 69% in 2004, while investments in fixed income products represented 34% compared with 32% in 2005 and 31% in 2004. Putnam’s revenue decreased 12% in 2005, reflecting a decrease in fees due to a decline in assets under management, lower 12b-1 fee revenue, and decreased investment gains. Assets under management averaged $196 billion in 2005, a 10% decline from the $217 billion managed in 2004. Assets under management aggregated $189 billion at December 31, 2005, compared with $213 billion at December 31, 2004. The change in assets under management from December 31, 2004 results primarily from net redemptions of $31 billion, partly offset by the positive impact of market performance. Putnam receives service fees from the Putnam mutual funds for transfer agent, custody, and other administrative services, as contracted by the Trustees of the Putnam mutual funds. Effective January 2005, the transfer agent service fee agreement was converted to a fixed rate per retail shareholder account and a fixed rate service fee based on average assets under management for mutual fund assets in defined contribution plans. For the first six months of 2004, the transfer agent service fee agreement was based on the reimbursement of the cost of service. For the third and fourth quarters 39 of 2004, transfer agent service fees were based on a fixed fee and recorded as revenue. The change in the service fee agreement resulted in an increase in both service fee revenue and expense of approximately $32 million in 2005 compared with 2004. Year-end and average assets under management are presented below: (In billions of dollars) 2006 2005 2004 Mutual Funds Growth Equity $ 26 $ 31 $ 38 Value Equity 37 37 41 Blend Equity 28 26 28 Fixed Income 33 32 36 124 126 143 Institutional: Equity 36 34 40 Fixed Income 32 29 30 68 63 70 Year-end Assets $ 192 $ 189 $ 213 Assets from Non-US Investors $ 36 $ 32 $ 38 Assets in Prime Money Market Funds $ 4 $ 1 $ — Average Assets $ 186 $ 196 $ 217 Components of year-to-date change in ending assets under management: Net Redemptions including Dividends Reinvested $ (16 ) $ (31 ) $ (51 ) Impact of PanAgora acquisition $ — $ — $ 8 Impact of Market/Performance $ 19 $ 7 $ 16 The categories of mutual fund assets reflect style designations aligned with each fund’s prospectus. Expense Expenses in 2006 decreased $161 million from 2005, due to a decrease in amortization expense for prepaid dealer commissions and the year-over-year effect of a $37 million charge in 2005 relating to costs to address issues associated with the calculation of certain amounts previously paid to Putnam by Putnam mutual funds in the form of cost reimbursements to Putnam for transfer agency services relating to defined contribution operations. Partly offsetting these decreases were costs of $14 million related to employee stock options. Expenses for 2005 decreased 23% from 2004. Expenses in 2005 include a $37 million charge, described above. Expenses in 2004 include a charge of $224 million related to Putnam’s regulatory settlements with the SEC and the Secretary of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts on market-timing issues. Other expense reductions in 2005 include lower compensation and severance costs, reduced costs related to regulatory issues, a decrease in amortization expense for prepaid dealer commissions and a decrease in restructuring charges. These reductions were partially offset by an increase in expenses previously borne by the funds under the prior transfer agent service agreement. Putnam’s expenses in 2004 include a $25 million credit to compensation expense associated with the settlement with Putnam’s former chief executive officer. 40 Corporate Items Corporate Expenses Corporate expenses of $137 million in 2006 were $150 million lower than in 2005. The decrease is primarily due to the impact of stock option expense, which was recorded as a corporate charge in 2005 and was charged to the business segments in 2006, and lower net restructuring charges, largely resulting from a gain on the disposal of five floors in MMC’s headquarters building, partly offset by higher professional services fees. In 2006, MMC corporate recorded a net credit of $31 million for restructuring and related charges. A $74 million gain on the sale of five floors in MMC’s headquarters building was partly offset by future rent on non-cancelable leases for floors vacated by MMC as well as accelerated amortization/depreciation related to floors that have been or will be vacated as part of the restructuring. The sale of these floors is an integral part of MMC’s overall restructuring plan and the gain from this disposal has been included as a reduction of other operating expense, consistent with the classification of other actions taken related to facilities MMC has vacated. In 2005, MMC corporate recorded $72 million of restructuring and related charges, primarily related to the consolidation of office space in London. Corporate expenses were $287 million in 2005 compared to $39 million in 2004. Expenses in 2005 included $64 million of incremental expenses, primarily related to stock options, resulting from the adoption of SFAS 123 (R) effective July 1, 2005. The incremental cost related to the implementation of SFAS 123 (R) was charged to corporate and not to the operating segments in 2005. In addition, $6 million was recorded for severance and other termination benefits related to the 2005 Plan, and a charge of $49 million was recorded related to the consolidation of office space in London. Because the office consolidation was initiated by MMC to benefit its London operations as a whole, the related charge was recorded in corporate. Corporate expenses also reflected $30 million of charges in connection with the resolution of certain litigation and related matters. Corporate expenses in 2004 included $18 million of restructuring costs, including severance and other termination benefits, future rent under non-cancelable leases and lease termination costs. The impact of the final settlement for insured losses related to the WTC reduced Corporate expenses in 2004. The replacement value of the assets exceeded their book value by $105 million which was recorded as a reduction of other operating expenses. Interest Interest income earned on corporate funds amounted to $64 million in 2006, an increase of $17 million from 2005. The increase in interest income reflected the combination of higher average corporate cash balances and generally higher average interest rates in 2006 compared with the prior year. Interest expense of $303 million in 2006 decreased from $332 million in 2005. The decrease in interest expense is primarily due to $34 million recorded in the third quarter of 2005 for the prepayment charge incurred in connection with the refinancing of the mortgage on MMC’s headquarters building in New York. Interest income was $47 million for 2005, an increase of $26 million from 2004. The increase in interest income reflected the combination of higher average corporate cash balances and generally higher average interest rates in 2005 compared with 2004. Interest expense was $332 million in 2005 compared to $219 million in 2004. The increase in interest expense is due to an increase in the amount of average outstanding debt resulting from the acquisition of Kroll and a $34 million charge in 2005 for the prepayment of the $200 million mortgage on MMC’s corporate headquarters in New York. In addition, interest expense in 2005 includes a write-off of $7 million of unamortized deferred financing costs related to MMC’s prior revolving credit agreements which were refinanced in December 2005. 41 Income Taxes MMC’s consolidated effective tax rate was 31.8% in 2006 compared to 33.7% in 2005. The change primarily reflects the release of valuation allowances on certain deferred tax assets and the resolution of tax audit issues, partly offset by an adjustment of the 2005 tax provision estimates to the tax return amount. MMC’s consolidated effective tax rate was 33.7% in 2005, a decrease from 59.4% in 2004. The decrease in the rate was primarily due to the impact in 2004 of the non-deductibility of Putnam’s $224 million in regulatory settlements and of a lower benefit related to Marsh’s $850 million settlement of the NYAG lawsuit; partially offset in 2005 by an increase in valuation allowances provided on net operating losses in certain state and foreign jurisdictions. The effective tax rate is sensitive to the geographic mix of MMC’s earnings, which may have a favorable or unfavorable impact on the rate. Furthermore, losses in certain jurisdictions cannot be offset by earnings from other operations, and may require valuation allowances affecting the rate, depending on estimates of their realizability. MMC establishes allowances for potential liabilities that may arise out of tax audits and litigation to the extent that such liabilities are probable and can be estimated in accordance with SFAS No. 5. Once established, allowances are evaluated based on the facts and circumstances that exist at each reporting period. Adjustments may result, for example, upon resolution of an issue with the taxing authorities, or expiration of a statute of limitations barring an assessment for an issue for which an allowance had previously been recorded. Such adjustments could have a material impact on MMC’s effective tax rate, net income, and cash flows in a particular future period. 2005 Stock Option Exchanges At the May 2005 Annual Meeting, MMC’s shareholders approved a stock option exchange offer for MMC options. Under the exchange offer, eligible employees could exchange certain deeply underwater options for new options with an estimated fair value equal to 90% of the value of options surrendered in exchange, calculated using the Black-Scholes pricing model. Effective July 1, 2005, employees elected to exchange 42 million options for 16 million new options. The exchange resulted in the retirement of 26 million options and no incremental compensation expense was incurred in connection with the new option grants. The exercise price of the new options of $27.86 is equal to the market price of MMC’s common stock as of the new grant date. The new options were unvested when granted and will vest on the later of the second anniversary of the new option grant or the vesting date of the tendered option. The other terms and conditions of the new options are substantially similar to those of the tendered options they replaced. On September 29, 2005, certain eligible participants in the Putnam Investments Trust Equity Partnership Plan participated in a voluntary option exchange pursuant to the terms of the Offer to Exchange Certain Outstanding Options (the “Offer to Exchange”), dated August 30, 2005. Under the Offer to Exchange, holders of options on Class B shares meeting certain eligibility requirements could elect to exchange those options for restricted shares with the equivalent value of the exchanged options, as determined using the Black-Scholes valuation model. As a result of the Offer to Exchange, a total of 2,201,850 options were retired and 139,388 restricted shares were issued at a grant price of $28.26 per share. Liquidity and Capital Resources MMC’s routine liquidity needs are primarily for servicing debt and paying dividends on outstanding stock. Our primary source for meeting these requirements is cash flows from our operations. Cash on our consolidated balance sheets includes funds available for general corporate purposes. Funds held on behalf of clients in a fiduciary capacity are segregated and shown separately in the consolidated balance sheet as an offset to fiduciary liabilities. 42 Operating Cash Flows MMC generated $878 million of cash from operations in 2006 compared with $399 million in 2005. These amounts reflect the net income earned by MMC during those periods, excluding gains or losses from the disposition of businesses, the gain on the sale of five floors from the MMC headquarters building and adjusted for non-cash charges and changes in working capital which relate, primarily, to the timing of payments for accrued liabilities or receipts of assets. These include payments in 2006 of approximately $270 million for regulatory settlements and tax payments of $136 million related to the disposition of businesses. Cash generated from the disposition of businesses is included in investing cash flows. In January 2005 MMC reached a settlement with the NYAG and NYSID that resolved the actions commenced by them against MMC and Marsh. As a result of this agreement, MMC recorded a charge in 2004 for an $850 million policyholder fund. MMC paid the first $255 million to the fund on June 1, 2005. An additional $255 million was paid on June 1, 2006, and $170 million will be paid to the fund on or before each of June 1, 2007 and 2008, respectively. These amounts are included in Regulatory settlements in the consolidated balance sheets. MMC has funding requirements for the U.S. non-qualified and non-U.S. pension plans in 2007 of approximately $19 million and $176 million, respectively. MMC’s policy for funding its tax qualified defined benefit retirement plans is to contribute amounts at least sufficient to meet the funding requirements set forth in U.S. and applicable foreign law. There currently is no ERISA funding requirement for the U.S. qualified plan in 2006 or in 2007. Funding requirements for non-U.S. plans vary country by country. Contribution rates are determined by the local actuaries based on local funding practices and requirements. Funding amounts may be influenced by future asset performance, discount rates and other variables impacting the assets and/or liabilities of the plan. In addition, amounts funded in the future, to the extent not due under regulatory requirements, may be affected by alternative uses of MMC’s cash flows, including dividends, investments, and share repurchases. During 2006, MMC contributed approximately $20 million to the U.S. pension plans and $319 million to the significant non-U.S. pension plans, compared with $229 million for U.S. plans and $498 million for significant non-U.S. plans in 2005. The contribution to the non-U.S. plans in 2006 includes a non-cash contribution of MMC’s investment in Trident III, a private equity limited partnership. The contribution was recorded based on the estimated fair value on the date of the contribution of $182 million. Financing Cash Flows Net cash used for financing activities was $759 million in 2006 compared with $128 million of net cash provided by financing activities in 2005. During 2006, MMC reduced outstanding debt by approximately $570 million. In December 2005, MMC and certain of its foreign subsidiaries entered into a new $1.2 billion multi-currency revolving credit facility. Subsidiary borrowings under the facility are unconditionally guaranteed by MMC. The facility, which will expire in December 2010, replaced MMC’s $1.0 billion and $700 million revolving credit facilities which were scheduled to expire in 2007 and 2009, respectively. In December 2005, certain of MMC’s foreign subsidiaries borrowed approximately $510 million under the new facility, primarily to fund the repatriation of accumulated earnings pursuant to the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004. There was $94 million outstanding under this facility at December 31, 2006. In September 2005, MMC issued $550 million of 5.15% senior notes due 2010 and $750 million of 5.75% senior notes due 2015 (the “2005 Notes”). The net proceeds from the 2005 Notes were used to pay down the $1.3 billion term loan facility established in late 2004. 43 Also in September 2005, MMC refinanced its headquarters building in New York City by entering into a 30-year, $475 million mortgage loan agreement at a fixed annual rate of 5.7%. This replaced the existing $200 million, 9.8% mortgage due in 2009. The incremental proceeds, net of a $34 million prepayment charge, were used to pay down outstanding short-term debt. MMC’s senior debt is currently rated Baa2 by Moody’s and BBB by Standard & Poor’s. MMC’s short-term debt is currently rated P-2 by Moody’s and A-2 by Standard & Poor’s. MMC carries a negative outlook from both Moody’s and Standard & Poor’s. MMC paid total dividends of $374 million in 2006 ($0.68 per share) and $363 million ($0.68 per share) in 2005. MMC made no share repurchases in 2006. In January 2007, MMC announced that its board of directors had approved an increase to MMC’s quarterly cash dividend to 19 cents per share from 17 cents previously. MMC also maintains other credit facilities, guarantees and letters of credit with various banks, primarily related to operations located outside the United States, aggregating $270 million at December 31, 2006 and $354 million at December 31, 2005. There was $8 million outstanding under these facilities at December 31, 2006. Investing Cash Flows Net cash used for investing activities amounted to $136 million in 2006 compared with $153 million of net cash provided by investing activities in 2005. Cash generated by the sale of SCMS totaled $326 million in 2006, which was partly offset by net purchases of long term investments. Cash used for acquisitions totaled $221 million in 2006 versus $74 million in 2005. Remaining deferred cash payments of approximately $75 million related to acquisitions completed in 2006 and prior years are recorded in Accounts payable and accrued liabilities or in Other liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets at December 31, 2006. Proceeds from sales related to fixed assets and capitalized software includes $125 million of proceeds related to the sale of the floors from the MMC headquarters building. In addition, cash used to purchase investments of $193 million was partly offset by the sale of securities of $118 million in 2006. In 2005, cash generated by the sale of securities totaled $333 million. MMC expects the after tax proceeds from the anticipated sale of Putnam in mid-2007 to approach $2.5 billion, subject to certain adjustments in the sale agreement. MMC will analyze various alternatives for use of the expected proceeds including acquisitions, adjustments to our capital structure, such as debt repayment and/or share repurchases, and investments in our existing businesses. MMC’s additions to fixed assets and capitalized software, which amounted to $307 million in 2006 and $345 million in 2005, primarily relate to computer equipment purchases, the refurbishing and modernizing of office facilities and software development costs. MMC has committed to potential future investments of approximately $222 million in connection with various private equity funds and other MMC investments. The commitment comprises $82 million related to Trident II and other funds managed by Stone Point and $140 million related to possible investments by Putnam. At December 31, 2006, MMC has no future commitments related to Trident III, as those commitments were assumed by MMC’s U.K. pension plan when the investment in Trident III was contributed to the plan in December 2006. The majority of MMC’s other investment commitments for funds managed by Stone Point are related to Trident II, the investment period for which is now closed for new investments. Any remaining capital calls for Trident II would relate to follow-on investments in existing portfolio companies or for management fees or other partnership expenses. Significant future capital calls related to Trident II are not expected. Although it is anticipated that Trident II will be harvesting its remaining portfolio in 2007 and thereafter, the timing of any portfolio company sales and capital distributions is unknown and not controlled by MMC. 44 Putnam has investment commitments of $140 million for three active Thomas H. Lee (“THL”) funds, of which Putnam believes approximately $42 million will not be called. Putnam is authorized to commit to invest up to $187 million in future THL investment funds, but is not required to do so. At December 31, 2006 none of that additional $187 million is committed. These commitments will remain with Putnam when the anticipated sale of Putnam closes. Approximately $37 million was invested in 2006 related to all of the commitments discussed above (including investments in Trident III prior to its contribution to MMC’s U.K. pension plan). Commitments and Obligations MMC’s contractual obligations were comprised of the following as of December 31, 2006 (dollars in millions): Payment due by Period Within 1-3 4-5 After Contractual Obligations Total 1 Year Years Years 5 Years Bank Borrowings-International $ 8 $ 8 $ — $ — $ — Current portion of long-term debt 1,103 1,103 — — — Long-term debt 3,865 — 669 566 2,630 NYAG/NYSID settlement 340 170 170 — — Net operating leases 3,472 462 762 566 1,682 Service agreements 451 129 182 99 41 Other long-term obligations 86 73 10 2 1 Total $ 9,325 $ 1,945 $ 1,793 $ 1,233 $ 4,354 Market Risk Certain of MMC’s revenues, expenses, assets and liabilities are exposed to the impact of interest rate changes and fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates and equity markets. Interest Rate RiskMMC manages its net exposure to interest rate changes by utilizing a mixture of variable and fixed rate borrowings to finance MMC’s asset base. MMC uses interest rate swaps on a limited basis to manage exposure to interest rate movements on its cash and investments as well as interest expense on borrowings. Rate swaps are only executed with highly creditworthy counterparties. MMC had the following investments and debt instruments subject to variable interest rates: December 31, (In millions of dollars) 2006 Cash and cash equivalents invested in certificates of deposit and time deposits (Note 1) $ 2,089 Fiduciary cash and investments (Note 1) $ 3,704 Variable rate debt outstanding (Note 11) $ 601 These investments and debt instruments are discussed more fully in the above-indicated notes to the consolidated financial statements. Based on the above balances, if short-term interest rates increase by 10% or 48 basis points over the course of the year, annual interest income, including interest earned on fiduciary funds, would increase by approximately $15 million. However, this would be partially offset by a $2 million increase in interest expense resulting in a net increase to income before income taxes and minority interest of $13 million. 45 Foreign Currency RiskThe translated values of revenue and expense from MMC’s international risk and insurance services and consulting operations are subject to fluctuations due to changes in currency exchange rates. We periodically use forward contracts and options to limit foreign currency exchange rate exposure on net income and cash flows for specific, clearly defined transactions arising in the ordinary course of business. Equity Price RiskMMC holds investments in public and private companies, as well as in certain private equity funds managed by Stone Point. Publicly traded investments of $124 million are classified as available for sale under SFAS No. 115. Non-publicly traded investments of $75 million are accounted for using the cost method and $366 million are accounted for using the equity method under APB Opinion No. 18, “The Equity Method of Accounting for Investments in Common Stock”. Changes in value of trading securities are recognized in income when they occur. The investments that are classified as available for sale or that are not publicly traded are subject to risk of changes in market value, which if determined to be other than temporary, could result in realized impairment losses. MMC periodically reviews the carrying value of such investments to determine if any valuation adjustments are appropriate under the applicable accounting pronouncements. OtherA significant number of lawsuits and regulatory proceedings are pending. See Note 16 to the consolidated financial statements. Management’s Discussion of Critical Accounting Policies The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (“GAAP”) requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue and expenses, and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. Management considers the policies discussed below to be critical to understanding MMC’s financial statements because their application places the most significant demands on management’s judgment, and requires management to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain. Actual results may differ from those estimates. Legal and Other Loss ContingenciesMMC and its subsidiaries are subject to numerous claims, lawsuits and proceedings. GAAP requires that liabilities for contingencies be recorded when it is probable that a liability has been incurred before the balance sheet date and the amount can be reasonably estimated. Significant management judgment is required to comply with this guidance. MMC analyzes its litigation exposure based on available information, including consultation with outside counsel handling the defense of these matters, to assess its potential liability. In addition, to the extent that insurance coverage is available, significant management judgment is required to determine the amount of recoveries that are expected under MMC’s various insurance programs. Retirement BenefitsMMC maintains qualified and non-qualified defined benefit pension plans for its U.S. and a variety of defined benefit and defined contribution plans for eligible non-U.S. employees. MMC’s policy for funding its tax qualified defined benefit retirement plans is to contribute amounts at least sufficient to meet the funding requirements set forth in U.S. and applicable foreign laws. In September 2006, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) issued SFAS No. 158, “Employers’ Accounting for Defined Benefit Pension and Other Postretirement Plans – an amendment of FASB Statements No. 87, 88, 106, and 132(R)” (“SFAS 158”). SFAS 158 requires that MMC 46 recognize the funded status of its overfunded defined benefit pension and retiree medical plans (the “Plans”) as a net benefit plan asset and its unfunded and underfunded plans as a net benefit plan liability. The gains or losses and prior service costs or credits that have not been recognized as components of net periodic costs are recorded as a component of Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income (“AOCI”), net of tax, in MMC’s balance sheet. MMC adopted the provisions of SFAS 158, prospectively, on December 31, 2006. The determination of net periodic pension cost is based on a number of actuarial assumptions, including an expected long-term rate of return on plan assets, the discount rate and assumed rate of salary increase. Significant assumptions used in the calculation of net periodic pension costs and pension liabilities are disclosed in Note 8 to the consolidated financial statements. MMC believes the assumptions for each plan are reasonable and appropriate and will continue to evaluate actuarial assumptions at least annually and adjust them as appropriate. Based on its current assumptions, MMC expects pension expense to decrease by approximately $53 million in 2007 and currently expects to contribute approximately $195 million to the plans during 2007. During 2005 MMC made changes to the U.S. pension plan that were designed to reduce MMC’s benefits costs going forward. The changes, which were effective January 1, 2006, include changing the benefit formula from a final average salary to a career average salary as well as a change in the calculation for early retirement benefits. During 2006, MMC made similar changes to its U.K. pension plans. Future pension expense or credits will depend on plan provisions, future investment performance, future assumptions, and various other factors related to the populations participating in the pension plans. Holding all other assumptions constant, a half-percentage point change in the rate of return and discount rate assumptions would affect net periodic pension cost for the U.S. and U.K. plans, which comprise approximately 84% of total pension plan liabilities, as follows: 0.5 Percentage 0.5 Percentage Point Increase Point Decrease (In millions of dollars) U.S. U.K. U.S. U.K. Assumed Rate of Return $ (14.4 ) $ (23.4 ) $ 14.4 $ 23.4 Discount Rate $ (28.4 ) $ (51.5 ) $ 30.4 $ 54.6 Changing the discount rate and leaving the other assumptions constant may not be representative of the impact on expense, because the long-term rates of inflation and salary increases are correlated with the discount rate. MMC contributes to certain health care and life insurance benefits provided to its retired employees. The cost of these postretirement benefits for employees in the United States is accrued during the period up to the date employees are eligible to retire, but is funded by MMC as incurred. This postretirement liability is included in Other liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets. The key assumptions and sensitivity to changes in the assumed health care cost trend rate are discussed in Note 8 to the consolidated financial statements. Income TaxesMMC’s tax rate reflects its income, statutory tax rates and tax planning in the various jurisdictions in which it operates. Significant judgment is required in determining the annual tax rate and in evaluating tax positions. Tax allowances are established when, despite the belief that the tax return positions are fully supportable, there is the potential that they may be successfully challenged. These allowances, as well as the related interest, are adjusted to reflect changing facts and circumstances. 47 Tax law requires items be included in MMC’s tax returns at different times than the items are reflected in the financial statements. As a result, the annual tax expense reflected in the consolidated statements of income is different than that reported in the tax returns. Some of these differences are permanent, such as expenses that are not deductible in the returns, and some differences are temporary and reverse over time, such as depreciation expense. Temporary differences create deferred tax assets and liabilities. Deferred tax assets generally represent items that can be used as a tax deduction or credit in tax returns in future years for which benefit has already been recorded in the financial statements. Valuation allowances are established for deferred tax assets when it is estimated that future taxable income will be insufficient to use a deduction or credit in that jurisdiction. Deferred tax liabilities generally represent tax expense recognized in the financial statements for which payment has been deferred, or expense for which a deduction has been taken already in the tax return but the expense has not yet been recognized in the financial statements. As discussed below, under New Accounting Pronouncements, MMC’s accounting for income taxes will be impacted by the adoption of FASB Interpretation No. 48. Share-based PaymentEffective July 1, 2005, MMC adopted SFAS 123(R) “Share-based Payment”, which requires, among other things, that the estimated fair value of stock options be charged to earnings. Significant management judgment is required to determine the appropriate assumptions for inputs such as volatility and expected term necessary to estimate option values. In addition, management judgment is required to analyze the terms of the plans and awards granted thereunder to determine if awards will be treated as equity awards or liability awards, as defined by SFAS 123(R). As of December 31, 2006, there was $84 million of unrecognized compensation cost related to MMC’s option awards and $15 million of unrecognized compensation cost related to Putnam’s option awards. The weighted-average periods over which the costs are expected to be recognized are 1.4 years for MMC and 1.7 years for Putnam. Also as of December 31, 2006, there was $203 million of unrecognized compensation cost related to MMC’s restricted stock, restricted stock unit and deferred stock unit awards and $94 million of unrecognized compensation cost related to Putnam’s restricted stock awards. See Note 9 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding the adoption of SFAS 123(R). Investment ValuationMMC holds investments in both public and private companies, as well as certain private equity funds managed by Stone Point and T.H. Lee. The majority of the public investments are accounted for as available for sale securities under SFAS No. 115. Where applicable, certain investments are accounted for under APB Opinion No. 18. MMC periodically reviews the carrying value of its investments to determine if any valuation adjustments are appropriate under the applicable accounting pronouncements. MMC bases its review on the facts and circumstances as they relate to each investment. Fair value of private equity investments is determined by the Funds’ investment managers. Factors considered in determining the fair value of private equity investments include: implied valuation of recently completed financing rounds that included sophisticated outside investors; performance multiples of comparable public companies; restrictions on the sale or disposal of the investments; trading characteristics of the securities; and the relative size of the holdings in comparison to other private investors and the public market float. In those instances where quoted market prices are not available, particularly for equity holdings in private companies, or formal restrictions limit the sale of securities, significant management judgment is required to determine the appropriate value of MMC’s investments. MMC reviews the appropriateness of valuation results for significant private equity investments with the fund manager. 48 New Accounting Pronouncements New accounting pronouncements are discussed in Note 1 to MMC’s consolidated financial statements. In September 2006, the FASB issued SFAS 158 which requires that MMC recognize the funded status of its overfunded defined benefit pension and retiree medical plans (the “Plans”) as a net benefit plan asset and its unfunded and underfunded plans as a net benefit plan liability. The gains or losses and prior service costs or credits that have not been recognized as components of net periodic costs are recorded as a component of AOCI, net of tax, in MMC’s balance sheet. MMC adopted the provisions of SFAS 158, prospectively, on December 31, 2006. The impact of adopting SFAS 158 caused a reduction in assets of $660 million and an increase in liabilities of $245 million, including a related adjustment to tax benefits of $423 million. The net impact of adopting SFAS 158 was a reduction of MMC’s stockholders’ equity of $905 million, $804 million including an adjustment for the impact of recording a minimum pension credit prior to the adoption of SFAS 158. This adoption has no impact on MMC’s consolidated statements of income or cash flows. The adoption of SFAS 158 does not impact any financial covenants in MMC’s bank agreements, nor does MMC expect adoption to adversely impact its credit ratings. SFAS 158 also requires companies to measure the funded status of their plans as of their year-end balance sheet date no later than 2008. MMC’s existing policy is to measure the funded status of its Plans as of its year-end balance sheet date and therefore is not impacted by this requirement. In September 2006, the FASB issued SFAS No. 157, “Fair Value Measurements” (“SFAS 157”), which defines fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value, and expands required disclosures about fair value measurements. The provisions of SFAS 157 are effective as of the beginning of MMC’s 2008 fiscal year. MMC is currently evaluating the impact of adopting SFAS 157 on its consolidated financial statements. In June 2006, the FASB issued FASB Interpretation No. 48, “Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes – an interpretation of FASB Statement No. 109” (“FIN 48”), which clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income tax positions. This interpretation requires that MMC recognize in its consolidated financial statements the impact of a tax position when it is more likely than not that the tax position would be sustained upon examination by the tax authorities based on the technical merits of the position. This interpretation also provides guidance on derecognition, classification, interest and penalties, accounting in interim periods, disclosure, and transition. The provisions of FIN 48 will be effective for MMC beginning in the first quarter of 2007, with the cumulative effect of any change in accounting principle recorded as an adjustment to opening retained earnings. On February 27, 2007 the FASB issued draft implementation guidance in the form of a proposed FASB Staff Position subject to a thirty day comment period. Pending finalization of this guidance, MMC is evaluating the impact of adopting FIN 48 on its consolidated financial statements. Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk.
