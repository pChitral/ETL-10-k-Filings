1035267,ISRG,INTUITIVE SURGICAL INC,2017,"Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis” for further details on the joint venture with Fosun Pharma. ManufacturingWe manufacture our da Vinci Surgical Systems at our facility in Sunnyvale, California. We manufacture our instruments at our Sunnyvale facility and our Mexicali, Mexico facility. We purchase both custom and off-the-shelf components from a large number of suppliers and subject them to stringent quality specifications and processes. Some of the components necessary for the assembly of our products are currently provided to us by sole-sourced suppliers (the only recognized supply source available to us) or single-sourced suppliers (the only approved supply source for us among other sources). We purchase the majority of our components and major assemblies through purchase orders rather than long-term supply agreements and generally do not maintain large volumes of finished goods. 10Table of ContentsCompetitionWe face competition in the forms of existing open surgery, conventional MIS, drug therapies, radiation treatment, and emerging interventional surgical approaches. Our success depends on continued clinical and technical innovation, quality and reliability as well as educating hospitals, surgeons and patients on the demonstrated results associated with da Vinci Surgery and its value relative to other techniques. We also face competition from several companies that are developing new approaches and products for the MIS market. We believe that many companies are focused on adding capability to manual MIS systems. Because many of these developments are aimed at MIS, we believe that our da Vinci Surgical System may prove complementary to some of these new technologies. Moreover, as we add new robotically controlled products (e.g. Single-Site, EndoWrist stapler, and Vessel Sealer) that compete with product offerings traditionally within the domains of open surgery and/or conventional MIS, we face greater competition from larger and well established companies such as Ethicon Endo-Surgery, Inc. Furthermore, as da Vinci use increases, a number of companies have introduced products in the field of robotic surgery or have made explicit statements to enter the field of robotic surgery, including: Auris Surgical Robotics, Inc.; Avatera Medical GmbH; Cambridge Medical Robotics Ltd; Johnson & Johnson and Google Inc. and their joint venture, Verb Surgical Inc.; Medicaroid Inc.; MedRobotics Corp.; meerecompany Inc.; Medtronic PLC; Olympus Corp.; Samsung Corporation; Smart Robot Technology Group Co. Ltd.; TransEnterix Inc.; and Titan Medical Inc. Companies with substantial experience in industrial robotics could potentially expand into the field of surgical robotics and become a competitor. In addition, research efforts utilizing computers and robotics in surgery are underway at various companies and research institutions. Our revenues may be adversely impacted as our competitors announce their intent to enter our markets and as our customers anticipate the availability of competing products.Intellectual PropertyWe place considerable importance on obtaining and maintaining patent, copyright and trade secret protection for significant new technologies, products, and processes. We generally rely upon a combination of intellectual property laws, as well as confidentiality procedures and contractual provisions, to protect our proprietary technology. For example, we have trademarks, both registered and unregistered, that provide distinctive identification of our products in the marketplace. We also have exclusive and non-exclusive patent licenses with various third parties to supplement our own large and robust patent portfolio. As of December 31, 2016, we held ownership or exclusive field-of-use licenses for more than 2,400 U.S. and foreign patents and more than 1,800 U.S. and foreign patent applications. We intend to continue filing new patent applications in the U.S. and foreign jurisdictions to seek protection for our technology. Patents are granted for finite terms. Upon expiration, the inventions claimed in a patent enter the public domain. Government RegulationOur products and operations are subject to regulation by the FDA, the State of California and countries or regions in which we market our products. In addition, our products must meet the requirements of a large and growing body of international standards which govern the design, manufacture, materials content and sourcing, testing, certification, packaging, installation, use and disposal of our products. We must continually keep abreast of these standards and requirements and integrate our compliance into the development and regulatory documentation for our products. Failure to meet these standards could limit our ability to market our products in those regions which require compliance to such standards. Examples of standards to which we are subject include electrical safety standards such as those of the International Electrotechnical Commission (e.g. IEC 60601-ss series of standards), and composition standards such as the Reduction of Hazardous Substances (“RoHS”) and the Waste Electrical and Electronic Equipment (“WEEE”) Directives. United StatesThe FDA regulates the development, testing, manufacturing, labeling, storage, recordkeeping, promotion, marketing, distribution, and service of medical devices in the U.S. to ensure that medical products distributed domestically are safe and effective for their intended uses. In addition, the FDA regulates the export of medical devices manufactured in the U.S. to markets outside of the U.S. and the importation of medical devices manufactured abroad. Under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (“FFDCA”), medical devices are classified into one of three classes—Class I, Class II or Class III—depending on the degree of risk associated with each medical device and the extent of control needed to ensure safety and effectiveness. Our current products are Class I and Class II medical devices. Class II devices are those which are subject to general controls and most require premarket demonstration of adherence to certain performance standards or other special controls, as specified by the FDA, and clearance by the FDA. Premarket review and clearance by the FDA for these devices is accomplished through the 510(k) premarket notification process. Unless a Class II 11Table of Contentsdevice is exempt from premarket review, the manufacturer must submit to the FDA a premarket notification submission demonstrating that the device is “substantially equivalent” in intended use and technology to a “predicate device” that is either: 1.a device that has grandfather marketing status because it was legally marketed prior to May 28, 1976, the date upon which the Medical Device Amendments of 1976 were enacted, or2.a device that has previously been cleared through the 510(k) process. If the FDA agrees that the device is substantially equivalent to a predicate device, it will grant clearance to commercially market the device in the U.S. The FDA has a statutory 90-day period to respond to a 510(k) submission, or a guidance-based 30-day period for “special” 510(k) submissions which have a more restrictive scope and generally involve more specific or very limited changes to a legally marketed device. As a practical matter, clearance often takes longer. The FDA may require further information, including clinical data, to make a determination regarding substantial equivalence. If the FDA determines that the device, or its intended use, is not “substantially equivalent,” the FDA may deny the request for clearance. Although unlikely for the types of products marketed by us, the FDA may classify the device, or the particular use of the device, into Class III, and the device sponsor must then fulfill more rigorous pre-market approval (“PMA”) requirements. A PMA application, which is intended to demonstrate that a device is safe and effective, must be supported by extensive data, including data from preclinical studies and human clinical trials. The FDA, by statute and regulation, has 180 days to review a PMA application, though the review more often occurs over a significantly longer period of time, and can take up to several years. In approving a PMA application or clearing a 510(k) submission, the FDA may also require some form of post-market surveillance when necessary to protect the public health or to provide additional safety and effectiveness data for the device. In such cases, the manufacturer might be required to follow certain patient groups for a number of years and makes periodic reports to the FDA on the clinical status of those patients.After a device receives FDA 510(k) clearance, any modification that could significantly affect its safety or effectiveness, or that would constitute a major change in its intended use, requires a new 510(k) clearance or could require a PMA application approval. The FDA requires each manufacturer to make the determination of whether a modification requires a new 510(k) notification or PMA application in the first instance, but the FDA can review any such decision. If the FDA disagrees with a manufacturer’s decision not to seek a new 510(k) clearance or PMA approval for a particular change, the FDA may retroactively require the manufacturer to seek 510(k) clearance or PMA approval. The FDA also can require the manufacturer to cease U.S. marketing and/or recall the modified device until 510(k) clearance or PMA approval is obtained. In addition, after a device is placed on the market, numerous FDA and other regulatory requirements continue to apply. These include establishment registration and device listing with the FDA; compliance with medical device reporting regulations, which require that manufacturers report to the FDA if their device may have caused or contributed to a death or serious injury or malfunctioned in a way that would likely cause or contribute to a death or serious injury if it were to recur; and compliance with corrections and removal reporting regulations, which require that manufacturers report to the FDA field corrections and product recalls or removals if undertaken to reduce a risk to health posed by the device or to remedy a violation of the FFDCA that may present a risk to health. The FDA and the Federal Trade Commission (“FTC”) also regulate the advertising and promotion of our products to ensure that the claims we make are consistent with our regulatory clearances, that there is scientific data to substantiate the claims and that our advertising is neither false nor misleading. In general, we may not promote or advertise our products for uses not within the scope of our intended use statement in our clearances or make unsupported safety and effectiveness claims. Many regulatory jurisdictions outside of the U.S. have similar regulations to which we are subject. Our manufacturing processes are required to comply with the FDA’s Good Manufacturing Practice (“GMP”) requirements contained in its Quality System Regulation (“QSR”) and associated regulations and guidance. The QSR covers, among other things, the methods used in, and the facilities and controls used for, the design, manufacture, packaging, labeling, storage, installation, and servicing of all medical devices intended for human use. The QSR also requires maintenance of extensive records which demonstrate compliance with FDA regulation, the manufacturer’s own procedures, specifications and testing as well as distribution and post-market experience. Compliance with the QSR is necessary to receive FDA clearance or approval to market new products and is necessary for a manufacturer to be able to continue to market cleared or approved product offerings in the U.S. A company’s facilities, records, and manufacturing processes are subject to periodic scheduled or unscheduled inspections by the FDA, which may issue reports known as Forms FDA 483 or Notices of Inspectional Observations which list instances where the FDA inspector believes the manufacturer has failed to comply with applicable regulations and/or procedures. If the observations are sufficiently serious or the manufacturer fails to respond appropriately, the FDA may issue Warning Letters, or Untitled Letters, which are notices of potential enforcement actions against the manufacturer. If a Warning Letter or Untitled Letter is not addressed to the satisfaction of the FDA, or if the FDA becomes aware of any other serious issue with a manufacturer’s products or facilities, it could result in fines, injunctions, civil penalties, delays, suspension or withdrawal of clearances, seizures or recalls of products, operating restrictions, total shutdown of production facilities, prohibition on export or import and criminal prosecution. Such actions may have further indirect consequences for the manufacturer outside of the U.S., and may adversely affect the reputation of the manufacturer and the product. In the U.S., routine FDA inspections usually occur every two years, and may occur more often for cause. 12Table of ContentsTo a greater or lesser extent, most other countries require some form of quality system and regulatory compliance, which may include periodic inspections, inspections by third party auditors, and specialized documentation. Failure to meet all the requirements of these countries could jeopardize our ability to import, market, support and receive reimbursement for the use of our products in these countries. In addition to the above, we may seek to conduct clinical studies or trials in the U.S. or other countries on products that have not yet been cleared or approved for a particular indication. Additional regulations govern the approval, initiation, conduct, documentation and reporting of clinical studies to regulatory agencies in the countries or regions in which they are conducted. Such investigational use is generally also regulated by local and institutional requirements and policies which usually include review by an ethics committee or institutional review board (“IRB”). Failure to comply with all regulations governing such studies could subject the company to significant enforcement actions and sanctions, including halting of the study, seizure of investigational devices or data, sanctions against investigators, civil or criminal penalties, and other actions. Without the data from one or more clinical studies, it may not be possible for us to secure the data necessary to support certain regulatory submissions, to secure reimbursement or demonstrate other requirements. We cannot assure that access to clinical investigators, sites and subjects, documentation and data will be available on the terms and timeframes necessary. Products manufactured outside the U.S. by or for us are subject to U.S. Customs and FDA inspection upon entry into the U.S. We must demonstrate compliance of such products to U.S. regulations and carefully document the eventual distribution or re-exportation of such products. Failure to comply with all applicable regulations could prevent us from having access to products or components critical to the manufacture of finished products and lead to shortages and delays. California RegulationThe State of California requires that we obtain a license to manufacture medical devices and until 2012 conducted periodic inspections of medical device manufacturers. Our facilities and manufacturing processes were last inspected in July 2011 and were found to be in compliance. In accordance with the State of California regulations, our license to manufacture is renewed annually with any updated manufacturing information. Although the State of California has announced suspension of routine periodic inspections, there can be no assurance the State of California will not resume such inspections or conduct such inspections under specific circumstances which are not yet known. Foreign RegulationIn order for us to market our products in countries outside the United States, we must obtain regulatory approvals and comply with extensive product and quality system regulations in other countries. These regulations, including the requirements for approvals or clearance and the time required for regulatory review, vary from country to country. Some countries have regulatory review processes which are substantially longer than U.S. processes. Failure to obtain regulatory approval in a timely manner and to meet all local requirements including language and specific safety standards in any foreign country in which we plan to market our products could prevent us from marketing products in such countries or subject us to sanctions and fines. To be sold in Japan, most medical devices must undergo thorough safety examinations and demonstrate medical efficacy before they receive regulatory approval. We obtained from the Japanese Ministry of Health, Labor, and Welfare (“MHLW”) approval for our da Vinci Si Surgical Systems in October 2012 and approval for our da Vinci Xi Surgical Systems in March 2015. National reimbursement status was received in Japan for dVP procedures, effective April 2012 and for da Vinci partial nephrectomy procedures in April 2016. We are currently seeking reimbursement for additional procedures through the MHLW’s Senshin Iryo processes as well as alternative reimbursement processes. Our Senshin Iryo approvals require in-country clinical data and are considered for reimbursed status in April of even numbered years.Commercialization of medical devices in Europe is regulated by the European Union (“EU”). The EU presently requires that all medical products bear the Conformité Européenne (“CE”) mark, for compliance with the Medical Device Directive (93/42/EEC) as amended. The CE mark is an international symbol of adherence to certain essential principles of safety and performance mandated in applicable European medical device directives, which once affixed, enables a product to be sold in member countries of the EU and those affiliated countries which accept the CE mark. The CE mark is also recognized in many countries outside of the EU, such as Australia, and can assist in the clearance process. In order to affix the CE mark on products, a recognized European Notified Body must certify a manufacturer’s quality system and design dossier for compliance with international and European requirements. We have received authorization from Presafe Denmark A/S (formerly DGM Denmark A/S), a recognized European Notified Body and part of Nemko Presafe A/S, to affix the CE mark to our da Vinci Surgical System and EndoWrist instruments and accessories. To maintain authorization to apply the CE mark, we are subject to annual surveillance audits and periodic re-certification audits. In September 2013, the European Commission adopted a recommendation indicating that all Notified Bodies, including Presafe, should carry out unannounced audits, at least once every third year, of the manufacturers whose medical devices they have certified. These unannounced audits can also extend to the manufacturer’s critical suppliers or sub-contractors (those that supply a critical input or perform a critical function for the manufacturer). 13Table of ContentsIf we modify our existing products or develop new products in the future, we may need to apply for authorization to affix the CE mark to such products. We do not know whether we will be able to obtain authorization to affix the CE mark for new or modified products or whether we will continue to meet the safety and performance standards required to maintain the authorizations we have already received. If we are unable to maintain authorizations to affix the CE mark to our products, we will no longer be able to sell our products in member countries of the EU or those whose marketing authorizations are based on the CE mark. Regulations in other countries, including the requirements for approvals or clearance and the time required for regulatory review, vary from country to country. Certain countries, such as China and South Korea, have their own regulatory agencies. These countries typically require regulatory approvals and compliance with extensive safety and quality system regulations. Failure to obtain regulatory approval in any foreign country in which we plan to market our products, or failure to comply with any regulation in any foreign country in which we market our products, may negatively impact our ability to generate revenue and harm our business. Our system sales into China are also dependent on obtaining importation authorizations and hospitals completing a central purchasing tender process under the authorization, the most recent of which expired at the end of 2015. In addition, local regulations may apply which govern the use of our products and which could have an adverse effect on our product utilization if they are unfavorable. All such regulations are revised from time to time and in general are increasing in complexity, and in the scope and degree of documentation and testing required. There can be no assurance the outcomes from such documentation and testing will be acceptable to any particular regulatory agency or will continue to be acceptable over time. There are further regulations governing the importation, marketing, sale, distribution, use and service as well as the removal and disposal of medical devices in the regions in which we operate and market our products. Failure to comply with any of these regulations could result in sanctions or fines, and could prevent us from marketing our products in these regions. Other Healthcare LawsWe are also subject to federal and state healthcare laws and regulations pertaining to fraud and abuse, physician payment transparency, privacy, and security laws and regulations. These laws include:•the federal Anti-Kickback Statute, which prohibits, among other things, persons from knowingly and willfully soliciting, receiving, offering or paying remuneration, directly or indirectly, in exchange for or to induce either the referral of an individual for, or the purchase, order or recommendation of, any good or service for which payment may be made under federal healthcare programs, such as the Medicare and Medicaid programs. A person or entity does not need to have actual knowledge of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute or specific intent to violate it to have committed a violation. In addition, the government may assert that a claim including items or services resulting from a violation of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute constitutes a false or fraudulent claim for purposes of the False Claims Act; •federal false claims laws which prohibit, among other things, individuals or entities from knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, claims for payment from Medicare, Medicaid or other federal third-party payors that are false or fraudulent; •the federal Civil Monetary Penalties Law, which prohibits, among other things, offering or transferring remuneration to a federal healthcare beneficiary that a person knows or should know is likely to influence the beneficiary’s decision to order or receive items or services reimbursable by the government from a particular provider or supplier;•federal criminal laws that prohibit executing a scheme to defraud any federal healthcare benefit program or making false statements relating to healthcare matters; •the federal Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, as amended by the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act, which governs the conduct of certain electronic healthcare transactions and protects the security and privacy of protected health information; •the federal Physician Payment Sunshine Act, which requires (i) manufacturers of drugs, devices, biologics and medical supplies for which payment is available under Medicare, Medicaid or the Children’s Health Insurance Program (with certain exceptions) to report annually to the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (“CMS”) information related to payments or other “transfers of value” made to physicians (defined to include doctors, dentists, optometrists, podiatrists and chiropractors) and teaching hospitals, and (ii) applicable manufacturers and group purchasing organizations to report annually to CMS ownership and investment interests held by the physicians described above and their immediate family members, and payments or other “transfers of value” to such physician owners. Manufacturers are required to submit reports to CMS by the 90th day of each calendar year; and •analogous state and foreign law equivalents of each of the above federal laws, such as anti-kickback and false claims laws which may apply to items or services reimbursed by any third-party payor, including commercial insurers; state laws that require device companies to comply with the industry’s voluntary compliance guidelines and the applicable compliance guidance promulgated by the federal government or otherwise restrict payments that may be made to healthcare providers and other potential referral sources; state laws that require device manufacturers to report 14Table of Contentsinformation related to payments and other “transfers of value” to physicians and other healthcare providers or marketing expenditures; and state laws governing the privacy and security of health information in certain circumstances, many of which differ from each other in significant ways and may not have the same effect, thus complicating compliance efforts. If our operations are found to violate any of the laws described above or any other laws and regulations that apply to us, we may be subject to penalties, including civil and criminal penalties, damages, fines, the curtailment or restructuring of our operations, the exclusion from our participation in federal and state healthcare programs and imprisonment, any of which could adversely affect our ability to market our products and materially adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition. Any action against us for violation of these laws, even if we successfully defend against it, could cause us to incur significant legal expenses and divert our management’s attention from the operation of our business.Third-Party Coverage and ReimbursementIn the U.S. and most markets OUS where we sell our products, the government and health insurance companies together are responsible for hospital and surgeon reimbursement for virtually all covered surgical procedures. Governments and insurance companies generally reimburse hospitals and physicians for surgery when the procedure is considered medically necessary. In the U.S., CMS administers the Medicare and Medicaid programs (the latter, along with applicable state governments). Many other third-party payors model their reimbursement methodologies after the Medicare program. As the single largest payor, this program has a significant impact on other payors’ payment systems.Generally, reimbursement for professional services performed at a facility by physicians is reported under billing codes issued by the American Medical Association (“AMA”), known as Current Procedural Terminology (“CPT”) codes. Physician reimbursement under Medicare generally is based on a fee schedule and determined by the relative values of the professional service rendered. In addition, CMS and the National Center for Health Statistics (“NCHS”) are jointly responsible for overseeing changes and modifications to billing codes used by hospitals to report inpatient procedures, known as ICD-9-CM procedural codes prior to October 1, 2015, and ICD-10-PCS codes on and after October 1, 2015. For Medicare, CMS generally reimburses hospitals for services provided during an inpatient stay based on a prospective payment system that is determined by a classification system known as Medicare-Severity Diagnostic Related Groupings (“MS-DRGs”). MS-DRGs are assigned using a number of factors including the principal diagnosis, major procedures, discharged status, patient age and complicating secondary diagnoses among other things. Hospital outpatient services, reported by CPT codes, are assigned to clinically relevant Ambulatory Payment Classifications (“APCs”) used to determine the payment amount for services provided.On October 1, 2008, CMS and NCHS issued a new family of ICD-9-CM procedure codes for “Robotically Assisted Procedures”. The purpose of the ICD-9-CM family of procedure codes, 17.4X, was to gather data on robotic assisted surgical procedures. On and after October 1, 2015, a new family of ICD-10-PCS codes may be used-in conjunction with other applicable procedure codes-to describe various robotic assisted procedures. An inpatient surgical procedure, completed with or without robotic assistance, continues to be assigned to the clinically relevant MS-DRG.Governments and insurance companies carefully review and increasingly challenge the prices charged for medical products and surgical services. Reimbursement rates from private companies vary depending on the procedure performed, the third-party payor, contract terms, and other factors. Because both hospitals and physicians may receive the same reimbursement for their respective services, with or without robotics, regardless of actual costs incurred by the hospital or physician in furnishing the care, including for the specific products used in that procedure, hospitals and physicians may decide not to use our products if reimbursement amounts are insufficient to cover any additional costs incurred when purchasing our products. Domestic institutions typically bill various third-party payors, such as Medicare, Medicaid and other government programs and private insurance plans for the primary surgical procedure that includes our products. Because our da Vinci Surgical System has been cleared for commercial distribution in the U.S. by the FDA, coverage and reimbursement by payors are generally determined by the medical necessity of the primary surgical procedure. We believe that the additional procedures we intend to pursue are established surgical procedures that are generally already reimbursable by government agencies and insurance companies for appropriately selected patients. If hospitals do not obtain sufficient reimbursement from third-party payors for procedures performed with our products, or if governmental and private payors’ policies do not cover surgical procedures performed using our products, we may not be able to generate the revenues necessary to support our business. In countries outside the U.S., reimbursement is obtained from various sources, including governmental authorities, private health insurance plans, and labor unions. In most foreign countries, private insurance systems may also offer payments for some therapies. In addition, health maintenance organizations are emerging in certain European countries. To effectively conduct our business, we may need to seek OUS reimbursement approvals, and we do not know if these required approvals will be obtained in a timely manner or at all. In some countries, patients may be permitted to pay directly for surgical services; however, such “co-pay” practices are not common in most countries. 15Table of ContentsIn March 2010, the U.S. President signed the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as amended by the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act (collectively, the “PPACA”), which makes changes that significantly impact healthcare providers, insurers, pharmaceutical and medical device manufacturers. The PPACA contains a number of provisions designed to generate the revenues necessary to fund health insurance coverage expansion, including, but not limited to fees or taxes on certain health-related industries, including medical device manufacturers. For sales between January 1, 2013 and December 31, 2015, medical device manufacturers were required to pay an excise tax (or sales tax) of 2.3% on certain U.S. medical device revenues. Under this provision, we incurred an excise tax of approximately $17.0 million in 2015 which was included as a cost of revenue and a reduction of product gross profit margin. In December, 2015, President Obama signed into law the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2016 (the “Appropriations Act”). The Appropriations Act includes a two-year moratorium on the medical device excise tax such that medical device sales in 2016 and 2017 are exempt from the medical device excise tax. Unless there is further legislative action, the tax will be automatically reinstated for sales of medical devices on or after January 1, 2018.The PPACA also appropriates funding to research the comparative effectiveness of health care treatments and strategies. It remains unclear how this research will influence future Medicare coverage and reimbursement decisions, as well as influence other third-party payor coverage and reimbursement policies. As the U.S. congress and state governments determine how to implement the PPACA, the full impact of the PPACA on the medical device industry and the sale of our products is currently unknown. The PPACA, as well as other federal or state health care reform measures that may be adopted in the future, could have a material adverse effect on our business. The taxes imposed by PPACA and the expansion in the government’s role in the U.S. healthcare industry may result in decreased profits, lower reimbursement from payors for procedures that use our products and/or reduced procedural volumes, all of which may adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. In addition, other legislative changes have been proposed and adopted since the PPACA was enacted. These changes included an aggregate reduction in Medicare payments to providers of up to 2% per fiscal year, which went into effect on April 1, 2013 and will remain in effect through 2025 unless additional Congressional action is taken. On January 2, 2013, the American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012 was signed into law, which, among other things, further reduced Medicare payments to several providers, including hospitals, imaging centers and cancer treatment centers. The Medicare Access and CHIP Reauthorization Act of 2015, enacted on April 16, 2015 (“MACRA”), repealed the formula by which Medicare made annual payment adjustments to physicians and replaced the former formula with fixed annual updates and a new system of incentive payments scheduled to begin in 2019 that are based on various performance measures and physicians’ participation in alternative payment models such as accountable care organizations.There have also been judicial and congressional challenges to certain aspects of the PPACA, and we expect that the U.S. federal government will seek to modify, repeal, or otherwise invalidate all, or certain provisions of, the PPACA. For instance, on January 20, 2017, an executive order was issued, which stated that it is the U.S. federal government's policy to seek the prompt repeal of the PPACA, and directed the heads of all executive departments and agencies to minimize the economic and regulatory burdens of the PPACA to the maximum extent permitted by law. Any regulatory or legislative developments in domestic or foreign markets that eliminate or reduce reimbursement rates for procedures performed with our products could harm our ability to sell our products or cause downward pressure on the prices of our products, either of which would affect our ability to generate the revenues necessary to support our business. EmployeesAs of December 31, 2016, we had 3,755 employees, 466 of whom were engaged directly in research and development, 1,529 in manufacturing and service and 1,760 in marketing, sales, and administrative activities. None of our employees are covered by a collective bargaining agreement, and we consider our relationship with our employees to be good.

We purchase both custom and off-the-shelf components from a large number of suppliers and subject them to stringent quality specifications and processes. Some of the components necessary for the assembly of our products are currently provided to us by sole-sourced suppliers (the only recognized supply source available to us) or single-sourced suppliers (the only approved supply source for us among other sources).

Our success depends on continued clinical and technical innovation, quality and reliability as well as educating hospitals, surgeons, and patients on the demonstrated results associated with da Vinci Surgery and its value relative to other techniques. We also face competition from several companies that are developing new approaches and products for the MIS market. We believe that many companies are focused on adding capability to manual MIS systems. Because many of these developments are aimed at MIS, we believe that our da Vinci Surgical Systems may prove complementary to some of these new technologies. Moreover, as we add new robotically controlled products (e.g. Single-Site, EndoWrist Stapler, and EndoWrist One Vessel Sealer) that compete with product offerings traditionally within the domains of open surgery and/or conventional MIS, we face greater competition from larger and well established companies such as Ethicon Endo-Surgery, Inc. and Medtronic PLC. Furthermore, a number of companies have introduced products in the field of robotic surgery or have made explicit their intention to enter the field of robotic surgery, including: Auris Surgical Robotics, Inc.; Avatera Medical GmbH; Cambridge Medical Robotics Ltd; Johnson & Johnson and Google Inc. and their joint venture, Verb Surgical Inc.; Medicaroid Inc.; MedRobotics Corp.; Medtronic PLC; meerecompany Inc.; Olympus Corp.; Samsung Corporation; Smart Robot Technology Group Co. Ltd.; Titan Medical Inc.; and TransEnterix Inc. Other companies with substantial experience in industrial robotics could potentially expand into the field of surgical robotics and become a competitor. In addition, research efforts utilizing computers and robotics in surgery are underway at various companies and research institutions. Our revenues may be adversely impacted as our competitors announce their intent to enter our markets and as our customers anticipate the availability of competing products.Intellectual PropertyWe place considerable importance on obtaining and maintaining patent, copyright, and trade secret protection for significant new technologies, products, and processes. We generally rely upon a combination of intellectual property laws, as well as confidentiality procedures and contractual provisions, to protect our proprietary technology. For example, we have trademarks, both registered and unregistered, that provide distinctive identification of our products in the marketplace. We also have exclusive and non-exclusive patent licenses with various third parties to supplement our own large and robust patent portfolio. As of December 31, 2017, we held ownership or exclusive field-of-use licenses for more than 2,750 U.S. and foreign patents and more than 1,900 U.S. and foreign patent applications. We intend to continue filing new patent applications in the U.S. and foreign jurisdictions to seek protection for our technology. 10Table of ContentsPatents are granted for finite terms. Upon expiration, the inventions claimed in a patent enter the public domain. Government RegulationOur products and operations are subject to regulation by the FDA, the State of California, and countries or regions in which we market our products. In addition, our products must meet the requirements of a large and growing body of international standards which govern the design, manufacture, materials content and sourcing, testing, certification, packaging, installation, use, and disposal of our products. We must continually keep abreast of these standards and requirements and integrate our compliance into the development and regulatory documentation for our products. Failure to meet these standards could limit our ability to market our products in those regions which require compliance to such standards. Examples of standards to which we are subject include electrical safety standards such as those of the International Electrotechnical Commission (e.g. IEC 60601-ss series of standards), and composition standards such as the Reduction of Hazardous Substances (“RoHS”) and the Waste Electrical and Electronic Equipment (“WEEE”) Directives. United StatesThe FDA regulates the development, testing, manufacturing, labeling, storage, recordkeeping, promotion, marketing, distribution, and service of medical devices in the U.S. to ensure that medical products distributed domestically are safe and effective for their intended uses. In addition, the FDA regulates the export of medical devices manufactured in the U.S. to markets outside of the U.S. and the importation of medical devices manufactured abroad. Under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (“FFDCA”), medical devices are classified into one of three classes—Class I, Class II or Class III—depending on the degree of risk associated with each medical device and the extent of control needed to ensure safety and effectiveness. Our current products are Class I and Class II medical devices. Class II devices are those which are subject to general controls and most require premarket demonstration of adherence to certain performance standards or other special controls, as specified by the FDA, and clearance by the FDA. Premarket review and clearance by the FDA for these devices is accomplished through the 510(k) premarket notification process. Unless a Class II device is exempt from premarket review, the manufacturer must submit to the FDA a premarket notification submission demonstrating that the device is “substantially equivalent” in intended use and technology to a “predicate device” that is either: •a device that has grandfather marketing status because it was legally marketed prior to May 28, 1976, the date upon which the Medical Device Amendments of 1976 were enacted; or•a device that has previously been cleared through the 510(k) process. If the FDA agrees that the device is substantially equivalent to a predicate device, it will grant clearance to commercially market the device in the U.S. The FDA has a statutory 90-day period to respond to a 510(k) submission, or a guidance-based 30-day period for “special” 510(k) submissions which have a more restrictive scope and generally involve more specific or very limited changes to a legally marketed device. As a practical matter, clearance often takes longer. The FDA may require further information, including clinical data, to make a determination regarding substantial equivalence. If the FDA determines that the device, or its intended use, is not “substantially equivalent,” the FDA may deny the request for clearance. Although unlikely for the types of products marketed by us, the FDA may classify the device, or the particular use of the device, into Class III, and the device sponsor must then fulfill more rigorous pre-market approval (“PMA”) requirements. A PMA application, which is intended to demonstrate that a device is safe and effective, must be supported by extensive data, including data from preclinical studies and human clinical trials. The FDA, by statute and regulation, has 180 days to review a PMA application, though the review more often occurs over a significantly longer period of time, and can take up to several years. In approving a PMA application or clearing a 510(k) submission, the FDA may also require some form of post-market surveillance when necessary to protect the public health or to provide additional safety and effectiveness data for the device. In such cases, the manufacturer might be required to follow certain patient groups for a number of years and makes periodic reports to the FDA on the clinical status of those patients.After a device receives FDA 510(k) clearance, any modification that could significantly affect its safety or effectiveness, or that would constitute a major change in its intended use, requires a new 510(k) clearance or could require a PMA application approval. The FDA requires each manufacturer to make the determination of whether a modification requires a new 510(k) notification or PMA application in the first instance, but the FDA can review any such decision. If the FDA disagrees with a manufacturer’s decision not to seek a new 510(k) clearance or PMA approval for a particular change, the FDA may retroactively require the manufacturer to seek 510(k) clearance or PMA approval. The FDA also can require the manufacturer to cease U.S. marketing and/or recall the modified device until 510(k) clearance or PMA approval is obtained. In addition, after a device is placed on the market, numerous FDA and other regulatory requirements continue to apply. These include establishment registration and device listing with the FDA; compliance with medical device reporting regulations, which require that manufacturers report to the FDA if their device may have caused or contributed to a death or serious injury or malfunctioned in a way that would likely cause or contribute to a death or serious injury if it were to recur; and compliance with corrections and removal reporting regulations, which require that manufacturers report to the FDA field corrections and product recalls or removals if undertaken to reduce a risk to health posed by the device or to remedy a violation of the FFDCA that may present a risk to health. The FDA and the Federal Trade Commission (“FTC”) also regulate the advertising and promotion of our products to ensure that the claims we make are consistent with our regulatory clearances, that there is scientific data to substantiate the claims and that our advertising is neither false nor misleading. In general, we may not promote or advertise our products for uses not within the scope of our intended use statement in our clearances or make unsupported safety and effectiveness claims. Many regulatory jurisdictions outside of the U.S. have similar regulations to which we are subject. Our manufacturing processes are required to comply with the FDA’s Good Manufacturing Practice (“GMP”) requirements contained in its Quality System Regulation (“QSR”) and associated regulations and guidance. The QSR covers, among other things, the methods used in, and the facilities and controls used for, the design, manufacture, packaging, labeling, storage, installation, and servicing of all medical devices intended for human use. The QSR also requires maintenance of extensive records which demonstrate compliance with FDA regulation, the manufacturer’s own procedures, specifications, and testing as well as distribution and post-market experience. Compliance with the QSR is necessary to receive FDA clearance or approval to market new products and is necessary for a manufacturer to be able to continue to market cleared or approved product offerings in the U.S. A company’s facilities, records, and manufacturing processes are subject to periodic scheduled or unscheduled inspections by the FDA, which may issue reports known as Forms FDA 483 or Notices of Inspectional Observations which list instances where the FDA inspector believes the manufacturer has failed to comply with applicable regulations and/or procedures. If the observations are sufficiently serious or the manufacturer fails to respond appropriately, the FDA may issue Warning Letters, or Untitled Letters, which are notices of potential enforcement actions against the manufacturer. If a Warning Letter or Untitled Letter is not addressed to the satisfaction of the FDA, or if the FDA becomes aware of any other serious issue with a manufacturer’s products or facilities, it could result in fines, injunctions, civil penalties, delays, suspension or withdrawal of clearances, seizures or recalls of products, operating restrictions, total shutdown of production facilities, prohibition on export or import and criminal prosecution. Such actions may have further indirect consequences for the manufacturer outside of the U.S., and may adversely affect the reputation of the manufacturer and the product. In the U.S., routine FDA inspections usually occur every two years, and may occur more often for cause. 11Table of ContentsTo a greater or lesser extent, most other countries require some form of quality system and regulatory compliance, which may include periodic inspections, inspections by third party auditors, and specialized documentation. Failure to meet all the requirements of these countries could jeopardize our ability to import, market, support, and receive reimbursement for the use of our products in these countries. In addition to the above, we may seek to conduct clinical studies or trials in the U.S. or other countries on products that have not yet been cleared or approved for a particular indication. Additional regulations govern the approval, initiation, conduct, documentation, and reporting of clinical studies to regulatory agencies in the countries or regions in which they are conducted. Such investigational use is generally also regulated by local and institutional requirements and policies which usually include review by an ethics committee or institutional review board (“IRB”). Failure to comply with all regulations governing such studies could subject the company to significant enforcement actions and sanctions, including halting of the study, seizure of investigational devices or data, sanctions against investigators, civil or criminal penalties, and other actions. Without the data from one or more clinical studies, it may not be possible for us to secure the data necessary to support certain regulatory submissions, to secure reimbursement, or demonstrate other requirements. We cannot provide assurance that access to clinical investigators, sites and subjects, documentation and data will be available on the terms and timeframes necessary. Products manufactured outside the U.S. by or for us are subject to U.S. Customs and FDA inspection upon entry into the U.S. We must demonstrate compliance of such products to U.S. regulations and carefully document the eventual distribution or re-exportation of such products. Failure to comply with all applicable regulations could prevent us from having access to products or components critical to the manufacture of finished products and lead to shortages and delays. California RegulationThe State of California requires that we obtain a license to manufacture medical devices and until 2012 conducted periodic inspections of medical device manufacturers. Our facilities and manufacturing processes were last inspected in July 2011 and were found to be in compliance. In accordance with the State of California regulations, our license to manufacture is renewed annually with any updated manufacturing information. Although the State of California has announced suspension of routine periodic inspections, there can be no assurance the State of California will not resume such inspections or conduct such inspections under specific circumstances which are not yet known. Foreign RegulationIn order for us to market our products in countries outside the United States, we must obtain regulatory approvals and comply with extensive product and quality system regulations in other countries. These regulations, including the requirements for approvals or clearance and the time required for regulatory review, vary from country to country. Some countries have regulatory review processes which are substantially longer than U.S. processes. Failure to obtain regulatory approval in a timely manner and to meet all local requirements including language and specific safety standards in any foreign country in which we plan to market our products could prevent us from marketing products in such countries or subject us to sanctions and fines. To be sold in Japan, most medical devices must undergo thorough safety examinations and demonstrate medical efficacy before they receive regulatory approval. We obtained from the Japanese Ministry of Health, Labor, and Welfare (“MHLW”) approval for our da Vinci Si Surgical Systems in October 2012 and approval for our da Vinci Xi Surgical Systems in March 2015. National reimbursement status was received in Japan for dVP procedures, effective April 2012 and for da Vinci partial nephrectomy procedures in April 2016. We are currently seeking reimbursement for additional procedures through the MHLW’s Senshin Iryo processes as well as alternative reimbursement processes. Our Senshin Iryo approvals require in-country clinical data and are considered for reimbursed status in April of even numbered years.Commercialization of medical devices in Europe is regulated by the European Union (“EU”). The EU presently requires that all medical products bear the Conformité Européenne (“CE”) mark, for compliance with the Medical Device Directive (93/42/EEC) as amended. The CE mark is an international symbol of adherence to certain essential principles of safety and performance mandated in applicable European medical device directives, which once affixed, enables a product to be sold in member countries of the EU and those affiliated countries which accept the CE mark. The CE mark is also recognized in many countries outside of the EU, such as Australia, and can assist in the clearance process. In order to affix the CE mark on products, a recognized European Notified Body must certify a manufacturer’s quality system and design dossier for compliance with international and European requirements. We have received authorization from Presafe Denmark A/S (formerly DGM Denmark A/S), a recognized European Notified Body and part of Nemko Presafe A/S, to affix the CE mark to our da Vinci Surgical System and EndoWrist instruments and accessories. To maintain authorization to apply the CE mark, we are subject to annual surveillance audits and periodic re-certification audits. In September 2013, the European Commission adopted a recommendation indicating that all Notified Bodies, including Presafe, should carry out unannounced audits, at least once every third year, of the manufacturers whose medical devices they have certified. These unannounced audits can also extend to the manufacturer’s critical suppliers or sub-contractors (those that supply a critical input or perform a critical function for the manufacturer). 12Table of ContentsIf we modify our existing products or develop new products in the future, we may need to apply for authorization to affix the CE mark to such products. We do not know whether we will be able to obtain authorization to affix the CE mark for new or modified products or whether we will continue to meet the safety and performance standards required to maintain the authorizations we have already received. If we are unable to maintain authorizations to affix the CE mark to our products, we will no longer be able to sell our products in member countries of the EU or those whose marketing authorizations are based on the CE mark. In April 2017, the Medical Device Regulation was adopted to replace the Medical Device Directive (93/42/EEC) as amended. The Medical Device Regulation will apply after a three-year transition period and imposes stricter requirements for the marketing and sale of medical devices and grants Notified Bodies increased post-market surveillance authority. We may be subject to risks associated with additional testing, modification, certification, or amendment of our existing market authorizations, or we may be required to modify products already installed at our customers’ facilities to comply with the official interpretations of these revised regulations.Regulations in other countries, including the requirements for approvals or clearance and the time required for regulatory review, vary from country to country. Certain countries, such as China and South Korea, have their own regulatory agencies. These countries typically require regulatory approvals and compliance with extensive safety and quality system regulations. Failure to obtain regulatory approval in any foreign country in which we plan to market our products, or failure to comply with any regulation in any foreign country in which we market our products, may negatively impact our ability to generate revenue and harm our business. Our system sales into China are also dependent on obtaining importation authorizations and hospitals completing a central purchasing tender process under the authorization, the most recent of which expired at the end of 2015. In addition, local regulations may apply which govern the use of our products and which could have an adverse effect on our product utilization if they are unfavorable. All such regulations are revised from time to time and in general are increasing in complexity, and in the scope and degree of documentation and testing required. There can be no assurance the outcomes from such documentation and testing will be acceptable to any particular regulatory agency or will continue to be acceptable over time. There are further regulations governing the importation, marketing, sale, distribution, use, and service as well as the removal and disposal of medical devices in the regions in which we operate and market our products. Failure to comply with any of these regulations could result in sanctions or fines, and could prevent us from marketing our products in these regions. Other Healthcare LawsWe are also subject to federal and state healthcare laws and regulations pertaining to fraud and abuse, physician payment transparency, privacy, and security laws and regulations. These laws include:•the federal Anti-Kickback Statute, which prohibits, among other things, persons from knowingly and willfully soliciting, receiving, offering or paying remuneration, directly or indirectly, in exchange for or to induce either the referral of an individual for, or the purchase, order or recommendation of, any good or service for which payment may be made under federal healthcare programs, such as the Medicare and Medicaid programs. A person or entity does not need to have actual knowledge of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute or specific intent to violate it to have committed a violation. In addition, the government may assert that a claim including items or services resulting from a violation of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute constitutes a false or fraudulent claim for purposes of the False Claims Act; •federal false claims laws which prohibit, among other things, individuals or entities from knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, claims for payment from Medicare, Medicaid or other federal third-party payors that are false or fraudulent; •the federal Civil Monetary Penalties Law, which prohibits, among other things, offering or transferring remuneration to a federal healthcare beneficiary that a person knows or should know is likely to influence the beneficiary’s decision to order or receive items or services reimbursable by the government from a particular provider or supplier;•federal criminal laws that prohibit executing a scheme to defraud any federal healthcare benefit program or making false statements relating to healthcare matters; •the federal Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, as amended by the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act, which governs the conduct of certain electronic healthcare transactions and protects the security and privacy of protected health information; •the federal Physician Payment Sunshine Act, which requires (i) manufacturers of drugs, devices, biologics and medical supplies for which payment is available under Medicare, Medicaid, or the Children’s Health Insurance Program (with certain exceptions) to report annually to the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (“CMS”) information related to payments or other “transfers of value” made to physicians (defined to include doctors, dentists, optometrists, podiatrists, and chiropractors) and teaching hospitals, and (ii) applicable manufacturers and group purchasing organizations to report annually to CMS ownership and investment interests held by the physicians described above 13Table of Contentsand their immediate family members, and payments or other “transfers of value” to such physician owners. Manufacturers are required to submit reports to CMS by the 90th day of each calendar year; and •analogous state and foreign law equivalents of each of the above federal laws, such as anti-kickback and false claims laws which may apply to items or services reimbursed by any third-party payor, including commercial insurers; state laws that require device companies to comply with the industry’s voluntary compliance guidelines and the applicable compliance guidance promulgated by the federal government or otherwise restrict payments that may be made to healthcare providers and other potential referral sources; state laws that require device manufacturers to report information related to payments and other “transfers of value” to physicians and other healthcare providers or marketing expenditures and pricing information; and state laws governing the privacy and security of health information in certain circumstances, many of which differ from each other in significant ways and may not have the same effect, thus complicating compliance efforts. If our operations are found to violate any of the laws described above or any other laws and regulations that apply to us, we may be subject to penalties, including civil and criminal penalties, damages, fines, the curtailment or restructuring of our operations, the exclusion from our participation in federal and state healthcare programs, and imprisonment, any of which could adversely affect our ability to market our products and materially adversely affect our business, results of operations, and financial condition. Any action against us for violation of these laws, even if we successfully defend against it, could cause us to incur significant legal expenses and divert our management’s attention from the operation of our business.Third-Party Coverage and ReimbursementIn the U.S. and most markets OUS where we sell our products, the government and health insurance companies together are responsible for hospital and surgeon reimbursement for virtually all covered surgical procedures. Governments and insurance companies generally reimburse hospitals and physicians for surgery when the procedure is considered medically necessary. In the U.S., CMS administers the Medicare and Medicaid programs (the latter, along with applicable state governments). Many other third-party payors model their reimbursement methodologies after the Medicare program. As the single largest payor, this program has a significant impact on other payors’ payment systems.Generally, reimbursement for professional services performed at a facility by physicians is reported under billing codes issued by the American Medical Association (“AMA”), known as Current Procedural Terminology (“CPT”) codes. Physician reimbursement under Medicare generally is based on a fee schedule and determined by the relative values of the professional service rendered. In addition, CMS and the National Center for Health Statistics (“NCHS”) are jointly responsible for overseeing changes and modifications to billing codes used by hospitals to report inpatient procedures, known as ICD-9-CM procedural codes prior to October 1, 2015, and ICD-10-PCS codes on and after October 1, 2015. For Medicare, CMS generally reimburses hospitals for services provided during an inpatient stay based on a prospective payment system that is determined by a classification system known as Medicare-Severity Diagnostic Related Groupings (“MS-DRGs”). MS-DRGs are assigned using a number of factors including the principal diagnosis, major procedures, discharged status, patient age, and complicating secondary diagnoses among 14Table of Contentsother things. Hospital outpatient services, reported by CPT codes, are assigned to clinically relevant Ambulatory Payment Classifications (“APCs”) used to determine the payment amount for services provided.On October 1, 2008, CMS and NCHS issued a new family of ICD-9-CM procedure codes for “Robotically Assisted Procedures.” The purpose of the ICD-9-CM family of procedure codes, 17.4X, was to gather data on robotic assisted surgical procedures. Since October 1, 2015, a new family of ICD-10-PCS codes can be used-in conjunction with other applicable procedure codes-to describe various robotic assisted procedures. An inpatient surgical procedure, completed with or without robotic assistance, continues to be assigned to the clinically relevant MS-DRG.Governments and insurance companies carefully review and increasingly challenge the prices charged for medical products and surgical services. Reimbursement rates from private companies vary depending on the procedure performed, the third-party payor, contract terms, and other factors. Because both hospitals and physicians may receive the same reimbursement for their respective services, with or without robotics, regardless of actual costs incurred by the hospital or physician in furnishing the care, including for the specific products used in that procedure, hospitals and physicians may decide not to use our products if reimbursement amounts are insufficient to cover any additional costs incurred when purchasing our products. Domestic institutions typically bill various third-party payors, such as Medicare, Medicaid, and other government programs and private insurance plans for the primary surgical procedure that includes our products. Because our da Vinci Surgical System has been cleared for commercial distribution in the U.S. by the FDA, coverage and reimbursement by payors are generally determined by the medical necessity of the primary surgical procedure. We believe that the additional procedures we intend to pursue are established surgical procedures that are generally already reimbursable by government agencies and insurance companies for appropriately selected patients. If hospitals do not obtain sufficient reimbursement from third-party payors for procedures performed with our products, or if governmental and private payors’ policies do not cover surgical procedures performed using our products, we may not be able to generate the revenues necessary to support our business. In countries outside the U.S., reimbursement is obtained from various sources, including governmental authorities, private health insurance plans, and labor unions. In most foreign countries, private insurance systems may also offer payments for some therapies. In addition, health maintenance organizations are emerging in certain European countries. To effectively conduct our business, we may need to seek OUS reimbursement approvals, and we do not know if these required approvals will be obtained in a timely manner or at all. In some countries, patients may be permitted to pay directly for surgical services; however, such “co-pay” practices are not common in most countries. In the U.S., there have been and continue to be a number of legislative initiatives to contain healthcare costs. In March 2010, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as amended by the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act (collectively, the “PPACA”), was enacted. The PPACA made changes that have significantly impacted healthcare providers, insurers, and pharmaceutical and medical device manufacturers. The PPACA contained a number of provisions designed to generate the revenues necessary to fund health insurance coverage expansion, including, but not limited to fees or taxes on certain health-related industries, including medical device manufacturers. For sales between January 1, 2013 and December 31, 2015, medical device manufacturers were required to pay an excise tax (or sales tax) of 2.3% on certain U.S. medical device revenues. Under this provision, we incurred Medical Device Excise Tax (“MDET”) of approximately $17.0 million in 2015 which was included as a cost of revenue and a reduction of product gross profit margin. The Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2016 (the “Appropriations Act”), enacted in December 2015, included a two-year moratorium on MDET such that medical device sales in 2016 and 2017 were exempt from the MDET. New legislation was passed in January 2018 such that MDET will be delayed until January 1, 2020. The PPACA also appropriated funding to research the comparative effectiveness of health care treatments and strategies. It remains unclear how this research will influence future Medicare coverage and reimbursement decisions, as well as influence other third-party payor coverage and reimbursement policies. The PPACA, as well as other federal or state health care reform measures that may be adopted in the future, could have a material adverse effect on our business. The taxes imposed by PPACA and the expansion in the government’s role in the U.S. healthcare industry may result in decreased profits, lower reimbursement from payors for procedures that use our products, and/or reduced procedural volumes, all of which may adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations. In addition, other legislative changes have been proposed and adopted since the PPACA was enacted. These changes included an aggregate reduction in Medicare payments to providers of up to 2% per fiscal year, which went into effect on April 1, 2013 and will remain in effect through 2025 unless additional Congressional action is taken. On January 2, 2013, the American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012 was signed into law, which, among other things, further reduced Medicare payments to several types of providers, including hospitals, imaging centers and cancer treatment centers. The Medicare Access and CHIP Reauthorization Act of 2015, enacted on April 16, 2015 (“MACRA”), repealed the formula by which Medicare made annual payment adjustments to physicians and replaced the former formula with fixed annual updates and a new system of incentive payments scheduled to begin in 2019 that are based on various performance measures and physicians’ participation in alternative payment models such as accountable care organizations. Individual states in the U.S. have also become increasingly aggressive in passing legislation and implementing 15Table of Contentsregulations designed to control product pricing, including price or patient reimbursement constraints and discounts, and require marketing cost disclosure and transparency measures.There have also been judicial and congressional challenges to certain aspects of the PPACA, as well as efforts by the U.S. administration to modify, repeal, or otherwise invalidate all, or certain provisions of, the PPACA. Since January 2017, the U.S. President has signed two Executive Orders designed to delay the implementation of certain provisions of the PPACA or otherwise circumvent some of the requirements for health insurance mandated by the PPACA. The current U.S. administration has also announced that it will discontinue the payment of cost-sharing reduction (“CSR”) payments to insurance companies until Congress approves the appropriation of funds for the CSR payments. The loss of the CSR payments is expected to increase premiums on certain policies issued by qualified health plans under the PPACA. A bipartisan bill to appropriate funds for CSR payments has been introduced in the Senate, but the future of that bill is uncertain. In addition, CMS has recently proposed regulations that would give states greater flexibility in setting benchmarks for insurers in the individual and small group marketplaces, which may have the effect of relaxing the essential health benefits required under the PPACA for plans sold through such marketplaces. Because of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act enacted on December 22, 2017, the PPACA's individual mandate penalty for not having health insurance coverage will be eliminated starting in 2019. Further, each chamber of Congress has put forth multiple bills designed to repeal or repeal and replace portions of the PPACA. Although the majority of these measures have not been enacted by Congress to date, Congress will likely continue to consider other legislation to repeal or repeal and replace elements of the PPACA. Any regulatory or legislative developments in domestic or foreign markets that eliminate or reduce reimbursement rates for procedures performed with our products could harm our ability to sell our products or cause downward pressure on the prices of our products, either of which would adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations. EmployeesAs of December 31, 2017, we had 4,444 employees, 597 of whom were engaged directly in research and development, 1,868 in manufacturing and service, and 1,979 in marketing, sales, and administrative activities. None of our employees are covered by a collective bargaining agreement, and we consider our relationship with our employees to be good.

Our financial results for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016, and 2015 are discussed in “Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” and “",2023-12-30 18:54:49.148054
1035267,ISRG,INTUITIVE SURGICAL INC,2019,"Item 7. Management Discussion and Analysis” for further details on the Joint Venture. No single customer accounted for more than 10% of revenue during the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017, and 2016. During the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017, and 2016, domestic revenue accounted for 71%, 73%, and 72%, respectively, of total revenue, while revenue from our OUS markets accounted for 29%, 27%, and 28%, respectively. As of December 31, 2018, and 2017, 88% and 88% of all long-lived assets were in the U.S., respectively.Our direct sales organization is composed of a capital sales team, responsible for selling da Vinci Surgical Systems, and a clinical sales team, responsible for supporting da Vinci Surgical System use in surgical procedures performed at our hospital accounts. Our hospital accounts include both individual hospitals and health care facilities and hospitals and health care facilities that are part of an integrated delivery network (“IDN groups”). The initial da Vinci Surgical System sale into an account as a major capital equipment purchase by our customers typically has a lengthy sales cycle that can be affected by macroeconomic factors, capital spending prioritization, timing of budgeting cycles, and competitive bidding processes. Capital sales activities include educating surgeons and hospital staff across multiple surgical specialties on the benefits of robotic-assisted surgery with a da Vinci Surgical System, total treatment costs, and the clinical applications that our technology enables. We also train our sales organization to educate hospital management on the potential benefits of adopting our technology, including clinical benefits of robotic-assisted surgery with a da Vinci Surgical System, potential reductions in complications and length of stay, and the resulting potential for increased patient satisfaction, surgeon recruitment, and procedure volume. Our clinical sales team works on site at hospitals, interacting with surgeons, operating room staff, and hospital administrators to develop and sustain successful robotic surgery programs. They assist the hospital in identifying surgeons who have an interest in robotic surgery and the potential benefits provided by the da Vinci Surgical System. Our clinical sales team provides current clinical information on robotic surgery practices and new product applications to the hospital teams. Our clinical sales team has grown with the expanded installed base of da Vinci Surgical Systems and the total number of procedures performed. We expect this organization to continue to grow as our business expands. Our customers place orders to replenish their supplies of instruments and accessories on a regular basis. Orders received are typically shipped within one business day. New direct customers who purchase a new da Vinci Surgical System typically place an initial stocking order of instruments and accessories soon after they receive their system. Our business is subject to seasonal fluctuations. Historically, our sales of da Vinci Surgical Systems have tended to be heaviest during the third month of each fiscal quarter, lighter in the first fiscal quarter and heavier in the fourth fiscal quarter. In addition, we have historically experienced lower procedure volume in the first and third fiscal quarters and higher procedure volume in the second and fourth fiscal quarters. In the U.S., procedure volumes for procedures associated with benign conditions are typically seasonally higher in the fourth quarter when more patients have met annual deductibles and lower in the first quarter when deductibles are reset. Seasonality outside the U.S. varies and is generally more pronounced around local holidays and vacation periods. The timing of procedures and changes in procedure volume impact the timing of instrument and accessory and capital purchases.Customer Support and Training ProgramsWe have a network of field service engineers across the U.S., Europe, and Asia and maintain relationships with various distributors around the globe. This infrastructure of service and support specialists offers a full complement of services for our customers, including 24/7 support, installation, repair, and maintenance. We generate service revenue by providing these services to our customers through comprehensive service contracts and time and material programs. 9Table of ContentsWe provide basic system training that teaches the fundamental operating principles of the da Vinci Surgical System to surgeons, surgical assistants, and operating room nurses. We have established training centers where system training and ongoing surgical procedural training are provided, the latter led by expert surgeons. Training technologies include our Simulation program which provides for independent da Vinci skills development through interactive VR exercises, and our telementoring program which provides real-time surgeon-to-surgeon learning and collaboration during robotic-assisted surgery.Research and DevelopmentWe focus our research and development efforts on innovation and improvement for products and services that align with our mission: We believe that minimally invasive care is life-enhancing care. Through ingenuity and intelligent technology, we believe we can expand the potential of physicians to heal without constraints. We employ engineering, research and development staff to focus on delivering future innovations and sustaining improvements that advance our mission. We establish strategic alliances with other medical and technology companies to complement our research and development effort. To date, these alliances have taken several forms, including cooperation in the areas of product development, training, procedure development, and marketing activities. We have formed alliances with several companies including, but not limited to, 3D Systems, Inc., Bolder Surgical Holdings, Inc. (formerly JustRight Surgical, LLC), Erbe Elektromedizin GmbH, InTouch Technology Inc., Johnson & Johnson, Mimic Technologies, Inc., Novadaq Technologies, Inc., Olympus Corporation, Schoelly Fiberoptic GmbH, and Trumpf Medical (a division of Hill-Rom Holdings, Inc.). ManufacturingWe manufacture our da Vinci Surgical Systems at our facilities in Sunnyvale, California and Durham, North Carolina. We manufacture our instruments at our Sunnyvale and Mexicali, Mexico facilities. We purchase both custom and off-the-shelf components from a large number of suppliers and subject them to stringent quality specifications and processes. Some of the components necessary for the assembly of our products are currently provided to us by sole-sourced suppliers (the only recognized supply source available to us) or single-sourced suppliers (the only approved supply source for us among other sources). We purchase the majority of our components and major assemblies through purchase orders rather than long-term supply agreements and generally do not maintain large volumes of finished goods relative to our anticipated demand. CompetitionWe face competition in the forms of existing open surgery, conventional MIS, drug therapies, radiation treatment, and emerging interventional surgical approaches. Our success depends on continued clinical and technical innovation, quality and reliability as well as educating hospitals, surgeons, and patients on the demonstrated results associated with robotic-assisted surgery using da Vinci Surgical Systems and its value relative to other techniques. We also face competition from several companies that are developing new approaches and products for the MIS market. We believe that many companies are focused on adding capability to manual MIS systems. Because many of these developments are aimed at MIS, we believe that our da Vinci Surgical Systems may prove complementary to some of these new technologies. Moreover, as we add new robotically controlled products (e.g. da Vinci Stapling and da Vinci Vessel Sealer Extend) that compete with product offerings traditionally within the domains of open surgery and/or conventional MIS, we face greater competition from larger and well established companies such as Ethicon Endo-Surgery, Inc. and Medtronic PLC. Furthermore, a number of companies have introduced products in the field of robotic surgery or have made explicit their intention to enter the field of robotic surgery including, but not limited to: Auris Health, Inc.; Avatera Medical GmbH; CMR Surgical Limited; Johnson & Johnson and Google Inc. and their joint venture, Verb Surgical Inc.; Medicaroid Inc.; MedRobotics Corp.; Medtronic PLC; meerecompany Inc.; Olympus Corp.; Samsung Corporation; Smart Robot Technology Group Co. Ltd.; Titan Medical Inc.; TransEnterix Inc.; and Wego Holding Co., Ltd. Other companies with substantial experience in industrial robotics could potentially expand into the field of surgical robotics and become a competitor. In addition, research efforts utilizing computers and robotics in surgery are underway at various companies and research institutions. Our revenues may be adversely impacted as our competitors announce their intent to enter our markets and as our customers anticipate the availability of competing products.Intellectual PropertyWe place considerable importance on obtaining and maintaining patent, copyright, trademark, and trade secret protection for significant new technologies, products, and processes. We generally rely upon a combination of intellectual property laws, as well as confidentiality procedures and contractual provisions, to protect our proprietary technology. For example, we have trademarks, both registered and unregistered, that provide distinctive identification of our products in the marketplace. We also have exclusive and non-exclusive patent licenses with various third parties to supplement our own robust patent portfolio. 10Table of ContentsAs of December 31, 2018, we held ownership or exclusive field-of-use licenses for more than 3,000 U.S. and foreign patents and more than 2,000 U.S. and foreign patent applications. We intend to continue filing new patent applications in the U.S. and foreign jurisdictions to seek protection for our technology. Patents are granted for finite terms. Upon expiration, the inventions claimed in a patent enter the public domain. Government RegulationOur products and operations are subject to regulation by the FDA, the State of California, and countries or regions in which we market our products. In addition, our products must meet the requirements of a large and growing body of international standards which govern the design, manufacture, materials content and sourcing, testing, certification, packaging, installation, use, and disposal of our products. We must continually keep abreast of these standards and requirements and integrate our compliance into the development and regulatory documentation for our products. Failure to meet these standards could limit our ability to market our products in those regions which require compliance to such standards. Examples of standards to which we are subject include electrical safety standards such as those of the International Electrotechnical Commission (e.g. IEC 60601-ss series of standards), and composition standards such as the Reduction of Hazardous Substances (“RoHS”) and the Waste Electrical and Electronic Equipment (“WEEE”) Directives. United StatesThe FDA regulates the development, testing, manufacturing, labeling, storage, recordkeeping, promotion, marketing, distribution, and service of medical devices in the U.S. to ensure that medical products distributed domestically are safe and effective for their intended uses. In addition, the FDA regulates the export of medical devices manufactured in the U.S. to markets outside of the U.S. and the importation of medical devices manufactured abroad. Under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (“FFDCA”), medical devices are classified into one of three classes—Class I, Class II or Class III—depending on the degree of risk associated with each medical device and the extent of control needed to ensure safety and effectiveness. Our current products are Class II medical devices. Class II devices are those which are subject to general controls and most require premarket demonstration of adherence to certain performance standards or other special controls, as specified by the FDA, and clearance by the FDA. Premarket review and clearance by the FDA for these devices is accomplished through the 510(k) premarket notification process. Unless a Class II device is exempt from premarket review, the manufacturer must submit to the FDA a premarket notification submission demonstrating that the device is “substantially equivalent” in intended use and technology to a “predicate device” that is either: •a device that has grandfather marketing status because it was legally marketed prior to May 28, 1976, the date upon which the Medical Device Amendments of 1976 were enacted; or•a device that has previously been cleared through the 510(k) process. If the FDA agrees that the device is substantially equivalent to a predicate device, it will grant clearance to commercially market the device in the U.S. The FDA has a statutory 90-day period to respond to a 510(k) submission, or a guidance-based 30-day period for “special” 510(k) submissions which have a more restrictive scope and generally involve more specific or very limited changes to a legally marketed device. As a practical matter, clearance often takes longer. The FDA may require further information, including clinical data, to make a determination regarding substantial equivalence. If the FDA determines that the device, or its intended use, is not “substantially equivalent,” the FDA may deny the request for clearance. Although unlikely for the types of products marketed by us, the FDA may classify the device, or the particular use of the device, into Class III, and the device sponsor must then fulfill more rigorous pre-market approval (“PMA”) requirements. A PMA application, which is intended to demonstrate that a device is safe and effective, must be supported by data, typically including data from preclinical studies and human clinical trials. The FDA, by statute and regulation, has 180 days to review a PMA application, though the review more often occurs over a significantly longer period of time, and can take up to several years. In approving a PMA application or clearing a 510(k) submission, the FDA may also require some form of post-market surveillance when necessary to protect the public health or to provide additional safety and effectiveness data for the device. In such cases, the manufacturer might be required to follow certain patient groups for a number of years and make periodic reports to the FDA on the clinical status of those patients.After a device receives FDA 510(k) clearance, any modification that could significantly affect its safety or effectiveness, or that would constitute a major change in its intended use, requires a new 510(k) clearance or could require a PMA application approval. The FDA requires each manufacturer to make the determination of whether a modification requires a new 510(k) notification or PMA application in the first instance, but the FDA can review any such decision. If the FDA disagrees with a manufacturer’s decision not to seek a new 510(k) clearance or PMA approval for a particular change, the FDA may retroactively require the manufacturer to seek 510(k) clearance or PMA approval. The FDA also can require the manufacturer to cease U.S. marketing and/or recall the modified device until 510(k) clearance or PMA approval is obtained. In addition, after a device is placed on the market, numerous FDA and other regulatory requirements continue to apply. These include establishment registration and device listing with the FDA; compliance with medical device reporting regulations, which 11Table of Contentsrequire that manufacturers report to the FDA if their device may have caused or contributed to a death or serious injury or malfunctioned in a way that would likely cause or contribute to a death or serious injury if it were to recur; and compliance with corrections and removal reporting regulations, which require that manufacturers report to the FDA field corrections and product recalls or removals if undertaken to reduce a risk to health posed by the device or to remedy a violation of the FFDCA that may present a risk to health. The FDA and the Federal Trade Commission (“FTC”) also regulate the advertising and promotion of our products to ensure that the claims we make are consistent with our regulatory clearances, that there is scientific data to substantiate the claims and that our advertising is neither false nor misleading. In general, we may not promote or advertise our products for uses not within the scope of our intended use statement in our clearances or make unsupported safety and effectiveness claims. Many regulatory jurisdictions outside of the U.S. have similar regulations to which we are subject. Our manufacturing processes are required to comply with the FDA’s Good Manufacturing Practice (“GMP”) requirements contained in its Quality System Regulation (“QSR”) and associated regulations and guidance. The QSR covers, among other things, the methods used in, and the facilities and controls used for, the design, manufacture, packaging, labeling, storage, installation, and servicing of all medical devices intended for human use. The QSR also requires maintenance of extensive records which demonstrate compliance with FDA regulation, the manufacturer’s own procedures, specifications, and testing as well as distribution and post-market experience. Compliance with the QSR is necessary to receive FDA clearance or approval to market new products and is necessary for a manufacturer to be able to continue to market cleared or approved product offerings in the U.S. A company’s facilities, records, and manufacturing processes are subject to periodic scheduled or unscheduled inspections by the FDA, which may issue reports known as Forms FDA 483 or Notices of Inspectional Observations which list instances where the FDA investigator believes the manufacturer has failed to comply with applicable regulations and/or procedures. If the observations are sufficiently serious or the manufacturer fails to respond appropriately, the FDA may issue Warning Letters, or Untitled Letters, which are notices of potential enforcement actions against the manufacturer. If a Warning Letter or Untitled Letter is not addressed to the satisfaction of the FDA, or if the FDA becomes aware of any other serious issue with a manufacturer’s products or facilities, it could result in fines, injunctions, civil penalties, delays, suspension or withdrawal of clearances, seizures or recalls of products, operating restrictions, total shutdown of production facilities, prohibition on export or import and criminal prosecution. Such actions may have further indirect consequences for the manufacturer outside of the U.S., and may adversely affect the reputation of the manufacturer and the product. To a greater or lesser extent, most other countries require some form of quality system and regulatory compliance, which may include periodic inspections, inspections by third-party auditors, and specialized documentation. Failure to meet all the requirements of these countries could jeopardize our ability to import, market, support, and receive reimbursement for the use of our products in these countries. In addition to the above, we may seek to conduct clinical studies or trials in the U.S. or other countries on products that have not yet been cleared or approved for a particular indication. Additional regulations govern the approval, initiation, conduct, documentation, and reporting of clinical studies to regulatory agencies in the countries or regions in which they are conducted. Such investigational use is generally also regulated by local and institutional requirements and policies which usually include review by an ethics committee or institutional review board (“IRB”). Failure to comply with all regulations governing such studies could subject the company to significant enforcement actions and sanctions, including halting of the study, seizure of investigational devices or data, sanctions against investigators, civil or criminal penalties, and other actions. Without the data from one or more clinical studies, it may not be possible for us to secure the data necessary to support certain regulatory submissions, to secure reimbursement, or demonstrate other requirements. We cannot provide assurance that access to clinical investigators, sites and subjects, documentation and data will be available on the terms and timeframes necessary. Products manufactured outside the U.S. by or for us are subject to U.S. Customs and FDA inspection upon entry into the U.S. We must demonstrate compliance of such products to U.S. regulations and carefully document the eventual distribution or re-exportation of such products. Failure to comply with all applicable regulations could prevent us from having access to products or components critical to the manufacture of finished products and lead to shortages and delays. California RegulationThe State of California requires that we obtain a license to manufacture medical devices and until 2012 conducted periodic inspections of medical device manufacturers. Our facilities and manufacturing processes were last inspected in July 2011 and were found to be in compliance. In accordance with the State of California regulations, our license to manufacture is renewed annually with any updated manufacturing information. Although the State of California has announced suspension of routine periodic inspections, there can be no assurance the State of California will not resume such inspections or conduct such inspections under specific circumstances which are not yet known. Foreign RegulationIn order for us to market our products in countries outside the United States, we must obtain regulatory approvals and comply with extensive product and quality system regulations in other countries. These regulations, including the requirements for approvals or clearance and the time required for regulatory review, vary from country to country. Some countries have regulatory review 12Table of Contentsprocesses which are substantially longer than U.S. processes. Failure to obtain regulatory approval in a timely manner and to meet all local requirements including language and specific safety standards in any foreign country in which we plan to market our products could prevent us from marketing products in such countries or subject us to sanctions and fines. To be sold in Japan, most medical devices must undergo thorough safety examinations and demonstrate medical efficacy before they receive regulatory approval. We obtained from the Japanese Ministry of Health, Labor, and Welfare (“MHLW”) approval for our da Vinci Si Surgical Systems in October 2012 and approval for our da Vinci Xi Surgical Systems in March 2015, and approval for our da Vinci X Surgical Systems in April 2018. National reimbursement status was received in Japan for dVP procedures, effective April 2012 and for da Vinci partial nephrectomy procedures in April 2016. An additional 12 da Vinci procedures were granted reimbursement effective April 1, 2018, including gastrectomy, anterior resection, lobectomy and hysterectomy, for both malignant and benign conditions. These additional 12 reimbursed procedures have varying levels of conventional laparoscopic penetration and will be reimbursed at rates equal to the conventional laparoscopic procedures. Given the reimbursement level and laparoscopic penetration for these procedures, there can be no assurance that adoption will occur or, that the adoption pace for these procedures will be similar to any other da Vinci procedure. If these procedures are not adopted and we are not successful in obtaining adequate procedure reimbursements for additional procedures, then the demand for our products in Japan could be limited. We are currently seeking reimbursement for additional procedures through the MHLW’s Senshin Iryo processes as well as alternative reimbursement processes. Our Senshin Iryo approvals require in-country clinical data and are considered for reimbursed status in April of even numbered years.Commercialization of medical devices in Europe is regulated by the European Union (“EU”). The EU presently requires that all medical products bear the Conformité Européenne (“CE”) mark, for compliance with the Medical Device Directive (93/42/EEC) as amended. The CE mark is an international symbol of adherence to certain essential principles of safety and performance mandated in applicable European medical device directives, which once affixed, enables a product to be sold in member countries of the EU and those affiliated countries which accept the CE mark. The CE mark is also recognized in many countries outside of the EU, such as Australia, and can assist in the clearance process. In order to affix the CE mark on products, a recognized European Notified Body must certify a manufacturer’s quality system and design dossier for compliance with international and European requirements. We have received authorization from Presafe Denmark A/S (formerly DGM Denmark A/S), a recognized European Notified Body and part of Nemko Presafe A/S, to affix the CE mark to our da Vinci Surgical System and EndoWrist instruments and accessories. To maintain authorization to apply the CE mark, we are subject to annual surveillance audits and periodic re-certification audits. In September 2013, the European Commission adopted a recommendation indicating that all Notified Bodies, including Presafe, should carry out unannounced audits, at least once every third year, of the manufacturers whose medical devices they have certified. These unannounced audits can also extend to the manufacturer’s critical suppliers or sub-contractors (those that supply a critical input or perform a critical function for the manufacturer). If we modify our existing products or develop new products in the future, we may need to apply for authorization to affix the CE mark to such products. We do not know whether we will be able to obtain authorization to affix the CE mark for new or modified products or whether we will continue to meet the safety and performance standards required to maintain the authorizations we have already received. If we are unable to maintain authorizations to affix the CE mark to our products, we will no longer be able to sell our products in member countries of the EU or those whose marketing authorizations are based on the CE mark. In May 2017, the Medical Device Regulation was implemented to replace the Medical Device Directive (93/42/EEC) as amended. The Medical Device Regulation will apply after a three-year transition period and imposes stricter requirements for the marketing and sale of medical devices and grants Notified Bodies increased post-market surveillance authority. We may be subject to risks associated with additional testing, modification, certification, or amendment of our existing market authorizations, or we may be required to modify products already installed at our customers’ facilities to comply with the official interpretations of these revised regulations.Regulations in other countries, including the requirements for approvals or clearance and the time required for regulatory review, vary from country to country. Certain countries, such as China and South Korea, have their own regulatory agencies. These countries typically require regulatory approvals and compliance with extensive safety and quality system regulations. Failure to obtain regulatory approval in any foreign country in which we plan to market our products, or failure to comply with any regulation in any foreign country in which we market our products, may negatively impact our ability to generate revenue and harm our business. Our system sales into China are also dependent on obtaining importation authorizations, provincial approvals, and hospitals completing a tender process under the authorization. In October 2018, the China National Health Commission published on its official website the quota for major medical equipment to be imported and sold in China through 2020. The government will allow the sale of 154 new surgical robots into China, which could include da Vinci Surgical Systems as well as surgical systems introduced by others. Da Vinci Surgical systems sales under the quota are uncertain. In addition, local regulations may apply which govern the use of our products and which could have an adverse effect on our product utilization if they are unfavorable. All such regulations are revised from time to time and in general are increasing in complexity, and in the scope and degree of documentation and testing required. There can be no assurance the outcomes from such documentation and testing will be acceptable to any particular regulatory agency or will continue to be acceptable over time. There are further regulations governing the importation, 13Table of Contentsmarketing, sale, distribution, use, and service as well as the removal and disposal of medical devices in the regions in which we operate and market our products. Failure to comply with any of these regulations could result in sanctions or fines and could prevent us from marketing our products in these regions. Other Healthcare LawsWe are also subject to federal and state healthcare laws and regulations pertaining to fraud and abuse, physician payment transparency, privacy, and security laws and regulations. These laws include:•the federal Anti-Kickback Statute, which prohibits, among other things, persons from knowingly and willfully soliciting, receiving, offering or paying remuneration, directly or indirectly, in exchange for or to induce either the referral of an individual for, or the purchase, order or recommendation of, any good or service for which payment may be made under federal healthcare programs, such as the Medicare and Medicaid programs. A person or entity does not need to have actual knowledge of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute or specific intent to violate it to have committed a violation. In addition, the government may assert that a claim including items or services resulting from a violation of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute constitutes a false or fraudulent claim for purposes of the False Claims Act; •federal false claims laws which prohibit, among other things, individuals or entities from knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, claims for payment from Medicare, Medicaid or other federal third-party payors that are false or fraudulent. Private individuals can bring False Claims Act “qui tam” actions, on behalf of the government and such individuals may share in amounts paid by the entity to the government in fines or settlement;•the federal Civil Monetary Penalties Law, which prohibits, among other things, offering or transferring remuneration to a federal healthcare beneficiary that a person knows or should know is likely to influence the beneficiary’s decision to order or receive items or services reimbursable by the government from a particular provider or supplier;•federal criminal laws that prohibit executing a scheme to defraud any federal healthcare benefit program or making false statements relating to healthcare matters; •the federal Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, as amended by the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act, which governs the conduct of certain electronic healthcare transactions and protects the security and privacy of protected health information; •the federal Physician Payment Sunshine Act, which requires (i) manufacturers of drugs, devices, biologics and medical supplies for which payment is available under Medicare, Medicaid, or the Children’s Health Insurance Program (with certain exceptions) to report annually to the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (“CMS”) information related to payments or other “transfers of value” made to physicians (defined to include doctors, dentists, optometrists, podiatrists, and chiropractors), certain other healthcare professionals, and teaching hospitals, and (ii) applicable manufacturers and group purchasing organizations to report annually to CMS ownership and investment interests held by the physicians described above and their immediate family members, and payments or other “transfers of value” to such physician owners. Manufacturers are required to submit reports to CMS by the 90th day of each calendar year; and •analogous state and foreign law equivalents of each of the above federal laws, such as anti-kickback and false claims laws which may apply to items or services reimbursed by any third-party payor, including commercial insurers; state laws that require device companies to comply with the industry’s voluntary compliance guidelines and the applicable compliance guidance promulgated by the federal government or otherwise restrict payments that may be made to healthcare providers and other potential referral sources; state laws that require device manufacturers to report information related to payments and other “transfers of value” to physicians and other healthcare providers or marketing expenditures and pricing information; and laws governing the privacy and security of health information in certain circumstances, including the E.U. General Data Protection Regulation (“GDPR”), many of which differ from each other in significant ways and may not have the same effect, thus complicating compliance efforts. If our operations are found to violate any of the laws described above or any other laws and regulations that apply to us, we may be subject to penalties, including civil and criminal penalties, damages, fines, the curtailment or restructuring of our operations, the exclusion from our participation in federal and state healthcare programs, and imprisonment, any of which could adversely affect our ability to market our products and materially adversely affect our business, results of operations, and financial condition. Any action against us for violation of these laws, even if we successfully defend against it, could cause us to incur significant legal expenses and divert our management’s attention from the operation of our business.Third-Party Coverage and ReimbursementIn the U.S. and most markets OUS where we sell our products, the government and health insurance companies together are responsible for hospital and surgeon reimbursement for virtually all covered surgical procedures. Governments and insurance companies generally reimburse hospitals and physicians for surgery when the procedure is considered medically necessary. In the 14Table of ContentsU.S., CMS administers the Medicare and Medicaid programs (the latter, along with applicable state governments). Many other third-party payors model their reimbursement methodologies after the Medicare program. As the single largest payor, this program has a significant impact on other payors’ payment systems.Generally, reimbursement for professional services performed at a facility by physicians is reported under billing codes issued by the American Medical Association (“AMA”), known as Current Procedural Terminology (“CPT”) codes. Physician reimbursement under Medicare generally is based on a fee schedule and determined by the relative values of the professional service rendered. In addition, CMS and the National Center for Health Statistics (“NCHS”) are jointly responsible for overseeing changes and modifications to billing codes used by hospitals to report inpatient procedures, ICD-10-PCS codes. For Medicare, CMS generally reimburses hospitals for services provided during an inpatient stay based on a prospective payment system that is determined by a classification system known as Medicare-Severity Diagnostic Related Groupings (“MS-DRGs”). MS-DRGs are assigned using a number of factors including the principal diagnosis, major procedures, discharged status, patient age, and complicating secondary diagnoses among other things. Hospital outpatient services, reported by CPT codes, are assigned to clinically relevant Ambulatory Payment Classifications (“APCs”) used to determine the payment amount for services provided.Since October 1, 2015, a new family of ICD-10-PCS codes can be used-in conjunction with other applicable procedure codes-to describe various robotic-assisted procedures. An inpatient surgical procedure, completed with or without robotic assistance, continues to be assigned to the clinically relevant MS-DRG.Governments and insurance companies carefully review and increasingly challenge the prices charged for medical products and surgical services. Reimbursement rates from private companies vary depending on the procedure performed, the third-party payor, contract terms, and other factors. Because both hospitals and physicians may receive the same reimbursement for their respective services, with or without robotics, regardless of actual costs incurred by the hospital or physician in furnishing the care, including for the specific products used in that procedure, hospitals and physicians may decide not to use our products if reimbursement amounts are insufficient to cover any additional costs incurred when purchasing our products. Domestic institutions typically bill various third-party payors, such as Medicare, Medicaid, and other government programs and private insurance plans for the primary surgical procedure that includes our products. Because our da Vinci Surgical System has been cleared for commercial distribution in the U.S. by the FDA, coverage and reimbursement by payors are generally determined by the medical necessity of the primary surgical procedure. We believe that the additional procedures we intend to pursue are established surgical procedures that are generally already reimbursable by government agencies and insurance companies for appropriately selected patients. If hospitals do not obtain sufficient reimbursement from third-party payors for procedures performed with our products, or if governmental and private payors’ policies do not cover surgical procedures performed using our products, we may not be able to generate the revenues necessary to support our business. In countries outside the U.S., reimbursement is obtained from various sources, including governmental authorities, private health insurance plans, and labor unions. In most foreign countries, private insurance systems may also offer payments for some therapies. In addition, health maintenance organizations are emerging in certain European countries. To effectively conduct our business, we may need to seek OUS reimbursement approvals, and we do not know if these required approvals will be obtained in a timely manner or at all. In some countries, patients may be permitted to pay directly for surgical services; however, such “co-pay” practices are not common in most countries. In the U.S., there have been and continue to be a number of legislative initiatives to contain healthcare costs. In March 2010, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as amended by the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act (collectively, the “PPACA”), was enacted. The PPACA made changes that have significantly impacted healthcare providers, insurers, and pharmaceutical and medical device manufacturers. The PPACA contained a number of provisions designed to generate the revenues necessary to fund health insurance coverage expansion including, but not limited to, fees or taxes on certain health-related industries, including medical device manufacturers. For sales between January 1, 2013 and December 31, 2015, medical device manufacturers were required to pay an excise tax (or sales tax) of 2.3% on certain U.S. medical device revenues. The Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2016 (the “Appropriations Act”), enacted in December 2015, included a two-year moratorium on Medical Device Excise Tax (“MDET”) such that medical device sales in 2016 and 2017 were exempt from the MDET. Subsequent legislation was passed in January 2018 such that MDET will be delayed until January 1, 2020. The PPACA also appropriated funding to research the comparative effectiveness of health care treatments and strategies. It remains unclear how this research will influence future Medicare coverage and reimbursement decisions, as well as influence other third-party payor coverage and reimbursement policies. The PPACA, as well as other federal or state health care reform measures that may be adopted in the future, could have a material adverse effect on our business. The taxes imposed by PPACA and the expansion in the government’s role in the U.S. healthcare industry may result in decreased profits, lower reimbursement from payors for procedures that use our products, and/or reduced procedural volumes, all of which may adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations. In addition, other legislative changes have been proposed and adopted since the PPACA was enacted. These changes included an aggregate reduction in Medicare payments to providers of up to 2% per fiscal year, which went into effect on April 1, 2013 and 15Table of Contentswill remain in effect through 2027 unless additional Congressional action is taken. On January 2, 2013, the American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012 was signed into law, which, among other things, further reduced Medicare payments to several types of providers, including hospitals, imaging centers and cancer treatment centers. The Medicare Access and CHIP Reauthorization Act of 2015, enacted on April 16, 2015 (“MACRA”), repealed the formula by which Medicare made annual payment adjustments to physicians and replaced the former formula with fixed annual updates and a new system of incentive payments scheduled to begin in 2019 that are based on various performance measures and physicians’ participation in alternative payment models such as accountable care organizations. Individual states in the U.S. have also become increasingly aggressive in passing legislation and implementing regulations designed to control product pricing, including price or patient reimbursement constraints and discounts, and require marketing cost disclosure and transparency measures.There have also been judicial and congressional challenges to certain aspects of the PPACA, as well as efforts by the U.S. administration to modify, repeal, or otherwise invalidate all, or certain provisions of, the PPACA. Since January 2017, the U.S. President has signed two Executive Orders designed to delay the implementation of certain provisions of the PPACA or otherwise circumvent some of the requirements for health insurance mandated by the PPACA. The current U.S. administration has also announced that it will discontinue the payment of cost-sharing reduction (“CSR”) payments to insurance companies until Congress approves the appropriation of funds for the CSR payments. The loss of the CSR payments is expected to increase premiums on certain policies issued by qualified health plans under the PPACA. A bipartisan bill to appropriate funds for CSR payments has been introduced in the Senate, but the future of that bill is uncertain. In addition, CMS has recently proposed regulations that would give states greater flexibility in setting benchmarks for insurers in the individual and small group marketplaces, which may have the effect of relaxing the essential health benefits required under the PPACA for plans sold through such marketplaces. Because of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (“2017 Tax Act”) enacted on December 22, 2017, the PPACA’s individual mandate penalty for not having health insurance coverage will be eliminated starting in 2019. Further, each chamber of Congress has put forth multiple bills designed to repeal or repeal and replace portions of the PPACA. On December 14, 2018, a U.S. District Court Judge in the Northern District of Texas, ruled that the individual mandate is a critical and inseverable feature of the ACA, and therefore, because it was repealed as part of the 2017 Tax Act, the remaining provisions of the ACA are invalid as well. While the current White House Administration and CMS have both stated that the ruling will have no immediate effect, it is unclear how this decision, subsequent appeals, if any, and other efforts to repeal and replace the ACA will impact the ACA and our business. Although the majority of these measures have not been enacted by Congress to date, Congress will likely continue to consider other legislation to repeal or repeal and replace elements of the PPACA. Any regulatory or legislative developments in domestic or foreign markets that eliminate or reduce reimbursement rates for procedures performed with our products could harm our ability to sell our products or cause downward pressure on the prices of our products, either of which would adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations. EmployeesAs of December 31, 2018, we had 5,527 employees, 771 of whom were engaged directly in research and development, 2,341 in manufacturing and service, and 2,415 in marketing, sales, and administrative activities. None of our employees are covered by a collective bargaining agreement, and we consider our relationship with our employees to be good. GeneralWe make our periodic and current reports, including our Annual Reports on Form 10-K, Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q, Current Reports on Form 8-K, and any amendments to those reports, available free of charge, on our website as soon as practicable after such material is electronically filed or furnished with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”). Our website address is www.intuitive.com and the reports are filed under “SEC Filings,” on the Company—Investor Relations portion of our website. Periodically, we webcast Company announcements, product launch events, and executive presentations which can be viewed via our Investor Relations page on our website. In addition, we provide notifications of our material news including SEC filings, investor events, and press releases as part of our Investor Relations page on our website. The contents of our website are not intended to be incorporated by reference into this report or in any other report or document we file and any references to our website are intended to be inactive textual references only.

Further, references to the URLs for these websites are intended to be inactive textual references only.We operate our business as one segment as defined by U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. Our financial results for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017, and 2016 are discussed in “Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” and “",2023-12-30 18:54:49.615311
1035267,ISRG,INTUITIVE SURGICAL INC,2020,"Item 7. Management Discussion and Analysis” for further details on the Joint Venture. In the remainder of our markets outside of the U.S. (“OUS”), we provide our products through distributors. No single customer accounted for more than 10% of revenue during the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018, and 2017. During the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018, and 2017, domestic revenue accounted for 70%, 71%, and 73%, respectively, of total revenue, while revenue from our OUS markets accounted for 30%, 29%, and 27%, respectively, of total revenue. As of December 31, 2019, and 2018, 85% and 88% of all long-lived assets were in the U.S., respectively.Our direct sales organization is composed of a capital sales team, responsible for selling systems, and a clinical sales team, responsible for supporting system use in procedures performed at our hospital accounts. Our hospital accounts include both individual hospitals and healthcare facilities as well as hospitals and healthcare facilities that are part of an integrated delivery network (“IDN groups”). The initial system sale into an account is a major capital equipment purchase by our customers and typically has a lengthy sales cycle that can be affected by macroeconomic factors, capital spending prioritization, timing of budgeting cycles, and competitive bidding processes. Capital sales activities include educating surgeons or physicians and hospital staff across multiple specialties on the benefits of robotic-assisted surgery with a da Vinci Surgical System or robotic-assisted bronchoscopy with an Ion endoluminal system, total treatment costs, and the clinical applications that our technology enables. We also train our sales organization to educate hospital management on the potential benefits of adopting our technology, including the clinical benefits of robotic-assisted surgery with a da Vinci Surgical System or robotic-assisted bronchoscopy with an Ion endoluminal system, potential reductions in complications and length of stay, and the resulting potential for increased patient satisfaction, surgeon or physician recruitment, and procedure volume.10Table of ContentsOur clinical sales team works on site at hospitals, interacting with surgeons or physicians, operating room staff, and hospital administrators to develop and sustain successful robotic surgery or bronchoscopy programs. They assist the hospital in identifying surgeons or physicians who have an interest in robotic-assisted surgery or bronchosocpy and the potential benefits provided by the da Vinci Surgical System and the Ion endoluminal system. Our clinical sales team provides current clinical information on robotic-assisted surgery or bronchoscopy practices and new product applications to the hospital teams. Our clinical sales team has grown with the expanded installed base of da Vinci Surgical Systems, the new installed base of Ion endoluminal systems, and the total number of procedures performed. We expect this organization to continue to grow as our business expands.Our customers place orders to replenish their supplies of instruments and accessories on a regular basis. Orders received are typically shipped within one business day. New direct customers who purchase a new system typically place an initial stocking order of instruments and accessories soon after they receive their system. Our business is subject to seasonal fluctuations. Historically, our sales of da Vinci Surgical Systems have tended to be heavier in the fourth quarter and lighter in the first quarter, as hospital budgets are reset. In addition, we have historically experienced lower procedure volume in the first and third quarters and higher procedure volume in the second and fourth quarters. In the U.S., volumes for procedures associated with benign conditions are typically seasonally higher in the fourth quarter when more patients have met annual deductibles and lower in the first quarter when deductibles are reset. Seasonality outside the U.S. varies and is more pronounced around local holidays and vacation periods. The timing of procedures and changes in procedure volume impact the timing of instrument and accessory and capital purchases.Customer Support and Training ProgramsWe have a network of field service engineers across the U.S., Europe, and Asia and maintain relationships with various distributors around the globe. This infrastructure of service and support specialists offers a full complement of services for our customers, including 24/7 support, installation, repair, and maintenance. We generate service revenue by providing these services to our customers through comprehensive service contracts and time and material programs. We provide basic system training that teaches the fundamental operating principles of the systems to surgeons, surgical assistants, and operating room nurses. We have established training centers where system training and ongoing surgical procedural training are provided, the latter led by expert surgeons. Training technologies include our Simulation program, which provides independent da Vinci skills development through interactive VR exercises, and our telementoring program, which provides real-time surgeon-to-surgeon learning and collaboration during robotic-assisted surgery.Research and DevelopmentWe focus our research and development efforts on innovation and improvement for products and services that align with our mission: We believe that minimally invasive care is life-enhancing care. Through ingenuity and intelligent technology, we believe that we can expand the potential of physicians to heal without constraints. We employ engineering and research and development staff to focus on delivering future innovations and sustaining improvements that advance our mission. In certain instances, we complement our research and development effort through collaborations with other companies, such as Trumpf Medical (a division of Hill-Rom Holdings, Inc.).ManufacturingWe manufacture our systems at our facilities in Sunnyvale, California and Durham, North Carolina. We manufacture our instruments at our Sunnyvale and Mexicali, Mexico facilities. In 2019, we acquired certain assets and operations from Schölly Fiberoptic GmbH, and we are integrating endoscope manufacturing operations across multiple sites in Germany and the U.S., which is expected to be completed around the end of 2020.We purchase both custom and off-the-shelf components from a large number of suppliers and subject them to stringent quality specifications and processes. Some of the components necessary for the assembly of our products are currently provided to us by sole-sourced suppliers (the only recognized supply source available to us) or single-sourced suppliers (the only approved supply source for us among other sources). We purchase the majority of our components and major assemblies through purchase orders rather than long-term supply agreements and generally do not maintain large volumes of finished goods relative to our anticipated demand.11Table of ContentsCompetitionWe face competition in the forms of existing open surgery, conventional MIS, drug therapies, radiation treatment, and emerging interventional surgical approaches. Our success depends on continued clinical and technical innovation, quality and reliability, as well as educating hospitals, surgeons, and patients on the demonstrated results associated with robotic-assisted surgery using da Vinci Surgical Systems and its value relative to other techniques. We also face competition from several companies that are developing new approaches and products for the MIS market. We believe that many companies are focused on adding capabilities to manual MIS systems. Because many of these developments are aimed at MIS, we believe that our da Vinci Surgical Systems may prove complementary to some of these new technologies.Moreover, as we add new robotically controlled products (e.g., da Vinci Stapling and da Vinci Vessel Sealer Extend) that compete with product offerings traditionally within the domains of open surgery and/or conventional MIS, we face greater competition from larger and well established companies, such as Ethicon Endo-Surgery, Inc. and Medtronic plc.Furthermore, a number of companies have introduced products in the field of robotic-assisted surgery or have made explicit statements about their efforts to enter the field, including, but not limited to, the following companies: Avatera Medical GmbH; CMR Surgical Limited; Johnson & Johnson (including their wholly-owned subsidiaries Auris Health, Inc. and Verb Surgical Inc.); Medicaroid Inc.; MedRobotics Corp.; Medtronic plc; meerecompany Inc.; Olympus Corp.; Samsung Corporation; Smart Robot Technology Group Co. Ltd.; Titan Medical, Inc.; TransEnterix, Inc.; and Wego Holding Co., Ltd. Other companies with substantial experience in industrial robotics could potentially expand into the field of surgical robotics and become a competitor. In addition, research efforts utilizing computers and robotics in surgery are underway at various companies and research institutions. Our revenues may be adversely impacted as our competitors announce their intent to enter our markets and as our customers anticipate the availability of competing products.Intellectual PropertyWe place considerable importance on obtaining and maintaining patent, copyright, trademark, and trade secret protection for significant new technologies, products, and processes.We generally rely upon a combination of intellectual property laws, confidentiality procedures, and contractual provisions to protect our proprietary technology. For example, we have trademarks, both registered and unregistered, that provide distinctive identification of our products in the marketplace. We also have exclusive and non-exclusive patent licenses with various third parties to supplement our own robust patent portfolio.As of December 31, 2019, we held ownership or exclusive field-of-use licenses for more than 3,500 U.S. and foreign patents and more than 2,000 U.S. and foreign patent applications. We intend to continue filing new patent applications in the U.S. and foreign jurisdictions to seek protection for our technology.Patents are granted for finite terms. Upon expiration, the inventions claimed in a patent enter the public domain.Government RegulationOur products and operations are subject to regulation by the FDA, the State of California, and countries or regions in which we market our products. In addition, our products must meet the requirements of a large and growing body of international standards which govern the design, manufacture, materials content and sourcing, testing, certification, packaging, installation, use, and disposal of our products. We must continually keep abreast of these standards and requirements and integrate our compliance into the development and regulatory documentation for our products. Failure to meet these standards could limit our ability to market our products in those regions that require compliance to such standards. Examples of standards to which we are subject include electrical safety standards, such as those of the International Electrotechnical Commission (e.g., IEC 60601-ss series of standards), and composition standards, such as the Reduction of Hazardous Substances (“RoHS”) and the Waste Electrical and Electronic Equipment (“WEEE”) Directives.United States RegulationThe FDA regulates the development, testing, manufacturing, labeling, storage, recordkeeping, promotion, marketing, distribution, and service of medical devices in the U.S. to ensure that medical products distributed domestically are safe and effective for their intended uses. In addition, the FDA regulates the export of medical devices manufactured in the U.S. to markets outside of the U.S. and the importation of medical devices manufactured abroad.Under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (“FFDCA”), medical devices are classified into one of three classes—Class I, Class II, or Class III—depending on the degree of risk associated with each medical device and the extent of control needed to ensure safety and effectiveness. Our current products are Class II medical devices.12Table of ContentsClass II devices are those which are subject to general controls, and most require premarket demonstration of adherence to certain performance standards or other special controls, as specified by the FDA, and clearance by the FDA. Premarket review and clearance by the FDA for these devices is accomplished through the 510(k) premarket notification process. Unless a Class II device is exempt from a premarket review, the manufacturer must submit to the FDA a premarket notification submission demonstrating that the device is “substantially equivalent” in intended use and technology to a “predicate device” that is either:•a device that has grandfather marketing status, because it was legally marketed prior to May 28, 1976, the date upon which the Medical Device Amendments of 1976 were enacted; or•a device that has previously been cleared through the 510(k) process.If the FDA agrees that the device is substantially equivalent to a predicate device, it will grant clearance to commercially market the device in the U.S. The FDA has a statutory 90-day period to respond to a 510(k) submission, or a guidance-based 30-day period for “special” 510(k) submissions which have a more restrictive scope and generally involve more specific or very limited changes to a legally marketed device. As a practical matter, clearance often takes longer. The FDA may require further information, including clinical data, to make a determination regarding substantial equivalence. If the FDA determines that the device, or its intended use, is not “substantially equivalent,” the FDA may deny the request for clearance. Although unlikely for the types of products marketed by us, the FDA may classify the device, or the particular use of the device, into Class III, and the device sponsor must then fulfill more rigorous pre-market approval (“PMA”) requirements. A PMA application, which is intended to demonstrate that a device is safe and effective, must be supported by data, typically including data from preclinical studies and human clinical trials. The FDA, by statute and regulation, has 180 days to review a PMA application, although the review more often occurs over a significantly longer period of time, and can take up to several years. In approving a PMA application or clearing a 510(k) submission, the FDA may also require some form of post-market surveillance when necessary to protect the public health or to provide additional safety and effectiveness data for the device. In such cases, the manufacturer might be required to follow certain patient groups for a number of years and make periodic reports to the FDA on the clinical status of those patients.After a device receives FDA 510(k) clearance, any modification that could significantly affect its safety or effectiveness, or that would constitute a major change in its intended use, requires a new 510(k) clearance or could require a PMA application approval. The FDA requires each manufacturer to make the determination of whether a modification requires a new 510(k) notification or PMA application in the first instance, but the FDA can review any such decision. If the FDA disagrees with a manufacturer’s decision not to seek a new 510(k) clearance or PMA approval for a particular change, the FDA may retroactively require the manufacturer to seek 510(k) clearance or PMA approval. The FDA also can require the manufacturer to cease U.S. marketing and/or recall the modified device until 510(k) clearance or PMA approval is obtained.Over the last several years, the FDA has proposed reforms to its 510(k) clearance process, and such proposals could include increased requirements for clinical data and a longer review period, or could make it more difficult for manufacturers to utilize the 510(k) clearance process for their products. For example, in November 2018, FDA officials announced forthcoming steps that the FDA intends to take to modernize the premarket notification pathway under Section 510(k) of the FFDCA. Among other things, the FDA announced that it planned to develop proposals to drive manufacturers utilizing the 510(k) pathway toward the use of newer predicates. These proposals included plans to potentially sunset certain older devices that were used as predicates under the 510(k) clearance pathway and to potentially publish a list of devices that have been cleared on the basis of demonstrated substantial equivalence to predicate devices that are more than 10 years old. In May 2019, the FDA solicited public feedback on these proposals. These proposals have not yet been finalized or adopted, and the FDA may work with Congress to implement such proposals through legislation.More recently, in September 2019, the FDA finalized guidance describing an optional “safety and performance based” premarket review pathway for manufacturers of “certain, well-understood device types” to demonstrate substantial equivalence under the 510(k) clearance pathway by showing that such device meets objective safety and performance criteria established by the FDA, thereby obviating the need for manufacturers to compare the safety and performance of their medical devices to specific predicate devices in the clearance process. The FDA intends to develop and maintain a list of device types appropriate for the “safety and performance based” pathway and will continue to develop product-specific guidance documents that identify the performance criteria for each such device type, as well as the testing methods recommended in the guidance documents, where feasible.In addition, after a device is placed on the market, numerous FDA and other regulatory requirements continue to apply. These requirements include establishment registration and device listing with the FDA, compliance with medical device reporting regulations, which require that manufacturers report to the FDA if their device may have caused or contributed to a death or serious injury or malfunctioned in a way that would likely cause or contribute to a death or serious injury if it were to recur, and compliance with corrections and removal reporting regulations, which require that manufacturers report to the FDA field corrections and product recalls or removals if undertaken to reduce a risk to health posed by the device or to remedy a violation of the FFDCA that may present a risk to health. The FDA and the Federal Trade Commission (“FTC”) also regulate the advertising and promotion of our products to ensure that the claims we make are consistent with our regulatory clearances, 13Table of Contentsthat there is scientific data to substantiate the claims, and that our advertising is neither false nor misleading. In general, we may not promote or advertise our products for uses not within the scope of our intended use statement in our clearances or make unsupported safety and effectiveness claims. Many regulatory jurisdictions outside of the U.S. have similar regulations to which we are subject.Our manufacturing processes are required to comply with the FDA’s Good Manufacturing Practice (“GMP”) requirements contained in its Quality System Regulation (“QSR”) and associated regulations and guidance. The QSR covers, among other things, the methods used in, and the facilities and controls used for, the design, manufacture, packaging, labeling, storage, installation, and servicing of all medical devices intended for human use. The QSR also requires maintenance of extensive records, which demonstrate compliance with the FDA regulation, the manufacturer’s own procedures, specifications, and testing, as well as distribution and post-market experience. Compliance with the QSR is necessary to receive FDA clearance or approval to market new products and is necessary for a manufacturer to be able to continue to market cleared or approved product offerings in the U.S. A company’s facilities, records, and manufacturing processes are subject to periodic scheduled or unscheduled inspections by the FDA, which may issue reports known as Form FDA 483 or Notices of Inspectional Observations, which list instances where the FDA investigator believes the manufacturer has failed to comply with applicable regulations and/or procedures. If the observations are sufficiently serious or the manufacturer fails to respond appropriately, the FDA may issue Warning Letters, or Untitled Letters, which are notices of potential enforcement actions against the manufacturer. If a Warning Letter or Untitled Letter is not addressed to the satisfaction of the FDA or if the FDA becomes aware of any other serious issue with a manufacturer’s products or facilities, it could result in fines, injunctions, civil penalties, delays, suspension or withdrawal of clearances, seizures or recalls of products, operating restrictions, total shutdown of production facilities, prohibition on export or import, and criminal prosecution. Such actions may have further indirect consequences for the manufacturer outside of the U.S. and may adversely affect the reputation of the manufacturer and the product.To a greater or lesser extent, most other countries require some form of quality system and regulatory compliance, which may include periodic inspections, inspections by third-party auditors, and specialized documentation. Failure to meet all of the requirements of these countries could jeopardize our ability to import, market, support, and receive reimbursement for the use of our products in these countries.In addition to the above, we may seek to conduct clinical studies or trials in the U.S. or other countries on products that have not yet been cleared or approved for a particular indication. Additional regulations govern the approval, initiation, conduct, documentation, and reporting of clinical studies to regulatory agencies in the countries or regions in which they are conducted. Such investigational use is generally also regulated by local and institutional requirements and policies which usually include review by an ethics committee or institutional review board (“IRB”). Failure to comply with all regulations governing such studies could subject the Company to significant enforcement actions and sanctions, including halting of the study, seizure of investigational devices or data, sanctions against investigators, civil or criminal penalties, and other actions. Without the data from one or more clinical studies, it may not be possible for us to secure the data necessary to support certain regulatory submissions, secure reimbursement, or demonstrate other requirements. We cannot provide assurance that access to clinical investigators, sites, subjects, documentation, and data will be available on the terms and in the timeframes necessary.Products manufactured outside the U.S. by or for us are subject to U.S. Customs and FDA inspection upon entry into the U.S. We must demonstrate compliance of such products with U.S. regulations and carefully document the eventual distribution or re-exportation of such products. Failure to comply with all applicable regulations could prevent us from having access to products or components critical to the manufacture of finished products and lead to shortages and delays.California RegulationThe State of California requires that we obtain a license to manufacture medical devices and, until 2012, conducted periodic inspections of medical device manufacturers. Our facilities and manufacturing processes were last inspected in July 2011 and were found to be in compliance. In accordance with the State of California regulations, our license to manufacture is renewed annually with any updated manufacturing information. Although the State of California has announced the suspension of routine periodic inspections, there can be no assurance that the State of California will not resume such inspections or conduct such inspections under specific circumstances that are not yet known.Foreign RegulationIn order for us to market our products in countries outside the United States, we must obtain regulatory approvals and comply with extensive product and quality system regulations in other countries. These regulations, including the requirements for approvals or clearance and the time required for regulatory review, vary from country to country. Some countries have regulatory review processes that are substantially longer than U.S. processes. Failure to obtain regulatory approval in a timely manner and meet all of the local requirements including language and specific safety standards in any foreign country in which we plan to market our products could prevent us from marketing products in such countries or subject us to sanctions and fines.14Table of ContentsFor example, most medical devices must undergo thorough safety examinations and demonstrate medical efficacy before they receive regulatory approval to be sold in Japan. We obtained approval from the Japanese Ministry of Health, Labor, and Welfare (“MHLW”) for our da Vinci Si Surgical Systems in October 2012, for our da Vinci Xi Surgical Systems in March 2015, and for our da Vinci X Surgical Systems in April 2018. National reimbursement status in Japan was received for dVP procedures in April 2012 and for da Vinci partial nephrectomy procedures in April 2016. An additional 12 da Vinci procedures were granted reimbursement effective April 1, 2018, including gastrectomy, low anterior resection, lobectomy, and hysterectomy, for both malignant and benign conditions. These additional 12 reimbursed procedures have varying levels of conventional laparoscopic penetration and will be reimbursed at rates equal to the conventional laparoscopic procedures. Given the reimbursement level and laparoscopic penetration for these 12 procedures, there can be no assurance that adoption will occur or that the adoption pace for these procedures will be similar to any other da Vinci procedures. If these procedures are not adopted and we are not successful in obtaining adequate procedure reimbursements for additional procedures, then the demand for our products in Japan could be limited. We are currently seeking reimbursement for additional procedures through the MHLW’s Senshin Iryo processes as well as alternative reimbursement processes. Our Senshin Iryo approvals require in-country clinical data and are considered for reimbursed status in April of even-numbered years.Commercialization of medical devices in Europe is regulated by the European Union (“EU”). The EU presently requires that all medical products bear the Conformité Européenne (“CE”) mark for compliance with the Medical Device Directive (93/42/EEC) as amended. The CE mark is an international symbol of adherence to certain essential principles of safety and performance mandated in applicable European medical device directives, which, once affixed, enables a product to be sold in member countries of the EU and those affiliated countries that accept the CE mark. The CE mark is also recognized in many countries outside of the EU, such as Australia, and can assist in the clearance process. In order to affix the CE mark on products, a recognized European Notified Body must certify a manufacturer’s quality system and design dossier for compliance with international and European requirements. We have received authorization from Presafe Denmark A/S (formerly DGM Denmark A/S), a recognized European Notified Body and part of Nemko Presafe A/S, to affix the CE mark to our da Vinci Surgical Systems and EndoWrist instruments and accessories. To maintain authorization to apply the CE mark, we are subject to annual surveillance audits and periodic re-certification audits. In September 2013, the European Commission adopted a recommendation indicating that all Notified Bodies, including Presafe, should carry out unannounced audits at least once every third year, of the manufacturers whose medical devices they have certified. These unannounced audits can also extend to the manufacturer’s critical suppliers or sub-contractors (those that supply a critical input or perform a critical function for the manufacturer).If we modify our existing products or develop new products in the future, we may need to apply for authorization to affix the CE mark to such products. We do not know whether we will be able to obtain authorization to affix the CE mark for new or modified products or whether we will continue to meet the safety and performance standards required to maintain the authorizations we have already received. If we are unable to maintain authorizations to affix the CE mark to our products, we will no longer be able to sell our products in member countries of the EU or those whose marketing authorizations are based on the CE mark.In May 2017, the Medical Device Regulation was implemented to replace the Medical Device Directive (93/42/EEC) as amended. The Medical Device Regulation will apply after a three-year transition period and imposes stricter requirements for the marketing and sale of medical devices and grants Notified Bodies increased post-market surveillance authority. We may be subject to risks associated with additional testing, modification, certification, or amendment of our existing market authorizations, or we may be required to modify products already installed at our customers’ facilities to comply with the official interpretations of these revised regulations.Regulations in other countries, including the requirements for approvals or clearance and the time required for regulatory review, vary from country to country. Certain countries, such as China and South Korea, have their own regulatory agencies. These countries typically require regulatory approvals and compliance with extensive safety and quality system regulations. Failure to obtain regulatory approval in any foreign country in which we plan to market our products, or failure to comply with any regulation in any foreign country in which we market our products may negatively impact our ability to generate revenue and harm our business. Our system sales into China are also dependent on obtaining importation authorizations and provincial approvals, as well as hospitals completing a tender process under the authorization. In October 2018, the China National Health Commission published on its official website the quota for major medical equipment to be imported and sold in China through 2020. The government will allow the sale of 154 new surgical robots into China, which could include da Vinci Surgical Systems as well as surgical systems introduced by others. Sales of da Vinci Surgical Systems under the quota are uncertain, as they are dependent on hospitals completing a tender process and receiving associated approvals. In addition, local regulations may apply, which govern the use of our products and which could have an adverse effect on our product utilization if they are unfavorable. All such regulations are revised from time to time and, in general, are increasing in complexity, and in the scope and degree of documentation and testing required. There can be no assurance that the outcomes from such documentation and testing will be acceptable to any particular regulatory agency or will continue to be acceptable over time. There are further regulations governing the importation, marketing, sale, distribution, use, and service as well as the removal and disposal of 15Table of Contentsmedical devices in the regions in which we operate and market our products. Failure to comply with any of these regulations could result in sanctions or fines and could prevent us from marketing our products in these regions.Other Healthcare LawsWe are also subject to federal and state healthcare laws and regulations pertaining to fraud and abuse, physician payment transparency, privacy, and security laws and regulations. These laws include:•the federal Anti-Kickback Statute, which prohibits, among other things, persons from knowingly and willfully soliciting, receiving, offering, or paying remuneration, directly or indirectly, in exchange for or to induce either the referral of an individual for, or the purchase, order, or recommendation of, any good or service for which payment may be made under federal healthcare programs, such as the Medicare and Medicaid programs. A person or entity does not need to have actual knowledge of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute or specific intent to violate it to have committed a violation. In addition, the government may assert that a claim including items or services resulting from a violation of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute constitutes a false or fraudulent claim for purposes of the False Claims Act;•federal false claims laws that prohibit, among other things, individuals or entities from knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, claims for payment from Medicare, Medicaid, or other federal third-party payors that are false or fraudulent. Private individuals can bring False Claims Act “qui tam” actions on behalf of the government, and such individuals may share in amounts paid by the entity to the government in fines or settlement;•the federal Civil Monetary Penalties Law, which prohibits, among other things, offering or transferring remuneration to a federal healthcare beneficiary that a person knows or should know is likely to influence the beneficiary’s decision to order or receive items or services reimbursable by the government from a particular provider or supplier;•federal criminal laws that prohibit executing a scheme to defraud any federal healthcare benefit program or making false statements relating to healthcare matters;•the federal Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, as amended by the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act, which governs the conduct of certain electronic healthcare transactions and protects the security and privacy of protected health information;•the federal Physician Payment Sunshine Act, which requires (i) manufacturers of drugs, devices, biologics, and medical supplies for which payment is available under Medicare, Medicaid, or the Children’s Health Insurance Program (with certain exceptions) to report annually to the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (“CMS”) information related to payments or other “transfers of value” made to physicians (defined to include doctors, dentists, optometrists, podiatrists, and chiropractors), certain other healthcare professionals (as described below), and teaching hospitals, and (ii) applicable manufacturers and group purchasing organizations to report annually to CMS ownership any investment interests held by the physicians described above and their immediate family members and payments or other “transfers of value” to such physician owners. Additionally, on October 25, 2018, President Trump signed into law the “Substance Use-Disorder Prevention that Promoted Opioid Recovery and Treatment for Patients and Communities Act,” which, in part (under a provision entitled “Fighting the Opioid Epidemic with Sunshine”), extends the reporting and transparency requirements for physicians in the Physician Payments Sunshine Act to physician assistants, nurse practitioners, clinical nurse specialists, certified registered nurse anesthetists, and certified nurse midwives (with reporting requirements going into effect in 2022 for payments made in 2021). Manufacturers are required to submit reports to CMS by the 90th day of each calendar year; and•analogous state and foreign law equivalents of each of the above federal laws, such as anti-kickback and false claims laws, which may apply to items or services reimbursed by any third-party payor, including commercial insurers, state laws that require device companies to comply with the industry’s voluntary compliance guidelines and the applicable compliance guidance promulgated by the federal government or otherwise restrict payments that may be made to healthcare providers and other potential referral sources, state laws that require device manufacturers to report information related to payments and other “transfers of value” to physicians and other healthcare providers or marketing expenditures and pricing information, and laws governing the privacy and security of health information in certain circumstances, including the E.U. General Data Protection Regulation (“GDPR”), many of which differ from each other in significant ways and may not have the same effect, thus complicating compliance efforts.16Table of ContentsIf our operations are found to violate any of the laws described above or any other laws and regulations that apply to us, we may be subject to penalties, including civil and criminal penalties, damages, fines, the curtailment or restructuring of our operations, the exclusion from our participation in federal and state healthcare programs, and imprisonment, any of which could adversely affect our ability to market our products and materially adversely affect our business, results of operations, and financial condition. Any action against us for violation of these laws, even if we successfully defend against it, could cause us to incur significant legal expenses and divert our management’s attention from the operation of our business.Third-Party Coverage and ReimbursementIn the U.S. and most markets OUS where we sell our products, the government and health insurance companies together are responsible for hospital and surgeon reimbursement for virtually all covered surgical procedures. Governments and insurance companies generally reimburse hospitals and physicians for surgery when the procedure is considered medically necessary. In the U.S., CMS administers the Medicare and Medicaid programs (the latter, along with applicable state governments). Many other third-party payors model their reimbursement methodologies after the Medicare program. As the single largest payor, this program has a significant impact on other payors’ payment systems.Generally, reimbursement for professional services performed at a facility by physicians is reported under billing codes issued by the American Medical Association (“AMA”), known as Current Procedural Terminology (“CPT”) codes. Physician reimbursement under Medicare generally is based on a fee schedule and determined by the relative value of the professional service rendered. In addition, CMS and the National Center for Health Statistics (“NCHS”) are jointly responsible for overseeing changes and modifications to billing codes used by hospitals to report inpatient procedures, ICD-10-PCS codes. For Medicare, CMS generally reimburses hospitals for services provided during an inpatient stay based on a prospective payment system that is determined by a classification system known as Medicare-Severity Diagnostic Related Groupings (“MS-DRGs”). MS-DRGs are assigned using a number of factors, including the principal diagnosis, major procedures, discharged status, patient age, and complicating secondary diagnoses, among other things. Hospital outpatient services, reported by CPT codes, are assigned to clinically relevant Ambulatory Payment Classifications (“APCs”) used to determine the payment amount for services provided.Since October 1, 2015, a new family of ICD-10-PCS codes can be used, in conjunction with other applicable procedure codes, to describe various robotic-assisted procedures. An inpatient surgical procedure, completed with or without robotic assistance, continues to be assigned to the clinically relevant MS-DRG.Governments and insurance companies carefully review and increasingly challenge the prices charged for medical products and surgical services. Reimbursement rates from private companies vary depending on the procedure performed, the third-party payor, contract terms, and other factors. Because both hospitals and physicians may receive the same reimbursement for their respective services, with or without robotics, regardless of actual costs incurred by the hospital or physician in furnishing the care, including for the specific products used in that procedure, hospitals and physicians may decide not to use our products if reimbursement amounts are insufficient to cover any additional costs incurred when purchasing our products.Domestic institutions typically bill various third-party payors, such as Medicare, Medicaid, and other government programs and private insurance plans for the primary surgical procedure that includes our products. Because our da Vinci Surgical Systems have been cleared for commercial distribution in the U.S. by the FDA, coverage and reimbursement by payors are generally determined by the medical necessity of the primary surgical procedure. Governmental and third-party payors may also consider additional factors when determining coverage and reimbursement, including the designation of the surgical procedure as a covered benefit, the appropriateness of the procedure for the specific patient, support by guidelines established by the relevant professional college or medical society, and a payor determination that the procedure is neither experimental nor investigational. We believe that the additional procedures we intend to pursue are established surgical procedures that are generally already reimbursable by government agencies and insurance companies for appropriately selected patients. If hospitals do not obtain sufficient reimbursement from third-party payors for procedures performed with our products, or if governmental and private payors’ policies do not cover surgical procedures performed using our products, we may not be able to generate the revenues necessary to support our business.In countries outside the U.S., reimbursement is obtained from various sources, including governmental authorities, private health insurance plans, and labor unions. In most foreign countries, private insurance systems may also offer payments for some therapies. In addition, health maintenance organizations are emerging in certain European countries. To effectively conduct our business, we may need to seek OUS reimbursement approvals, and we do not know if these required approvals will be obtained in a timely manner or at all. In some countries, patients may be permitted to pay directly for surgical services; however, such “co-pay” practices are not common in most countries.In the U.S., there have been, and continue to be, a number of legislative initiatives to contain healthcare costs. In March 2010, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as amended by the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act (collectively, the “PPACA”), was enacted. The PPACA made changes that have significantly impacted healthcare providers, insurers, and pharmaceutical and medical device manufacturers. The PPACA contained a number of provisions designed to 17Table of Contentsgenerate the revenues necessary to fund health insurance coverage expansion, including, but not limited to, fees or taxes on certain health-related industries, including medical device manufacturers. The U.S. Medical Device Excise Tax (""MDET"") initially became effective on January 1, 2013. For sales between January 1, 2013 and December 31, 2015, medical device manufacturers were required to pay an excise tax (or sales tax) of 2.3% on certain U.S. medical device revenues. In December 2015, the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2016 (the “Appropriations Act”) was signed into law. The Appropriations Act included a two-year moratorium on the MDET such that medical device sales in 2016 and 2017 were exempt from the excise tax. This moratorium was extended through December 31, 2019, by the Extension of Continuing Appropriations Act of 2018, signed into law on January 22, 2018. The MDET was repealed in December 2019.The PPACA also appropriated funding to research the comparative effectiveness of healthcare treatments and strategies. It remains unclear how this research will influence future Medicare coverage and reimbursement decisions as well as influence other third-party payor coverage and reimbursement policies. The PPACA, as well as other federal or state healthcare reform measures that may be adopted in the future, could have a material adverse effect on our business. The taxes imposed by PPACA and the expansion in the government’s role in the U.S. healthcare industry may result in decreased profits, lower reimbursement from payors for procedures that use our products, and/or reduced procedural volumes, all of which may adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations.In addition, other legislative changes have been proposed and adopted since the PPACA was enacted. These changes included an aggregate reduction in Medicare payments to providers of up to 2% per fiscal year, which went into effect on April 1, 2013 and will remain in effect through 2027 unless additional Congressional action is taken. On January 2, 2013, the American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012 was signed into law, which, among other things, further reduced Medicare payments to several types of providers, including hospitals, imaging centers, and cancer treatment centers. The Medicare Access and CHIP Reauthorization Act of 2015, enacted on April 16, 2015 (“MACRA”), repealed the formula by which Medicare made annual payment adjustments to physicians and replaced the former formula with fixed annual updates and a new system of incentive payments scheduled to begin in 2019 that are based on various performance measures and physicians’ participation in alternative payment models, such as accountable care organizations. Individual states in the U.S. have also become increasingly aggressive in passing legislation and implementing regulations designed to control product pricing, including price or patient reimbursement constraints and discounts, and require marketing cost disclosure and transparency measures.There have also been judicial and congressional challenges to certain aspects of the PPACA, as well as efforts by the U.S. administration to modify, repeal, or otherwise invalidate all, or certain provisions of, the PPACA. Since January 2017, the U.S. President has signed two Executive Orders designed to delay the implementation of certain provisions of the PPACA or otherwise circumvent some of the requirements for health insurance mandated by the PPACA. The current U.S. administration has also announced that it will discontinue the payment of cost-sharing reduction (“CSR”) payments to insurance companies until Congress approves the appropriation of funds for the CSR payments. The loss of the CSR payments is expected to increase premiums on certain policies issued by qualified health plans under the PPACA. Legislation to appropriate funds for CSR payments has been introduced in Congress, but the future of such legislation is uncertain. In addition, CMS has finalized regulations that are effective beginning with the 2020 plan year that would give states greater flexibility in setting benchmarks for insurers in the individual and small group marketplaces, which may have the effect of relaxing the essential health benefits required under the PPACA for plans sold through such marketplaces. As a result of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (“2017 Tax Act”) enacted on December 22, 2017, the PPACA’s individual mandate penalty for not having health insurance coverage was eliminated starting in 2019. Further, each chamber of Congress has put forth multiple bills designed to repeal or repeal and replace portions of the PPACA. On December 14, 2018, a U.S. District Court Judge in the Northern District of Texas, ruled that the individual mandate is a critical and inseverable feature of the ACA and, therefore, because it was repealed as part of the 2017 Tax Act, the remaining provisions of the ACA are invalid as well. While the current White House Administration and CMS have both stated that the ruling will have no immediate effect, it is unclear how this decision, subsequent pending appeals, and other efforts to repeal and replace the ACA will impact the ACA and our business. Although the majority of these measures have not been enacted by Congress to date, Congress may continue to consider other legislation to repeal or repeal and replace elements of the PPACA. Any regulatory or legislative developments in domestic or foreign markets that eliminate or reduce reimbursement rates for procedures performed with our products could harm our ability to sell our products or cause downward pressure on the prices of our products, either of which would adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations.EmployeesAs of December 31, 2019, we had 7,326 employees, 999 of whom were engaged directly in research and development, 3,243 in manufacturing and service, and 3,084 in marketing, sales, and administrative activities. None of our employees are covered by a collective bargaining agreement, and we consider our relationship with our employees to be good.18Table of ContentsGeneralWe make our periodic and current reports, including our Annual Reports on Form 10-K, Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q, Current Reports on Form 8-K, and any amendments to those reports, available free of charge on our website as soon as practicable after such material is electronically filed or furnished with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”).

Our financial results for the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018, and 2017 are discussed in “Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” and “",2023-12-30 18:54:39.262246
1035267,ISRG,INTUITIVE SURGICAL INC,2021,"Item 7. Management Discussion and Analysis” for further details on the Joint Venture. In the remainder of our markets outside of the U.S. (“OUS”), we provide our products through distributors. During the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019, and 2018, domestic revenue accounted for 68%, 70%, and 71%, respectively, of total revenue, while revenue from our OUS markets accounted for 32%, 30%, and 29%, respectively, of total revenue. As of December 31, 2020, and 2019, 83% and 85% of all long-lived assets were in the U.S., respectively.Our direct sales organization is composed of a capital sales team, responsible for selling systems, and a clinical sales team, responsible for supporting system use in procedures performed at our hospital accounts. Our hospital accounts include both individual hospitals and healthcare facilities as well as hospitals and healthcare facilities that are part of an integrated delivery network (“IDN groups”). The initial system sale into an account is a major capital equipment purchase by our customers and typically has a lengthy sales cycle that can be affected by macroeconomic factors, capital spending prioritization, timing of budgeting cycles, and competitive bidding processes. Capital sales activities include educating surgeons or physicians and hospital staff across multiple specialties on the benefits of robotic-assisted surgery with a da Vinci Surgical System or robotic-assisted bronchoscopy with an Ion endoluminal system, total treatment costs, and the clinical applications that our technology enables. We also train our sales organization to educate hospital management on the potential benefits of adopting our technology, including the clinical benefits of robotic-assisted surgery with a da Vinci Surgical System or robotic-assisted bronchoscopy with an Ion endoluminal system, potential reductions in complications and length of stay, and the resulting potential for increased patient satisfaction, surgeon or physician recruitment, and procedure volume.10Table of ContentsOur clinical sales team works on site at hospitals, interacting with surgeons or physicians, operating room staff, and hospital administrators to develop and sustain successful robotic-assisted surgery or bronchoscopy programs. They assist the hospital in identifying surgeons or physicians who have an interest in robotic-assisted surgery or bronchoscopy and the potential benefits provided by the da Vinci Surgical System and the Ion endoluminal system. Our clinical sales team provides current clinical information on robotic-assisted surgery or bronchoscopy practices and new product applications to the hospital teams. Our clinical sales team has grown with the expanded installed bases of da Vinci Surgical Systems and Ion endoluminal systems as well as the total number of procedures performed. We expect this organization to continue to grow as our business expands.Our customers place orders to replenish their supplies of instruments and accessories on a regular basis. Orders received are typically shipped within one business day. New direct customers who purchase a new system typically place an initial stocking order of instruments and accessories soon after they receive their system.Our business is subject to seasonal fluctuations. Historically, our sales of da Vinci Surgical Systems have tended to be heavier in the fourth quarter and lighter in the first quarter, as hospital budgets are reset. In addition, we have historically experienced lower procedure volume in the first and third quarters and higher procedure volume in the second and fourth quarters. More than half of da Vinci procedures performed are for benign conditions. These benign procedures and other short-term elective procedures tend to be more seasonal than cancer procedures and surgeries for other life-threatening conditions. In the U.S., volumes for procedures associated with benign conditions are typically seasonally higher in the fourth quarter when more patients have met annual deductibles and lower in the first quarter when deductibles are reset. Seasonality outside the U.S. varies and is more pronounced around local holidays and vacation periods. The timing of procedures and changes in procedure volume impact the timing of instrument and accessory and capital purchases. As a result of factors outlined in ""Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—COVID-19 Pandemic"" below, including the past and potential future recommendations of authorities to defer elective procedures, historical procedure patterns have been and may continue to be disrupted.Customer Support and Training ProgramsWe have a network of field service engineers across the U.S., Europe, and Asia and maintain relationships with various distributors around the globe. This infrastructure of service and support specialists offers a full complement of services for our customers, including 24/7 support, installation, repair, and maintenance. We generate service revenue by providing these services to our customers through comprehensive service contracts and time and material programs.We provide basic system training that teaches the fundamental operating principles of the systems to surgeons, surgical assistants, and operating room nurses. We have established training centers where system training and ongoing surgical procedural training are provided, the latter led by expert surgeons. Training technologies include our Simulation program, which provides independent da Vinci skills development through interactive VR exercises, and our telementoring program, which provides real-time surgeon-to-surgeon learning and collaboration during robotic-assisted surgery.Research and DevelopmentWe focus our research and development efforts on innovation and improvement for products and services that align with our mission: We believe that minimally invasive care is life-enhancing care. Through ingenuity and intelligent technology, we believe that we can expand the potential of physicians to heal without constraints. We employ engineering and research and development staff to focus on delivering future innovations and sustaining improvements that advance our mission. In certain instances, we complement our research and development effort through collaborations with other companies, such as Trumpf Medical (a division of Hill-Rom Holdings, Inc.).ManufacturingWe manufacture our systems at our facilities in Sunnyvale, California and Durham, North Carolina. We manufacture our instruments at our facilities in Sunnyvale, California and Mexicali, Mexico. We also have manufacturing at multiple sites in Germany.We purchase both custom and off-the-shelf components from a large number of suppliers and subject them to stringent quality specifications and processes. Some of the components necessary for the assembly of our products are currently provided to us by sole-sourced suppliers (the only recognized supply source available to us) or single-sourced suppliers (the only approved supply source for us among other sources). We purchase the majority of our components and major assemblies through purchase orders rather than long-term supply agreements and generally do not maintain large volumes of finished goods relative to our anticipated demand.11Table of ContentsCompetitionWe face competition in the forms of existing open surgery, conventional MIS, drug therapies, radiation treatment, and emerging interventional surgical approaches. Our success depends on continued clinical and technical innovation, quality and reliability, as well as educating hospitals, surgeons, and patients on the demonstrated results associated with robotic-assisted surgery using da Vinci Surgical Systems and its value relative to other techniques. We also face competition from several companies that have introduced or are developing new approaches and products for the MIS market. We believe that the entrance or emergence of competition validates MIS and robotic-assisted surgery.Moreover, as we add new robotically controlled products (e.g., da Vinci Stapling and da Vinci Energy) that compete with product offerings traditionally within the domains of open surgery and/or conventional MIS, we face greater competition from larger and well established companies, such as Ethicon Endo-Surgery, Inc. and Medtronic plc.The companies that have introduced products in the field of robotic-assisted surgery or have made explicit statements about their efforts to enter the field, include, but are not limited to: avateramedical GmbH; CMR Surgical Ltd.; Johnson & Johnson (including their wholly owned subsidiaries Auris Health, Inc. and Verb Surgical Inc.); Medicaroid, Inc.; Medrobotics Corporation; Medtronic plc; meerecompany Inc.; MicroPort Scientific Corporation; Olympus Corporation; Samsung Group; Shandong Weigao Group Medical Polymer Company Ltd.; Smart Robot Technology Group Co. Ltd.; Titan Medical Inc.; and TransEnterix, Inc. Other companies with substantial experience in industrial robotics could potentially expand into the field of surgical robotics and become a competitor. In addition, research efforts utilizing computers and robotics in surgery are underway at various companies and research institutions. Our revenues may be adversely impacted as our competitors announce their intent to enter our markets and as our customers anticipate the availability of competing products.Intellectual PropertyWe place considerable importance on obtaining and maintaining patent, copyright, trademark, and trade secret protection for significant new technologies, products, and processes.We generally rely upon a combination of intellectual property laws, confidentiality procedures, and contractual provisions to protect our proprietary technology. For example, we have trademarks, both registered and unregistered, that provide distinctive identification of our products in the marketplace. We also have exclusive and non-exclusive patent licenses with various third parties to supplement our own robust patent portfolio.As of December 31, 2020, we held ownership or exclusive field-of-use licenses for more than 4,000 U.S. and foreign patents and have filed more than 2,000 U.S. and foreign patent applications. We intend to continue filing new patent applications in the U.S. and foreign jurisdictions to seek protection for our technology.Patents are granted for finite terms. Upon expiration, the inventions claimed in a patent enter the public domain.Government RegulationOur products and operations are subject to regulation by the FDA, the State of California, and countries or regions in which we market our products. In addition, our products must meet the requirements of a large and growing body of international standards, which govern the design, manufacture, materials content and sourcing, testing, certification, packaging, installation, use, and disposal of our products. We must continually keep abreast of these standards and requirements and integrate our compliance into the development and regulatory documentation for our products. Failure to meet these standards could limit our ability to market our products in those regions that require compliance to such standards. Examples of standards to which we are subject include electrical safety standards, such as those of the International Electrotechnical Commission (e.g., IEC 60601-ss series of standards), and composition standards, such as the Reduction of Hazardous Substances (“RoHS”) and the Waste Electrical and Electronic Equipment (“WEEE”) Directives.U.S. RegulationThe FDA regulates the development, testing, manufacturing, labeling, storage, recordkeeping, promotion, marketing, distribution, and service of medical devices in the U.S. to ensure that medical products distributed domestically are safe and effective for their intended uses. In addition, the FDA regulates the export of medical devices manufactured in the U.S. to markets outside of the U.S. and the importation of medical devices manufactured abroad.Under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (“FFDCA”), medical devices are classified into one of three classes—Class I, Class II, or Class III—depending on the degree of risk associated with each medical device and the extent of control needed to ensure safety and effectiveness. Our current products are Class II medical devices.Class II medical devices are those which are subject to general controls, and most require premarket demonstration of adherence to certain performance standards or other special controls, as specified by the FDA, and clearance by the FDA. Premarket review and clearance by the FDA for these devices is accomplished through the 510(k) premarket notification 12Table of Contentsprocess. Unless a Class II medical device is exempt from a premarket review, the manufacturer must submit to the FDA a premarket notification submission demonstrating that the device is “substantially equivalent” in intended use and technology to a “predicate device” that is either:•a device that has grandfather marketing status, because it was legally marketed prior to May 28, 1976, the date upon which the Medical Device Amendments of 1976 were enacted; or•a device that has previously been cleared through the 510(k) process.If the FDA agrees that the device is substantially equivalent to a predicate device, it will grant clearance to commercially market the device in the U.S. The FDA has a statutory 90-day period to respond to a 510(k) submission, or a guidance-based 30-day period for “special” 510(k) submissions, which have a more restrictive scope and generally involve more specific or very limited changes to a legally marketed device. As a practical matter, clearance often takes longer. The FDA may require further information, including clinical data, to make a determination regarding substantial equivalence. If the FDA determines that the device, or its intended use, is not “substantially equivalent,” the FDA may deny the request for clearance. Although unlikely for the types of products marketed by us, the FDA may classify the device, or the particular use of the device, into Class III, and the device sponsor must then fulfill more rigorous pre-market approval (“PMA”) requirements. A PMA application, which is intended to demonstrate that a device is safe and effective, must be supported by data, typically including data from preclinical studies and human clinical trials. The FDA, by statute and regulation, has 180 days to review a PMA application, although the review more often occurs over a significantly longer period of time, and can take up to several years. In approving a PMA application or clearing a 510(k) submission, the FDA may also require some form of post-market surveillance when necessary to protect the public health or to provide additional safety and effectiveness data for the device. In such cases, the manufacturer might be required to follow certain patient groups for a number of years and make periodic reports to the FDA on the clinical status of those patients.After a device receives FDA 510(k) clearance, any modification that could significantly affect its safety or effectiveness, or that would constitute a major change in its intended use, requires a new 510(k) clearance or could require a PMA application approval. The FDA requires each manufacturer to make the determination of whether a modification requires a new 510(k) notification or PMA application in the first instance, but the FDA can review any such decision. If the FDA disagrees with a manufacturer’s decision not to seek a new 510(k) clearance or PMA approval for a particular change, the FDA may retroactively require the manufacturer to seek 510(k) clearance or PMA approval. The FDA also can require the manufacturer to cease U.S. marketing and/or recall the modified device until 510(k) clearance or PMA approval is obtained.Over the last several years, the FDA has proposed reforms to its 510(k) clearance process, and such proposals will include increased requirements for clinical data and a longer review period and make it more difficult for manufacturers to utilize the 510(k) clearance process for their products. For example, in November 2018, FDA officials announced forthcoming steps that the FDA intends to take to modernize the premarket notification pathway under Section 510(k) of the FFDCA. Among other things, the FDA announced that it planned to develop proposals to drive manufacturers utilizing the 510(k) pathway toward the use of newer predicates. These proposals included plans to potentially sunset certain older devices that were used as predicates under the 510(k) clearance pathway and to potentially publish a list of devices that have been cleared on the basis of demonstrated substantial equivalence to predicate devices that are more than 10 years old. In May 2019, the FDA solicited public feedback on these proposals. These proposals have not yet been finalized or adopted, and the FDA may work with Congress to implement such proposals through legislation.More recently, in September 2019, the FDA finalized guidance describing an optional “safety and performance based” premarket review pathway for manufacturers of “certain, well-understood device types” to demonstrate substantial equivalence under the 510(k) clearance pathway by showing that such device meets objective safety and performance criteria established by the FDA, thereby obviating the need for manufacturers to compare the safety and performance of their medical devices to specific predicate devices in the clearance process. The FDA maintains a list of device types appropriate for the “safety and performance based” pathway and will continue to develop product-specific guidance documents that identify the performance criteria for each such device type, as well as the testing methods recommended in the guidance documents, where feasible.In addition, after a device is placed on the market, numerous FDA and other regulatory requirements continue to apply. These requirements include establishment registration and device listing with the FDA, compliance with medical device reporting regulations, which require that manufacturers report to the FDA if their device may have caused or contributed to a death or serious injury or malfunctioned in a way that would likely cause or contribute to a death or serious injury if it were to recur, and compliance with corrections and removal reporting regulations, which require that manufacturers report to the FDA field corrections and product recalls or removals if undertaken to reduce a risk to health posed by the device or to remedy a violation of the FFDCA that may present a risk to health. The FDA and the Federal Trade Commission (“FTC”) also regulate the advertising and promotion of our products to ensure that the claims we make are consistent with our regulatory clearances, that there is scientific data to substantiate the claims, and that our advertising is neither false nor misleading. In general, we may not promote or advertise our products for uses not within the scope of our intended use statement in our clearances or make 13Table of Contentsunsupported safety and effectiveness claims. Many regulatory jurisdictions outside of the U.S. have similar regulations to which we are subject.Our manufacturing processes are required to comply with the FDA’s Good Manufacturing Practice (“GMP”) requirements contained in its Quality System Regulation (“QSR”) and associated regulations and guidance. The QSR covers, among other things, the methods used in, and the facilities and controls used for, the design, manufacture, packaging, labeling, storage, installation, and servicing of all medical devices intended for human use. The QSR also requires maintenance of extensive records, which demonstrate compliance with the FDA regulation, the manufacturer’s own procedures, specifications, and testing, as well as distribution and post-market experience. Compliance with the QSR is necessary to receive FDA clearance or approval to market new products and is necessary for a manufacturer to be able to continue to market cleared or approved product offerings in the U.S. A company’s facilities, records, and manufacturing processes are subject to periodic scheduled or unscheduled inspections by the FDA, which may issue reports known as Form FDA 483 or Notices of Inspectional Observations, which list instances where the FDA investigator believes the manufacturer has failed to comply with applicable regulations and/or procedures. If the observations are sufficiently serious or the manufacturer fails to respond appropriately, the FDA may issue Warning Letters, or Untitled Letters, which are notices of potential enforcement actions against the manufacturer. If a Warning Letter or Untitled Letter is not addressed to the satisfaction of the FDA or if the FDA becomes aware of any other serious issue with a manufacturer’s products or facilities, it could result in fines, injunctions, civil penalties, delays, suspension or withdrawal of clearances, seizures or recalls of products, operating restrictions, total shutdown of production facilities, prohibition on export or import, and criminal prosecution. Such actions may have further indirect consequences for the manufacturer outside of the U.S. and may adversely affect the reputation of the manufacturer and the product.To a greater or lesser extent, most other countries require some form of quality system and regulatory compliance, which may include periodic inspections, inspections by third-party auditors, and specialized documentation. Failure to meet all of the requirements of these countries could jeopardize our ability to import, market, support, and receive reimbursement for the use of our products in these countries.In addition to the above, we may seek to conduct clinical studies or trials in the U.S. or other countries on products that have not yet been cleared or approved for a particular indication. Additional regulations govern the approval, initiation, conduct, documentation, and reporting of clinical studies to regulatory agencies in the countries or regions in which they are conducted. Such investigational use is generally also regulated by local and institutional requirements and policies which usually include review by an ethics committee or institutional review board (“IRB”). Failure to comply with all regulations governing such studies could subject the Company to significant enforcement actions and sanctions, including halting of the study, seizure of investigational devices or data, sanctions against investigators, civil or criminal penalties, and other actions. Without the data from one or more clinical studies, it may not be possible for us to secure the data necessary to support certain regulatory submissions, secure reimbursement, or demonstrate other requirements. We cannot provide assurance that access to clinical investigators, sites, subjects, documentation, and data will be available on the terms and in the timeframes necessary.Products manufactured outside the U.S. by or for us are subject to U.S. Customs and FDA inspection upon entry into the U.S. We must demonstrate compliance of such products with U.S. regulations and carefully document the eventual distribution or re-exportation of such products. Failure to comply with all applicable regulations could prevent us from having access to products or components critical to the manufacture of finished products and lead to shortages and delays.California RegulationThe State of California requires that we obtain a license to manufacture medical devices and, until 2012, conducted periodic inspections of medical device manufacturers. Our facilities and manufacturing processes were last inspected in July 2011 and were found to be in compliance. In accordance with the State of California regulations, our license to manufacture is renewed annually with any updated manufacturing information. Although the State of California has announced the suspension of routine periodic inspections, there can be no assurance that the State of California will not resume such inspections or conduct such inspections under specific circumstances that are not yet known.Foreign RegulationIn order for us to market our products in countries outside the United States, we must obtain regulatory approvals and comply with extensive product and quality system regulations in other countries. These regulations, including the requirements for approvals or clearance and the time required for regulatory review, vary from country to country. Some countries have regulatory review processes that are substantially longer than U.S. processes. Failure to obtain regulatory approval in a timely manner and meet all of the local requirements including language and specific safety standards in any foreign country in which we plan to market our products could prevent us from marketing products in such countries or subject us to sanctions and fines.For example, most medical devices must undergo thorough safety examinations and demonstrate medical efficacy before they receive regulatory approval to be sold in Japan. We obtained approval from the Japanese Ministry of Health, Labor, and 14Table of ContentsWelfare (“MHLW”) for our da Vinci Si Surgical System in October 2012, for our da Vinci Xi Surgical System in March 2015, and for our da Vinci X Surgical System in April 2018. National reimbursement status in Japan was received for dVP procedures in April 2012 and for da Vinci partial nephrectomy procedures in April 2016. An additional 12 da Vinci procedures were granted reimbursement effective April 1, 2018, including gastrectomy, low anterior resection, lobectomy, and hysterectomy, for both malignant and benign conditions. An additional 7 procedures were granted reimbursement effective April 1, 2020. These additional 19 reimbursed procedures have varying levels of conventional laparoscopic penetration and will be reimbursed at rates equal to the conventional laparoscopic procedures. Given the reimbursement level and laparoscopic penetration for these 19 procedures, there can be no assurance that adoption will occur or that the adoption pace for these procedures will be similar to any other da Vinci procedures. If these procedures are not adopted and we are not successful in obtaining adequate procedure reimbursements for additional procedures, then the demand for our products in Japan could be limited. The process of reimbursement for new da Vinci surgical procedures in Japan is led by the surgical societies. The societies submit for reimbursement or incremental reimbursement to the MHLW for their evaluation. The decision to reimburse requires in-country clinical data and is fixed in April of even-numbered years.Commercialization of medical devices in Europe is regulated by the European Union (“EU”). The EU presently requires that all medical products bear the Conformité Européenne (“CE”) mark for compliance with the Medical Device Directive (93/42/EEC) as amended. The CE mark is an international symbol of adherence to certain essential principles of safety and performance mandated in applicable European medical device directives, which, once affixed, enables a product to be sold in member countries of the EU and those affiliated countries that accept the CE mark. The CE mark is also recognized in many countries outside of the EU, such as Australia, and can assist in the clearance process. In order to affix the CE mark on products, a recognized European Notified Body must certify a manufacturer’s quality system and design dossier for compliance with international and European requirements. We have received authorization from Presafe Denmark A/S (formerly DGM Denmark A/S), a recognized European Notified Body and part of Nemko Presafe A/S, to affix the CE mark to our da Vinci Surgical Systems and EndoWrist instruments and accessories. To maintain authorization to apply the CE mark, we are subject to annual surveillance audits and periodic re-certification audits. In September 2013, the European Commission adopted a recommendation indicating that all Notified Bodies, including Presafe, should carry out unannounced audits at least once every third year, of the manufacturers whose medical devices they have certified. These unannounced audits can also extend to the manufacturer’s critical suppliers or sub-contractors (those that supply a critical input or perform a critical function for the manufacturer).If we modify our existing products or develop new products in the future, we may need to apply for authorization to affix the CE mark to such products. We do not know whether we will be able to obtain authorization to affix the CE mark for new or modified products or whether we will continue to meet the safety and performance standards required to maintain the authorizations we have already received. If we are unable to maintain authorizations to affix the CE mark to our products, we will no longer be able to sell our products in member countries of the EU or those whose marketing authorizations are based on the CE mark.In May 2017, the Medical Device Regulation was implemented to replace the Medical Device Directive (93/42/EEC) as amended. The Medical Device Regulation ((EU) 2017/745) comes into force on May 26, 2021, and imposes stricter requirements for the marketing and sale of medical devices and grants Notified Bodies increased post-market surveillance authority. We may be subject to risks associated with additional testing, modification, certification, or amendment of our existing market authorizations, or we may be required to modify products already installed at our customers’ facilities to comply with the official interpretations of these revised regulations.Regulations in other countries, including the requirements for approvals or clearance and the time required for regulatory review, vary from country to country. Certain countries, such as China and South Korea, have their own regulatory agencies. These countries typically require regulatory approvals and compliance with extensive safety and quality system regulations. Failure to obtain regulatory approval in any foreign country in which we plan to market our products, or failure to comply with any regulation in any foreign country in which we market our products may negatively impact our ability to generate revenue and harm our business. Our system sales into China are also dependent on obtaining importation authorizations and provincial approvals, as well as hospitals completing a tender process under the authorization. In October 2018, the China National Health Commission published on its official website the quota for major medical equipment to be imported and sold in China through 2020. After an adjustment notice was published in the third quarter of 2020, the government will now allow for the total sale of 225 new surgical robots into China, which could include da Vinci Surgical Systems as well as surgical systems introduced by others. Sales of da Vinci Surgical Systems under the quota are uncertain, as they are dependent on hospitals completing a tender process and receiving associated approvals. In addition, local regulations may apply, which govern the use of our products and which could have an adverse effect on our product utilization if they are unfavorable. All such regulations are revised from time to time and, in general, are increasing in complexity, and in the scope and degree of documentation and testing required. There can be no assurance that the outcomes from such documentation and testing will be acceptable to any particular regulatory agency or will continue to be acceptable over time. There are further regulations governing the importation, marketing, sale, distribution, use, and service as well as the removal and disposal of medical devices in the regions in which we operate and 15Table of Contentsmarket our products. Failure to comply with any of these regulations could result in sanctions or fines and could prevent us from marketing our products in these regions.Other Healthcare LawsWe are also subject to federal and state healthcare laws and regulations pertaining to fraud and abuse, physician payment transparency, privacy, and security laws and regulations. These laws include:•the federal Anti-Kickback Statute, which prohibits, among other things, persons from knowingly and willfully soliciting, receiving, offering, or paying remuneration, directly or indirectly, in exchange for or to induce either the referral of an individual for, or the purchase, order, or recommendation of, any good or service for which payment may be made under federal healthcare programs, such as the Medicare and Medicaid programs. A person or entity does not need to have actual knowledge of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute or specific intent to violate it to have committed a violation. In addition, the government may assert that a claim including items or services resulting from a violation of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute constitutes a false or fraudulent claim for purposes of the False Claims Act;•federal false claims laws that prohibit, among other things, individuals or entities from knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, claims for payment from Medicare, Medicaid, or other federal third-party payors that are false or fraudulent. Private individuals can bring False Claims Act “qui tam” actions on behalf of the government, and such individuals may share in amounts paid by the entity to the government in fines or settlement;•the federal Civil Monetary Penalties Law, which prohibits, among other things, offering or transferring remuneration to a federal healthcare beneficiary that a person knows or should know is likely to influence the beneficiary’s decision to order or receive items or services reimbursable by the government from a particular provider or supplier;•federal criminal laws that prohibit executing a scheme to defraud any federal healthcare benefit program or making false statements relating to healthcare matters;•the federal Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, as amended by the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act, which governs the conduct of certain electronic healthcare transactions and protects the security and privacy of protected health information;•the federal Physician Payment Sunshine Act, which requires (i) manufacturers of drugs, devices, biologics, and medical supplies for which payment is available under Medicare, Medicaid, or the Children’s Health Insurance Program (with certain exceptions) to report annually to the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (“CMS”) information related to payments or other “transfers of value” made to physicians (defined to include doctors, dentists, optometrists, podiatrists, and chiropractors), certain other healthcare professionals (as described below), and teaching hospitals, and (ii) applicable manufacturers and group purchasing organizations to report annually to CMS ownership any investment interests held by the physicians described above and their immediate family members and payments or other “transfers of value” to such physician owners. Additionally, on October 25, 2018, President Trump signed into law the “Substance Use-Disorder Prevention that Promoted Opioid Recovery and Treatment for Patients and Communities Act,” which, in part (under a provision entitled “Fighting the Opioid Epidemic with Sunshine”), extends the reporting and transparency requirements for physicians in the Physician Payments Sunshine Act to physician assistants, nurse practitioners, clinical nurse specialists, certified registered nurse anesthetists, and certified nurse midwives (with reporting requirements going into effect in 2022 for payments made in 2021). Manufacturers are required to submit reports to CMS by the 90th day of each calendar year; and•analogous state and foreign law equivalents of each of the above federal laws, such as anti-kickback and false claims laws, which may apply to items or services reimbursed by any third-party payor, including commercial insurers, state laws that require device companies to comply with the industry’s voluntary compliance guidelines and the applicable compliance guidance promulgated by the federal government or otherwise restrict payments that may be made to healthcare providers and other potential referral sources, state laws that require device manufacturers to report information related to payments and other “transfers of value” to physicians and other healthcare providers or marketing expenditures and pricing information, and laws governing the privacy and security of health information in certain circumstances, including the E.U. General Data Protection Regulation (“GDPR”), many of which differ from each other in significant ways and may not have the same effect, thus complicating compliance efforts.16Table of ContentsIf our operations are found to violate any of the laws described above or any other laws and regulations that apply to us, we may be subject to penalties, including civil and criminal penalties, damages, fines, the curtailment or restructuring of our operations, the exclusion from our participation in federal and state healthcare programs, and imprisonment, any of which could adversely affect our ability to market our products and materially adversely affect our business, results of operations, and financial condition. Any action against us for violation of these laws, even if we successfully defend against it, could cause us to incur significant legal expenses and divert our management’s attention from the operation of our business.Third-Party Coverage and ReimbursementIn the U.S. and most markets OUS where we sell our products, the government and health insurance companies together are responsible for hospital and surgeon reimbursement for virtually all covered surgical procedures. Governments and insurance companies generally reimburse hospitals and physicians for surgery when the procedure is considered medically necessary. In the U.S., CMS administers the Medicare and Medicaid programs (the latter, along with applicable state governments). Many other third-party payors model their reimbursement methodologies after the Medicare program. As the single largest payor, this program has a significant impact on other payors’ payment systems.Generally, reimbursement for professional services performed at a facility by physicians is reported under billing codes issued by the American Medical Association (“AMA”), known as Current Procedural Terminology (“CPT”) codes. Physician reimbursement under Medicare generally is based on a fee schedule and determined by the relative value of the professional service rendered. In addition, CMS and the National Center for Health Statistics (“NCHS”) are jointly responsible for overseeing changes and modifications to billing codes used by hospitals to report inpatient procedures, ICD-10-PCS codes. For Medicare, CMS generally reimburses hospitals for services provided during an inpatient stay based on a prospective payment system that is determined by a classification system known as Medicare-Severity Diagnostic Related Groupings (“MS-DRGs”). MS-DRGs are assigned using a number of factors, including the principal diagnosis, major procedures, discharged status, patient age, and complicating secondary diagnoses, among other things. Hospital outpatient services, reported by CPT codes, are assigned to clinically relevant Ambulatory Payment Classifications (“APCs”) used to determine the payment amount for services provided.Since October 1, 2015, a new family of ICD-10-PCS codes can be used, in conjunction with other applicable procedure codes, to describe various robotic-assisted procedures. An inpatient surgical procedure, completed with or without robotic assistance, continues to be assigned to the clinically relevant MS-DRG.Governments and insurance companies carefully review and increasingly challenge the prices charged for medical products and surgical services. Reimbursement rates from private companies vary depending on the procedure performed, the third-party payor, contract terms, and other factors. Because both hospitals and physicians may receive the same reimbursement for their respective services, with or without robotics, regardless of actual costs incurred by the hospital or physician in furnishing the care, including for the specific products used in that procedure, hospitals and physicians may decide not to use our products if reimbursement amounts are insufficient to cover any additional costs incurred when purchasing our products.Domestic institutions typically bill various third-party payors, such as Medicare, Medicaid, and other government programs and private insurance plans for the primary surgical procedure that includes our products. Because our da Vinci Surgical Systems have been cleared for commercial distribution in the U.S. by the FDA, coverage and reimbursement by payors are generally determined by the medical necessity of the primary surgical procedure. Governmental and third-party payors may also consider additional factors when determining coverage and reimbursement, including the designation of the surgical procedure as a covered benefit, the appropriateness of the procedure for the specific patient, support by guidelines established by the relevant professional college or medical society, and a payor determination that the procedure is neither experimental nor investigational. We believe that the additional procedures we intend to pursue are established surgical procedures that are generally already reimbursable by government agencies and insurance companies for appropriately selected patients. If hospitals do not obtain sufficient reimbursement from third-party payors for procedures performed with our products, or if governmental and private payors’ policies do not cover surgical procedures performed using our products, we may not be able to generate the revenues necessary to support our business.In countries outside the U.S., reimbursement is obtained from various sources, including governmental authorities, private health insurance plans, and labor unions. In most foreign countries, private insurance systems may also offer payments for some therapies. In addition, health maintenance organizations are emerging in certain European countries. To effectively conduct our business, we may need to seek OUS reimbursement approvals, and we do not know if these required approvals will be obtained in a timely manner or at all. In some countries, patients may be permitted to pay directly for surgical services; however, such “co-pay” practices are not common in most countries.In the U.S., there have been, and continue to be, a number of legislative initiatives to contain healthcare costs. In March 2010, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as amended by the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act (collectively, the “PPACA”), was enacted. The PPACA made changes that have significantly impacted healthcare providers, 17Table of Contentsinsurers, and pharmaceutical and medical device manufacturers. The PPACA contained a number of provisions designed to generate the revenues necessary to fund health insurance coverage expansion, including, but not limited to, fees or taxes on certain health-related industries, including medical device manufacturers.The PPACA also appropriated funding to research the comparative effectiveness of healthcare treatments and strategies. It remains unclear how this research will influence future Medicare coverage and reimbursement decisions as well as influence other third-party payor coverage and reimbursement policies. The PPACA, as well as other federal or state healthcare reform measures that may be adopted in the future, could have a material adverse effect on our business. The taxes imposed by PPACA and the expansion in the government’s role in the U.S. healthcare industry may result in decreased profits, lower reimbursement from payors for procedures that use our products, and/or reduced procedural volumes, all of which may adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations.In addition, other legislative changes have been proposed and adopted since the PPACA was enacted. These changes included an aggregate reduction in Medicare payments to providers of up to 2% per fiscal year, which went into effect on April 1, 2013 and will remain in effect through 2030, unless additional Congressional action is taken, with the exception of a temporary suspension of the 2% cut in Medicare payments from May 1, 2020, through December 31, 2020. On January 2, 2013, the American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012 was signed into law, which, among other things, further reduced Medicare payments to several types of providers, including hospitals, imaging centers, and cancer treatment centers. The Medicare Access and CHIP Reauthorization Act of 2015, enacted on April 16, 2015 (“MACRA”), repealed the formula by which Medicare made annual payment adjustments to physicians and replaced the former formula with fixed annual updates and a new system of incentive payments that began in 2019 and are based on various performance measures and physicians’ participation in alternative payment models, such as accountable care organizations. Individual states in the U.S. have also become increasingly aggressive in passing legislation and implementing regulations designed to control product pricing, including price or patient reimbursement constraints and discounts, and require marketing cost disclosure and transparency measures.There have also been judicial and congressional challenges to certain aspects of the PPACA, as well as efforts by the U.S. administration to modify, repeal, or otherwise invalidate all, or certain provisions of, the PPACA. Since January 2017, President Trump signed two Executive Orders designed to delay the implementation of certain provisions of the PPACA or otherwise circumvent some of the requirements for health insurance mandated by the PPACA. The Trump administration has also announced that it will discontinue the payment of cost-sharing reduction (“CSR”) payments to insurance companies until Congress approves the appropriation of funds for the CSR payments. The loss of the CSR payments is expected to increase premiums on certain policies issued by qualified health plans under the PPACA. Legislation to appropriate funds for CSR payments has been introduced in Congress, but the future of such legislation is uncertain. In addition, CMS finalized regulations that, effective beginning with the 2020 plan year, give states greater flexibility in setting benchmarks for insurers in the individual and small group marketplaces, which may have the effect of relaxing the essential health benefits required under the PPACA for plans sold through such marketplaces. As a result of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (“2017 Tax Act”) enacted on December 22, 2017, the PPACA’s individual mandate penalty for not having health insurance coverage was eliminated starting in 2019. Further, each chamber of Congress has put forth multiple bills designed to repeal or repeal and replace portions of the PPACA. On December 14, 2018, a U.S. District Court Judge in the Northern District of Texas, ruled that the individual mandate is a critical and inseverable feature of the ACA and, therefore, because it was repealed as part of the 2017 Tax Act, the remaining provisions of the ACA are invalid as well. The Fifth Court of Appeals affirmed the district court's ruling that the individual mandate was unconstitutional, but it remanded the case back to the district court for further analysis of whether the mandate could be severed from the Affordable Care Act. The Supreme Court of the United States granted certiorari on March 2, 2020 and held oral arguments on November 10, 2020. The case is expected to be decided by mid-2021. It is unclear how this decision, subsequent pending appeals, and other efforts to repeal and replace the ACA will impact the ACA and our business. Although the majority of these measures have not been enacted by Congress to date, Congress may continue to consider other legislation to repeal or repeal and replace elements of the PPACA. Any regulatory or legislative developments in domestic or foreign markets that eliminate or reduce reimbursement rates for procedures performed with our products could harm our ability to sell our products or cause downward pressure on the prices of our products, either of which would adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations.18Table of ContentsHuman CapitalThe future success of our company depends on our ability to attract, retain, and further develop top talent. To facilitate talent attraction, retention, and development, we strive to make Intuitive an inclusive, diverse, and safe workplace with opportunities for our employees to grow and develop in their careers, supported by strong compensation, benefits, and health and wellness programs as well as by programs that build connections between our employees and the communities in which they live and work.At December 31, 2020, we had approximately 8,081 full-time employees, 1,111 of whom were engaged directly in research and development, 3,559 in manufacturing and service, and 3,411 in marketing, sales and administrative activities. During 2020, the number of employees increased by approximately 755. Our employees are based in 27 different countries around the world. Our global workforce consists of diverse, highly skilled talent at all levels. During 2020, our turnover rate was less than 6.5%.Inclusion and DiversityWe strive to foster a culture where mutual respect, inclusive behavior, and dignity are core to our individual expectations. Since our founding, we have remained committed to fostering an inclusive environment in which our differing backgrounds, life experiences, and perspectives join to positively impact the communities in which we live and serve.We continue to build a culture where the best idea wins and our doors and minds are always open. We do this by leading with inclusion and empowering everyone to do their best work as their most authentic selves—regardless of race, color, national origin, religion, sex, sexual orientation, gender identity and expression, age, disability, or military service status. We are united by our collective purpose and common set of organizational values that are core to our mission and culture.We support the growth and expansion of our employee resource groups (ERGs), which foster an inclusive culture and sense of belonging for our employees. Our ERGs provide a point of connection for employees who share common community attributes and want to engage, learn, communicate, and participate in advancing our inclusion and diversity objectives. Our ERGs include the Women Intuitive Network, Intuitive Pan-Asian Community, BLACK at Intuitive, Diverse Abilities, PRIDE, and VETS. In 2020, our ERGs grew from three to 10 companywide. These employee-volunteer-led groups focus on four key impact areas including recruitment, employee development, community building, and business development. ERGs also provided ideas and insight to senior management and various departments by serving as sources of employee feedback on important aspects of our business, such as talent acquisition and retention, accessibility accommodations, and operational challenge solutions. From a governance perspective, maintaining a mix of backgrounds and experience in our board composition is essential to understanding and reflecting the needs of our diverse stakeholders. Currently, three of our 10 board members are women, one of our board members identifies as Hispanic, and one of our board members identifies as Middle Eastern.Health, Safety, and WellnessThe health, safety, and wellness of our employees is a priority in which we have always invested, and will continue to do so. These investments and the prioritization of employee health, safety, and wellness took on particular significance in 2020 in light of COVID-19. We provide our employees and their families with access to a variety of innovative, flexible, and convenient health and wellness programs. Program benefits are intended to provide protection and security, so employees can have peace of mind concerning events that may require time away from work or that may impact their financial well-being. Additionally, we provide programs to help support employee physical and mental health by providing tools and resources to help them improve or maintain their health status, encourage engagement in healthy behaviors, and offer choices where possible so they are customized to meet their needs and the needs of their families.In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, we implemented significant changes that we determined were in the best interest of our employees, as well as the communities in which we operate, in compliance with government regulations. This includes having the vast majority of our employees work from home, while implementing additional safety measures for employees continuing critical on-site work. A number of employees critical to maintaining our essential engineering, manufacturing, repair, and logistics functions have continued to work from Intuitive locations globally. To protect and support our essential team members, we have implemented health and safety measures that included maximizing personal workspaces, changing shift schedules, providing personal protective equipment (PPE), and instituting mandatory screening before accessing buildings. We created subteam groups, keeping the same manufacturing teams working together to facilitate contact tracing and minimize potential staffing risk.19Table of ContentsCompensation and BenefitsWe provide compensation and benefits programs to help meet the needs of our employees. In addition to base compensation, these programs, which vary by country and region, include annual bonuses, stock awards, an Employee Stock Purchase Plan, 401(k) and pension plans, healthcare and insurance benefits, health savings and flexible spending accounts, paid time off, family leave, family care resources, and flexible work schedules, among many others. As a response to the COVID-19 pandemic, we implemented modifications to our compensation program, including paying a portion of 2020 bonuses mid-year to help staff cover unforeseen pandemic-related expenses. We also offered premium pay and a subsidized lunch program.Ensuring fair and equitable pay is integral to our commitment to our employees. Our executive team and Board of Directors strongly support this commitment. We conduct pay equity reviews annually to help us understand whether our compensation structure is appropriate and to identify what improvements can be made. In addition, we utilize a robust inspection process with an independent consulting firm for gender and ethnicity hiring, promotion, and wage equity to determine whether any statistically significant pay differences exist between women and men and between minorities and non-minorities. If pay disparities are identified, we conduct further evaluation to determine whether remedial adjustments are appropriate. In addition, employees can raise issues regarding pay equity with their manager, their human resources partner, or confidentially through our anonymous reporting helpline.Talent DevelopmentWe value our employees and the passion, commitment, and professional depth they provide. To enhance employee retention and job satisfaction, we offer ongoing learning and leadership training opportunities that support growth.With a commitment to achieving diverse representation within our leadership ranks that reflects the diversity that we see in our overall employee base, we increased our leadership development efforts in 2020 by reinforcing development around our People Leader Success Model. Leadership development focuses on people-leader effectiveness, cultural continuity, and organizational effectiveness, so that leaders at all levels have the capabilities and knowledge that they and their teams need to succeed.Our Global Talent Management team transitioned much of our leadership training from in-person sessions to remote learning with the emergence of COVID-19 in 2020. Our scaled learning platform of on-demand and virtual classroom learning eliminates travel and allows employees worldwide to access development at their convenience.We have robust annual global performance review processes for reviewing all employees’ performance and pay. To support our managers, we train them on conducting effective performance reviews and making compensation recommendations, which take into consideration market pay data and performance, as well as experience in an employee’s respective role.Community Programs and Our COVID-19 ResponseWe believe that building connections between our employees, their families, and our communities creates a more meaningful, fulfilling, and enjoyable workplace. Through our engagement programs, our employees can pursue their interests and hobbies, connect to volunteering and giving opportunities, and enjoy unique recreational experiences with family members.The Intuitive Foundation is a nonprofit organization established and funded by Intuitive in 2018. Since its founding, the Intuitive Foundation has been dedicated to promoting health, advancing education, and reducing human suffering. The Foundation supports outreach programs financially while we provide the volunteers and mentors from within our company. Since its inception, we have contributed $55 million to the Intuitive Foundation to fulfill its mission.The events of 2020 inspired Intuitive employees to further support the Foundation’s work on several key initiatives. The Foundation’s multifaceted response to the COVID-19 pandemic was a major focus in 2020. From the first days of the pandemic, Intuitive and the Intuitive Foundation engaged within the communities in which we live and work. We converted some of our manufacturing lines to produce PPE, donating more than a million face shields globally through the Intuitive Foundation. Employees and their families sewed facemasks and volunteered in their communities. Our engineers helped design and implement updates to ventilators that made them easier to produce. Some of our medically trained employees volunteered as healthcare workers on the front lines. Lastly, Intuitive and the Intuitive Foundation, along with many employees, contributed financially to support COVID-19 relief.We encourage you to review the ""Talent and workplace experience"" and ""Creating stronger communities"" section of our Sustainability Report 2020 (located on our website) for more detailed information regarding our Human Capital programs and initiatives.

Our financial results for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019, and 2018 are discussed in “Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” and “",2023-12-30 18:54:31.645889
1035267,ISRG,INTUITIVE SURGICAL INC,2022,"Item 7. Management Discussion and Analysis” for further details on the Joint Venture. In the remainder of our markets outside of the U.S., we provide our products through distributors. During the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020, and 2019, domestic revenue accounted for 67%, 68%, and 70%, respectively, of total revenue, while revenue from our OUS markets accounted for 33%, 32%, and 30%, respectively, of total revenue. As of December 31, 2021, and 2020, 84% and 83% of all long-lived assets were in the U.S., respectively.Our direct sales organization is composed of a capital sales team, responsible for selling systems, and a clinical sales team, responsible for supporting system use in procedures performed at our hospital accounts. Our hospital accounts include both individual hospitals and healthcare facilities as well as hospitals and healthcare facilities that are part of an integrated delivery network (“IDN groups”). The initial system sale into an account is a major capital equipment purchase by our customers and typically has a lengthy sales cycle that can be affected by macroeconomic factors, capital spending prioritization, timing of budgeting cycles, and competitive bidding processes. Capital sales activities include educating surgeons or physicians and hospital staff across multiple specialties on the benefits of robotic-assisted surgery with a da Vinci Surgical System or robotic-assisted bronchoscopy with an Ion endoluminal system, total treatment costs, and the clinical applications that our technology enables. We also train our sales organization to educate hospital management on the potential benefits of adopting our technology, including the clinical benefits of robotic-assisted surgery with a da Vinci Surgical System or robotic-assisted bronchoscopy with an Ion endoluminal system, potential reductions in complications and length of stay, and the resulting potential for increased patient satisfaction, surgeon or physician recruitment, and procedure volume.Our clinical sales team works on site at hospitals, interacting with surgeons or physicians, operating room staff, and hospital administrators to develop and sustain successful robotic-assisted surgery or bronchoscopy programs. They assist the hospital in identifying surgeons or physicians who have an interest in robotic-assisted surgery or bronchoscopy and the potential benefits provided by the da Vinci Surgical System and the Ion endoluminal system. Our clinical sales team provides current clinical information on robotic-assisted surgery or bronchoscopy practices and new product applications to the hospital teams. Our clinical sales team has grown with the expanded installed bases of da Vinci Surgical Systems and Ion endoluminal systems as well as the total number of procedures performed. We expect this organization to continue to grow as our business expands.Our customers place orders to replenish their supplies of instruments and accessories on a regular basis. Orders received are typically shipped within one business day. New direct customers who purchase a new system typically place an initial stocking order of instruments and accessories soon after they receive their system.Our business is subject to seasonal fluctuations. Historically, our sales of da Vinci Surgical Systems have tended to be heavier in the fourth quarter and lighter in the first quarter, as hospital budgets are reset. In addition, we have historically experienced lower procedure volume in the first and third quarters and higher procedure volume in the second and fourth quarters. More than half of da Vinci procedures performed are for benign conditions. These benign procedures and other short-term elective procedures tend to be more seasonal than cancer procedures and surgeries for other life-threatening conditions. In the U.S., volumes for procedures associated with benign conditions are typically seasonally higher in the fourth quarter when more patients have met annual deductibles and lower in the first quarter when deductibles are reset. Seasonality outside the U.S. varies and is more pronounced around local holidays and vacation periods. The timing of procedures and changes in procedure volume impact the timing of instrument and accessory and capital purchases. As a result of factors outlined in “Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—COVID-19 Pandemic” below, including the past and potential future recommendations of authorities to defer elective procedures, historical procedure patterns have been and may continue to be disrupted.Customer SupportWe have a network of field service engineers across the U.S., Europe, and Asia and maintain relationships with various distributors around the globe. This infrastructure of service and support specialists offers a full complement of services for our customers, including 24/7 support, installation, repair, and maintenance. We generate service revenue by providing these services to our customers through comprehensive service contracts and time and material programs.13Table of ContentsResearch and DevelopmentWe focus our research and development efforts on innovation and improvement for products and services that align with our mission: We believe that minimally invasive care is life-enhancing care. Through ingenuity and intelligent technology, we believe that we can expand the potential of physicians to heal without constraints. We employ engineering and research and development staff to focus on delivering future innovations and sustaining improvements that advance our mission. In certain instances, we complement our research and development effort through collaborations with other companies, such as Trumpf Medical (a division of Hill-Rom Holdings, Inc.).ManufacturingWe manufacture our systems at our facilities in Sunnyvale, California and Durham, North Carolina. We manufacture our instruments at our facilities in Sunnyvale, California and Mexicali, Mexico. We also have manufacturing at multiple sites in Germany.We purchase both custom and off-the-shelf components from a large number of suppliers and subject them to stringent quality specifications and processes. Some of the components necessary for the assembly of our products are currently provided to us by sole-sourced suppliers (the only recognized supply source available to us) or single-sourced suppliers (the only approved supply source for us among other sources). We purchase the majority of our components and major assemblies through purchase orders rather than long-term supply agreements and generally do not maintain large volumes of finished goods relative to our anticipated demand.CompetitionWe face competition in the forms of existing open surgery, conventional MIS, drug therapies, radiation treatment, and emerging interventional surgical approaches. Our success depends on continued clinical and technical innovation, quality and reliability, as well as educating hospitals, surgeons, and patients on the demonstrated results associated with robotic-assisted surgery using da Vinci Surgical Systems and its value relative to other techniques. We also face competition from several companies that have introduced or are developing new approaches and products for the MIS market. We believe that the entrance or emergence of competition validates MIS and robotic-assisted surgery.Moreover, as we add new robotically controlled products (e.g., da Vinci Stapling and da Vinci Energy) that compete with product offerings traditionally within the domains of open surgery and/or conventional MIS, we face greater competition from larger and well-established companies, such as Johnson & Johnson and Medtronic plc.The companies that have introduced products in the field of robotic-assisted surgery or have made explicit statements about their efforts to enter the field, include, but are not limited to, Asensus Surgical, Inc.; avateramedical GmbH; CMR Surgical Ltd.; Johnson & Johnson; Medicaroid, Inc.; Medrobotics Corporation; Medtronic plc; meerecompany Inc.; MicroPort Scientific Corporation; Olympus Corporation; Samsung Group; Shandong Weigao Group Medical Polymer Company Ltd.; and Titan Medical Inc. Other companies with substantial experience in industrial robotics could potentially expand into the field of surgical robotics and become a competitor. In addition, research efforts utilizing computers and robotics in surgery are underway at various companies and research institutions. Our revenues may be adversely impacted as our competitors announce their intent to enter our markets and as our customers anticipate the availability of competing products.Intellectual PropertyWe place considerable importance on obtaining and maintaining patent, copyright, trademark, and trade secret protection for significant new technologies, products, and processes.We generally rely upon a combination of intellectual property laws, confidentiality procedures, and contractual provisions to protect our proprietary technology. For example, we have trademarks, both registered and unregistered, that provide distinctive identification of our products in the marketplace. We also have exclusive and non-exclusive patent licenses with various third parties to supplement our own robust patent portfolio.As of December 31, 2021, we held ownership or exclusive field-of-use licenses for more than 4,200 U.S. and foreign patents and have filed more than 2,100 U.S. and foreign patent applications. We intend to continue filing new patent applications in the U.S. and foreign jurisdictions to seek protection for our technology.Patents are granted for finite terms. Upon expiration, the inventions claimed in a patent enter the public domain.Government RegulationOur products and operations are subject to regulation by the FDA, the State of California, and countries or regions in which we market our products. In addition, our products must meet the requirements of a large and growing body of international standards, which govern the design, manufacture, materials content and sourcing, testing, certification, packaging, installation, 14Table of Contentsuse, and disposal of our products. We must continually keep abreast of these standards and requirements and integrate our compliance into the development and regulatory documentation for our products. Failure to meet these standards could limit our ability to market our products in those regions that require compliance to such standards. Examples of standards to which we are subject include electrical safety standards, such as those of the International Electrotechnical Commission (e.g., IEC 60601-ss series of standards), and composition standards, such as the Reduction of Hazardous Substances (“RoHS”) and the Waste Electrical and Electronic Equipment (“WEEE”) Directives.U.S. RegulationOur products are subject to regulation as medical devices in the United States under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (“FFDCA”), as implemented and enforced by the FDA. The FDA regulates the development, design, non-clinical and clinical research, manufacturing, safety, efficacy, labeling, packaging, storage, installation, recordkeeping, complaint and adverse event reporting, clearance, approval, certification, promotion, marketing, export, import distribution, and service of medical devices in the U.S. to ensure that medical devices distributed domestically are safe and effective for their intended uses.Under the FFDCA, medical devices are classified into one of three classes—Class I, Class II, or Class III—depending on the degree of risk associated with each medical device and the extent of control needed to ensure safety and effectiveness. Our current products are Class II medical devices.Class II medical devices are those which are subject to general controls, and most require premarket demonstration of adherence to certain performance standards or other special controls, as specified by the FDA, and special controls as deemed necessary by the FDA to ensure the safety and effectiveness of the device. These special controls can include performance standards, post-market surveillance, patient registries, and FDA guidance documents.Manufacturers of most Class II devices are required to submit to the FDA a premarket notification under Section 510(k) of the FFDCA requesting authorization to commercially distribute the device. The FDA’s authorization to commercially distribute a device subject to a 510(k) premarket notification is generally known as 510(k) clearance. Our current products are subject to premarket notification and clearance under section 510(k) of the FFDCA. To obtain 510(k) clearance, we must submit to the FDA a premarket notification submission demonstrating that the proposed device is “substantially equivalent” to a legally marketed predicate device.The FDA may require additional information, including clinical data, to make a determination regarding substantial equivalence. In addition, the FDA collects user fees for certain medical device submissions and annual fees for medical device establishments.If the FDA agrees that the device is substantially equivalent to a predicate device, it will grant clearance to commercially market the device in the U.S. The FDA has a statutory 90-day period to respond to a 510(k) submission; however, as a practical matter, clearance often takes longer. The FDA may require further information, including clinical data, to make a determination regarding substantial equivalence. If the FDA determines that the device, or its intended use, is not “substantially equivalent,” the device may be designated as a Class III device. The device sponsor must then fulfill more rigorous PMA requirements or can request a risk-based classification determination for the device in accordance with the de novo classification pathway, which is a route to market for novel medical devices that are low to moderate risk and are not substantially equivalent to a predicate device.The PMA process is more demanding than the 510(k) premarket notification process. In a PMA application, the manufacturer must demonstrate that the device is safe and effective, and the PMA application must be supported by extensive data, including data from preclinical studies and human clinical trials. The FDA, by statute and regulation, has 180 days to review a PMA application, although the review more often occurs over a significantly longer period of time and can take up to several years. In approving a PMA application or clearing a 510(k) submission, the FDA may also require some additional manufacturing controls, design control activities and approvals, as well as specific post-market surveillance requirements when necessary to protect the public health or to provide additional safety and effectiveness data for the device. In such cases, the manufacturer might be required to follow certain patient groups for a number of years and make periodic reports to the FDA on the clinical status of those patients.Clinical trials are almost always required to support a PMA and are sometimes required to support a 510(k) submission. All clinical investigations designed to determine the safety and effectiveness of a medical device must be conducted in accordance with the FDA’s investigational device exemption (“IDE”) regulations, which govern investigational device labeling, prohibit promotion of the investigational device, and specify an array of recordkeeping, reporting and monitoring responsibilities of study sponsors and study investigators. Regardless of the degree of risk presented by the medical device, clinical studies must be approved by, and conducted under the oversight of, an Institutional Review Board (“IRB”) for each clinical site. During a study, the sponsor is required to comply with the applicable FDA requirements, including, for example, trial monitoring, selecting clinical investigators and providing them with the investigational plan, ensuring IRB review, adverse event reporting, record keeping, and prohibitions on the promotion of investigational devices or on making safety or effectiveness claims for 15Table of Contentsthem. The clinical investigators in the clinical study are also subject to the FDA’s regulations and must obtain patient informed consent, rigorously follow the investigational plan and study protocol, control the disposition of the investigational device, and comply with all reporting and recordkeeping requirements. Additionally, after a trial begins, we, the FDA, or the IRB could suspend or terminate a clinical trial at any time for various reasons, including a belief that the risks to study subjects outweigh the anticipated benefits.Over the last several years, the FDA has proposed reforms to its 510(k) clearance process, and such proposals could include increased requirements for clinical data and a longer review period and make it more difficult for manufacturers to utilize the 510(k) clearance process for their products. For example, in November 2018, FDA officials announced forthcoming steps that the FDA intended to take to modernize the premarket notification pathway under Section 510(k) of the FFDCA. Among other things, the FDA announced that it planned to develop proposals to drive manufacturers utilizing the 510(k) pathway toward the use of newer predicates. These proposals included plans to potentially sunset certain older devices that were used as predicates under the 510(k) clearance pathway and to potentially publish a list of devices that have been cleared on the basis of demonstrated substantial equivalence to predicate devices that are more than 10 years old. These proposals have not yet been finalized or adopted, and the FDA may work with Congress to implement such proposals through legislation.More recently, in September 2019, the FDA issued revised final guidance describing an optional “safety and performance based” premarket review pathway for manufacturers of “certain, well-understood device types” to demonstrate substantial equivalence under the 510(k) clearance pathway by showing that such device meets objective safety and performance criteria established by the FDA, thereby obviating the need for manufacturers to compare the safety and performance of their medical devices to specific predicate devices in the clearance process. The FDA maintains a list of device types appropriate for the “safety and performance based” pathway and continues to develop product-specific guidance documents that identify the performance criteria for each such device type, as well as the recommended testing methods, where feasible.After a device receives 510(k) clearance, any modification that could significantly affect its safety or effectiveness, or that would constitute a major change or modification in its intended use, will require a new 510(k) clearance or, depending on the modification, PMA approval or de novo classification. The FDA requires each manufacturer to determine whether the proposed change requires submission of a 510(k), de novo classification, or a PMA in the first instance, but the FDA can review any such decision and disagree with a manufacturer’s determination. If the FDA disagrees with a manufacturer’s determination, the FDA can require the manufacturer to cease marketing and/or request the recall of the modified device until 510(k) marketing clearance, approval of a PMA, or issuance of a de novo classification. Also, in these circumstances, the manufacturer may be subject to significant regulatory fines or penalties.In addition, the FDA may place significant limitations upon the intended use of our products as a condition of granting marketing authorization. Moreover, after a device is placed on the market, numerous FDA and other regulatory requirements continue to apply. These requirements include establishment registration and device listing with the FDA; compliance with medical device reporting regulations, which require that manufacturers report to the FDA if their device caused or contributed, or may have caused or contributed, to a death or serious injury or malfunctioned in a way that would likely cause or contribute to a death or serious injury if it were to recur; compliance with corrections and removal reporting regulations, which require that manufacturers report to the FDA field corrections and product recalls or removals if undertaken to reduce a risk to health posed by the device or to remedy a violation of the FFDCA that may present a risk to health; the FDA’s recall authority, whereby the agency can order device manufacturers to recall from the market a product that is in violation of governing laws and regulations; and post-market surveillance activities and regulations, which apply when deemed by the FDA to be necessary to protect the public health or to provide additional safety and effectiveness data for the device. In addition, the FDA and the Federal Trade Commission also regulate the advertising and promotion of our products to ensure that the claims we make are consistent with our regulatory clearances, that there is scientific data to substantiate the claims, and that our advertising is neither false nor misleading. In general, we may not promote or advertise our products for uses not within the scope of our intended use statement in our clearances or make unsupported safety and effectiveness claims. Our manufacturing processes are required to comply with the Quality System Regulation (“QSR”). The QSR covers, among other things, the methods used in, and the facilities and controls used for, the design, testing, controlling, documenting, manufacture, packaging, labeling, storage, installation, and servicing of all medical devices intended for human use. The QSR also requires maintenance of extensive records, which demonstrate compliance with the FDA regulation, the manufacturer’s own procedures, specifications, and testing, as well as distribution and post-market experience. Compliance with the QSR is necessary for a manufacturer to be able to continue to market cleared or approved product offerings in the U.S. A company’s facilities, records, and manufacturing processes are subject to periodic scheduled or unscheduled inspections by the FDA. Failure to maintain compliance with applicable QSR requirements could result in the shut-down of, or restrictions on, manufacturing operations and the recall or seizure of marketed products. If the FDA determines that a manufacturer has failed 16Table of Contentsto comply with applicable regulatory requirements, it can take a variety of compliance or enforcement actions, which may result in any of the following sanctions:•warning letters, untitled letters, fines, injunctions, consent decrees, administrative penalties, and civil or criminal penalties;•recalls, withdrawals, or administrative detention or seizure of our products;•operating restrictions or partial suspension or total shutdown of production;•refusing or delaying requests for 510(k) marketing clearance or PMA approvals of new products or modified products;•withdrawing 510(k) clearances or PMA approvals that have already been granted;•refusal to grant export approvals for our products; or•criminal prosecution.In addition, the discovery of previously unknown problems with any marketed products, including unanticipated adverse events or adverse events of increasing severity or frequency, whether resulting from the use of the device within the scope of its clearance or off-label by a physician in the practice of medicine, could result in restrictions on the device, including the removal of the product from the market or voluntary or mandatory device recalls.Products manufactured outside the U.S. by or for us are subject to U.S. Customs and FDA inspection upon entry into the U.S. We must demonstrate compliance of such products with U.S. regulations and carefully document the eventual distribution or re-exportation of such products. Failure to comply with all applicable regulations could prevent us from having access to products or components critical to the manufacture of finished products and lead to shortages and delays.Foreign RegulationIn order for us to market our products in countries outside the United States, we must obtain regulatory approvals or certifications and comply with extensive product and quality system regulations in other countries. These regulations, including the requirements for approvals, clearance, or certifications and the time required for regulatory review, vary from country to country. Some countries have regulatory review processes that are substantially longer than U.S. processes. Failure to obtain regulatory approval or certification in a timely manner and meet all of the local requirements, including language and specific safety standards, in any foreign country in which we plan to market our products could prevent us from marketing products in such countries or subject us to sanctions and fines.JapanMost medical devices must undergo thorough safety examinations and demonstrate medical efficacy before they receive regulatory approval to be sold in Japan. We obtained approval from the Japanese Ministry of Health, Labor, and Welfare (“MHLW”) for our da Vinci Si Surgical System in October 2012, for our da Vinci Xi Surgical System in March 2015, and for our da Vinci X Surgical System in April 2018. National reimbursement status in Japan was received for prostatectomy procedures in April 2012 and for da Vinci partial nephrectomy procedures in April 2016. An additional 12 da Vinci procedures were granted reimbursement effective April 1, 2018, including gastrectomy, low anterior resection, lobectomy, and hysterectomy, for both malignant and benign conditions. An additional 7 procedures were granted reimbursement effective April 1, 2020. These additional 19 reimbursed procedures have varying levels of conventional laparoscopic penetration and will be reimbursed at rates equal to the conventional laparoscopic procedures. Given the reimbursement level and laparoscopic penetration for these 19 procedures, there can be no assurance that adoption will occur or that the adoption pace for these procedures will be similar to any other da Vinci procedures. If these procedures are not adopted and we are not successful in obtaining adequate procedure reimbursements for additional procedures, then the demand for our products in Japan could be limited. The process of reimbursement for new da Vinci surgical procedures in Japan is led by the surgical societies. The societies submit for reimbursement or incremental reimbursement to the MHLW for their evaluation. The decision to reimburse requires in-country clinical data and is fixed in April of even-numbered years.European UnionIn the European Union (“EU”), all medical devices placed on the EU market must meet the essential requirements, including the requirement that a medical device must be designed and manufactured in such a way that it will not compromise the clinical condition or safety of patients, or the safety and health of users and others. In addition, the device must achieve the performance intended by the manufacturer and be designed, manufactured, and packaged in a suitable manner.Compliance with the essential requirements is a prerequisite for European Conformity Marking (“CE mark”) without which medical devices cannot be marketed or sold in the EU. To demonstrate compliance with the essential requirements, medical device manufacturers must undergo a conformity assessment procedure, which varies according to the type of medical device and its (risk) classification. Except for low-risk medical devices (Class I non-sterile, non-measuring devices), where the manufacturer can self-assess the conformity of its products with the essential requirements (except for any parts which relate to sterility or metrology), a conformity assessment procedure requires the intervention of a notified body. Notified bodies are 17Table of Contentsindependent organizations designated by EU member states to assess the conformity of devices before being placed on the market. A notified body would typically audit and examine a product’s technical dossiers and the manufacturers’ quality system. If satisfied that the relevant product conforms to the relevant essential requirements, the notified body issues a certificate of conformity, which the manufacturer uses as a basis for its own declaration of conformity. The manufacturer may then apply the CE mark to the device, which allows the device to be placed on the market throughout the EU.Until May 25, 2021, medical devices were regulated by Council Directive 93/42/EEC (the “EU Medical Devices Directive” or “MDD”), which has been repealed and replaced by Regulation (EU) No 2017/745 (the “EU Medical Devices Regulation” or “MDR”). Our current certificates have been granted under the MDD. However, as of May 26, 2021, some of the MDR requirements apply in place of the corresponding requirements of the MDD with regard to registration of economic operators and of devices, post-market surveillance, and vigilance requirements. Pursuing marketing of medical devices in the EU will notably require that our devices be certified under the new regime set forth in the MDR.Many EU member states have adopted specific anti-gift statutes that further limit commercial practices for medical devices, in particular vis-à-vis healthcare professionals and organizations. Additionally, there has been a recent trend of increased regulation of payments and transfers of value provided to healthcare professionals or entities and many EU member states have adopted national “Sunshine Acts,” which impose reporting and transparency requirements (often on an annual basis), similar to the requirements in the United States, on medical device manufacturers. Certain countries also mandate implementation of commercial compliance programs.BrexitSince January 1, 2021, the Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency (“MHRA”) has become the sovereign regulatory authority responsible for the Great Britain (i.e., England, Wales, and Scotland) medical device market. Following the end of the Brexit transitional period on January 1, 2021, new regulations require medical devices to be registered with the MHRA (but manufacturers were given a grace period of four to 12 months, depending on the classification of the device, to comply with the new registration process) before being placed on the Great Britain market. By July 1, 2023, in Great Britain, all medical devices will require a UKCA (“UK Conformity Assessed”) mark, but CE marks issued by EU notified bodies will remain valid until this time. Manufacturers may choose to use the UKCA mark on a voluntary basis until June 30, 2023. However, UKCA marking will not be recognized in the EU. Compliance with this legislation is a prerequisite to be able to affix the UKCA mark to our products, without which they cannot be sold or marketed in Great Britain.In addition, the Trade Deal between the UK and the EU generally provides for cooperation and exchange of information between the parties in the areas of product safety and compliance, including market surveillance, enforcement activities and measures, standardization-related activities, exchanges of officials, and coordinated product recalls. As such, processes for compliance and reporting should reflect requirements from regulatory authorities.Regulations in other countries, including the requirements for approvals, certification, or clearance and the time required for regulatory review, vary from country to country. Certain countries, such as China and South Korea, have their own regulatory agencies. These countries typically require regulatory approvals and compliance with extensive safety and quality system regulations. Failure to obtain regulatory approval in any foreign country in which we plan to market our products, or failure to comply with any regulation in any foreign country in which we market our products may negatively impact our ability to generate revenue and harm our business. In addition to product registration approvals, our system sales into China are also dependent on obtaining importation authorizations and provincial approvals, as well as hospitals completing a tender and hospital listing process under the authorization. In October 2018, the China National Health Commission published on its official website the quota for major medical equipment to be imported and sold in China through 2020. After an adjustment notice was published in the third quarter of 2020 (ref. NHC Financial Notice [2020] 315), the government will allow for the total sale of 225 new Endoscopic Surgical Instrument Control Systems (surgical robots) into China, which could include da Vinci Surgical Systems as well as surgical systems introduced by others. Sales of da Vinci Surgical Systems under the quota are uncertain, as they are dependent on hospitals completing a tender process and receiving associated approvals.In addition, local regulations may apply, which govern the use of our products and which could have an adverse effect on our product utilization if they are unfavorable. All such regulations are revised from time to time and, in general, are increasing in complexity and in the scope and degree of documentation and testing required. There can be no assurance that the outcomes from such documentation and testing will be acceptable to any particular regulatory agency or will continue to be acceptable over time. There are further regulations governing the importation, marketing, sale, distribution, use, and service as well as the removal and disposal of medical devices in the regions in which we operate and market our products. Failure to comply with any of these regulations could result in sanctions or fines and could prevent us from marketing our products in these regions.18Table of ContentsThird-Party Coverage and ReimbursementOur customers, including physicians, hospitals, and outpatient facilities, typically bill third-party payors for the costs and fees associated with the procedures in which our products are used. In the U.S., in order to receive payment for the procedures performed using our products, our customers must report codes that describe the services or products furnished and determine the medical necessity of the service or whether the service is included in the payors’ policy). In the U.S. and most markets globally where we sell our products, reimbursement for medical services and surgical procedures to hospitals, outpatient facilities, and surgeons (collectively “providers”) is determined by the government, commercial payors (insurers), or a combination of both.In the U.S., the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (“CMS”) and its fiscal intermediaries (Medicare Administrative Contractors) and state Medicaid programs establish reimbursement policies for medical and surgical services at the state and federal level for the Medicare and Medicaid programs. Third-party payors often rely upon Medicare coverage policy and payment limitations in setting their own coverage and reimbursement policies but also have their own methods and approval processes. Commercial payors in non-capitated contracts commonly establish payment to providers based on a percentage of the Medicare payment rate.Physicians and outpatient facilities bill for medical and surgical services by reporting a combination of billing codes. Current Procedural Terminology (“CPT”) codes are created by the American Medical Association (“AMA”) with input from CMS and commercial payors to describe medical and surgical procedures. CPT codes currently exist for minimally invasive surgical procedures, which may involve the da Vinci surgical system. In general, the majority of payors, including Medicare, consider robotic assistance as a tool used to perform the procedure and do not pay providers more for a surgical procedure that involves robotic assistance using the da Vinci or any other robotic surgical system. Because there is often no separate reimbursement for the use of our products, the additional cost associated with the use of our products can affect the profit margin of the hospital or surgery center where the procedure is performed. If hospitals do not obtain sufficient reimbursement from third-party payors for procedures performed with our products, or if governmental and private payors’ policies do not cover surgical procedures performed using our products, we may not be able to generate the revenue necessary to support our business.Hospitals bill for inpatient services by reporting ICD-10-PCS codes. CMS is primarily responsible for overseeing changes and modifications to ICD-10-PCS codes. Medicare payment to hospitals for services provided during an inpatient stay are based on the Inpatient Prospective Payment System (“IPPS”). Under the IPPS, each patient discharge is categorized into a Medicare Severity Adjusted Diagnosis-Related Group (“MS-DRG” or “DRG”). Each DRG has an assigned payment weight based on the average resources used for Medicare patients in that DRG, taking into account the patient’s principal diagnosis, surgical procedures, age, discharge status, and up to 24 additional or secondary diagnoses, among other things. The DRG is a single, bundled payment intended to cover all costs associated with the inpatient admission.The use of robotic technology does not influence MS-DRG assignment or payment for an inpatient admission related to a surgical procedure. CMS annually updates hospital inpatient and outpatient payments based on hospitals’ charge data. Hospital inpatient and outpatient payments are also adjusted based on whether the hospital is a teaching hospital, its geographic location, and any failures to meet certain quality metrics, among other factors.Commercial payors commonly establish inpatient facility payment for providers using published Medicare DRG rates as a benchmark. Commercial payment to providers varies depending on the procedure performed, geographic location, contractual allowances, and other factors.Medicare and commercial payor payments to facilities for medical and surgical services may not always fully reimburse providers for all costs associated with furnishing these procedures. If payment is insufficient for procedures involving our technology, hospitals and physicians may decide not to use our products.In countries outside the U.S., reimbursement for surgical services to physicians and facilities differs considerably and varies by country. In some markets, there is a single public payor who provides a global annual budget to hospitals to provide all care to the population served in a designated geographic area. In other markets, private insurance can be purchased or is provided by employers to supplement public health insurance. In some countries, patients may be permitted to pay directly for surgical services; however, such “co-pay” practices are not common (or allowed) in many countries. Further, in many global markets, access to procedures and technology is governed or heavily influenced by Health Technology Assessment (“HTA”) organizations, which conduct periodic and extensive evidence-based reviews of the clinical value and cost effectiveness of a new technology. To effectively conduct our business, we may need to seek OUS reimbursement approvals, and we do not know if these required approvals will be obtained in a timely manner or at all. In addition, in some markets, HTA organizations may publish reports with mixed conclusions about the clinical and economic value of our products to the population. Such reviews could negatively impact hospital adoption of our technology.19Table of ContentsHealthcare ReformIn the U.S., there have been, and continue to be, a number of legislative initiatives to contain healthcare costs. In March 2010, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as amended by the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act (collectively, the “ACA”), was enacted. The ACA made changes that have significantly impacted healthcare providers, insurers, and pharmaceutical and medical device manufacturers. The ACA contained a number of provisions designed to generate the revenues necessary to fund health insurance coverage expansion and appropriated funding to research the comparative effectiveness of healthcare treatments and strategies. It remains unclear how this research will influence future Medicare coverage and reimbursement decisions as well as influence other third-party payor coverage and reimbursement policies. Since its enactment, there have been judicial, executive and Congressional challenges to certain aspects of the ACA. On June 17, 2021, the U.S. Supreme Court dismissed the most recent judicial challenge to the ACA brought by several states without specifically ruling on the constitutionality of the ACA. Thus, the ACA will remain in effect in its current form. Further, prior to the U.S. Supreme Court ruling, President Biden issued an executive order to initiate a special enrollment period from February 15, 2021, through August 15, 2021, for purposes of obtaining health insurance coverage through the ACA marketplace. The executive order also instructed certain governmental agencies to review and reconsider their existing policies and rules that limit access to healthcare, including among others, reexamining Medicaid demonstration projects and waiver programs that include work requirements, and policies that create unnecessary barriers to obtaining access to health insurance coverage through Medicaid or the ACA.In addition, other legislative changes have been proposed and adopted since the ACA was enacted. These changes included an aggregate reduction in Medicare payments to providers of 2% per fiscal year, which went into effect on April 1, 2013, and will remain in effect through 2030, unless additional Congressional action is taken, with the exception of a temporary suspension from May 1, 2020, through March 31, 2022. On January 2, 2013, the American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012 was signed into law, which, among other things, further reduced Medicare payments to several types of providers, including hospitals, imaging centers, and cancer treatment centers. The Medicare Access and CHIP Reauthorization Act of 2015, enacted on April 16, 2015 (“MACRA”), repealed the formula by which Medicare made annual payment adjustments to physicians and replaced the former formula with fixed annual updates and a new system of incentive payments that began in 2019 and are based on various performance measures and physicians’ participation in alternative payment models, such as accountable care organizations. Individual states in the U.S. have also become increasingly aggressive in passing legislation and implementing regulations designed to control product pricing, including price or patient reimbursement constraints and discounts, and require marketing cost disclosure and transparency measures. In the U.S. and abroad, reimbursement is dynamic and subject to change annually by public and private payors. National government agencies may also intervene and pass legislation that is intended to reduce healthcare spending, which could impact market access. Such legislative interventions can vacillate significantly based on government leadership. Other federal or state healthcare reform measures that may be adopted in the future could have a material adverse effect on our business. Any regulatory or legislative developments in domestic or foreign markets that eliminate or reduce reimbursement rates for procedures performed with our products could harm our ability to sell our products or cause downward pressure on the prices of our products, either of which would adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations.Human CapitalThe future success of our company depends on our ability to attract, retain, and further develop top talent. To facilitate talent attraction, retention, and development, we strive to make Intuitive an inclusive, diverse, and safe workplace with opportunities for our employees to grow and develop in their careers, supported by strong compensation, benefits, and health and wellness programs as well as by programs that build connections between our employees and the communities in which they live and work.As of December 31, 2021, we had approximately 9,793 full-time employees, 1,294 of whom were engaged directly in research and development, 3,682 in manufacturing operations, 3,354 in commercial and service operations, and 1,463 in administrative activities. During 2021, the number of employees increased by approximately 1,712. Our employees are based in 27 different countries around the world. Our global workforce consists of diverse, highly skilled talent at all levels. During 2021, our turnover rate was approximately 10.3%.Inclusion and DiversityIntuitive’s inclusion and diversity (I&D) vision is to empower our employees and customers from every background to fully contribute toward our mission to expand the potential of physicians to heal without constraints. We want to build an environment where every individual can belong and flourish – in our company and the communities we serve.We believe that everyone should feel included and fairly treated, and we embrace the unique qualities that make people who they are. This includes all genders and gender identities, races, ethnicities, ages, national origins, native languages, 20Table of Contentsdisabilities, sexual orientations, body sizes, military backgrounds, socioeconomic backgrounds, religions, and family structures. We believe in seeking the different to propel innovation and creativity forward.We have a four-part strategy to guide our I&D progress: building a diverse workforce to fuel innovation and better mirror the patients we serve; ensuring an inclusive experience, where employees from all backgrounds feel welcome, supported, and valued; investing in fair practices by continuously improving our people practices and sharing progress; and strengthening our industry leadership by engaging with the healthcare community, diversity-focused organizations, and shareholders to drive positive change. Employee Resource Groups (ERGs) have been one key area of I&D focus and growth, providing support and community for traditionally marginalized groups, including women, people of color, members of the LGBTQ+ community, military veterans, and employees with disabilities.From a governance perspective, maintaining a mix of backgrounds and experience in our board composition is essential to understanding and reflecting the needs of our diverse stakeholders. Currently, four of our 11 board members self-identify as women, and three of our 11 board members self-identify as individuals from underrepresented communities (defined as an individual who self-identifies as Black, African American, Hispanic, Latino, Asian, Pacific Islander, Native American, Native Hawaiian, or Alaska Native, or who self-identifies as gay, lesbian, bisexual, or transgender).Health, Safety, and WellnessThe health, safety, and wellness of our employees is a priority in which we continued to invest and expand throughout 2021. We provide our employees and their families with access to a variety of innovative, flexible, and convenient health and wellness programs. Program benefits are intended to provide protection and security, including workplace health and safety best practices integrated into our everyday activities. Additionally, we provide programs that help employees have peace of mind concerning events that may require time away from work or that may impact their family, mental health, or financial well-being.We continue to implement changes that we determine are in the best interest of our employees, as well as the communities in which we operate, in compliance with government regulations. This includes having employees continue to work from home, where possible, while providing support for strategic, on-site, in-person activities and gatherings with meeting and event protocols in place to help minimize the exposure to COVID-19 and other risks. Each Intuitive location manages overall safety with guidance based on regional, country, and local regulations and best practices.In 2021, investments in building upgrades and facility safety improvements included improved-efficiency HVAC filters and restrooms equipped with touchless faucets, toilets, towel dispensers, and door kickplates, where possible. We increased cleaning frequency in common areas, while implementing additional safety measures for employees continuing critical on-site work. Employees critical to maintaining our essential engineering, manufacturing, repair, and logistics functions have continued to work from Intuitive locations globally. To protect and support our essential team members, health and safety measures that included maximizing personal workspaces, changing shift schedules, providing personal protective equipment (PPE), and screening and testing resources continue to be provided.Our future ways of working team helped us explore changes that could strengthen our culture and could appeal to a diverse group of new employees. These included redefining job classifications to include fully remote and hybrid work arrangements, setting new expectations around how we work. An employee survey to inform new ways of working resulted in more outdoor working spaces, self-service information technology equipment procurement, on-demand mental health care and resilience resources, ergonomics review and new furniture choices for those working from home, new scheduling systems for reserving on-site workspaces, and more thoughtful approaches to building cleaning and access to common areas.Keeping in mind employee health and safety, Intuitive has prepared for a post-pandemic future where employees can return to an Intuitive workspace with peace of mind.Compensation and BenefitsWe provide compensation and benefits programs to help meet the needs of our employees. In addition to base compensation, these programs, which vary by country and region, include annual bonuses, stock awards, an Employee Stock Purchase Plan, retirement savings plans, healthcare, income protection benefits, paid time off, family leave, family care resources, and flexible work schedules, among many others.Ensuring fair and equitable pay is integral to our commitment to our employees. Our executive team and Board of Directors strongly support this commitment. We conduct pay equity reviews annually to help us understand whether our compensation structure is appropriate and to identify what improvements can be made. In addition, we utilize a robust inspection process with an independent consulting firm for gender and ethnicity hiring, promotion, and wage equity to determine whether any statistically significant pay differences exist between women and men and between minorities and non-minorities. If pay disparities are identified, we conduct further evaluation to determine whether remedial adjustments are 21Table of Contentsappropriate. In addition, employees can raise issues regarding pay equity with their manager, their human resources partner, or confidentially through our anonymous reporting helpline.Talent DevelopmentWe value our employees and the passion, commitment, and professional depth they provide.

Our financial results for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020, and 2019 are discussed in “Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” and “",2023-12-30 18:54:31.717675
1035267,ISRG,INTUITIVE SURGICAL INC,2023,"Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” for further details on the Joint Venture. In the remainder of our markets outside of the U.S., we provide our products through distributors. During the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021, and 2020, domestic revenue accounted for 67%, 67%, and 68%, respectively, of total revenue, while revenue from our OUS markets accounted for 33%, 33%, and 32%, respectively, of total revenue.Our direct sales organization is composed of a capital sales team, responsible for selling systems, and a clinical sales team, responsible for supporting the systems used in procedures performed at our hospital accounts. Our hospital accounts include both individual hospitals and healthcare facilities as well as hospitals and healthcare facilities that are part of an integrated delivery network (“IDN groups”). The initial system sale into an account is a major capital equipment purchase by our customers and typically has a lengthy sales cycle that can be affected by macroeconomic factors, capital spending prioritization, the timing of budgeting cycles, and competitive bidding processes. Capital sales activities include educating surgeons or physicians and hospital staff across multiple specialties on the benefits of robotic-assisted surgery with a da Vinci Surgical System or robotic-assisted bronchoscopy with an Ion endoluminal system, total treatment costs, and the clinical applications that our technology enables. We also train our sales organization to educate hospital management on the potential benefits of adopting our technology, including the clinical benefits of robotic-assisted surgery with a da Vinci Surgical System or robotic-assisted bronchoscopy with an Ion endoluminal system, in support of their quadruple aim objectives.Our clinical sales team works on site at hospitals, interacting with surgeons or physicians, operating room staff, and hospital administrators to develop and sustain successful robotic-assisted surgery or bronchoscopy programs. They assist the hospital in identifying surgeons or physicians who have an interest in robotic-assisted surgery or bronchoscopy and the potential benefits provided by the da Vinci Surgical System and the Ion endoluminal system. Our clinical sales team provides current clinical information on robotic-assisted surgery or bronchoscopy practices and new product applications to the hospital teams. Our clinical sales team has grown with the expanded installed bases of da Vinci Surgical Systems and Ion endoluminal systems as well as the total number of procedures performed. We expect this organization to continue to grow as our business expands.Our customers place orders to replenish their supplies of instruments and accessories on a regular basis. Orders received are typically shipped within one business day. New direct customers who purchase a system typically place an initial stocking order of instruments and accessories soon after they receive their system.Our business is subject to seasonal fluctuations. Historically, our sales of da Vinci Surgical Systems have tended to be heavier in the fourth quarter and lighter in the first quarter, as hospital budgets are reset. In addition, we have historically experienced lower procedure volume in the first and third quarters and higher procedure volume in the second and fourth quarters. More than half of da Vinci procedures performed are for benign conditions. These benign procedures and other short-term elective procedures tend to be more seasonal than cancer procedures and surgeries for other life-threatening conditions. In the U.S., volumes for procedures associated with benign conditions are typically seasonally higher in the fourth quarter when more patients have met annual deductibles and lower in the first quarter when deductibles are reset. Seasonality outside of the U.S. varies and is more pronounced around local holidays and vacation periods. The timing of procedures and changes in procedure volume impact the timing of instruments and accessories and capital purchases. As a result of factors outlined in “Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—COVID-19 Pandemic” below, including the past and potential future recommendations of authorities to defer elective procedures, historical procedure patterns have been and may continue to be disrupted.Customer SupportWe have a network of field service and technical support engineers across the U.S., Europe, and Asia and maintain relationships with various distributors around the globe. This infrastructure of service and support specialists, along with advanced service tools and solutions, offers a full complement of services for our customers, including installation, repair, maintenance, 24/7 technical support, and proactive system health monitoring. We generate service revenue by providing these services to our customers through comprehensive service contracts and time and material programs.Research and DevelopmentWe focus our research and development efforts on innovation and improvement for products and services that align with our mission: We believe that minimally invasive care is life-enhancing care. Through ingenuity and intelligent technology, we 13Table of Contentsbelieve that we can expand the potential of physicians to heal without constraints. We employ engineering and research and development staff to focus on delivering future innovations and sustaining improvements that advance our mission. In certain instances, we complement our research and development effort through collaborations with other companies, such as Baxter International Inc.ManufacturingWe manufacture our systems at our facilities in Sunnyvale, California, Durham, North Carolina and, as of 2022, Peachtree Corners, Georgia. We manufacture our instruments at our facilities in Sunnyvale, California and Mexicali, Mexico. We also have manufacturing at multiple sites in Germany.We purchase both custom and off-the-shelf components from a large number of suppliers and subject them to stringent quality specifications and processes. Some of the components necessary for the assembly of our products are currently provided to us by sole-sourced suppliers (the only recognized supply source available to us) or single-sourced suppliers (the only approved supply source for us among other sources). We purchase the majority of our components and major assemblies through purchase orders rather than long-term supply agreements and generally do not maintain large volumes of finished goods relative to our anticipated demand.CompetitionWe face competition in the forms of existing open surgery, conventional MIS, drug therapies, radiation treatment, and other emerging diagnostic and interventional surgical approaches. Our success depends on continued clinical and technical innovation, quality, and reliability, as well as educating hospitals, surgeons, and patients on the demonstrated results associated with robotic-assisted medical procedures using da Vinci Surgical Systems or Ion endoluminal systems and their value relative to other techniques. We also face competition from several companies that have introduced or are developing new approaches and products for the MIS market. We believe that the entrance or emergence of competition validates MIS and robotic-assisted surgery or robotic-assisted bronchoscopy.Moreover, as we add new robotically controlled products (e.g., da Vinci Stapling and da Vinci Energy) that compete with product offerings traditionally within the domains of open surgery and/or conventional MIS, we face greater competition from larger and well-established companies, such as Johnson & Johnson and Medtronic plc.The companies that have introduced products in the field of robotic-assisted medical procedures or have made explicit statements about their efforts to enter the field include, but are not limited to, the following companies: Asensus Surgical, Inc.; avateramedical GmbH; CMR Surgical Ltd.; Johnson & Johnson; Medicaroid Corporation; Medrobotics Corporation; Medtronic plc; meerecompany Inc.; Olympus Corporation; Samsung Electronics Co., Ltd; Shandong Weigao Group Medical Polymer Company Ltd.; Shanghai Microport Medbot (Group) Co., Ltd.; and Titan Medical Inc. Other companies with substantial experience in industrial robotics could potentially expand into the field of medical robotics and become a competitor. In addition, research efforts utilizing computers and robotics for medical procedures are underway at various companies and research institutions. Our revenues may be adversely impacted as our competitors announce their intent to enter our markets and as our customers anticipate the availability of competing products.Intellectual PropertyWe place considerable importance on obtaining and maintaining patent, copyright, trademark, and trade secret protection for significant new technologies, products, and processes.We generally rely upon a combination of intellectual property laws, confidentiality procedures, and contractual provisions to protect our proprietary technology. For example, we have trademarks, both registered and unregistered, that provide distinctive identification of our products in the marketplace. We also have exclusive and non-exclusive patent licenses with various third parties to supplement our own robust patent portfolio.As of December 31, 2022, we owned more than 4,300 patents granted and still in force and more than 2,100 patents pending worldwide. We intend to continue filing new patent applications in the U.S. and foreign jurisdictions to seek protection for our technology.Patents are granted for finite terms. Upon expiration, the inventions claimed in a patent enter the public domain.Government RegulationOur products and operations are subject to regulation in the U.S. by the FDA and the State of California as well as by other countries and regions in which we market and promote our products. In addition, our products must meet the requirements of a large and growing body of international standards, which govern the design, manufacture, materials content and sourcing, testing, certification, packaging, installation, use, and disposal of our products. We must continually keep abreast of these regulations, standards, and requirements and integrate our compliance into the development and regulatory documentation for 14Table of Contentsour products. Failure to meet these standards could limit our ability to market our products in those regions that require compliance with such standards. Examples of standards to which we are subject include electrical safety standards, such as those of the International Electrotechnical Commission (e.g., IEC 60601-ss series of standards), and composition standards, such as the Reduction of Hazardous Substances (“RoHS”) and the Waste Electrical and Electronic Equipment (“WEEE”) Directives.U.S. RegulationOur products are subject to regulation as medical devices in the United States under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (“FFDCA”), as implemented and enforced by the FDA. The FDA regulates the development, design, non-clinical and clinical research, manufacturing, safety, efficacy, labeling, packaging, storage, installation, recordkeeping, complaint and adverse event reporting, clearance, approval, certification, promotion, marketing, export, import distribution, and service of medical devices in the U.S. to ensure that medical devices distributed domestically are safe and effective for their intended uses.Under the FFDCA, medical devices are classified into one of three classes—Class I, Class II, or Class III—depending on the degree of risk associated with each medical device and the extent of control needed to ensure safety and effectiveness. Our current products are Class II medical devices.Class II medical devices are those that are subject to general controls, and most require premarket demonstration of adherence to certain performance standards or other special controls, as specified by the FDA, and special controls as deemed necessary by the FDA to ensure the safety and effectiveness of the device. These special controls can include performance standards, post-market surveillance, patient registries, and FDA guidance documents.Manufacturers of most Class II devices are required to submit to the FDA a premarket notification under Section 510(k) of the FFDCA requesting authorization to commercially distribute the device. The FDA’s authorization to commercially distribute a device subject to a 510(k) premarket notification is generally known as 510(k) clearance. Our current products are subject to premarket notification and clearance under section 510(k) of the FFDCA. To obtain 510(k) clearance, we must submit to the FDA a premarket notification submission demonstrating that the proposed device is “substantially equivalent” to a legally marketed predicate device.The FDA may require additional information, including clinical data, to make a determination regarding substantial equivalence. In addition, the FDA collects user fees for certain medical device submissions and annual fees for medical device establishments.If the FDA agrees that the device is substantially equivalent to a predicate device, it will grant clearance to commercially market the device in the U.S. The FDA has a statutory 90-day period to respond to a 510(k) submission; however, as a practical matter, clearance often takes longer. The FDA may require further information, including clinical data, to make a determination regarding substantial equivalence. If the FDA determines that the device, or its intended use, is not “substantially equivalent,” the device may be designated as a Class III device. The device sponsor must then fulfill more rigorous PMA requirements or can request a risk-based classification determination for the device in accordance with the de novo classification pathway, which is a route to market for novel medical devices that are low to moderate risk and are not substantially equivalent to a predicate device.The PMA process is more demanding than the 510(k) premarket notification process. In a PMA application, the manufacturer must demonstrate that the device is safe and effective, and the PMA application must be supported by extensive data, including data from preclinical studies and human clinical trials. The FDA, by statute and regulation, has 180 days to review a PMA application, although the review more often occurs over a significantly longer period of time and can take up to several years. In approving a PMA application or clearing a 510(k) submission, the FDA may also require some additional manufacturing controls, design control activities and approvals, as well as specific post-market surveillance requirements when necessary to protect the public health or to provide additional safety and effectiveness data for the device. In such cases, the manufacturer might be required to follow certain patient groups for a number of years and make periodic reports to the FDA on the clinical status of those patients.Clinical trials are almost always required to support a PMA and are sometimes required to support a 510(k) submission. All clinical investigations designed to determine the safety and effectiveness of a medical device must be conducted in accordance with the FDA’s investigational device exemption (“IDE”) regulations, which govern investigational device labeling, prohibit the promotion of the investigational device, and specify an array of recordkeeping, reporting and monitoring responsibilities of study sponsors and study investigators. Regardless of the degree of risk presented by the medical device, clinical studies must be approved by, and conducted under the oversight of, an Institutional Review Board (“IRB”) for each clinical site. During a study, the sponsor is required to comply with the applicable FDA requirements, including, for example, trial monitoring, selecting clinical investigators and providing them with the investigational plan, ensuring IRB review, adverse event reporting, record keeping, and prohibitions on the promotion of investigational devices or on making safety or effectiveness claims for them. The clinical investigators in the clinical study are also subject to the FDA’s regulations and must obtain patient informed 15Table of Contentsconsent, rigorously follow the investigational plan and study protocol, control the disposition of the investigational device, and comply with all reporting and recordkeeping requirements. Additionally, after a trial begins, we, the FDA, or the IRB could suspend or terminate a clinical trial at any time for various reasons, including a belief that the risks to study subjects outweigh the anticipated benefits.Over the last several years, the FDA has proposed reforms to its 510(k) clearance process, and such proposals could include increased requirements for clinical data and a longer review period and make it more difficult for manufacturers to utilize the 510(k) clearance process for their products. For example, in September 2019, the FDA issued revised final guidance describing an optional “safety and performance based” premarket review pathway for manufacturers of “certain, well-understood device types” to demonstrate substantial equivalence under the 510(k) clearance pathway by showing that such device meets objective safety and performance criteria established by the FDA, thereby obviating the need for manufacturers to compare the safety and performance of their medical devices to specific predicate devices in the clearance process. The FDA maintains a list of device types appropriate for the “safety and performance based” pathway and continues to develop product-specific guidance documents that identify the performance criteria for each such device type, as well as the recommended testing methods, where feasible.After a device receives 510(k) clearance, any modification that could significantly affect its safety or effectiveness, or that would constitute a major change or modification in its intended use, will require a new 510(k) clearance or, depending on the modification, PMA approval or de novo classification. The FDA requires each manufacturer to determine whether the proposed change requires submission of a 510(k), de novo classification, or a PMA in the first instance, but the FDA can review any such decision and disagree with a manufacturer’s determination. If the FDA disagrees with a manufacturer’s determination, the FDA can require the manufacturer to cease marketing and/or request the recall of the modified device until 510(k) marketing clearance, approval of a PMA, or issuance of a de novo classification. Also, in these circumstances, the manufacturer may be subject to significant regulatory fines or penalties.In addition, the FDA may place significant limitations upon the intended use of our products as a condition of granting marketing authorization. Moreover, after a device is placed on the market, numerous FDA and other regulatory requirements continue to apply. These requirements include establishment registration and device listing with the FDA; compliance with medical device reporting regulations, which require that manufacturers report to the FDA if their device caused or contributed, or may have caused or contributed, to a death or serious injury or malfunctioned in a way that would likely cause or contribute to a death or serious injury if it were to recur; compliance with corrections and removal reporting regulations, which require that manufacturers report to the FDA field corrections and product recalls or removals if undertaken to reduce a risk to health posed by the device or to remedy a violation of the FFDCA that may present a risk to health; the FDA’s recall authority, whereby the agency can order device manufacturers to recall from the market a product that is in violation of governing laws and regulations; and post-market surveillance activities and regulations, which apply when deemed by the FDA to be necessary to protect the public health or to provide additional safety and effectiveness data for the device. In addition, the FDA and the Federal Trade Commission also regulate the advertising and promotion of our products to ensure that the claims we make are consistent with our regulatory clearances, that there is scientific data to substantiate the claims, and that our advertising is neither false nor misleading. In general, we may not promote or advertise our products for uses not within the scope of our intended use statement in our clearances or make unsupported safety and effectiveness claims. Our manufacturing processes are required to comply with the Quality System Regulation (“QSR”). The QSR covers, among other things, the methods used in, and the facilities and controls used for, the design, testing, controlling, documenting, manufacture, packaging, labeling, storage, installation, and servicing of all medical devices intended for human use. The QSR also requires maintenance of extensive records, which demonstrate compliance with the FDA regulation, the manufacturer’s own procedures, specifications, and testing, as well as distribution and post-market experience. Compliance with the QSR is necessary for a manufacturer to be able to continue to market cleared or approved product offerings in the U.S. A company’s facilities, records, and manufacturing processes are subject to periodic scheduled or unscheduled inspections by the FDA. Failure to maintain compliance with applicable QSR requirements could result in the shut-down of, or restrictions on, manufacturing operations and the recall or seizure of marketed products. If the FDA determines that a manufacturer has failed to comply with applicable regulatory requirements, it can take a variety of compliance or enforcement actions, which may result in any of the following sanctions:•warning letters, untitled letters, fines, injunctions, consent decrees, administrative penalties, and civil or criminal penalties;•recalls, withdrawals, or administrative detention or seizure of our products;•operating restrictions or partial suspension or total shutdown of production;•refusing or delaying requests for 510(k) marketing clearance or PMA approvals of new products or modified products;•withdrawing 510(k) clearances or PMA approvals that have already been granted;16Table of Contents•refusal to grant export approvals for our products; or•criminal prosecution.In addition, the discovery of previously unknown problems with any marketed products, including unanticipated adverse events or adverse events of increasing severity or frequency, whether resulting from the use of the device within the scope of its clearance or off-label by a physician in the practice of medicine, could result in restrictions on the device, including the removal of the product from the market or voluntary or mandatory device recalls.Products manufactured outside of the U.S. by or for us are subject to U.S. Customs and FDA inspection upon entry into the U.S. We must demonstrate compliance of such products with U.S. regulations and carefully document the eventual distribution or re-exportation of such products. Failure to comply with all applicable regulations could prevent us from having access to products or components critical to the manufacture of finished products and lead to shortages and delays.Data Privacy and Security Laws Numerous state, federal, and foreign laws, regulations, and standards govern the collection, use, access to, confidentiality, and security of health-related and other personal information and could apply now or in the future to our operations or the operations of our partners. In the U.S., numerous federal and state laws and regulations, including data breach notification laws, health information privacy and security laws, and consumer protection laws and regulations govern the collection, use, disclosure, and protection of health-related and other personal information. In addition, certain foreign laws govern the privacy and security of personal data, including health-related data. Privacy and security laws, regulations, and other obligations are constantly evolving, may conflict with each other to complicate compliance efforts, and can result in investigations, proceedings, or actions that lead to significant civil and/or criminal penalties and restrictions on data processing.We collect, process, share, disclose, transfer, and otherwise use data, some of which contains personal information about identifiable individuals including, but not limited to, our employees, clinical trial participants, partners, and vendors. Therefore, we are subject to U.S. (federal, state, local) and international laws and regulations, including those in the European Economic Area (“EEA”) and the UK regarding data privacy and security and our use of such data.We are subject to the European Union General Data Protection Regulation 2016/679 and applicable national supplementing laws (collectively, the “EU GDPR”) and to the United Kingdom General Data Protection Regulation and Data Protection Act 2018 (collectively, the “UK GDPR”) (the EU GDPR and UK GDPR together referred to as the “GDPR”). The GDPR imposes comprehensive data privacy compliance obligations in relation to our collection, processing, sharing, disclosure, transfer, and other use of data relating to an identifiable living individual or “personal data,” including a principle of accountability and the obligation to demonstrate compliance through policies, procedures, training, and audit.The EU GDPR and UK GDPR also regulate cross-border transfers of personal data out of the EEA and the UK. Recent legal developments in Europe have created complexity and uncertainty regarding such transfers, in particular in relation to transfers to the United States.Cybersecurity In the normal course of business, we may collect and store personal information and other sensitive information, including proprietary and confidential business information, trade secrets, intellectual property, patient information, sensitive third-party information, and employee information. To protect this information, our existing cybersecurity policies require continuous monitoring and detection programs, network security precautions, encryption of critical data, and in-depth security assessments of vendors. We maintain various protections designed to safeguard against cyberattacks, including firewalls and virus detection software. We have established and regularly test our disaster recovery plan, and we protect against business interruption by backing up our major systems. In addition, we periodically scan our environment for any vulnerabilities, perform penetration testing, and engage third parties to assess the effectiveness of our data security practices. In addition, we maintain insurance that includes cybersecurity coverage.Our cybersecurity program is executed by a team of highly skilled cybersecurity professionals, including, but not limited to, risk and threat analysts, penetration testers, security operations center analysts, cyber regulatory analysts, and risk/threat modelers. Team members maintain certification(s) and practical application of skills through organizations, such as ISC2 (Certified Information Security Systems Professional or CISSP), Global Information Assurance (GIAC), EC-Council, the Committee on National Security Systems (CNSS), and the National Security Agency (NSA). The program incorporates industry-standard frameworks, policies, and practices designed to protect the privacy and security of our sensitive information. Our cybersecurity team reports to the Board of Directors on a quarterly basis on information security and cybersecurity matters or more frequently as needed. Our Audit Committee, which is comprised of several members of our Board of Directors, has oversight responsibility for our data security practices, and we believe that the committee has the requisite skills and visibility into the design and operation of our data security practices to fulfill this responsibility effectively. Five members of our Board 17Table of Contentsof Directors have enhanced information security expertise, including Gary S. Guthart, Ph.D., Joseph C. Beery, Amal M. Johnson, Keith R. Leonard Jr., and Mark J. Rubash.Despite the implementation of our cybersecurity program, our security measures cannot guarantee that a significant cyberattack will not occur. A successful attack on our information technology systems could have significant consequences for the business. While we devote resources to our security measures to protect our systems and information, these measures cannot provide absolute security. See “Risk Factors – Information technology system failures, cyberattacks, or deficiencies in our cybersecurity could harm our business, customer relations, financial condition, or results of operations” for additional information about the risks to our business associated with a breach or compromise to our information technology systems.In April 2022, the FDA issued draft guidance on cybersecurity related to quality systems and premarket submission content for medical devices. The 2022 draft guidance for premarket cybersecurity in medical devices would increase the expectations that the FDA has for manufacturers. We are diligently pursuing compliance with this new guidance.Foreign RegulationIn order for us to market our products in countries outside the United States, we must obtain regulatory approvals or certifications and comply with extensive product and quality system regulations in other countries. These regulations, including the requirements for approvals, clearance, or certifications and the time required for regulatory review, vary from country to country. Some countries have regulatory review processes that are substantially longer than U.S. processes. Failure to obtain regulatory approval or certification in a timely manner and meet all of the local requirements, including language and specific safety standards, in any foreign country in which we plan to market our products could prevent us from marketing products in such countries or subject us to sanctions and fines.ChinaChina has its own regulatory agency. They require regulatory approvals and compliance with extensive safety and quality system regulations. Failure to obtain regulatory approval or failure to comply with any regulation may negatively impact our ability to generate revenue and harm our business. In addition to product registration approvals, our system sales into China are also dependent on obtaining importation authorizations and provincial approvals, as well as hospitals completing a tender and hospital listing process under the authorization. In October 2018, the China National Health Commission published on its official website the quota for major medical equipment to be imported and sold in China through 2020. After an adjustment notice was published in the third quarter of 2020 (ref. NHC Financial Notice [2020] 315), the government will allow for the total sale of 225 new Endoscopic Surgical Instrument Control Systems (surgical robots) into China, which could include da Vinci Surgical Systems as well as surgical systems introduced by others. Sales of da Vinci Surgical Systems under the quota are uncertain, as they are dependent on hospitals completing a tender process and receiving associated approvals.JapanMost medical devices must undergo thorough safety examinations and demonstrate medical efficacy before they receive regulatory approval to be sold in Japan. We obtained approval from the Japanese Ministry of Health, Labor, and Welfare (“MHLW”) for our da Vinci Si Surgical System in October 2012, for our da Vinci Xi Surgical System in March 2015, and for our da Vinci X Surgical System in April 2018. National reimbursement status in Japan was received for prostatectomy procedures in April 2012 and for da Vinci partial nephrectomy procedures in April 2016. An additional 12 da Vinci procedures were granted reimbursement effective April 1, 2018, including gastrectomy, low anterior resection, lobectomy, and hysterectomy, for both malignant and benign conditions. An additional seven da Vinci procedures were granted reimbursement effective April 1, 2020. An additional eight da Vinci procedures were granted reimbursement effective April 1, 2022, including colon resection. In addition, we received higher reimbursement for da Vinci gastrectomy procedures, as compared to open and conventional laparoscopic procedure reimbursements. The additional reimbursed procedures have varying levels of conventional laparoscopic penetration and will generally be reimbursed at rates equal to the conventional laparoscopic procedures. Given the reimbursement level and laparoscopic penetration for these additional procedures, there can be no assurance that the adoption pace for these procedures will be similar to prostatectomy or partial nephrectomy, given their higher reimbursement, or any other da Vinci procedure. If these procedures are not adopted and we are not successful in obtaining adequate procedure reimbursements for additional procedures, then the demand for our products in Japan could be limited. The process of reimbursement for new da Vinci surgical procedures in Japan is led by the surgical societies. The societies submit for reimbursement or incremental reimbursement to the MHLW for their evaluation. The decision to reimburse requires in-country clinical data and is fixed in April of even-numbered years. In September 2022, we received regulatory clearance for the da Vinci SP Surgical System in Japan for the same set of procedures as can be performed on the da Vinci Xi Surgical System in Japan.European UnionIn the European Union (“EU”), all medical devices placed on the EU market must meet the essential requirements, including the requirement that a medical device must be designed and manufactured in such a way that it will not compromise 18Table of Contentsthe clinical condition or safety of patients, or the safety and health of users and others. In addition, the device must achieve the performance intended by the manufacturer and be designed, manufactured, and packaged in a suitable manner.Until and including May 25, 2021, medical devices were regulated by Council Directive 93/42/EEC (the “EU Medical Devices Directive” or “MDD”), which has been repealed and replaced by Regulation (EU) No 2017/745 (the “EU Medical Devices Regulation” or “MDR”). Our current certificates have been granted under the MDD. However, as of May 26, 2021, some of the MDR requirements apply in place of the corresponding requirements of the MDD with regard to the registration of economic operators and of devices, post-market surveillance, and vigilance. Pursuing marketing of medical devices in the EU requires that our devices be certified under the new regime set forth in the MDR, and we are diligently pursuing our plan to be fully compliant by May 26, 2024. Under recently proposed draft legislation issued by the European Commission, this date would be extended to December 2027 for higher classification devices (Class III and certain Class C IIb implantable devices) and to December 2028 for medium- and lower-risk devices (for the other Class IIb devices, Class IIa, and some Class I devices). We may adjust our transition plans to take this transitional period into account, if said legislative proposal is adopted by the European Parliament and Council.Medical Devices DirectiveUnder the EU Medical Devices Directive, all medical devices placed on the market in the EU must meet the essential requirements laid down in Annex I to the EU Medical Devices Directive, including the requirement that a medical device must be designed and manufactured in such a way that it will not compromise the clinical condition or safety of patients or the safety and health of users and others. In addition, the device must achieve the performance intended by the manufacturer and be designed, manufactured, and packaged in a suitable manner. The European Commission has adopted various standards applicable to medical devices. These include standards governing common requirements, such as the sterilization and safety of medical electrical equipment and product standards for certain types of medical devices. There are also harmonized standards relating to design and manufacture. While not mandatory, compliance with these standards is viewed as the easiest way to satisfy the essential requirements as a practical matter, as it creates a rebuttable presumption that the device satisfies the essential requirements.Except for low-risk medical devices (Class I non-sterile, non-measuring devices), where the manufacturer can self-assess the conformity of its products with the essential requirements (except for any parts that relate to sterility or metrology), a conformity assessment procedure requires the intervention of a notified body. Notified bodies are independent organizations designated by EU member states to assess the conformity of devices before being placed on the market. A notified body would typically audit and examine a product’s technical dossiers and the manufacturer’s quality system (the notified body must presume that quality systems that implement the relevant harmonized standards, which is ISO 13485:2016 for Medical Devices Quality Management Systems, conform to these requirements). If satisfied that the relevant product conforms to the relevant essential requirements, the notified body issues a certificate of conformity, which the manufacturer uses as a basis for its own declaration of conformity. The manufacturer may then apply the Conformité Européenne mark (“CE mark”) to the device, which allows the device to be placed on the market throughout the EU.Throughout the term of the certificate of conformity, the manufacturer will be subject to periodic surveillance audits to verify continued compliance with the applicable requirements. In particular, there will be a new audit by the notified body before it will renew the relevant certificate(s).Medical Devices RegulationOn April 5, 2017, the MDR was adopted with the aim of ensuring better protection of public health and patient safety. The MDR establishes a uniform, transparent, predictable, and sustainable regulatory framework across the EU for medical devices and ensures a high level of safety and health while supporting innovation. Unlike directives, regulations are directly applicable in EU member states without the need for member states to implement into national law. This aims at increasing harmonization across the EU.The MDR became effective on May 26, 2021. Devices lawfully placed on the market pursuant to the MDD prior to May 26, 2021, may generally continue to be made available on the market or put into service until and including May 26, 2025, provided that the requirements of the transitional provisions are fulfilled (referred to as the “sell-off” provision). In particular, the certificate in question must still be valid. However, even in this case, manufacturers must comply with a number of new or reinforced requirements set forth in the MDR, in particular the obligations described below. If it is adopted by the European Parliament and Council, under draft legislation proposed by the European Commission, the sell-off provision would be removed.The MDR requires that, before placing a device on the market, other than a custom-made device, manufacturers (as well as other economic operators, such as authorized representatives and importers) must register by submitting identification information to the electronic system (EUDAMED), unless they have already registered. The information to be submitted by manufacturers (and authorized representatives) also includes the name, address, and contact details of the person or persons 19Table of Contentsresponsible for regulatory compliance. The new Regulation also requires that, before placing a device on the market, other than a custom-made device, manufacturers must assign a unique identifier to the device and provide it along with other core data to the unique device identifier (“UDI”) database. These new requirements aim at ensuring better identification and traceability of the devices.All manufacturers placing medical devices on the market in the EU must comply with the EU medical device vigilance system, which has been reinforced by the MDR. Under this system, serious incidents and Field Safety Corrective Actions (“FSCAs”) must be reported to the relevant authorities of the EU member states. These reports will have to be submitted through Eudamed (once functional) and aim to ensure that, in addition to reporting to the relevant authorities of the EU member states, other actors, such as the economic operators in the supply chain, will also be informed. Until Eudamed is fully functional, the corresponding provisions of the MDD continue to apply. Manufacturers are required to take FSCAs, which are defined as any corrective action for technical or medical reasons to prevent or reduce a risk of a serious incident associated with the use of a medical device that is made available on the market.The advertising and promotion of medical devices are subject to some general principles set forth in EU legislation. According to the MDR, only devices that are CE marked may be marketed and advertised in the EU in accordance with their intended purpose. Directive 2006/114/EC concerning misleading and comparative advertising and Directive 2005/29/EC on unfair commercial practices, while not specific to the advertising of medical devices, also apply to the advertising thereof and contain general rules, for example, requiring that advertisements are evidenced, balanced, and not misleading. Specific requirements are defined at a national level. EU member states’ laws related to the advertising and promotion of medical devices, which vary between jurisdictions, may limit or restrict the advertising and promotion of products to the general public and may impose limitations on promotional activities with healthcare professionals.Many EU member states have adopted specific anti-gift statutes that further limit commercial practices for medical devices, in particular vis-à-vis healthcare professionals and organizations. Additionally, there has been a recent trend of increased regulation of payments and transfers of value provided to healthcare professionals or entities and many EU member states have adopted national “Sunshine Acts,” which impose reporting and transparency requirements (often on an annual basis), similar to the requirements in the United States, on medical device manufacturers. Certain countries also mandate implementation of commercial compliance programs.In the EU, regulatory authorities have the power to carry out announced and, if necessary, unannounced inspections of companies, as well as suppliers and/or sub-contractors and, where necessary, the facilities of professional users. Failure to comply with regulatory requirements (as applicable) could require time and resources to respond to the regulatory authorities’ observations and to implement corrective and preventive actions, as appropriate. Regulatory authorities have broad compliance and enforcement powers and, if such issues cannot be resolved to their satisfaction, can take a variety of actions, including untitled or warning letters, fines, consent decrees, injunctions, or civil or criminal penalties.The aforementioned EU rules are generally applicable in the EEA, which consists of the 27 EU Member States as well as Iceland, Liechtenstein, and Norway.BrexitSince January 1, 2021, the Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency (“MHRA”) has become the sovereign regulatory authority responsible for the Great Britain (i.e., England, Wales, and Scotland) medical device market. Following the end of the Brexit transitional period on January 1, 2021, new regulations require all medical devices to be registered with the MHRA before being placed on the Great Britain market. From January 1, 2022, non-UK manufacturers were required to appoint a UK Responsible Person for the purposes of registering devices placed on the Great Britain market. Under the terms of the Protocol on Ireland/Northern Ireland, the MDR applies to medical devices placed on the Northern Ireland market in the same way as it applies to medical devices marketed in the EU.On June 26, 2022, the MHRA published its response to a 10-week consultation on the future regulation of medical devices in the UK. Regulations implementing the new regime were originally scheduled to come into force in July 2023 but have recently been postponed to July 2024. Devices bearing CE marks issued by EU notified bodies under the MDR or MDD are now subject to transitional arrangements. In its consultation response, the MHRA indicated that the future UK regulations will allow devices certified under the MDR to be placed on the market in Great Britain under the CE mark until either the certificate expires or for five years after the new regulations take effect, whichever is sooner. Following these transitional periods, all medical devices will require a UK Conformity Assessed (“UKCA”) mark in order to be placed on the market in Great Britain. Manufacturers may choose to use the UKCA mark on a voluntary basis prior to entry of the new regulations on July 1, 2024. However, from July 2024, products that do not have existing and valid certification under the EU Medical Devices Directive or EU MDR and, therefore, are not subject to the transitional arrangements will be required to carry the UKCA mark if they are to be sold into the market in Great Britain. For products to be sold into the market in Northern Ireland, CE marking will continue to be recognized as a result of the Northern Ireland Protocol implemented following the UK’s exit from the EU. UKCA 20Table of Contentsmarking will not be recognized in the EU. Following the transitional period, compliance with the UK regulations will be a prerequisite to be able to affix the UKCA mark to our products, without which they cannot be sold or marketed in Great Britain.In addition, the Trade Deal between the UK and the EU generally provides for cooperation and exchange of information between the parties in the areas of product safety and compliance, including market surveillance, enforcement activities and measures, standardization-related activities, exchanges of officials, and coordinated product recalls. As such, processes for compliance and reporting should reflect requirements from regulatory authorities.Other countriesRegulations in other countries, including the requirements for approvals, certification, or clearance and the time required for regulatory review, vary from country to country. Certain countries, such as South Korea, Brazil, Australia, India, and Canada, have their own regulatory agencies. These countries typically require regulatory approvals and compliance with extensive safety and quality system regulations included in the MDSAP (Medical Device Single Audit Program) that we comply with every year as part of our annual audit program. Failure to obtain regulatory approval in any foreign country in which we plan to market our products, or failure to comply with any regulation in any foreign country in which we market our products may negatively impact our ability to generate revenue and harm our business.In addition, local regulations may apply, which govern the use of our products and which could have an adverse effect on our product utilization if they are unfavorable. All such regulations are revised from time to time and, in general, are increasing in complexity and in the scope and degree of documentation and testing required. There can be no assurance that the outcomes from such documentation and testing will be acceptable to any particular regulatory agency or will continue to be acceptable over time. There are further regulations governing the importation, marketing, sale, distribution, use, and service as well as the removal and disposal of medical devices in the regions in which we operate and market our products. Failure to comply with any of these regulations could result in sanctions or fines and could prevent us from marketing our products in these regions.Third-Party Coverage and PaymentOur customers, including physicians, hospitals, and outpatient facilities, typically bill third-party payors for the costs and fees associated with the procedures in which our products are used. In the U.S., in order to receive payment for the procedures performed using our products, our customers must report codes that describe the services or products furnished and determine the medical necessity of the service or whether the service is included in the payors’ policy. In the U.S. and most markets globally where we sell our products, payment for medical services and surgical procedures to hospitals, outpatient facilities, and surgeons (collectively “providers”) is determined by the government, commercial payors (insurers), or a combination of both.In the U.S., the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (“CMS”) and its fiscal intermediaries (Medicare Administrative Contractors) and state Medicaid programs establish reimbursement policies for medical and surgical services at the state and federal level for the Medicare and Medicaid programs. Third-party payors often rely upon Medicare coverage policy and payment limitations in setting their own coverage and payment policies but also have their own methods and approval processes. Commercial payors in non-capitated contracts commonly establish payment to providers based on a percentage of the Medicare payment rate.Physicians and outpatient facilities bill for medical and surgical services by reporting a combination of billing codes. Current Procedural Terminology (“CPT”) codes are created by the American Medical Association (“AMA”) with input from CMS and commercial payors to describe medical and surgical procedures. CPT codes currently exist for minimally invasive surgical procedures, which may involve the da Vinci surgical system, as well as for robotic-assisted bronchoscopy, which may involve the Ion endoluminal system. In general, the majority of payors, including Medicare, consider robotic assistance as a tool used to perform the procedure and do not pay providers more for a procedure that involves robotic assistance using the da Vinci, Ion, or any other robotic system. Because there is often no separate payment for the use of our products, the additional cost associated with the use of our products can affect the profit margin of the hospital or surgery center where the procedure is performed. If hospitals do not obtain sufficient payment from third-party payors for procedures performed with our products, or if governmental and private payors’ policies do not cover surgical procedures performed using our products, we may not be able to generate the revenue necessary to support our business.Hospitals bill for inpatient services by reporting ICD-10-PCS codes. CMS is primarily responsible for overseeing changes and modifications to ICD-10-PCS codes. Medicare payments to hospitals for services provided during an inpatient stay are based on the Inpatient Prospective Payment System (“IPPS”). Under the IPPS, each patient discharge is categorized into a Medicare Severity Adjusted Diagnosis-Related Group (“MS-DRG” or “DRG”). Each DRG has an assigned payment weight based on the average resources used for Medicare patients in that DRG, taking into account the patient’s principal diagnosis, surgical procedures, age, discharge status, and additional or secondary diagnoses, among other things. The DRG is a single, bundled payment intended to cover all costs associated with the inpatient admission.21Table of ContentsThe use of robotic technology does not influence the MS-DRG assignment or payment for an inpatient admission related to a surgical procedure. CMS annually updates hospital inpatient and outpatient payments based on hospitals’ charge data. Hospital inpatient and outpatient payments are also adjusted based on whether the hospital is a teaching hospital, its geographic location, and any failures to meet certain quality metrics, among other factors.Commercial payors commonly establish inpatient facility payment for providers using published Medicare DRG rates as a benchmark. Commercial payment to providers varies depending on the procedure performed, geographic location, contractual allowances, and other factors.Medicare and commercial payor payments to facilities for medical and surgical services may not always fully reimburse providers for all costs associated with furnishing these procedures. If payment is insufficient for procedures involving our technology, hospitals and physicians may decide not to use our products.In countries outside of the U.S., payment for surgical services to physicians and facilities differs considerably and varies by country. In some markets, there is a single public payor who provides a global annual budget to hospitals to provide all care to the population served in a designated geographic area. In other markets, private insurance can be purchased or is provided by employers to supplement public health insurance. In some countries, patients may be permitted to pay directly for surgical services; however, such “co-pay” practices are not common (or allowed) in many countries. Further, in many global markets, access to procedures and technology is governed or heavily influenced by Health Technology Assessment (“HTA”) organizations, which conduct periodic and extensive evidence-based reviews of the clinical value and cost effectiveness of a new technology. To effectively conduct our business, we may need to seek OUS reimbursement approvals, and we do not know if these required approvals will be obtained in a timely manner or at all. In addition, in some markets, HTA organizations may publish reports with mixed conclusions about the clinical and economic value of our products to the population. Such reviews could negatively impact hospital adoption of our technology.Healthcare ReformIn the U.S., there have been, and continue to be, a number of legislative initiatives to contain healthcare costs. In March 2010, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as amended by the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act (collectively, the “ACA”), was enacted. The ACA made changes that have significantly impacted healthcare providers, insurers, pharmaceutical companies, and medical device manufacturers. The ACA contained a number of provisions designed to generate the revenues necessary to fund health insurance coverage expansion and appropriated funding to research the comparative effectiveness of healthcare treatments and strategies. To date, this research has had a negligible effect on Medicare coverage and reimbursement decisions as well as influence on other third-party payor coverage and reimbursement policies.Since its enactment, there have been judicial, executive, and Congressional challenges to certain aspects of the ACA. On June 17, 2021, the U.S. Supreme Court dismissed the most recent judicial challenge to the ACA brought by several states without specifically ruling on the constitutionality of the ACA. Thus, the ACA remained in effect in its current form.In addition, other legislative changes have been proposed and adopted since the ACA was enacted. These changes included an aggregate reduction in Medicare payments, which went into effect on April 1, 2013, and will remain in effect through 2031, unless additional Congressional action is taken, with the exception of a temporary suspension due to the COVID-19 pandemic from May 1, 2020, through March 31, 2022. On January 2, 2013, the American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012 was signed into law, which, among other things, further reduced Medicare payments to several types of providers, including hospitals, imaging centers, and cancer treatment centers. The Medicare Access and CHIP Reauthorization Act of 2015, enacted on April 16, 2015 (“MACRA”), repealed the formula by which Medicare made annual payment adjustments to physicians and replaced the former formula with fixed annual updates and a new system of incentive payments that began in 2019 and are based on various performance measures and physicians’ participation in alternative payment models, such as accountable care organizations. Individual states in the U.S. have also become increasingly aggressive in passing legislation and implementing regulations designed to control product pricing, including price or patient reimbursement constraints and discounts, and require marketing cost disclosure and transparency measures.In the U.S. and abroad, reimbursement is dynamic and subject to change annually by public and private payors. Congress and government agencies may also intervene and pass legislation that is intended to reduce healthcare spending, which could impact market access. Such legislative interventions can vacillate significantly based on government leadership. Other federal or state healthcare reform measures that may be adopted in the future could have a material adverse effect on our business. Any regulatory or legislative developments in domestic or foreign markets that eliminate or reduce reimbursement rates for procedures performed with our products could harm our ability to sell our products or cause downward pressure on the prices of our products, either of which would adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of business operations.For instance, in December 2021, the EU Regulation No 2021/2282 on HTA, amending Directive 2011/24/EU, was adopted. This regulation, which entered into force in January 2022, intends to boost cooperation among EU member states in assessing health technologies, including certain medical devices, and provides the basis for cooperation at the EU level for joint 22Table of Contentsclinical assessments in these areas. The regulation foresees a three-year transitional period and will permit EU member states to use common HTA tools, methodologies, and procedures across the EU, working together in four main areas, including joint clinical assessment of the innovative health technologies with the most potential impact for patients, joint scientific consultations whereby developers can seek advice from HTA authorities, identification of emerging health technologies to identify promising technologies early, and continuing voluntary cooperation in other areas. Individual EU member states will continue to be responsible for assessing non-clinical (e.g., economic, social, ethical, etc.) aspects of health technology and making decisions on pricing and reimbursement.Human CapitalThe future success of our company depends on our ability to attract, retain, and further develop top talent. We enable this by continuously striving to make Intuitive an inclusive, diverse, and safe workplace with opportunities for our employees to grow and develop in their careers. These objectives are supported through strong compensation, benefits, programs that encourage employee health and wellness, and connections between our employees and the communities in which they live and work.As of December 31, 2022, we had approximately 12,120 full-time employees, 1,651 of whom were engaged directly in research and development, 4,843 in manufacturing operations, 3,834 in commercial and service operations, and 1,792 in administrative activities. During 2022, the number of employees increased by approximately 2,327. Our employees are based in 29 different countries around the world. Our global workforce consists of diverse, highly skilled talent at all levels. During 2022, our turnover rate was approximately 10.9%.Inclusion and DiversityIntuitive’s inclusion and diversity (“I&D”) vision is to empower our employees and customers from every background to fully contribute toward our mission to expand the potential of physicians to heal without constraints. We want to build an environment where every individual can belong and flourish – in our company and the communities we serve.We believe that everyone should feel included and fairly treated, and we embrace the unique qualities that make people who they are. This includes all genders and gender identities, races, ethnicities, ages, national origins, native languages, disabilities, sexual orientations, body sizes, military backgrounds, socioeconomic backgrounds, religions, and family structures. We believe in seeking the different to propel innovation and creativity forward.We have a four-part strategy to guide our I&D progress: ensuring an inclusive experience, where employees from all backgrounds feel welcome, supported, and valued; building a diverse workforce to fuel innovation and better mirror the patients we serve; continuously investing in and enhancing the fairness of our people practices and sharing progress; and strengthening industry engagement through collaboration with the healthcare community, diversity-focused organizations, and shareholders to drive positive change. Employee Resource Groups (“ERGs”) have been one key area of I&D focus and growth, providing support and community for traditionally marginalized groups, including women, people of color, members of the lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, queer, and/or questioning (“LGBTQ+”) community, military veterans, and employees with disabilities. Details of our employee workforce composition, including a link to our Employer Information Report (“EEO-1”) submission to the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (“EEOC”), are available on our website. Although we reference the availability of our EEO-1 on our website in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, our EEO-1 and any other materials on our website are not incorporated by reference into this Annual Report on Form 10-K or any of our other filings under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, or the Exchange Act. While matters discussed in such EEO-1 and other website materials may be significant, any significance should not be read as necessarily rising to the level of materiality used for the purposes of our compliance with the U.S. federal securities laws, even if we use the word “material” or “materiality” in such materials.From a governance perspective, maintaining a mix of backgrounds and experience in our Board composition is essential to understanding and reflecting the needs of our diverse stakeholders. Currently, four of our 11 Board members self-identify as women, and three of our 11 board members self-identify as individuals from underrepresented communities (defined as an individual who self-identifies as Black, African American, Hispanic, Latino, Asian, Pacific Islander, Native American, Native Hawaiian, or Alaska Native, or who self-identifies as LGBTQ+).Health, Safety, and WellnessThe health, safety, and wellness of our employees is a priority in which we continue to invest and expand. We provide our employees and their families with access to a variety of innovative, flexible, and convenient health and wellness programs. Program benefits are intended to provide protection, peace of mind, and security, including workplace health and safety best practices integrated into everyday activities and programs that support employee time away from work, family care, mental health, or financial well-being.23Table of ContentsWe continue to evolve our programs to respond to the best interest of our changing workforce, as well as the communities in which we operate, in compliance with government regulations. Each Intuitive location manages overall safety with guidance based on regional, country, and local regulations and best practices.In 2022, we focused on collecting internal and external insights to inform decision-making on work models that would align with how employees will work in the current environment, which has evolved as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. These efforts will allow for an improved employee experience, regardless of whether an employee is working from home, fully on-site, or in a hybrid fashion. As we move into 2023, our focus will be on the implementation and sustained success of these new work models, including on-site engagement activities that reinforce our differentiating culture and facilitate cross-team networking, collaboration, and innovation.Compensation and BenefitsWe provide compensation and benefits programs to help meet the needs of our employees. In addition to base compensation, these programs, which vary by country and region, include annual bonuses, stock awards, an Employee Stock Purchase Plan, retirement savings plans, healthcare, income protection benefits, paid time off, family leave, family care resources, and flexible work schedules, among many others.Ensuring fair and equitable pay is integral to our commitment to our employees. Our executive team and Board of Directors strongly support this commitment. We regularly review pay for internal equity and ensure our compensation structure is appropriate, including with regard to race/ethnicity and gender. We also engage outside counsel to ensure compliance with pay equity laws. When we identify any potential differences in pay for whatever reason, we research those differences and act if appropriate. Employees are encouraged to share any pay equity concerns with management, Human Resources, or confidentially through our reporting hotline, including anonymously. Intuitive has a non-retaliation policy for raising any workplace concerns, including around pay.Talent DevelopmentWe value our employees and the passion, commitment, and expertise they contribute to Intuitive. To enhance employee retention and engagement, we offer ongoing learning and leadership training opportunities that support growth.With a commitment to building strong, inclusive leaders, in 2022, we rolled out an enhancement to our existing manager development program designed to equip our people leaders with fundamental management skills to accelerate leadership success. This program is delivered over a twelve-month period through a mix of in-person, virtual, and on-demand learning. For our individual contributor employee population, we offer a variety of general and targeted development opportunities, including technical skills training, career learning journeys, and networking opportunities. We also provide extra support for Employee Resource Group leaders via a 1:1 coaching program.We have robust annual global performance and compensation planning processes for reviewing all employees’ performance and pay. As part of this process, Intuitive supports career development and growth through our Talent Action Planning program, which encourages employees to work on targeted talent development actions to enhance on-the-job performance and prepare for future career opportunities with the support of their leaders. To support our people leaders in managing the performance of their teams, we train them on conducting effective career conversations and performance reviews and making fair and equitable compensation recommendations. Compensation guidelines are provided to leaders, which take into consideration market pay data and performance, as well as job experience. In 2022, we added a new focus on clarity and consistency in our internal promotion processes.Community ProgramsWe believe that building connections between our employees, their families, and our communities creates a more meaningful, fulfilling, and enjoyable workplace. Through our engagement programs, our employees can pursue their interests and hobbies, connect to volunteering and giving opportunities, and enjoy unique recreational experiences with family members.The Intuitive Foundation is a nonprofit organization established in 2018 and funded by Intuitive.
