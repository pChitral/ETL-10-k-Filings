6281,ADI,ANALOG DEVICES INC,2012,"ITEM 7.MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (all tabular amounts in thousands except per share amounts)During the first quarter of fiscal 2008, we sold our baseband chipset business and related support operations, or Baseband Chipset Business, to MediaTek Inc. and sold our CPU voltage regulation and PC thermal monitoring business to certain subsidiaries of ON Semiconductor Corporation. The financial results of these businesses are presented as discontinued operations in the consolidated statements of income for all periods presented. Unless otherwise noted, this Management’s Discussion and Analysis relates only to financial results from continuing operations.Results of OperationsOverview Fiscal Year 2012 over 2011 2011 over 2010 2012 2011 2010 $ Change % Change $ Change % ChangeRevenue$2,701,142 $2,993,320 $2,761,503 $(292,178) (10)% $231,817 8%Gross Margin %64.5% 66.4% 65.2% Net income from Continuing Operations$651,236 $860,894 $711,225 $(209,658) (24)% $149,669 21%Net income from Continuing Operations as a % of Revenue24.1% 28.8% 25.8% Diluted EPS from Continuing Operations$2.13 $2.79 $2.33 $(0.66) (24)% $0.46 20%Diluted EPS$2.13 $2.81 $2.33 $(0.68) (24)% $0.48 21%Fiscal 2012 was a 53-week year. Fiscal 2011 and fiscal 2010 were 52-week years. The additional week in fiscal 2012 was included in the first quarter ended February 4, 2012.The year-to-year revenue changes by end market and product category are more fully outlined below under Revenue Trends by End Market and Revenue Trends by Product Type.During fiscal 2012, our revenue decreased 10% compared to fiscal 2011. Our diluted earnings per share from continuing operations decreased to $2.13 in fiscal 2012 from $2.79 in fiscal 2011. Cash flow from operations in fiscal 2012 was $814.5 million, or 30.2% of revenue. During fiscal 2012, we received $191.2 million in net proceeds from employee stock option exercises, repurchased a total of approximately 4.2 million shares of our common stock for an aggregate of $160.5 million, distributed $344.7 million to our shareholders in dividend payments, paid $56.5 million in principal payments related to our $145.0 million term loan facility, paid $132.2 million for property, plant and equipment additions and paid $24.2 million, net of cash acquired, for the acquisition of Multigig. In addition, we paid $1,183.5 million for the net purchase of short term available-for-sale investments. These factors contributed to the net decrease in cash and cash equivalents of $876.3 million in fiscal 2012.The year-to-year decrease in revenue and profitability for fiscal 2012 was primarily the result of continued slowdown in the growth of the global economy. Our customers were increasingly cautious through the year and reduced the inventory levels of our products. We believe that our variable cost structure and continued efforts to manage production, inventory levels and expenses helped to mitigate the effect that these lower sales levels had on our earnings.26Revenue Trends by End MarketThe following table summarizes revenue by end market. The categorization of revenue by end market is determined using a variety of data points including the technical characteristics of the product, the “sold to” customer information, the “ship to” customer information and the end customer product or application into which our product will be incorporated. As data systems for capturing and tracking this data evolve and improve, the categorization of products by end market can vary over time. When this occurs, we reclassify revenue by end market for prior periods. Such reclassifications typically do not materially change the sizing of, or the underlying trends of results within, each end market. 2012 2011 2010 Revenue % ofTotalProductRevenue Y/Y% Revenue % ofTotalProductRevenue Revenue % ofTotalProductRevenueIndustrial$1,240,344 46% (12)% $1,411,386 47% $1,280,027 46%Automotive463,577 17% 11 % 417,929 14% 335,163 12%Consumer467,626 17% (16)% 559,142 19% 605,541 22%Communications529,595 20% (12)% 604,863 20% 540,772 20%Total Revenue$2,701,142 100% (10)% $2,993,320 100% $2,761,503 100%Industrial — The year-to-year decrease in revenue from fiscal 2011 to fiscal 2012 in industrial end market revenue was primarily the result of a broad-based decrease in demand in this end market related to ongoing global macro-economic weakness. The year-to-year decrease was most significant for products sold into the industrial automation and instrumentation sectors. The year-to-year increase in revenue from fiscal 2010 to fiscal 2011 in industrial end market revenue was primarily the result of a broad-based increase in demand in this end market, which was most significant for products sold into the automation and instrumentation sectors and, to a lesser extent, products sold into the energy and healthcare sectors. Automotive — The year-to-year increase in revenue from fiscal 2011 to fiscal 2012 in automotive end market revenue was primarily the result of an increase in the electronic content in automobiles used in infotainment applications and to a lesser extent in power train and safety applications and a general increase in demand by our customers. The year-to-year increase in revenue from fiscal 2010 to fiscal 2011 in automotive end market revenue was primarily the result of a general increase in the electronic content found in vehicles and, to a lesser extent, a general increase in demand by our customers. Consumer — The year-to-year decrease in revenue from fiscal 2011 to fiscal 2012 in consumer end market revenue was primarily the result of a broad-based decrease in demand for products sold in this end market. The year-to-year decrease in revenue from fiscal 2010 to fiscal 2011 in consumer end market revenue was primarily the result of a decrease in demand for products in the digital camera and home entertainment sector primarily as a result of the impact of the earthquake and tsunami that occurred in Japan in March 2011, partially offset by an increase in demand for products used in portable devices in this end market. Communications — The year-to-year fluctuations in communications end market revenue for the years presented are primarily the result of broad-based demand shifts in this end market, which were most significant for products sold into the wireless base station end market sector.27Revenue Trends by Product TypeThe following table summarizes revenue by product categories. The categorization of our products into broad categories is based on the characteristics of the individual products, the specification of the products and in some cases the specific uses that certain products have within applications. The categorization of products into categories is therefore subject to judgment in some cases and can vary over time. In instances where products move between product categories, we reclassify the amounts in the product categories for all prior periods. Such reclassifications typically do not materially change the sizing of, or the underlying trends of results within, each product category. 2012 2011 2010 Revenue % ofTotalProductRevenue* Y/Y% Revenue % ofTotalProductRevenue Revenue % ofTotalProductRevenueConverters$1,192,064 44% (11)% $1,343,487 45% $1,295,700 47%Amplifiers/Radio frequency697,687 26% (11)% 788,299 26% 701,557 25%Other analog397,376 15% (3)% 410,323 14% 334,663 12%Subtotal analog signal processing2,287,127 85% (10)% 2,542,109 85% 2,331,920 84%Power management & reference182,134 7% (16)% 217,615 7% 194,740 7%Total analog products$2,469,261 91% (11)% $2,759,724 92% $2,526,660 91%Digital signal processing231,881 9% (1)% 233,596 8% 234,843 9%Total Revenue$2,701,142 100% (10)% $2,993,320 100% $2,761,503 100%_____________________________________*The sum of the individual percentages do not equal the total due to rounding. The year-to-year fluctuations in total revenue for the years presented were the result of a broad-based demand shift across all product categories.Revenue Trends by Geographic RegionDuring fiscal year 2012 we changed our method for classifying revenue by geographic region to more accurately reflect the primary location of our customers' design activity for our products. Prior periods have been reclassified to align with this definition. In general, the prior classification method reflected the customers' manufacturing location or the distributors' stocking territory. No changes have been made to our revenue recognition policy. A breakdown of our fiscal 2012, 2011 and 2010 revenue by geographic location follows.

The year-to-year decrease in sales in Japan and Rest of Asia was primarily the result of lower sales activity in the consumer end market sector in this region due to the earthquake and tsunami that occurred in Japan in March 2011.Gross Margin Change Fiscal Year 2012 over 2011 2011 over 2010 2012 2011 2010 $ Change % Change $ Change % ChangeGross Margin$1,741,001 $1,986,541 $1,799,422 $(245,540) (12)% $187,119 10%Gross Margin %64.5% 66.4% 65.2% Gross margin percentage in fiscal 2012 decreased 190 basis points compared to fiscal 2011 primarily as a result of decreased operating levels in our manufacturing facilities as well as a reduced percentage of sales of our products sold into the industrial automation and instrumentation sectors of the industrial end market and the wireless base station sector of the communications end market, which earn higher margins as compared to products sold into our other end market sectors.Gross margin percentage in fiscal 2011 increased 120 basis points compared to fiscal 2010 primarily as a result of an increase in sales of $231.8 million, increased operating levels in our manufacturing facilities and the impact of efforts to reduce overall manufacturing costs, including the savings realized as a result of our wafer fabrication consolidation actions. Additionally, a higher proportion of our revenues were from products sold into the instrumentation and automation sectors of the industrial end market, which earn higher margins as compared to products sold into our other end markets.Research and Development (R&D) Change Fiscal Year 2012 over 2011 2011 over 2010 2012 2011 2010 $ Change % Change $ Change % ChangeR&D Expenses$512,003 $505,570 $492,305 $6,433 1% $13,265 3%R&D Expenses as a % of Revenue19.0% 16.9% 17.8% R&D expenses increased in fiscal 2012 as compared to fiscal 2011 as a result of annual salary increases that became effective during the second quarter of fiscal 2012 and a general increase in spending, partially offset by lower variable compensation expense, which is linked to our overall profitability and revenue growth.R&D expenses increased in fiscal 2011 as compared to fiscal 2010. The increase was primarily the result of higher employee salary and benefit expense due to salary increases that were effective in the second quarter of fiscal 2011, increased headcount, and a general increase in spending. These increases were partially offset by lower variable compensation expense, which is a variable expense linked to our overall profitability and revenue growth.R&D expenses as a percentage of revenue will fluctuate from year-to-year depending on the amount of revenue and the success of new product development efforts, which we view as critical to our future growth. We have hundreds of R&D projects underway, none of which we believe are material on an individual basis. We expect to continue the development of innovative technologies and processes for new products. We believe that a continued commitment to R&D is essential to maintain product leadership with our existing products as well as to provide innovative new product offerings, and therefore, we expect to continue to make significant R&D investments in the future.29Selling, Marketing, General and Administrative (SMG&A) Change Fiscal Year 2012 over 2011 2011 over 2010 2012 2011 2010 $ Change % Change $ Change % ChangeSMG&A Expenses$396,519 $406,707 $390,560 $(10,188) (3)% $16,147 4%SMG&A Expenses as a % of Revenue14.7% 13.6% 14.1% SMG&A expenses decreased in fiscal 2012 as compared to fiscal 2011 as lower variable compensation expense, which is a variable expense linked to our overall profitability and revenue growth, was partially offset by annual salary increases that became effective during the second quarter of fiscal 2012.SMG&A, expenses increased in fiscal 2011 as compared to fiscal 2010. The increase was primarily the result of higher employee salary and benefit expense due to salary increases that were effective in the second quarter of fiscal 2011, increased headcount and a general increase in spending. These increases were partially offset by lower variable compensation expense, which is a variable expense linked to our overall profitability and revenue growth.Special ChargesWe monitor global macroeconomic conditions on an ongoing basis, and continue to assess opportunities for improved operational effectiveness and efficiency and better alignment of expenses with revenues. As a result of these assessments, we have undertaken various restructuring actions over the past several years. The expense reductions relating to ongoing actions are described below.Closure of Wafer Fabrication Facility in SunnyvaleWe ceased production at our California wafer fabrication facility in November 2006. We paid the related lease obligation costs on a monthly basis over the remaining lease term, which expired in March 2010. We recorded a one-time settlement charge of $0.4 million in fiscal 2010 related to the termination of the lease. This action was completed during fiscal 2010.Reduction of Operating CostsDuring fiscal 2008 through fiscal 2010, we recorded special charges of approximately $43.3 million. These special charges included: $39.1 million for severance and fringe benefit costs in accordance with our ongoing benefit plan or statutory requirements at foreign locations for 245 manufacturing employees and 470 engineering and SMG&A employees; $2.1 million for lease obligation costs for facilities that we ceased using during the first quarter of fiscal 2009; $0.8 million for the write-off of property, plant and equipment; $0.5 million for contract termination costs and $0.3 million for clean-up and closure costs that were expensed as incurred; and $0.5 million related to the impairment of intellectual property. This action resulted in annual cost savings of approximately $52.0 million per year. We have terminated the employment of all employees associated with these actions. During fiscal 2011, we recorded a special charge of approximately $2.2 million for severance and fringe benefit costs in accordance with our ongoing benefit plan or statutory requirements at foreign locations for 25 engineering and SMG&A employees. This action was completed in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2012. This action resulted in annual cost savings of approximately $4.0 million.During fiscal 2012, we recorded special charges of approximately $8.4 million. The special charge included $7.9 million for severance and fringe benefit costs in accordance with our ongoing benefit plan or statutory requirements at foreign locations for 95 manufacturing, engineering and SMG&A employees; $0.1 million for contract termination costs; $0.2 million for lease obligation costs for facilities that we ceased using during the third quarter of fiscal 2012 and $0.2 million for the write-off of property, plant and equipment. As of November 3, 2012, we employed 6 of the 95 employees included in this cost reduction action. These employees must continue to be employed by us until their employment is involuntarily terminated in order to receive the severance benefit. We estimate this action will result in annual savings in SMG&A expenses of approximately $12.0 million once fully implemented.30Closure of a Wafer Fabrication Facility in CambridgeDuring fiscal 2009 and fiscal 2010, we recorded special charges of $26.8 million as a result of our decision to consolidate our Cambridge, Massachusetts wafer fabrication facility into our existing Wilmington, Massachusetts facility. These special charges included: $7.4 million for severance and fringe benefit costs recorded in accordance with our ongoing benefit plan for 124 manufacturing employees and 9 SMG&A employees; $14.6 million for the impairment of manufacturing assets; $3.4 million for lease obligation costs for the Cambridge wafer fabrication facility, which we ceased using in the first quarter of fiscal 2010; and $1.4 million for clean-up and closure costs that were expensed as incurred. This action was completed during the third quarter of fiscal 2011. This action resulted in annual cost savings of approximately $43 million per year.Operating Income from Continuing Operations Change Fiscal Year 2012 over 2011 2011 over 2010 2012 2011 2010 $ Change % Change $ Change % ChangeOperating income from Continuing Operations$824,048 $1,072,025 $900,074 $(247,977) (23)% $171,951 19%Operating income from Continuing Operations as a % of Revenue30.5% 35.8% 32.6% The year-over-year decrease in operating income from continuing operations in fiscal 2012 as compared to fiscal 2011 was primarily the result of a decrease in revenue of $292.2 million and a 190 basis point decrease in gross margin percentage.The increase in operating income from continuing operations in fiscal 2011 as compared to fiscal 2010 was primarily the result of an increase in revenue of $231.8 million and a 120 basis point increase in gross margin percentage.Nonoperating (Income) Expense Change Fiscal Year 2012 over 2011 2011 over 2010 2012 2011 2010 $ Change $ ChangeInterest expense$26,422 $19,146 $10,429 $7,276 $8,717Interest income(14,448) (9,060) (9,837) (5,388) 777Other, net(1,459) 492 (2,183) (1,951) 2,675Total nonoperating expense (income)$10,515 $10,578 $(1,591) $(63) $12,169The year-over-year increase in nonoperating interest expense in fiscal 2012 as compared to fiscal 2011 was primarily a result of our issuance of $375.0 million aggregate principal amount of 3.0% senior unsecured notes on April 4, 2011 which was partially offset by the impact of the termination of our interest rate swap agreement more fully described below under the heading Debt. The increases were partially offset by an increase in nonoperating interest income due to higher interest rates earned on our investments and the investment of higher cash balances in fiscal 2012 as compared to fiscal 2011, and an increase in nonoperating other income as a result of the gain from the sale of other investments in the second quarter of fiscal 2012.The year-over-year increase in nonoperating expense (income) in fiscal 2011 as compared to fiscal 2010 was primarily due to an increase in interest expense incurred as a result of the issuance of $375 million aggregate principal amount of 3.0% senior unsecured notes on April 4, 2011, and the $145 million term loan facility entered into by a wholly owned subsidiary of ours in December 2010. In addition, we earned lower interest income as a result of lower interest rates in fiscal 2011 as compared to fiscal 2010, which was partially offset by interest earned on higher cash balances in fiscal 2011.31Provision for Income Taxes Change Fiscal Year 2012 over 2011 2011 over 2010 2012 2011 2010 $ Change % Change $ Change % ChangeProvision for Income Taxes$162,297 $200,553 $190,440 $(38,256) (19)% $10,113 5%Effective Income Tax Rate19.9% 18.9% 21.1% Our effective tax rate reflects the applicable tax rate in effect in the various tax jurisdictions around the world where our income is earned.Our effective tax rate for fiscal 2012 increased 100 basis points compared to our effective tax rate for fiscal 2011 due to the expiration of the U.S. federal research and development tax credit in December 2011. Our effective tax rate for fiscal 2011 decreased 220 basis points compared to our effective tax rate for fiscal 2010 due to the impact of several discrete tax items. The effective tax rate for fiscal 2011 included the reinstatement of the federal R&D tax credit in December 2010 retroactive to January 1, 2010, resulting in a $6.0 million income tax savings; a $6.7 million reduction in the state tax credit valuation reserve; a $0.5 million tax benefit from the increase in Irish deferred taxes as a result of the increase in the Irish manufacturing tax rate from 10% to 12.5%; and a net $10.8 million tax benefit related to the settlement with the Appeals Office of the Internal Revenue Service of certain tax matters for the fiscal 2004 through fiscal 2007 tax years.

Accordingly, the results of the operations of these businesses have been presented as discontinued operations within the consolidated financial statements.32AcquisitionsIn fiscal 2012, we acquired privately-held Multigig, Inc. (Multigig) of San Jose, California. The acquisition of Multigig is expected to enhance our clocking capabilities in stand-alone and embedded applications and strengthen our high speed signal processing solutions. The acquisition-date fair value of the consideration transferred totaled $26.8 million, which consisted of $24.2 million in initial cash payments at closing and an additional $2.6 million subject to an indemnification holdback that is payable within 15 months of the transaction date, which is included in accrued liabilities in the consolidated balance sheet as of November 3, 2012. Our assessment of fair value of the tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed was based on their estimated fair values at the date of acquisition, resulting in the recognition of $15.6 million of in-process research and development (IPR&D), $1.1 million of developed technology, $7.0 million of goodwill and $3.1 million of net deferred tax assets. During the third quarter of fiscal 2012, we reduced the indemnification holdback amount by $0.1 million as a result of indemnification claims. During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2012, we finalized our purchase accounting for Multigig which resulted in adjustments of $0.4 million to deferred taxes and goodwill. In addition, we will be obligated to pay royalties to the Multigig employees on revenue recognized from the sale of certain Multigig products through the earlier of 5 years or the aggregate maximum payment of $1.0 million. Royalty payments to Multigig employees require post-acquisition services to be rendered and, as such, we will record these amounts as compensation expense in the related periods. As of November 3, 2012, no royalty payments have been made. We recognized $0.5 million of acquisition-related costs that were expensed in the second quarter of fiscal 2012, which were included in operating expenses in the consolidated statement of income.In fiscal 2011, we acquired privately-held Lyric Semiconductor, Inc. (Lyric) of Cambridge, Massachusetts. The acquisition of Lyric gives us the potential to achieve an order of magnitude improvement in power efficiency in mixed signal processing. The acquisition-date fair value of the consideration transferred totaled $27.8 million, which consisted of $14.0 million in initial cash payments at closing and contingent consideration of up to $13.8 million. The contingent consideration arrangement requires additional cash payments to the former equity holders of Lyric upon the achievement of certain technological and product development milestones payable during the period from June 2011 through June 2016. As of November 3, 2012, we paid $2.0 million in contingent consideration. The payment is reflected in the statements of cash flows as cash used in financing activities related to the liability recognized at fair value as of the acquisition date and cash provided by operating activities related to the fair value adjustments previously recognized in earnings. The fair value of the remaining contingent consideration was approximately $12.2 million of IPR&D as of November 3, 2012, of which $6.8 million is included in accrued liabilities and $5.4 million is included in other non-current liabilities in the consolidated balance sheet. We allocated the purchase price to the tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their estimated fair values at the date of acquisition, resulting in the recognition of $12.2 million of in-process research and development, $18.9 million of goodwill and $3.3 million of net deferred tax liabilities. In addition, we will be obligated to pay royalties to the former equity holders of Lyric on revenue recognized from the sale of Lyric products and licenses through the earlier of 20 years or the accrual of a maximum of $25.0 million. Royalty payments to Lyric employees require post-acquisition services to be rendered and, as such, we will record these amounts as compensation expense in the related periods. As of November 3, 2012, no royalty payments have been made. We recognized $0.2 million of acquisition related costs that we expensed in the third quarter of fiscal 2011. These costs are included in operating expenses in the consolidated statement of income.We have not provided pro forma results of operations for Multigig and Lyric in this report as they were not material to us on either an individual or an aggregate basis. We included the results of operations of each acquisition in our consolidated statement of income from the date of such acquisition.Liquidity and Capital ResourcesAt November 3, 2012, our principal source of liquidity was $3,900.4 million of cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments, of which approximately $1,105.8 million was held in the United States. The balance of our cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments was held outside the United States in various foreign subsidiaries. As we intend toreinvest our foreign earnings indefinitely, this cash held outside the United States is not available to meet certain aspects of our cash requirements in the United States, including cash dividends and common stock repurchases. Our cash and cash equivalents consist of highly liquid investments with maturities of three months or less at the time of acquisition, including money market funds, and our short-term investments consist primarily of corporate obligations, such as commercial paper and floating rate notes, bonds and bank time deposits. We maintain these balances with high credit quality counterparties, continually monitor the amount of credit exposure to any one issuer and diversify our investments in order to minimize our credit risk.We believe that our existing sources of liquidity and cash expected to be generated from future operations, together with existing and anticipated available long-term financing, will be sufficient to fund operations, capital expenditures, research and development efforts, dividend payments (if any) and repurchases of our stock (if any) under our stock repurchase program in the immediate future and for at least the next twelve months.33 Change Fiscal Year 2012 over 2011 2011 over 2010 2012 2011 2010 $ Change % Change $ Change % ChangeNet Cash Provided by Operations$814,542 $900,529 $991,175 $(85,987) (10)% $(90,646) (9)%Net Cash Provided by Operations as a % of Revenue30.2% 30.1% 35.9% At November 3, 2012, cash and cash equivalents totaled $528.8 million.

In addition, we received $191.2 million in net proceeds from employee stock option exercises. The principal uses of funds for fiscal 2012 were the repurchase of approximately 4.2 million shares of our common stock for an aggregate of $160.5 million, dividend payments of $344.7 million, principal payments of $56.5 million related to our $145 million term loan facility, additions to property, plant and equipment of $132.2 million and payments of $24.2 million, net of cash acquired, for the acquisition of Multigig. In addition, we paid $1,183.5 million for the net purchase of short term available-for-sale investments. These factors contributed to the net decrease in cash and cash equivalents of $876.3 million in fiscal 2012.Working Capital Fiscal Year 2012 2011 $ Change% ChangeAccounts Receivable$339,881 $348,416 $(8,535)(2)%Days Sales Outstanding*45 44 Inventory$313,723 $295,081 $18,6426 %Days Cost of Sales in Inventory*114 105 _______________________________________*We use the annualized fourth quarter revenue in our calculation of days sales outstanding and we use the annualized fourth quarter cost of sales in our calculation of days cost of sales in inventory.The decrease in accounts receivable was primarily the result of lower revenue in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2012 compared to the fourth quarter of fiscal 2011. Days sales outstanding increased as a result of higher product shipments made to our distributors in the final month of the fourth quarter of fiscal 2012 compared to the final month of the fourth quarter of fiscal 2011.Inventory as of November 3, 2012 increased as compared to the end of the fourth quarter of fiscal 2011 as a result of an increase in manufacturing production to support anticipated higher sales demand. Days cost of sales in inventory increased primarily due to lower manufacturing costs which resulted in cost of sales decreasing 2% from the fourth quarter of fiscal 2011 to the fourth quarter of fiscal 2012. In addition, inventory levels increased by 6% for the same period.Current liabilities of $525.1 million at November 3, 2012, remained flat to the $525.0 million recorded at the end of fiscal 2011, as an increase in deferred income on shipments to distributors, net, which is more fully described below and an increase in accounts payable was offset by a decrease in accrued liabilities as a result of lower variable compensation expense accruals. As of November 3, 2012 and October 29, 2011, we had gross deferred revenue of $299.0 million and $309.6 million, respectively, and gross deferred cost of sales of $60.5 million and $76.4 million, respectively. Deferred income on shipments to distributors increased in fiscal 2012 primarily as a result of a mix shift in favor of higher margin products in the channel. Sales to distributors are made under agreements that allow distributors to receive price-adjustment credits and to return qualifying products for credit, as determined by us, in order to reduce the amounts of slow-moving, discontinued or obsolete product from their inventory. Given the uncertainties associated with the levels of price-adjustment credits to be granted to distributors, the sales price to the distributors is not fixed or determinable until the distributors resell the products to their customers. Therefore, we defer revenue recognition from sales to distributors until the distributors have sold the products to their customers. The amount of price-adjustments is dependent on future overall market conditions, and therefore the levels of these adjustments could fluctuate significantly from period to period. To the extent that we experience a significant increase in the amount of credits we issue to our distributors, there could be a material impact on the ultimate revenue and gross margin recognized relating to these transactions.34 DebtAs of November 3, 2012, we had $821.6 million in debt outstanding, of which $14.5 million was current. Our debt obligations consist of the following:$375.0 million aggregate principal amount of 5.0% senior unsecured notesOn June 30, 2009, we issued $375.0 million aggregate principal amount of 5.0% senior unsecured notes due July 1, 2014 (the 5.0% Notes) with semi-annual fixed interest payments due on January 1 and July 1 of each year, commencing January 1, 2010. We swapped the fixed interest portion of these notes for a variable interest rate based on the three-month LIBOR plus 2.05%. The variable interest payments based on the variable annual rate were payable quarterly. The LIBOR based rate was set quarterly three months prior to the date of the interest payment. In the second quarter of fiscal 2012, we terminated the interest rate swap agreement. We received $19.8 million in cash proceeds from the swap termination, which included $1.3 million in accrued interest. The proceeds, net of interest received, are disclosed in cash flows from financing activities in the consolidated statements of cash flows. As a result of the termination, the carrying value of the 5.0% Notes was adjusted for the change in fair value of the interest component of the debt up to the date of the termination of the swap in an amount equal to the fair value of the swap, and will be amortized to earnings as a reduction of interest expense over the remaining life of the debt. This amortization is reflected in the consolidated statements of cash flows within operating activities.$145.0 million term loan facilityOn December 22, 2010, Analog Devices Holdings B.V., our wholly owned subsidiary, entered into a credit agreement with Bank of America, N.A., London Branch as administrative agent. The credit agreement provides for a $145.0 million term loan facility, which matures on December 22, 2013. We have guaranteed the borrower’s obligations. The terms of the agreement provide for a three-year principal amortization schedule with $3.6 million payable quarterly every March, June, September and December with the balance payable upon the maturity date.$375.0 million aggregate principal amount of 3.0% senior unsecured notesOn April 4, 2011, we issued $375.0 million aggregate principal amount of 3.0% senior unsecured notes due April 15, 2016 (the 3.0% Notes) with semi-annual fixed interest payments due on April 15 and October 15 of each year, commencing October 15, 2011.The indenture governing the 5.0% Notes and 3.0% Notes contains covenants that may limit our ability to: incur, create, assume or guarantee any debt for borrowed money secured by a lien upon a principal property; enter into sale and lease-back transactions with respect to a principal property; and consolidate with or merge into, or transfer or lease all or substantially all of our assets to, any other party. As of November 3, 2012, we were compliant with these covenants. The terms of the $145.0 million term loan facility include limitations on subsidiary indebtedness and on liens against our assets and the assets of our subsidiaries, and also include financial covenants that require us to maintain a minimum interest coverage ratio and not exceed a maximum leverage ratio. As of November 3, 2012, we were compliant with these covenants. See Note 16, Debt, of the Notes to our Consolidated Financial Statements contained in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further information on our outstanding debt.Revolving Credit FacilityWe have a five-year $165.0 million unsecured revolving credit facility that expires in May 2013. To date, we have not borrowed under this credit facility but we may borrow in the future and use the proceeds for support of commercial paper issuance, stock repurchases, dividend payments, acquisitions, capital expenditures, working capital and other lawful corporate purposes. The terms of this facility also include financial covenants that require us to maintain a minimum interest coverage ratio and not exceed a maximum leverage ratio. As of November 3, 2012, we were compliant with these covenants. Stock Repurchase ProgramOur common stock repurchase program has been in place since August 2004. In the aggregate, our Board of Directors has authorized us to repurchase $5.0 billion of our common stock under the program. Under the program, we may repurchase outstanding shares of our common stock from time to time in the open market and through privately negotiated transactions. Unless terminated earlier by resolution of our Board of Directors, the repurchase program will expire when we have repurchased all shares authorized under the program. As of November 3, 2012, we had repurchased a total of approximately 129.2 million shares of our common stock for approximately $4,439.0 million under this program. As of November 3, 2012, an additional $561.0 million worth of shares remains available for repurchase under the current authorized program. The repurchased shares are held as authorized but unissued shares of common stock. We also from time to time repurchase shares in settlement of employee tax withholding obligations due upon the vesting of restricted stock units or the exercise of stock options, or in certain limited circumstances to satisfy the exercise price of options granted to our employees under our equity compensation plans. Any future common stock repurchases will be based on several factors, including our financial 35performance, outlook, liquidity and the amount of cash we have available in the United States. Capital ExpendituresNet additions to property, plant and equipment were $132.2 million in fiscal 2012 and were funded with a combination of cash on hand and cash generated from operations. We expect capital expenditures to be in the range of approximately $90 million to $120 million in fiscal 2013 to be used primarily in our manufacturing facilities and to be funded with a combination of cash on hand and cash generated from operations. DividendsOn November 26, 2012, our Board of Directors declared a cash dividend of $0.30 per outstanding share of common stock. The dividend will be paid on December 18, 2012 to all shareholders of record at the close of business on December 7, 2012 and is expected to total approximately $90.4 million. We currently expect quarterly dividends to continue at $0.30 per share, although they remain subject to determination and declaration by our Board of Directors. The payment of future dividends, if any, will be based on several factors, including our financial performance, outlook and liquidity. Contractual ObligationsThe table below summarizes our contractual obligations and the amounts we owe under these contracts in specified periods as of November 3, 2012: Payment due by period Less than More than(thousands) Total 1 Year 1-3 Years 3-5 Years 5 YearsContractual obligations: Operating leases (a) $89,028 $29,559 $36,299 $10,733 $12,437Debt obligations 810,108 14,500 420,608 375,000 —Interest payments associated with long-term debt obligations (b) 77,763 30,775 41,363 5,625 —Deferred compensation plan (c) 28,480 54 — — 28,426Pension funding (d) 2,488 2,488 — — —Total $1,007,867 $77,376 $498,270 $391,358 $40,863_______________________________________(a)Certain of our operating lease obligations include escalation clauses. These escalating payment requirements are reflected in the table.(b)The interest payments related to our term loan facility are based on LIBOR plus a spread of 1.25% (1.46% as of November 3, 2012). The actual payments will be based on the LIBOR rate corresponding to the tenor of the interest period chosen, plus a spread of 1.25% which is set two business days prior to the start of the new interest period.(c)These payments relate to obligations under our deferred compensation plan. The deferred compensation plan allows certain members of management and other highly-compensated employees and non-employee directors to defer receipt of all or any portion of their compensation. The amount in the “More than 5 Years” column of the table represents the remaining total balance under the deferred compensation plan to be paid to participants who have not terminated employment. Since we cannot reasonably estimate the timing of withdrawals for participants who have not yet terminated employment, we have included the future obligation to these participants in the “More than 5 Years” column of the table.(d)Our funding policy for our foreign defined benefit plans is consistent with the local requirements of each country. The payment obligations in the table are estimates of our expected contributions to these plans for fiscal year 2013. The actual future payments may differ from the amounts presented in the table and reasonable estimates of payments beyond one year are not practical because of potential future changes in variables, such as plan asset performance, interest rates and the rate of increase in compensation levels.Purchase orders for the purchase of raw materials and other goods and services are not included in the table above. We are not able to determine the total amount of these purchase orders that represent contractual obligations, as purchase orders may represent authorizations to purchase rather than binding agreements. In addition, our purchase orders generally allow for cancellation without significant penalties. We do not have significant agreements for the purchase of raw materials or other goods specifying minimum quantities or set prices that exceed our expected short-term requirements.36Our 2011 acquisition of Lyric Semiconductor involves the potential payment of contingent consideration. The table above does not reflect any such obligations, as the timing and amounts are uncertain. See Note 6 in the Notes to our Consolidated Financial Statements contained in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for more information regarding our acquisitions.As of November 3, 2012, our total liabilities associated with uncertain tax positions was $10.1 million, which are included in “Other non-current liabilities” in our consolidated balance sheet contained in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Due to the complexity associated with our tax uncertainties, we cannot make a reasonably reliable estimate of the period in which we expect to settle the non-current liabilities associated with these uncertain tax positions. Therefore, we have not included these uncertain tax positions in the above contractual obligations table.The expected timing of payments and the amounts of the obligations discussed above are estimated based on current information available as of November 3, 2012.Off-balance Sheet FinancingAs of November 3, 2012, we had no off-balance sheet financing arrangements.OutlookThe following statements are based on current expectations. These statements are forward-looking, and actual results may differ materially. Unless specifically mentioned, these statements do not give effect to the potential impact of any mergers, acquisitions, divestitures, or business combinations that may be announced or closed after the date of filing this report. These statements supersede all prior statements regarding our business outlook made by us.We are planning for revenue in the first quarter of fiscal 2013 to be down approximately 6% to 12% from the fourth quarter of fiscal 2012. Our plan is for gross margin percentage for the first quarter of fiscal 2013 to be approximately 62.0%. We are planning for operating expenses in the first quarter of fiscal 2013 to be approximately $223 million and our tax rate to be approximately 18%. As a result, our plan is for Diluted EPS to be approximately $0.40 to $0.48 in the first quarter of fiscal 2013.New Accounting PronouncementsFrom time to time, new accounting pronouncements are issued by the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) that are adopted by us as of the specified effective date. Unless otherwise discussed, management believes that the impact of recently issued standards will not have a material impact on our future financial condition and results of operations. See Note 2t, New Accounting Pronouncements, of the Notes to our Consolidated Financial Statements contained in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for a description of recently issued and adopted accounting pronouncements, including the dates of adoption and impact on our historical financial condition and results of operations.Critical Accounting Policies and EstimatesManagement’s discussion and analysis of the financial condition and results of operations is based upon the consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue and expenses, and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. We base our estimates and judgments on historical experience, knowledge of current conditions and beliefs of what could occur in the future based on available information. We consider the following accounting policies to be both those most important to the portrayal of our financial condition and those that require the most subjective judgment. If actual results differ significantly from management’s estimates and projections, there could be a material effect on our financial statements. We also have other policies that we consider key accounting policies, such as our policy for revenue recognition, including the deferral of revenue on sales to distributors until the products are sold to the end user; however, the application of these policies does not require us to make significant estimates or judgments that are difficult or subjective.37Inventory ValuationWe value inventories at the lower of cost (first-in, first-out method) or market. Because of the cyclical nature of the semiconductor industry, changes in inventory levels, obsolescence of technology, and product life cycles, we write down inventories to net realizable value. We employ a variety of methodologies to determine the net realizable value of inventory. While a portion of the calculation is determined via reference to the age of inventory and lower of cost or market calculations, an element of the calculation is subject to significant judgments made by us about future demand for our inventory. If actual demand for our products is less than our estimates, additional adjustments to existing inventories may need to be recorded in future periods. To date, our actual results have not been materially different than our estimates, and we do not expect them to be materially different in the future.Allowance for Doubtful AccountsWe maintain allowances for doubtful accounts, when appropriate, for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments. If the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate, our actual losses may exceed our estimates, and additional allowances would be required. To date, our actual results have not been materially different than our estimates, and we do not expect them to be materially different in the future.Long-Lived AssetsWe review property, plant, and equipment and finite lived intangible assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of assets may not be recoverable. Recoverability of these assets is measured by comparison of their carrying value to future undiscounted cash flows that the assets are expected to generate over their remaining economic lives. If such assets are considered to be impaired, the impairment to be recognized in earnings equals the amount by which the carrying value of the assets exceeds their fair value determined by either a quoted market price, if any, or a value determined by utilizing a discounted cash flow technique. Although we have recognized no material impairment adjustments related to our property, plant, and equipment and identified intangible assets during the past three fiscal years, except those made in conjunction with restructuring actions, deterioration in our business in the future could lead to such impairment adjustments in future periods. Evaluation of impairment of long-lived assets requires estimates of future operating results that are used in the preparation of the expected future undiscounted cash flows. Actual future operating results and the remaining economic lives of our long-lived assets could differ from the estimates used in assessing the recoverability of these assets. These differences could result in impairment charges, which could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations. In addition, in certain instances, assets may not be impaired but their estimated useful lives may have decreased. In these situations, we amortize the remaining net book values over the revised useful lives. We review indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment annually, on the first day of the fourth quarter (on or about August 1) or more frequently if indicators of impairment exist. The impairment test involves the comparison of the fair value of the intangible asset with its carrying amount.GoodwillGoodwill is subject to annual impairment tests or more frequently if indicators of potential impairment exist and suggest that the carrying value of goodwill may not be recoverable from estimated discounted future cash flows. We test goodwill for impairment at the reporting unit level (operating segment or one level below an operating segment) on an annual basis in the fourth quarter (on or about August 1) or more frequently if we believe indicators of impairment exist. For our latest annual impairment assessment that occurred on August 5, 2012, we identified our reporting units to be our five operating segments, which meet the aggregation criteria for one reportable segment. The performance of the test involves a two-step process. The first step of the impairment test involves comparing the fair values of the applicable reporting units with their aggregate carrying values, including goodwill. We generally determine the fair value of our reporting units using the income approach methodology of valuation that includes the discounted cash flow method as well as other generally accepted valuation methodologies, which requires significant judgment by management. If the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds the reporting unit’s fair value, we perform the second step of the goodwill impairment test to determine the amount of impairment loss. The second step of the goodwill impairment test involves comparing the implied fair value of the affected reporting unit’s goodwill with the carrying value of that goodwill. These impairment tests may result in impairment losses that could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations.38Value of Contingent Consideration related to Business CombinationWe record contingent consideration resulting from a business combination at its fair value on the acquisition date. We generally determine the fair value of the contingent consideration using the income approach methodology of valuation. Each reporting period thereafter, we revalue these obligations and record increases or decreases in their fair value as an adjustment to operating expenses within the consolidated statement of income. Changes in the fair value of the contingent consideration can result from changes in assumed discount periods and rates, and from changes pertaining to the achievement of the defined milestones. Significant judgment is employed in determining the appropriateness of these assumptions as of the acquisition date and for each subsequent period. Accordingly, future business and economic conditions, as well as changes in any of the assumptions described above, can materially impact the amount of contingent consideration expense we record in any given period.Accounting for Income TaxesWe must make certain estimates and judgments in determining income tax expense for financial statement purposes. These estimates and judgments occur in the calculation of tax credits, benefits, and deductions, and in the calculation of certain tax assets and liabilities, which arise from differences in the timing of the recognition of revenue and expense for tax and financial statement purposes, as well as the interest and penalties relating to these uncertain tax positions. We assessed the likelihood of the realization of deferred tax assets and concluded that a valuation allowance is needed to reserve the amount of the deferred tax assets that may not be realized due to the uncertainty of the timing and amount of the realization of certain state credit carryovers. In reaching our conclusion, we evaluated certain relevant criteria including the existence of deferred tax liabilities that can be used to absorb deferred tax assets, the taxable income in prior carryback years in the impacted state jurisdictions that can be used to absorb net operating losses and taxable income in future years. Our judgments regarding future profitability may change due to future market conditions, changes in U.S. or international tax laws and other factors. These changes, if any, may require material adjustments to these deferred tax assets, resulting in a reduction in net income or an increase in net loss in the period when such determinations are made, which in turn, may result in an increase or decrease to our tax provision in a subsequent period.We account for uncertain tax positions by determining if it is “more likely than not” that a tax position will be sustained by the appropriate taxing authorities prior to recording any benefit in the financial statements. An uncertain income tax position is not recognized if it has less than a 50% likelihood of being sustained. For those tax positions where it is more likely than not that a tax benefit will be sustained, we have recorded the largest amount of tax benefit with a greater than 50% likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement with a taxing authority that has full knowledge of all relevant information. For those income tax positions where it is not more likely than not that a tax benefit will be sustained, no tax benefit has been recognized in the financial statements. We reevaluate these uncertain tax positions on a quarterly basis. This evaluation is based on factors including, but not limited to, changes in known facts or circumstances, changes in tax law, effectively settled issues under audit, and new audit activity. A change in these factors would result in the recognition of a tax benefit or an additional charge to the tax provision.In the ordinary course of global business, there are many transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax outcome is uncertain. Some of these uncertainties arise as a consequence of cost reimbursement and royalty arrangements among related entities. Although we believe our estimates are reasonable, no assurance can be given that the final tax outcome of these matters will not be different than that which is reflected in our historical income tax provisions and accruals. In the event our assumptions are incorrect, the differences could have a material impact on our income tax provision and operating results in the period in which such determination is made. In addition to the factors described above, our current and expected effective tax rate is based on then-current tax law. Significant changes during the year in enacted tax law could affect these estimates.Stock-Based CompensationStock-based compensation expense associated with stock options and related awards is recognized in the statement of income. Determining the amount of stock-based compensation to be recorded requires us to develop estimates to be used in calculating the grant-date fair value of stock options. We calculate the grant-date fair values using the Black-Scholes valuation model. The use of valuation models requires us to make estimates of the following items:39Expected volatility — We are responsible for estimating volatility and have considered a number of factors, including third-party estimates, when estimating volatility. We currently believe that the exclusive use of implied volatility results in the best estimate of the grant-date fair value of employee stock options because it reflects the market’s current expectations of future volatility. In evaluating the appropriateness of exclusively relying on implied volatility, we concluded that: (1) options in our common stock are actively traded with sufficient volume on several exchanges; (2) the market prices of both the traded options and the underlying shares are measured at a similar point in time to each other and on a date close to the grant date of the employee share options; (3) the traded options have exercise prices that are both near-the-money and close to the exercise price of the employee share options; and (4) the remaining maturities of the traded options used to estimate volatility are at least one year.Expected term — We use historical employee exercise and option expiration data to estimate the expected term assumption for the Black-Scholes grant-date valuation. We believe that this historical data is currently the best estimate of the expected term of a new option, and that generally, all of our employees exhibit similar exercise behavior. In general, the longer the expected term used in the Black-Scholes valuation model, the higher the grant-date fair value of the option.Risk-free interest rate — The yield on zero-coupon U.S. Treasury securities for a period that is commensurate with the expected term assumption is used as the risk-free interest rate.Expected dividend yield — Expected dividend yield is calculated by annualizing the cash dividend declared by our Board of Directors for the current quarter and dividing that result by the closing stock price on the date of grant of the option. Until such time as our Board of Directors declares a cash dividend for an amount that is different from the current quarter’s cash dividend, the current dividend will be used in deriving this assumption. Cash dividends are not paid on options, restricted stock or restricted stock units.The amount of stock-based compensation expense recognized during a period is based on the value of the portion of the awards that are ultimately expected to vest. Forfeitures are estimated at the time of grant and revised, if necessary, in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates. The term “forfeitures” is distinct from “cancellations” or “expirations” and represents only the unvested portion of the surrendered option. Based on an analysis of our historical forfeitures, we have applied an annual forfeiture rate of 4.4% to all unvested stock-based awards as of November 3, 2012. The rate of 4.4% represents the portion that is expected to be forfeited each year over the vesting period. This analysis is re-evaluated quarterly and the forfeiture rate is adjusted as necessary. Ultimately, the actual expense recognized over the vesting period will only be for those awards that vest.ContingenciesFrom time to time, we receive demands from third parties alleging that our products or manufacturing processes infringe the patent or intellectual property rights of these parties. We periodically assess each matter to determine if a contingent liability should be recorded. In making this determination, we may, depending on the nature of the matter, consult with internal and external legal counsel and technical experts. Based on the information we obtain, combined with our judgment regarding all the facts and circumstances of each matter, we determine whether it is probable that a contingent loss may be incurred and whether the amount of such loss can be reasonably estimated. If a loss is probable and reasonably estimable, we record a contingent loss. In determining the amount of a contingent loss, we consider advice received from experts in the specific matter, current status of legal proceedings, settlement negotiations that may be ongoing, prior case history and other factors. If the judgments and estimates made by us are incorrect, we may need to record additional contingent losses that could materially adversely impact our results of operations.40Post-Retirement Benefits We have significant pension costs and liabilities related to our foreign defined benefit pension plans that are developed from actuarial valuations specific to each country. Inherent in these valuations are key assumptions including discount rates, expected return on plan assets, mortality rates, merit and promotion increases. We are required to consider current market conditions, including changes in interest rates, in making our assumptions. Changes in the related pension costs or liabilities may occur in the future due to changes in our assumptions. Our assumptions as to the expected long-term rates of return on plan assets are based upon the composition of plan assets, historical long-term rates of return on similar assets and current and expected market conditions. The discount rate used for non-U.S. plans reflects the market rate for high-quality fixed-income investments on our annual measurement date (November 3) and is subject to change each year. The discount rates used for plans outside the U.S. are based on a combination of relevant indices regarding corporate and government securities, the duration of the liability and appropriate judgment. Changes in pension income/costs or assets/liabilities may occur in the future due to changes in the assumptions and changes in asset values. If the actual results and events of our pension plan differ from our current assumptions, our benefit obligations may be over-or under-valued. See the disclosures about pension obligations, the composition of plan assets, assumptions and other matters in Note 13 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements contained in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. We performed a sensitivity analysis on the discount rate and long-term rate of return on assets, which are key assumptions in determining our net periodic post-retirement benefit cost. The table below illustrates the impact of an increase/(decrease) of 25 basis points in these assumptions for the year ended November 3, 2012. Increase/(Decrease) in Pension Expense 25 Basis Point Increase 25 Basis Point DecreaseLong-term rate of return on assets used to determine net periodic benefit cost$(0.5) $0.5Discount rate used to determine net periodic benefit cost$(1) $1ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISKInterest Rate ExposureOur interest income and expense are sensitive to changes in the general level of interest rates. In this regard, changes in interest rates affect the interest earned on our marketable securities and short term investments, as well as the fair value of our investments, debt and interest-rate swap agreement.Based on our marketable securities and short-term investments outstanding as of November 3, 2012 and October 29, 2011, our annual interest income would change by approximately $41 million and $38 million, respectively, for each 100 basis point increase in interest rates.To provide a meaningful assessment of the interest rate risk associated with our investment portfolio, we performed a sensitivity analysis to determine the impact a change in interest rates would have on the value of our investment portfolio assuming a 100 basis point parallel shift in the yield curve. Based on investment positions as of November 3, 2012 and October 29, 2011, a hypothetical 100 basis point increase in interest rates across all maturities would result in a $10 million decline in each year in the fair market value of the portfolio. Such losses would only be realized if we sold the investments prior to maturity.As of November 3, 2012, we had $750 million in principal amount of senior unsecured notes outstanding, which consisted of $375 million 5% senior unsecured notes, due July 1, 2014 and $375 million 3% senior unsecured notes, due April 15, 2016. As of November 3, 2012, a hypothetical 100 basis point increase in market interest rates would reduce the fair value of our $375 million of 3% senior unsecured notes outstanding by approximately $13 million. As of November 3, 2012 a similar increase in market interest rates would change the fair value of our $375 million 5% senior unsecured notes by $6 million. 41Foreign Currency ExposureAs more fully described in Note 2i in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements contained in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, we regularly hedge our non-U.S. dollar-based exposures by entering into forward foreign currency exchange contracts. The terms of these contracts are for periods matching the duration of the underlying exposure and generally range from one month to twelve months. Currently, our largest foreign currency exposure is the Euro, primarily because our European operations have the highest proportion of our local currency denominated expenses. Relative to foreign currency exposures existing at November 3, 2012 and October 29, 2011, a 10% unfavorable movement in foreign currency exchange rates over the course of the year would expose us to approximately $1 million in losses in earnings or cash flows.The market risk associated with our derivative instruments results from currency exchange rates that are expected to offset the market risk of the underlying transactions, assets and liabilities being hedged. The counterparties to the agreements relating to our foreign exchange instruments consist of a number of major international financial institutions with high credit ratings. Based on the credit ratings of our counterparties as of November 3, 2012, we do not believe that there is significant risk of nonperformance by them. While the contract or notional amounts of derivative financial instruments provide one measure of the volume of these transactions, they do not represent the amount of our exposure to credit risk. The amounts potentially subject to credit risk (arising from the possible inability of counterparties to meet the terms of their contracts) are generally limited to the amounts, if any, by which the counterparties’ obligations under the contracts exceed our obligations to the counterparties.The following table illustrates the effect that a 10% unfavorable or favorable movement in foreign currency exchange rates, relative to the U.S. dollar, would have on the fair value of our forward exchange contracts as of November 3, 2012 and October 29, 2011: November 3, 2012 October 29, 2011Fair value of forward exchange contracts asset$1,061 $2,472Fair value of forward exchange contracts liability$— $—Fair value of forward exchange contracts after a 10% unfavorable movement in foreign currency exchange rates asset$16,800 $17,859Fair value of forward exchange contracts after a 10% favorable movement in foreign currency exchange rates liability$(13,885) $(13,332)The calculation assumes that each exchange rate would change in the same direction relative to the U.S. dollar. In addition to the direct effects of changes in exchange rates, such changes typically affect the volume of sales or the foreign currency sales price as competitors’ products become more or less attractive. Our sensitivity analysis of the effects of changes in foreign currency exchange rates does not factor in a potential change in sales levels or local currency selling prices.42",2023-12-30 19:09:03.547826
6281,ADI,ANALOG DEVICES INC,2013,"ITEM 7.MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (all tabular amounts in thousands except per share amounts)During the first quarter of fiscal 2008, we sold our baseband chipset business and related support operations, which we refer to as the Baseband Chipset Business, to MediaTek Inc. The financial results of this business is presented as discontinued operations in the consolidated statements of income for all periods presented. Unless otherwise noted, this Management’s Discussion and Analysis relates only to financial results from continuing operations.Results of OperationsOverview Fiscal Year 2013 over 2012 2012 over 2011 2013 2012 2011 $ Change % Change $ Change % ChangeRevenue$2,633,689 $2,701,142 $2,993,320 $(67,453) (2)% $(292,178) (10)%Gross Margin %64.3% 64.5% 66.4% Net income from Continuing Operations$673,487 $651,236 $860,894 $22,251 3 % $(209,658) (24)%Net income from Continuing Operations as a % of Revenue25.6% 24.1% 28.8% Diluted EPS from Continuing Operations$2.14 $2.13 $2.79 $0.01 — % $(0.66) (24)%Diluted EPS$2.14 $2.13 $2.81 $0.01 — % $(0.68) (24)%Fiscal 2013 and fiscal 2011 were 52-week years. Fiscal 2012 was a 53-week year. The additional week in fiscal 2012 was included in the first quarter ended February 4, 2012.The year-to-year revenue changes by end market and product category are more fully outlined below under Revenue Trends by End Market and Revenue Trends by Product Type.During fiscal 2013, our revenue decreased 2% compared to fiscal 2012. Our diluted earnings per share from continuing operations increased to $2.14 in fiscal 2013 from $2.13 in fiscal 2012. Cash flow from operations in fiscal 2013 was $912.3 million, or 34.6% of revenue. The year-to-year decrease in revenue was primarily attributable to one less week of operations in fiscal 2013 as compared to fiscal 2012 and continued weakness in the global economic environment. We believe that our variable cost structure and continued efforts to manage production, inventory levels and expenses helped to mitigate the effect of the lower sales level on our earnings. 26Revenue Trends by End MarketThe following table summarizes revenue by end market. The categorization of revenue by end market is determined using a variety of data points including the technical characteristics of the product, the “sold to” customer information, the “ship to” customer information and the end customer product or application into which our product will be incorporated. As data systems for capturing and tracking this data evolve and improve, the categorization of products by end market can vary over time. When this occurs, we reclassify revenue by end market for prior periods. Such reclassifications typically do not materially change the sizing of, or the underlying trends of results within, each end market. 2013 2012 2011 Revenue % ofTotalProductRevenue* Y/Y% Revenue % ofTotalProductRevenue Revenue % ofTotalProductRevenueIndustrial$1,219,798 46% (2)% $1,246,380 46% $1,416,686 47%Automotive481,803 18% 4 % 463,927 17% 418,419 14%Consumer403,649 15% (13)% 464,103 17% 556,056 19%Communications528,439 20% — % 526,732 20% 602,159 20%Total Revenue$2,633,689 100% (2)% $2,701,142 100% $2,993,320 100%*The sum of the individual percentages do not equal the total due to rounding.The year-to-year decrease in revenue in the industrial and consumer end markets in fiscal 2013 was primarily the result of a weak global economic environment and one less week of operations in fiscal 2013 as compared to fiscal 2012. Automotive end market revenue increased in fiscal 2013 primarily as a result of increasing electronic content in vehicles.The year-to-year decrease in revenue in the industrial, consumer and communications end markets in fiscal 2012 was primarily the result of a broad-based decrease in demand in these end markets. Automotive end market revenue increased in fiscal 2012 primarily as a result of increasing electronic content in vehicles.27Revenue Trends by Product TypeThe following table summarizes revenue by product categories. The categorization of our products into broad categories is based on the characteristics of the individual products, the specification of the products and in some cases the specific uses that certain products have within applications. The categorization of products into categories is therefore subject to judgment in some cases and can vary over time. In instances where products move between product categories, we reclassify the amounts in the product categories for all prior periods. Such reclassifications typically do not materially change the sizing of, or the underlying trends of results within, each product category. 2013 2012 2011 Revenue % ofTotalProductRevenue* Y/Y% Revenue % ofTotalProductRevenue* Revenue % ofTotalProductRevenueConverters$1,180,072 45% (1)% $1,192,064 44% $1,343,487 45%Amplifiers/Radio frequency682,759 26% (2)% 697,687 26% 788,299 26%Other analog372,281 14% (6)% 397,376 15% 410,323 14%Subtotal analog signal processing2,235,112 85% (2)% 2,287,127 85% 2,542,109 85%Power management & reference172,920 7% (5)% 182,134 7% 217,615 7%Total analog products$2,408,032 91% (2)% $2,469,261 91% $2,759,724 92%Digital signal processing225,657 9% (3)% 231,881 9% 233,596 8%Total Revenue$2,633,689 100% (2)% $2,701,142 100% $2,993,320 100%_____________________________________*The sum of the individual percentages do not equal the total due to rounding. The year-to-year decrease in total revenue in fiscal 2013 as compared to fiscal 2012 was the result of one less week of operations in fiscal 2013 as compared to fiscal 2012 and a broad-based decrease in demand across most product type categories. The year-to-year decrease in total revenue in fiscal 2012 as compared to fiscal 2011 was the result of a broad-based demand shift across all product categories.Revenue Trends by Geographic RegionRevenue by geographic region, based upon the primary location of our customers' design activity for its products, for fiscal 2013, 2012 and 2011 was as follows.

The year-over-year sales increase in China for fiscal 2013 was primarily the result of an increase in demand in the industrial end market. 28Sales decreased in all regions in fiscal 2012 as compared to fiscal 2011 as a result of a broad-based decrease in demand.

Gross margin percentage in fiscal 2012 decreased 190 basis points compared to fiscal 2011 primarily as a result of decreased operating levels in our manufacturing facilities as well as a reduced percentage of sales of our products sold into the industrial automation and instrumentation sectors of the industrial end market and the wireless base station sector of the communications end market, which earn higher margins as compared to products sold into our other end market sectors.Research and Development (R&D) Change Fiscal Year 2013 over 2012 2012 over 2011 2013 2012 2011 $ Change % Change $ Change % ChangeR&D Expenses$513,255 $512,003 $505,570 $1,252 —% $6,433 1%R&D Expenses as a % of Revenue19.5% 19.0% 16.9% R&D expenses remained flat in fiscal 2013 as compared to fiscal 2012 as increases in R&D employee salary and benefit expenses and other operational spending were offset by lower variable compensation expense linked to our overall profitability and revenue growth.R&D expenses increased in fiscal 2012 as compared to fiscal 2011 as a result of annual salary increases that became effective during the second quarter of fiscal 2012 and a general increase in spending, partially offset by lower variable compensation expense linked to our overall profitability and revenue growth.R&D expenses as a percentage of revenue will fluctuate from year-to-year depending on the amount of revenue and the success of new product development efforts, which we view as critical to our future growth. We have hundreds of R&D projects underway, none of which we believe are material on an individual basis. We expect to continue the development of innovative technologies and processes for new products. We believe that a continued commitment to R&D is essential to maintain product leadership with our existing products as well as to provide innovative new product offerings, and therefore, we expect to continue to make significant R&D investments in the future.Selling, Marketing, General and Administrative (SMG&A) Change Fiscal Year 2013 over 2012 2012 over 2011 2013 2012 2011 $ Change % Change $ Change % ChangeSMG&A Expenses$396,233 $396,519 $406,707 $(286) — % $(10,188) (3)%SMG&A Expenses as a % of Revenue15.0% 14.7% 13.6% SMG&A expenses remained flat in fiscal 2013 as compared to fiscal 2012 as decreases in SMG&A employee salary and benefit expenses and variable compensation expense linked to our overall profitability and revenue growth were partially offset by increases in other operational spending. In addition, fiscal 2013 also included $6.3 million of stock-based compensation expense following the death of our CEO in the second quarter of fiscal 2013 due to the accelerated vesting of restricted stock units in accordance with the terms of his restricted stock unit agreement. 29SMG&A expenses decreased in fiscal 2012 as compared to fiscal 2011 as lower variable compensation expense, which is a variable expense linked to our overall profitability and revenue growth, was partially offset by annual salary increases that became effective during the second quarter of fiscal 2012.Special ChargesWe monitor global macroeconomic conditions on an ongoing basis, and continue to assess opportunities for improved operational effectiveness and efficiency and better alignment of expenses with revenues. As a result of these assessments, we have undertaken various restructuring actions over the past several years. The expense reductions relating to ongoing actions are described below.During fiscal 2008 through fiscal 2010, we recorded special charges of approximately $43.3 million. These special charges included: $39.1 million for severance and fringe benefit costs in accordance with our ongoing benefit plan or statutory requirements at foreign locations for 245 manufacturing employees and 470 engineering and SMG&A employees; $2.1 million for lease obligation costs for facilities that we ceased using during the first quarter of fiscal 2009; $0.8 million for the write-off of property, plant and equipment; $0.5 million for contract termination costs and $0.3 million for clean-up and closure costs that were expensed as incurred; and $0.5 million related to the impairment of intellectual property. This action resulted in annual cost savings of approximately $52.0 million per year. We have terminated the employment of all employees associated with these actions. During fiscal 2011, we recorded a special charge of approximately $2.2 million for severance and fringe benefit costs in accordance with our ongoing benefit plan or statutory requirements at foreign locations for 25 engineering and SMG&A employees. This action was completed in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2012. This action resulted in annual cost savings of approximately $4.0 million.During fiscal 2012, we recorded special charges of approximately $8.4 million. The special charge included $7.9 million for severance and fringe benefit costs in accordance with our ongoing benefit plan or statutory requirements at foreign locations for 95 manufacturing, engineering and SMG&A employees; $0.1 million for contract termination costs; $0.2 million for lease obligation costs for facilities that we ceased using during the third quarter of fiscal 2012 and $0.2 million for the write-off of property, plant and equipment. This action resulted in annual savings in SMG&A expenses of approximately $12.0 million per year. We have terminated the employment of all employees associated with this action. During fiscal 2013, we recorded special charges of approximately $29.8 million for severance and fringe benefit costs in accordance with our ongoing benefit plan or statutory requirements at foreign locations for 235 engineering and SMG&A employees. As of November 2, 2013, we employed 98 of the 235 employees included in this cost reduction action. These employees must continue to be employed by us until their employment is involuntarily terminated in order to receive the severance benefit. We estimate these actions will result in annual cost savings of approximately $32.6 million, once fully implemented, which will be used to make additional investments in products that we expect will drive revenue growth in the future.Operating Income from Continuing Operations Change Fiscal Year 2013 over 2012 2012 over 2011 2013 2012 2011 $ Change % Change $ Change % ChangeOperating income from Continuing Operations$753,075 $824,048 $1,072,025 $(70,973) (9)% $(247,977) (23)%Operating income from Continuing Operations as a % of Revenue28.6% 30.5% 35.8% The year-over-year decrease in operating income from continuing operations in fiscal 2013 as compared to fiscal 2012 was primarily the result of a decrease in revenue of $67.5 million, a 20 basis point decrease in gross margin percentage, and an increase of $21.4 million in special charges as more fully described above under the heading Special Charges.The year-over-year decrease in operating income from continuing operations in fiscal 2012 as compared to fiscal 2011 was primarily the result of a decrease in revenue of $292.2 million and a 190 basis point decrease in gross margin percentage.30Nonoperating (Income) Expense Change Fiscal Year 2013 over 2012 2012 over 2011 2013 2012 2011 $ Change $ ChangeInterest expense$27,102 $26,422 $19,146 $680 $7,276Interest income(12,753) (14,448) (9,060) 1,695 (5,388)Other, net(76,597) (1,459) 492 (75,138) (1,951)Total nonoperating (income) expense$(62,248) $10,515 $10,578 $(72,763) $(63)The year-over-year increase in nonoperating income in fiscal 2013 as compared to fiscal 2012 was primarily the result of recognizing a gain of $85.4 million from the sale of a product line, as more fully described below under the heading Divestitures, partially offset by the net loss on extinguishment of debt of approximately $10.2 million in conjunction with the redemption of our $375 million aggregate principal amount of 5.0% senior unsecured notes in fiscal 2013 as more fully described below under the heading Liquidity and Capital Resources.The year-over-year increase in nonoperating interest expense in fiscal 2012 as compared to fiscal 2011 was primarily a result of our issuance of $375.0 million aggregate principal amount of 3.0% senior unsecured notes on April 4, 2011 which was partially offset by the impact of the termination of our interest rate swap agreement more fully described below under the heading Debt. The increases were partially offset by an increase in nonoperating interest income due to higher interest rates earned on our investments and the investment of higher cash balances in fiscal 2012 as compared to fiscal 2011, and an increase in nonoperating other income as a result of the gain from the sale of other investments in the second quarter of fiscal 2012.Provision for Income Taxes Change Fiscal Year 2013 over 2012 2012 over 2011 2013 2012 2011 $ Change % Change $ Change % ChangeProvision for Income Taxes$141,836 $162,297 $200,553 $(20,461) (13)% $(38,256) (19)%Effective Income Tax Rate17.4% 19.9% 18.9% Our effective tax rate reflects the applicable tax rate in effect in the various tax jurisdictions around the world where our income is earned.The decrease in our effective tax rate for fiscal 2013 compared to fiscal 2012 was primarily due to income earned in lower tax rate jurisdictions as a result of an international tax restructuring effective January 1, 2013. In addition, our effective tax rate for fiscal 2013 was lower by approximately 3% as a result of various discrete items including the reinstatement of the U.S. federal research and development tax credit and the reversal of certain prior period tax liabilities. These decreases in our effective tax rate were partially offset by the recording of a tax reserve of $36.5 million related to one open tax matter related to Section 965 of the Internal Revenue Code which increased our effective tax rate by approximately 5% and the tax effect of the gain on the sale of a product line in fiscal 2013 which increased our effective tax rate by approximately 3%. The increase in our effective tax rate for fiscal 2012 compared to fiscal 2011 was primarily due to the expiration of the U.S. federal research and development tax credit in December 2011. 31Income from Continuing Operations, Net of Tax Change Fiscal Year 2013 over 2012 2012 over 2011 2013 2012 2011 $ Change % Change $ Change % ChangeIncome from Continuing Operations, net of tax$673,487 $651,236 $860,894 $22,251 3% $(209,658) (24)%Income from Continuing Operations, net of tax as a % of Revenue25.6% 24.1% 28.8% Diluted EPS from Continuing Operations$2.14 $2.13 $2.79 $0.01 —% $(0.66) (24)%The year-over-year increase in net income from continuing operations in fiscal 2013 from fiscal 2012 was primarily a result of the lower provision for income taxes and the $72.8 million increase in nonoperating income, partially offset by the $71.0 million decrease in operating income from continuing operations.The year-over-year decrease in net income from continuing operations in fiscal 2012 from fiscal 2011 was primarily a result of the $248.0 million decrease in operating income from continuing operations partially offset by a lower provision for income taxes in fiscal 2012.The impact of inflation and foreign currency exchange rate movement on our results of operations during the past three fiscal years has not been significant.Discontinued Operations Fiscal Year 2013 2012 2011Total income from Discontinued Operations, net of tax$— $— $6,500Diluted earnings per share from Discontinued Operations— — 0.02We sold our Baseband Chipset Business to MediaTek Inc. during the first quarter of fiscal 2008. Accordingly, the results of the operations of this business has been presented as discontinued operations within the consolidated financial statements. In fiscal 2011, additional proceeds of $10.0 million were released from escrow and $6.5 million net of tax was recorded as additional gain from the sale of discontinued operations. Divestitures On October 31, 2013, we completed the sale of the assets and intellectual property related to our microphone product line to InvenSense, Inc. (InvenSense). We received $100.0 million in cash for the assets and intellectual property and after providing for the write-off of inventory, fixed assets and other costs incurred to complete the transaction, recorded a net gain of $85.4 million in nonoperating income during fiscal 2013. We have agreed to provide InvenSense with various transition services subsequent to the closing. We may receive additional cash payments, not to exceed $70.0 million, based on the achievement of certain revenue milestones through the first anniversary of the closing date. The sale of the assets and intellectual property related to the microphone product line did not qualify as a discontinued operation as it did not meet the requirement to be considered a component of an entity.32AcquisitionsIn fiscal 2012, we acquired privately-held Multigig, Inc. (Multigig) of San Jose, California. The acquisition of Multigig is expected to enhance our clocking capabilities in stand-alone and embedded applications and strengthen our high speed signal processing solutions. The acquisition-date fair value of the consideration transferred totaled $26.8 million, which consisted of $24.2 million in initial cash payments at closing and an additional $2.6 million subject to an indemnification holdback that was payable within 15 months of the transaction date. During the third quarter of fiscal 2012, we reduced this holdback amount by $0.1 million as a result of indemnification claims. During the third quarter of fiscal 2013, we paid the remaining $2.5 million due under the holdback. Our assessment of fair value of the tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed was based on their estimated fair values at the date of acquisition, resulting in the recognition of $15.6 million of in-process research and development (IPR&D), $1.1 million of developed technology, $7.0 million of goodwill and $3.1 million of net deferred tax assets. The goodwill recognized is attributable to future technologies that have yet to be determined as well as the assembled workforce of Multigig. Future technologies do not meet the criteria for recognition separately from goodwill because they are a part of future development and growth of the business. None of the goodwill is expected to be deductible for tax purposes. During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2012, we finalized our purchase accounting for Multigig which resulted in adjustments of $0.4 million to deferred taxes and goodwill. In addition, we will be obligated to pay royalties to the Multigig employees on revenue recognized from the sale of certain Multigig products through the earlier of 5 years or the aggregate maximum payment of $1.0 million. Royalty payments to Multigig employees require post-acquisition services to be rendered and, as such, we will record these amounts as compensation expense in the related periods. As of November 2, 2013, no royalty payments have been made. We recognized $0.5 million of acquisition-related costs that were expensed in fiscal 2012, which were included in operating expenses in the consolidated statement of income.In fiscal 2011, we acquired privately-held Lyric Semiconductor, Inc. (Lyric) of Cambridge, Massachusetts. The acquisition of Lyric gives us the potential to achieve significant improvement in power efficiency in mixed signal processing. The acquisition-date fair value of the consideration transferred totaled $27.8 million, which consisted of $14.0 million in initial cash payments at closing and contingent consideration of up to $13.8 million. The contingent consideration arrangement requires additional cash payments to the former equity holders of Lyric upon the achievement of certain technological and product development milestones payable during the period from June 2011 through June 2016. We estimated the fair value of the contingent consideration arrangement utilizing the income approach. Changes in the fair value of the contingent consideration subsequent to the acquisition date primarily driven by assumptions pertaining to the achievement of the defined milestones will be recognized in operating income in the period of the estimated fair value change. As of November 2, 2013, the Company had paid $8.0 million in contingent consideration. These payments are reflected in the statements of cash flows as cash used in financing activities related to the liability recognized at fair value as of the acquisition date and cash provided by operating activities related to the fair value adjustments previously recognized in earnings. The fair value of the tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed was based on their estimated fair values at the date of acquisition, resulting in the recognition of $12.2 million of IPR&D, $18.9 million of goodwill and $3.3 million of net deferred tax liabilities. The goodwill recognized is attributable to future technologies that have yet to be determined as well as the assembled workforce of Lyric. Future technologies do not meet the criteria for recognition separately from goodwill because they are a part of future development and growth of the business. None of the goodwill is expected to be deductible for tax purposes. The fair value of the remaining contingent consideration was approximately $6.5 million as of November 2, 2013, of which $3.8 million is included in accrued liabilities and $2.7 million is included in other non-current liabilities in our consolidated balance sheet. In addition, we will be obligated to pay royalties to the former equity holders of Lyric on revenue recognized from the sale of Lyric products and licenses through the earlier of 20 years or the accrual of a maximum of $25.0 million. Royalty payments to Lyric employees require post-acquisition services to be rendered and, as such, we will record these amounts as compensation expense in the related periods. As of November 2, 2013, no royalty payments have been made. We recognized $0.2 million of acquisition related costs that were expensed in fiscal 2011. These costs are included in operating expenses in the consolidated statement of income.We have not provided pro forma results of operations for Multigig and Lyric herein as these acquisitions were not considered material to us on either an individual or an aggregate basis. We included the results of operations of each acquisition in our consolidated statement of income from the date of each acquisition.Liquidity and Capital ResourcesAt November 2, 2013, our principal source of liquidity was $4,682.9 million of cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments, of which approximately $1,318.9 million was held in the United States. The balance of our cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments was held outside the United States in various foreign subsidiaries. As we intend toreinvest our foreign earnings indefinitely, this cash held outside the United States is not available to meet certain aspects of our cash requirements in the United States, including cash dividends and common stock repurchases. Our cash and cash equivalents consist of highly liquid investments with maturities of three months or less at the time of acquisition, including money market 33funds, and our short-term investments consist primarily of corporate obligations, such as commercial paper and floating rate notes, bonds and bank time deposits. We maintain these balances with high credit quality counterparties, continually monitor the amount of credit exposure to any one issuer and diversify our investments in order to minimize our credit risk.We believe that our existing sources of liquidity and cash expected to be generated from future operations, together with existing and anticipated available long-term financing, will be sufficient to fund operations, capital expenditures, research and development efforts, dividend payments (if any) and repurchases of our stock (if any) under our stock repurchase program in the immediate future and for at least the next twelve months.

The following changes contributed to the net decrease in cash and cash equivalents of $136.7 million in fiscal 2013.Operating Activities During fiscal 2013, we generated cash from operating activities of $912.3 million, an increase of $97.8 million compared to the $814.5 million generated in fiscal 2012. The increase in cash flow from operating activities was related to higher net income adjusted for non-cash items and the gain on the sale of the product line coupled with net cash inflows from working capital changes.Investing Activities During fiscal 2013, cash used for investing activities included $918.7 million for the net purchases of available-for-sale short term investments, $123.1 million for property, plant and equipment additions and $100.0 million in proceeds from the sale of a product line. Financing Activities During fiscal 2013, cash used for financing activities included net proceeds of $493.9 million from the issuance of $500.0 million aggregate principal amount of 2.875% senior unsecured notes on June 3, 2013, proceeds of $306.3 million from employee stock options and proceeds of $11.0 million from the settlement of derivative instruments. We paid $392.8 million related to the redemption of the $375.0 million aggregate principal amount of 5.0% senior unsecured notes, distributed $406.0 million to our shareholders in dividend payments, paid $60.5 million for the repurchase of 1.4 million shares of our common stock and repaid the remaining outstanding principal balance on our $145 million term loan facility of $60.1 million.Working Capital Fiscal Year 2013 2012 $ Change% ChangeAccounts Receivable$325,144 $339,881 $(14,737)(4)%Days Sales Outstanding*44 45 Inventory$283,337 $313,723 $(30,386)(10)%Days Cost of Sales in Inventory*111 114 _______________________________________*We use the annualized fourth quarter revenue in our calculation of days sales outstanding and we use the annualized fourth quarter cost of sales in our calculation of days cost of sales in inventory.34The decrease in accounts receivable was primarily the result of lower revenue in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2013 compared to the fourth quarter of fiscal 2012. Days sales outstanding decreased as a result of lower product shipments in the final month of the fourth quarter of fiscal 2013 compared to the final month of the fourth quarter of fiscal 2012.Inventory as of November 2, 2013 decreased as compared to the end of the fourth quarter of fiscal 2012 as a result of our continued efforts to balance manufacturing production, demand and inventory levels. Days cost of sales in inventory decreased from 114 days at the end of fiscal 2012 to 111 days at the end of fiscal 2013 primarily as a result of cost of sales decreasing 7% while inventory decreased by 10% for the same period.Current liabilities increased to $570.5 million at November 2, 2013 from $525.1 million recorded at the end of fiscal 2012, as increases in income taxes payable, accrued liabilities and deferred income on shipments to distributors, more fully described below, were partially offset by a decrease in the current portion of long term debt. As of November 2, 2013 and November 3, 2012, we had gross deferred revenue of $309.2 million and $299.0 million, respectively, and gross deferred cost of sales of $61.8 million and $60.5 million, respectively. Deferred income on shipments to distributors increased in fiscal 2013 primarily as a result of a mix shift in favor of higher margin products sold into the channel. Sales to distributors are made under agreements that allow distributors to receive price-adjustment credits and to return qualifying products for credit, as determined by us, in order to reduce the amounts of slow-moving, discontinued or obsolete product from their inventory. Given the uncertainties associated with the levels of price-adjustment credits to be granted to distributors, the sales price to the distributors is not fixed or determinable until the distributors resell the products to their customers. Therefore, we defer revenue recognition from sales to distributors until the distributors have sold the products to their customers. The amount of price-adjustments is dependent on future overall market conditions, and therefore the levels of these adjustments could fluctuate significantly from period to period. To the extent that we experience a significant increase in the amount of credits we issue to our distributors, there could be a material impact on the ultimate revenue and gross margin recognized relating to these transactions. DebtAs of November 2, 2013, we had $872.2 million in principal outstanding on our long term debt. Our debt obligations consist of the following:$375.0 million aggregate principal amount of 3.0% senior unsecured notesOn April 4, 2011, we issued $375.0 million aggregate principal amount of 3.0% senior unsecured notes due April 15, 2016 (the 2016 Notes) with semi-annual fixed interest payments due on April 15 and October 15 of each year, commencing October 15, 2011.$500.0 million aggregate principal amount of 2.875% senior unsecured notesOn June 3, 2013, we issued $500.0 million aggregate principal amount of 2.875% senior unsecured notes due June 1, 2023 (the 2023 Notes) with semi-annual fixed interest payments due on June 1 and December 1 of each year, commencing December 1, 2013.The indentures governing the 2016 Notes and the 2023 Notes contain covenants that may limit our ability to: incur, create, assume or guarantee any debt for borrowed money secured by a lien upon a principal property; enter into sale and lease-back transactions with respect to a principal property; and consolidate with or merge into, or transfer or lease all or substantially all of our assets to, any other party. As of November 2, 2013, we were compliant with these covenants. See Note 16 in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements contained in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further information on our outstanding debt.Revolving Credit FacilityDuring December 2012, we terminated our $165.0 million unsecured revolving credit facility with certain institutional lenders entered into in May 2008. On December 19, 2012, we entered into a five-year, $500.0 million senior unsecured revolving credit facility with certain institutional lenders. To date, we have not borrowed under this credit facility but we may borrow in the future and use the proceeds for repayment of existing indebtedness, stock repurchases, acquisitions, capital expenditures, working capital and other lawful corporate purposes. The terms of the facility impose restrictions on our ability to undertake certain transactions, to create certain liens on assets and to incur certain subsidiary indebtedness. In addition, the credit agreement contains a consolidated leverage ratio covenant of total consolidated funded debt to consolidated EBITDA (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization) of not greater than 3.0 to 1.0. As of November 2, 2013, we were compliant with these covenants.35$145.0 million term loan facilityOn December 22, 2010, Analog Devices Holdings B.V., our wholly owned subsidiary, entered into a credit agreement with Bank of America, N.A., London Branch as administrative agent. The borrower's obligations were guaranteed by us. The credit agreement provided for a $145.0 million term loan facility, which was set to mature on December 22, 2013. During the first quarter of fiscal 2013, we repaid the remaining outstanding principal balance on the loan of $60.1 million and the credit agreement was terminated. $375.0 million aggregate principal amount of 5.0% senior unsecured notesDuring the third quarter of fiscal 2013, we redeemed our outstanding 5.0% senior unsecured notes which were due on July 1, 2014 (the 2014 Notes). The redemption price was 104.744% of the principal amount of the 2014 Notes. We recognized a net loss on the debt extinguishment of approximately $10.2 million recorded in other, net expense within non-operating (income) expense. The loss was comprised of the make-whole premium of $17.8 million paid to bondholders on the 2014 Notes in accordance with the terms of the 2014 Notes, the recognition of the remaining $8.6 million of unamortized proceeds received from the termination of the interest rate swap associated with the debt, and the write-off of approximately $1.0 million of debt issuance and discount costs that remained to be amortized. The write-off of the remaining unamortized portion of debt issuance costs, discount and swap proceeds are reflected in our condensed consolidated statements of cash flows within operating activities, and the make-whole premium is reflected within financing activities. Stock Repurchase ProgramOur common stock repurchase program has been in place since August 2004. In the aggregate, our Board of Directors has authorized us to repurchase $5.0 billion of our common stock under the program. Under the program, we may repurchase outstanding shares of our common stock from time to time in the open market and through privately negotiated transactions. Unless terminated earlier by resolution of our Board of Directors, the repurchase program will expire when we have repurchased all shares authorized under the program. As of November 2, 2013, we had repurchased a total of approximately 130.1 million shares of our common stock for approximately $4,481.6 million under this program. As of November 2, 2013, an additional $518.4 million worth of shares remains available for repurchase under the current authorized program. The repurchased shares are held as authorized but unissued shares of common stock. We also from time to time repurchase shares in settlement of employee tax withholding obligations due upon the vesting of restricted stock units or the exercise of stock options. Any future common stock repurchases will be based on several factors, including our financial performance, outlook, liquidity and the amount of cash we have available in the United States. Capital ExpendituresNet additions to property, plant and equipment were $123.1 million in fiscal 2013 and were funded with a combination of cash on hand and cash generated from operations. We expect capital expenditures for fiscal 2014 to be approximately $150 million, of which about two-thirds relates to ongoing capital spending, and about one-third relates to capital spending for a new building we are constructing on our campus in Ireland. These capital expenditures will be funded with a combination of cash on hand and cash generated from operations. DividendsOn November 25, 2013, our Board of Directors declared a cash dividend of $0.34 per outstanding share of common stock. The dividend will be paid on December 17, 2013 to all shareholders of record at the close of business on December 6, 2013 and is expected to total approximately $105.8 million. We currently expect quarterly dividends to continue at $0.34 per share, although they remain subject to determination and declaration by our Board of Directors. The payment of future dividends, if any, will be based on several factors, including our financial performance, outlook and liquidity. 36 Contractual ObligationsThe table below summarizes our contractual obligations and the amounts we owe under these contracts in specified periods as of November 2, 2013: Payment due by period Less than More than(thousands) Total 1 Year 1-3 Years 3-5 Years 5 YearsContractual obligations: Operating leases (a) $69,071 $28,045 $27,766 $11,507 $1,753Debt obligations 875,000 — 375,000 — 500,000Interest payments associated with long-term debt obligations 171,795 25,545 45,625 28,750 71,875Deferred compensation plan (b) 17,431 67 — — 17,364Pension funding (c) 3,511 3,511 — — —Total $1,136,808 $57,168 $448,391 $40,257 $590,992_______________________________________(a)Certain of our operating lease obligations include escalation clauses. These escalating payment requirements are reflected in the table.(b)These payments relate to obligations under our deferred compensation plan. The deferred compensation plan allows certain members of management and other highly-compensated employees and non-employee directors to defer receipt of all or any portion of their compensation. The amount in the “More than 5 Years” column of the table represents the remaining total balance under the deferred compensation plan to be paid to participants who have not terminated employment. Since we cannot reasonably estimate the timing of withdrawals for participants who have not yet terminated employment, we have included the future obligation to these participants in the “More than 5 Years” column of the table.(c)Our funding policy for our foreign defined benefit plans is consistent with the local requirements of each country. The payment obligations in the table are estimates of our expected contributions to these plans for fiscal year 2014. The actual future payments may differ from the amounts presented in the table and reasonable estimates of payments beyond one year are not practical because of potential future changes in variables, such as plan asset performance, interest rates and the rate of increase in compensation levels.Purchase orders for the purchase of raw materials and other goods and services are not included in the table above. We are not able to determine the total amount of these purchase orders that represent contractual obligations, as purchase orders may represent authorizations to purchase rather than binding agreements. In addition, our purchase orders generally allow for cancellation without significant penalties. We do not have significant agreements for the purchase of raw materials or other goods specifying minimum quantities or set prices that exceed our expected short-term requirements.Our 2011 acquisition of Lyric Semiconductor involves the potential payment of contingent consideration. The table above does not reflect any such obligations, as the timing and amounts are uncertain. See Note 6 in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements contained in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for more information regarding our acquisitions.As of November 2, 2013, our total liabilities associated with uncertain tax positions was $71.3 million, which are included in “Other non-current liabilities” in our consolidated balance sheet contained in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Due to the complexity associated with our tax uncertainties, we cannot make a reasonably reliable estimate of the period in which we expect to settle the non-current liabilities associated with these uncertain tax positions. Therefore, we have not included these uncertain tax positions in the above contractual obligations table.The expected timing of payments and the amounts of the obligations discussed above are estimated based on current information available as of November 2, 2013.Off-balance Sheet FinancingAs of November 2, 2013, we had no off-balance sheet financing arrangements.37OutlookThe following statements are based on current expectations. These statements are forward-looking, and actual results may differ materially as a result of, among other things, the important factors contained in Part I, Item 1A. ""Risk Factors"" and elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Unless specifically mentioned, these statements do not give effect to the potential impact of any mergers, acquisitions, divestitures, or business combinations that may be announced or closed after the date of filing this report. These statements supersede all prior statements regarding our business outlook made by us.We are planning for revenue in the first quarter of fiscal 2014 to be down approximately 5% to down approximately 10% from the fourth quarter of fiscal 2013. Our plan is for gross margin percentage for the first quarter of fiscal 2014 to be approximately 64% to 65%. We are planning for operating expenses in the first quarter of fiscal 2014 to be approximately $226 million and our tax rate to be approximately 13%. As a result, our plan is for Diluted EPS to be approximately $0.44 to $0.52 in the first quarter of fiscal 2014.New Accounting PronouncementsFrom time to time, new accounting pronouncements are issued by the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) that are adopted by us as of the specified effective date. Unless otherwise discussed, management believes that the impact of recently issued standards will not have a material impact on our future financial condition and results of operations. See Note 2t, New Accounting Pronouncements, of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements contained in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for a description of recently issued and adopted accounting pronouncements, including the dates of adoption and impact on our historical financial condition and results of operations.Critical Accounting Policies and EstimatesManagement’s discussion and analysis of the financial condition and results of operations is based upon the consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue and expenses, and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. We base our estimates and judgments on historical experience, knowledge of current conditions and beliefs of what could occur in the future based on available information. We consider the following accounting policies to be both those most important to the portrayal of our financial condition and those that require the most subjective judgment. If actual results differ significantly from management’s estimates and projections, there could be a material effect on our financial statements. We also have other policies that we consider key accounting policies, such as our policy for revenue recognition, including the deferral of revenue on sales to distributors until the products are sold to the end user; however, the application of these policies does not require us to make significant estimates or judgments that are difficult or subjective.Inventory ValuationWe value inventories at the lower of cost (first-in, first-out method) or market. Because of the cyclical nature of the semiconductor industry, changes in inventory levels, obsolescence of technology, and product life cycles, we write down inventories to net realizable value. We employ a variety of methodologies to determine the net realizable value of inventory. While a portion of the calculation is determined via reference to the age of inventory and lower of cost or market calculations, an element of the calculation is subject to significant judgments made by us about future demand for our inventory. If actual demand for our products is less than our estimates, additional adjustments to existing inventories may need to be recorded in future periods. To date, our actual results have not been materially different than our estimates, and we do not expect them to be materially different in the future.Allowance for Doubtful AccountsWe maintain allowances for doubtful accounts, when appropriate, for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments. If the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate, our actual losses may exceed our estimates, and additional allowances would be required. To date, our actual results have not been materially different than our estimates, and we do not expect them to be materially different in the future.Long-Lived AssetsWe review property, plant, and equipment and finite lived intangible assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of assets may not be recoverable. Recoverability of these assets is measured by comparison of their carrying value to future undiscounted cash flows that the assets are expected to generate over their remaining economic lives. If such assets are considered to be impaired, the impairment to be recognized in earnings equals the 38amount by which the carrying value of the assets exceeds their fair value determined by either a quoted market price, if any, or a value determined by utilizing a discounted cash flow technique. Although we have recognized no material impairment adjustments related to our property, plant, and equipment and identified intangible assets during the past three fiscal years, except those made in conjunction with restructuring actions, deterioration in our business in the future could lead to such impairment adjustments in future periods. Evaluation of impairment of long-lived assets requires estimates of future operating results that are used in the preparation of the expected future undiscounted cash flows. Actual future operating results and the remaining economic lives of our long-lived assets could differ from the estimates used in assessing the recoverability of these assets. These differences could result in impairment charges, which could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations. In addition, in certain instances, assets may not be impaired but their estimated useful lives may have decreased. In these situations, we amortize the remaining net book values over the revised useful lives. We review indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment annually, on the first day of the fourth quarter (on or about August 1) or more frequently if indicators of impairment exist. The impairment test involves the comparison of the fair value of the intangible asset with its carrying amount.GoodwillGoodwill is subject to annual impairment tests or more frequently if indicators of potential impairment exist and suggest that the carrying value of goodwill may not be recoverable from estimated discounted future cash flows. We test goodwill for impairment at the reporting unit level (operating segment or one level below an operating segment) on an annual basis in the fourth quarter (on or about August 1) or more frequently if we believe indicators of impairment exist. For our latest annual impairment assessment that occurred on August 4, 2013, we identified our reporting units to be our five operating segments, which meet the aggregation criteria for one reportable segment. The performance of the test involves a two-step process. The first step of the impairment test involves comparing the fair values of the applicable reporting units with their aggregate carrying values, including goodwill. We generally determine the fair value of our reporting units using the income approach methodology of valuation that includes the discounted cash flow method as well as other generally accepted valuation methodologies, which requires significant judgment by management. If the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds the reporting unit’s fair value, we perform the second step of the goodwill impairment test to determine the amount of impairment loss. The second step of the goodwill impairment test involves comparing the implied fair value of the affected reporting unit’s goodwill with the carrying value of that goodwill. These impairment tests may result in impairment losses that could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations.Value of Contingent Consideration related to Business CombinationWe record contingent consideration resulting from a business combination at its fair value on the acquisition date. We generally determine the fair value of the contingent consideration using the income approach methodology of valuation. Each reporting period thereafter, we revalue these obligations and record increases or decreases in their fair value as an adjustment to operating expenses within the consolidated statement of income. Changes in the fair value of the contingent consideration can result from changes in assumed discount periods and rates, and from changes pertaining to the achievement of the defined milestones. Significant judgment is employed in determining the appropriateness of these assumptions as of the acquisition date and for each subsequent period. Accordingly, future business and economic conditions, as well as changes in any of the assumptions described above, can materially impact the amount of contingent consideration expense we record in any given period.Accounting for Income TaxesWe must make certain estimates and judgments in determining income tax expense for financial statement purposes. These estimates and judgments occur in the calculation of tax credits, benefits, and deductions, and in the calculation of certain tax assets and liabilities, which arise from differences in the timing of the recognition of revenue and expense for tax and financial statement purposes, as well as the interest and penalties relating to these uncertain tax positions. We assessed the likelihood of the realization of deferred tax assets and concluded that a valuation allowance is needed to reserve the amount of the deferred tax assets that may not be realized due to the uncertainty of the timing and amount of the realization of certain state credit carryovers. In reaching our conclusion, we evaluated certain relevant criteria including the existence of deferred tax liabilities that can be used to absorb deferred tax assets, the taxable income in prior carryback years in the impacted state jurisdictions that can be used to absorb net operating losses and taxable income in future years. Our judgments regarding future profitability may change due to future market conditions, changes in U.S. or international tax laws and other factors. These changes, if any, may require material adjustments to these deferred tax assets, resulting in a reduction in net income or an increase in net loss in the period when such determinations are made, which in turn, may result in an increase or decrease to our tax provision in a subsequent period.39We account for uncertain tax positions by determining if it is “more likely than not” that a tax position will be sustained by the appropriate taxing authorities prior to recording any benefit in the financial statements. An uncertain income tax position is not recognized if it has less than a 50% likelihood of being sustained. For those tax positions where it is more likely than not that a tax benefit will be sustained, we have recorded the largest amount of tax benefit with a greater than 50% likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement with a taxing authority that has full knowledge of all relevant information. For those income tax positions where it is not more likely than not that a tax benefit will be sustained, no tax benefit has been recognized in the financial statements. We reevaluate these uncertain tax positions on a quarterly basis. This evaluation is based on factors including, but not limited to, changes in known facts or circumstances, changes in tax law, effectively settled issues under audit, and new audit activity. A change in these factors would result in the recognition of a tax benefit or an additional charge to the tax provision.In the ordinary course of global business, there are many transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax outcome is uncertain. Some of these uncertainties arise as a consequence of cost reimbursement and royalty arrangements among related entities. Although we believe our estimates are reasonable, no assurance can be given that the final tax outcome of these matters will not be different than that which is reflected in our historical income tax provisions and accruals. In the event our assumptions are incorrect, the differences could have a material impact on our income tax provision and operating results in the period in which such determination is made. In addition to the factors described above, our current and expected effective tax rate is based on then-current tax law. Significant changes during the year in enacted tax law could affect these estimates.Stock-Based CompensationStock-based compensation expense associated with stock options and related awards is recognized in the statement of income. Determining the amount of stock-based compensation to be recorded requires us to develop estimates to be used in calculating the grant-date fair value of stock options. We calculate the grant-date fair values using the Black-Scholes valuation model. The use of valuation models requires us to make estimates of the following items:Expected volatility — We are responsible for estimating volatility and have considered a number of factors, including third-party estimates, when estimating volatility. We currently believe that the exclusive use of implied volatility results in the best estimate of the grant-date fair value of employee stock options because it reflects the market’s current expectations of future volatility. In evaluating the appropriateness of exclusively relying on implied volatility, we concluded that: (1) options in our common stock are actively traded with sufficient volume on several exchanges; (2) the market prices of both the traded options and the underlying shares are measured at a similar point in time to each other and on a date close to the grant date of the employee share options; (3) the traded options have exercise prices that are both near-the-money and close to the exercise price of the employee share options; and (4) the remaining maturities of the traded options used to estimate volatility are at least one year.Expected term — We use historical employee exercise and option expiration data to estimate the expected term assumption for the Black-Scholes grant-date valuation. We believe that this historical data is currently the best estimate of the expected term of a new option, and that generally, all of our employees exhibit similar exercise behavior. In general, the longer the expected term used in the Black-Scholes valuation model, the higher the grant-date fair value of the option.Risk-free interest rate — The yield on zero-coupon U.S. Treasury securities for a period that is commensurate with the expected term assumption is used as the risk-free interest rate.Expected dividend yield — Expected dividend yield is calculated by annualizing the cash dividend declared by our Board of Directors for the current quarter and dividing that result by the closing stock price on the date of grant of the option. Until such time as our Board of Directors declares a cash dividend for an amount that is different from the current quarter’s cash dividend, the current dividend will be used in deriving this assumption. Cash dividends are not paid on options, restricted stock or restricted stock units.The amount of stock-based compensation expense recognized during a period is based on the value of the portion of the awards that are ultimately expected to vest. Forfeitures are estimated at the time of grant and revised, if necessary, in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates. The term “forfeitures” is distinct from “cancellations” or “expirations” and represents only the unvested portion of the surrendered option. Based on an analysis of our historical forfeitures, we have applied an annual forfeiture rate of 4.4% to all unvested stock-based awards as of November 2, 2013. The rate of 4.4% represents the portion that is expected to be forfeited each year over the vesting period. This analysis is re-evaluated quarterly and the forfeiture rate is adjusted as necessary. Ultimately, the actual expense recognized over the vesting period will only be for those awards that vest.40ContingenciesFrom time to time, we receive demands from third parties alleging that our products or manufacturing processes infringe the patent or intellectual property rights of these parties. We periodically assess each matter to determine if a contingent liability should be recorded. In making this determination, we may, depending on the nature of the matter, consult with internal and external legal counsel and technical experts. Based on the information we obtain, combined with our judgment regarding all the facts and circumstances of each matter, we determine whether it is probable that a contingent loss may be incurred and whether the amount of such loss can be reasonably estimated. If a loss is probable and reasonably estimable, we record a contingent loss. In determining the amount of a contingent loss, we consider advice received from experts in the specific matter, current status of legal proceedings, settlement negotiations that may be ongoing, prior case history and other factors. If the judgments and estimates made by us are incorrect, we may need to record additional contingent losses that could materially adversely impact our results of operations.Post-Retirement Benefits We have significant pension costs and liabilities related to our foreign defined benefit pension plans that are developed from actuarial valuations specific to each country. Inherent in these valuations are key assumptions including discount rates, expected return on plan assets, mortality rates, merit and promotion increases. We are required to consider current market conditions, including changes in interest rates, in making our assumptions. Changes in the related pension costs or liabilities may occur in the future due to changes in our assumptions. Our assumptions as to the expected long-term rates of return on plan assets are based upon the composition of plan assets, historical long-term rates of return on similar assets and current and expected market conditions. The discount rate used for non-U.S. plans reflects the market rate for high-quality fixed-income investments on our annual measurement date (November 2) and is subject to change each year. The discount rates used for plans outside the U.S. are based on a combination of relevant indices regarding corporate and government securities, the duration of the liability and appropriate judgment. Changes in pension income/costs or assets/liabilities may occur in the future due to changes in the assumptions and changes in asset values. If the actual results and events of our pension plan differ from our current assumptions, our benefit obligations may be over-or under-valued. See the disclosures about pension obligations, the composition of plan assets, assumptions and other matters in Note 13 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements contained in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. We performed a sensitivity analysis on the discount rate and long-term rate of return on assets, which are key assumptions in determining our net periodic post-retirement benefit cost. The table below illustrates the impact of an increase(decrease) of 25 basis points in these assumptions for the year ended November 2, 2013. Increase (Decrease) in Pension Expense 25 Basis Point Increase 25 Basis Point DecreaseLong-term rate of return on assets used to determine net periodic benefit cost$(0.5) $0.5Discount rate used to determine net periodic benefit cost$(1.8) $1.9ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISKInterest Rate ExposureOur interest income and expense are sensitive to changes in the general level of interest rates. In this regard, changes in interest rates affect the interest earned on our marketable securities and short term investments, as well as the fair value of our investments and debt.Based on our marketable securities and short-term investments outstanding as of November 2, 2013 and November 3, 2012, our annual interest income would change by approximately $46 million and $41 million, respectively, for each 100 basis point increase in interest rates.To provide a meaningful assessment of the interest rate risk associated with our investment portfolio, we performed a sensitivity analysis to determine the impact a change in interest rates would have on the value of our investment portfolio assuming a 100 basis point parallel shift in the yield curve. Based on investment positions as of November 2, 2013 and November 3, 2012, a hypothetical 100 basis point increase in interest rates across all maturities would result in a $15 million and $10 million decline, respectively in the fair market value of the portfolio. Such losses would only be realized if we sold the investments prior to maturity.41As of November 2, 2013, we had $875 million in principal amount of senior unsecured notes outstanding, which consisted of $375 million 3% senior unsecured notes (the 2016 Notes), due April 15, 2016 and $500 million 2.875% senior unsecured notes (the 2023 Notes), due June 1, 2023. As of November 2, 2013, a hypothetical 100 basis point increase in market interest rates would reduce the fair value of our 2016 Notes outstanding by approximately $9 million. As of November 2, 2013, a similar increase in market interest rates would reduce the fair value of our 2023 Notes by $41 million. Foreign Currency ExposureAs more fully described in Note 2i in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements contained in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, we regularly hedge our non-U.S. dollar-based exposures by entering into forward foreign currency exchange contracts. The terms of these contracts are for periods matching the duration of the underlying exposure and generally range from one month to twelve months. Currently, our largest foreign currency exposure is the Euro, primarily because our European operations have the highest proportion of our local currency denominated expenses. Relative to foreign currency exposures existing at November 2, 2013 and November 3, 2012, a 10% unfavorable movement in foreign currency exchange rates over the course of the year would expose us to approximately $2 million and $1 million, respectively, in losses in earnings or cash flows.The market risk associated with our derivative instruments results from currency exchange rates that are expected to offset the market risk of the underlying transactions, assets and liabilities being hedged. The counterparties to the agreements relating to our foreign exchange instruments consist of a number of major international financial institutions with high credit ratings. Based on the credit ratings of our counterparties as of November 2, 2013, we do not believe that there is significant risk of nonperformance by them. While the contract or notional amounts of derivative financial instruments provide one measure of the volume of these transactions, they do not represent the amount of our exposure to credit risk. The amounts potentially subject to credit risk (arising from the possible inability of counterparties to meet the terms of their contracts) are generally limited to the amounts, if any, by which the counterparties’ obligations under the contracts exceed our obligations to the counterparties.The following table illustrates the effect that a 10% unfavorable or favorable movement in foreign currency exchange rates, relative to the U.S. dollar, would have on the fair value of our forward exchange contracts as of November 2, 2013 and November 3, 2012: November 2, 2013 November 3, 2012Fair value of forward exchange contracts asset$2,267 $1,061Fair value of forward exchange contracts after a 10% unfavorable movement in foreign currency exchange rates asset$22,763 $16,800Fair value of forward exchange contracts after a 10% favorable movement in foreign currency exchange rates liability$(17,216) $(13,885)The calculation assumes that each exchange rate would change in the same direction relative to the U.S. dollar. In addition to the direct effects of changes in exchange rates, such changes typically affect the volume of sales or the foreign currency sales price as competitors’ products become more or less attractive. Our sensitivity analysis of the effects of changes in foreign currency exchange rates does not factor in a potential change in sales levels or local currency selling prices.42",2023-12-30 19:08:50.440501

Fiscal 2012 was a 53-week year. The additional week in fiscal 2012 was included in the first quarter ended February 4, 2012.On July 22, 2014, we completed the acquisition of Hittite Microwave Corporation (Hittite), a company that designs and develops high performance integrated circuits, modules, subsystems and instrumentation for radio frequency, microwave and millimeterwave applications. The total consideration paid to acquire Hittite was approximately $2.4 billion, financed through a combination of existing cash on hand and a 90-day term loan facility of $2.0 billion. The acquisition of Hittite is referred to as the Acquisition. The results of operations of Hittite from July 22, 2014 (the Acquisition Date) are included in the consolidated statements of income for fiscal 2014 and accounted for approximately 3% of revenue. See Note 6, Acquisitions, of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements contained in Item 8 of this Annual Report on From 10-K for further discussion related to the Acquisition.The year-to-year revenue changes by end market and product category are more fully outlined below under Revenue Trends by End Market and Revenue Trends by Product Type.Revenue Trends by End MarketThe following table summarizes revenue by end market. The categorization of revenue by end market is determined using a variety of data points including the technical characteristics of the product, the “sold to” customer information, the “ship to” customer information and the end customer product or application into which our product will be incorporated. As data systems for capturing and tracking this data evolve and improve, the categorization of products by end market can vary over time. When this occurs, we reclassify revenue by end market for prior periods. Such reclassifications typically do not materially change the sizing of, or the underlying trends of results within, each end market. 2014 2013 2012 Revenue % ofTotalProductRevenue Y/Y% Revenue % ofTotalProductRevenue* Revenue % ofTotalProductRevenueIndustrial$1,333,694 47% 10 % $1,215,829 46% $1,244,608 46%Automotive524,867 18% 9 % 483,445 18% 464,553 17%Consumer325,222 11% (20)% 404,548 15% 464,179 17%Communications680,990 24% 29 % 529,867 20% 527,802 20%Total Revenue$2,864,773 100% 9 % $2,633,689 100% $2,701,142 100%*The sum of the individual percentages does not equal the total due to rounding.26 The year-to-year increase in communications end market revenue in fiscal 2014 was primarily a result of increased wireless base station deployment activity and, to a lesser extent, an increase in revenue as a result of the Acquisition. Industrial end market revenue increased year-over-year in fiscal 2014 as compared to fiscal 2013 as a result of an increase in demand in this end market, which was most significant for products sold into the instrumentation and automation sectors and, to a lesser extent, an increase in revenue as a result of the Acquisition. The year-to-year increase in automotive end market revenue in fiscal 2014 was primarily a result of increasing electronic content in vehicles and higher demand for new vehicles. The year-to-year decrease in revenue in the consumer end market in fiscal 2014 was primarily the result of the sale of our microphone product line in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2013. The year-to-year decrease in revenue in the industrial and consumer end markets in fiscal 2013 was primarily the result of a weak global economic environment and one less week of operations in fiscal 2013 as compared to fiscal 2012. Automotive end market revenue increased in fiscal 2013 primarily as a result of increasing electronic content in vehicles.Revenue Trends by Product TypeThe following table summarizes revenue by product categories. The categorization of our products into broad categories is based on the characteristics of the individual products, the specification of the products and in some cases the specific uses that certain products have within applications. The categorization of products into categories is therefore subject to judgment in some cases and can vary over time. In instances where products move between product categories, we reclassify the amounts in the product categories for all prior periods. Such reclassifications typically do not materially change the sizing of, or the underlying trends of results within, each product category. 2014 2013 2012 Revenue % ofTotalProductRevenue* Y/Y% Revenue % ofTotalProductRevenue* Revenue % ofTotalProductRevenue*Converters$1,285,368 45% 9 % $1,180,072 45% $1,192,064 44%Amplifiers/Radio frequency806,975 28% 18 % 682,759 26% 697,687 26%Other analog356,406 12% (4)% 372,281 14% 397,376 15%Subtotal analog signal processing2,448,749 85% 10 % 2,235,112 85% 2,287,127 85%Power management & reference174,483 6% 1 % 172,920 7% 182,134 7%Total analog products$2,623,232 92% 9 % $2,408,032 91% $2,469,261 91%Digital signal processing241,541 8% 7 % 225,657 9% 231,881 9%Total Revenue$2,864,773 100% 9 % $2,633,689 100% $2,701,142 100%_____________________________________*The sum of the individual percentages does not equal the total due to rounding.The year-to-year increase in total revenue in fiscal 2014 as compared to fiscal 2013 was the result of improving demand across most product type categories and the result of the Acquisition, which was partially offset by declines in the other analog product category, primarily as a result of the sale of our microphone product line in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2013.The year-to-year decrease in total revenue in fiscal 2013 as compared to fiscal 2012 was the result of one less week of operations in fiscal 2013 as compared to fiscal 2012 and a broad-based decrease in demand across most product type categories.Revenue Trends by Geographic RegionRevenue by geographic region, based upon the primary location of our customers' design activity for its products, for fiscal 2014, 2013 and 2012 was as follows.27 Change Fiscal Year 2014 over 2013 2013 over 2012 2014 2013 2012 $ Change % Change $ Change % ChangeUnited States$821,554 $821,269 $818,653 $285 — % $2,616 — %Rest of North and South America96,957 99,215 114,133 (2,258) (2)% (14,918) (13)%Europe924,477 840,585 852,668 83,892 10 % (12,083) (1)%Japan308,054 292,804 333,558 15,250 5 % (40,754) (12)%China459,260 349,575 341,196 109,685 31 % 8,379 2 %Rest of Asia254,471 230,241 240,934 24,230 11 % (10,693) (4)%Total Revenue$2,864,773 $2,633,689 $2,701,142 $231,084 9 % $(67,453) (2)%In fiscal years 2014, 2013 and 2012, the predominant countries comprising “Rest of North and South America” are Canada and Mexico; the predominant countries comprising “Europe” are Germany, Sweden, France and the United Kingdom; and the predominant countries comprising “Rest of Asia” are Taiwan and South Korea. On a regional basis, the year-over-year sales increases for fiscal 2014 in most regions were the result of an increase in demand in the communications, industrial and automotive end markets and an increase in revenue as a result of the Acquisition, partially offset by a lower demand for products used in consumer applications. On a regional basis, the year-over-year sales declines in Japan and Rest of Asia for fiscal 2013 were primarily the result of lower demand for products used in consumer applications. The year-over-year sales increase in China for fiscal 2013 was primarily the result of an increase in demand in the industrial end market. Gross Margin Change Fiscal Year 2014 over 2013 2013 over 2012 2014 2013 2012 $ Change % Change $ Change % ChangeGross Margin$1,830,188 $1,692,411 $1,741,001 $137,777 8% $(48,590) (3)%Gross Margin %63.9% 64.3% 64.5% Gross margin percentage decreased by 40 basis points compared to fiscal 2013, primarily as a result of recording approximately $53.6 million of additional cost related to the sale of acquired inventory written up to fair value as a result of the Acquisition. This expense was partially offset by the improved utilization levels in our manufacturing facilities and, to a lesser extent, a mix shift in favor of higher margin products being sold as a result of the Acquisition.Gross margin percentage in fiscal 2013 decreased 20 basis points compared to fiscal 2012 primarily as a result of a slight mix shift in favor of lower margin products being sold. Research and Development (R&D) Change Fiscal Year 2014 over 2013 2013 over 2012 2014 2013 2012 $ Change % Change $ Change % ChangeR&D Expenses$559,686 $513,035 $511,835 $46,651 9% $1,200 —%R&D Expenses as a % of Revenue19.5% 19.5% 18.9% R&D expenses increased in fiscal 2014 as compared to fiscal 2013, primarily due to an increase in variable compensation expense linked to our overall profitability and revenue growth, higher R&D employee and related benefit expenses, and a general increase in other operational spending. Approximately $15.0 million of the overall increase year-over-year was a result of the Acquisition. 28R&D expenses remained flat in fiscal 2013 as compared to fiscal 2012 as increases in R&D employee salary and benefit expenses and other operational spending were offset by lower variable compensation expense linked to our overall profitability and revenue growth.R&D expenses as a percentage of revenue will fluctuate from year-to-year depending on the amount of revenue and the success of new product development efforts, which we view as critical to our future growth. We have hundreds of R&D projects underway, none of which we believe are material on an individual basis. We expect to continue the development of innovative technologies and processes for new products. We believe that a continued commitment to R&D is essential to maintain product leadership with our existing products as well as to provide innovative new product offerings, and therefore, we expect to continue to make significant R&D investments in the future.Selling, Marketing, General and Administrative (SMG&A) Change Fiscal Year 2014 over 2013 2013 over 2012 2014 2013 2012 $ Change % Change $ Change % ChangeSMG&A Expenses$454,676 $396,233 $396,519 $58,443 15% $(286) — %SMG&A Expenses as a % of Revenue15.9% 15.0% 14.7% SMG&A expenses increased year-to-year as compared to fiscal 2013 primarily due to Acquisition-related transaction costs and other activity of approximately $33.3 million. The remainder of the increases were primarily due to higher variable compensation expense linked to our overall profitability and revenue growth, higher SMG&A employee and related benefit expenses as a result of an increased headcount attributable to the Acquisition and, to a lesser extent, increases in other operational spending. The increases in SMG&A employee and related benefit expenses were partially offset by a lower stock-based compensation expense as fiscal 2013 included $6.3 million related to the accelerated vesting of restricted stock units following the death of the Company's then-CEO in the second quarter of fiscal 2013.SMG&A expenses remained flat in fiscal 2013 as compared to fiscal 2012 as decreases in SMG&A employee salary and benefit expenses and variable compensation expense linked to our overall profitability and revenue growth were partially offset by increases in other operational spending. In addition, fiscal 2013 also included $6.3 million of stock-based compensation expense following the death of our CEO in the second quarter of fiscal 2013 due to the accelerated vesting of restricted stock units in accordance with the terms of his restricted stock unit agreement. Amortization of IntangiblesDuring fiscal 2014, we recognized approximately $26.0 million of amortization expense within operating expenses of which approximately $25.9 million related to the $665.5 million of amortizable intangible assets acquired as a result of the Acquisition.These amortizable intangible assets are being amortized on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful lives.Special ChargesWe monitor global macroeconomic conditions on an ongoing basis, and continue to assess opportunities for improved operational effectiveness and efficiency and better alignment of expenses with revenues. As a result of these assessments, we have undertaken various restructuring actions over the past several years. The expense reductions relating to ongoing actions are described below.During fiscal 2008 through fiscal 2011, we recorded special charges of approximately $45.5 million. These special charges included: $41.3 million for severance and fringe benefit costs in accordance with our ongoing benefit plan or statutory requirements at foreign locations for 245 manufacturing employees and 495 engineering and SMG&A employees; $2.1 million for lease obligation costs for facilities that we ceased using during the first quarter of fiscal 2009; $0.8 million for the write-off of property, plant and equipment; $0.5 million for contract termination costs and $0.3 million for clean-up and closure costs that were expensed as incurred; and $0.5 million related to the impairment of intellectual property. This action resulted in estimated annual cost savings of approximately $56.0 million. We have terminated the employment of all employees associated with these actions. During fiscal 2012, we recorded special charges of approximately $8.4 million. These special charges included: $7.9 million for severance and fringe benefit costs in accordance with our ongoing benefit plan or statutory requirements at foreign locations for 95 manufacturing, engineering and SMG&A employees; $0.2 million for lease obligation costs for facilities that we ceased using during the third quarter of fiscal 2012; $0.1 million for contract termination costs; and $0.2 million for the 29write-off of property, plant and equipment. These actions resulted in estimated annual cost savings of approximately $12.0 million. We have terminated the employment of all employees associated with these actions. During fiscal 2013, we recorded special charges of approximately $29.8 million for severance and fringe benefit costs in accordance with our ongoing benefit plan or statutory requirements at foreign locations for 235 engineering and SMG&A employees. As of November 1, 2014, the Company still employed 2 of the 235 employees included in this cost reduction action. These employees must continue to be employed by the Company until their employment is involuntarily terminated in order to receive the severance benefit. This action resulted in annual cost savings of approximately $32.6 million.During fiscal 2014, we recorded special charges of approximately $37.3 million. These special charges included $37.9 million for severance and fringe benefit costs in accordance with our ongoing benefit plan or statutory requirements at foreign locations for 341 manufacturing, engineering and SMG&A employees; $0.5 million for lease obligations costs for facilities that we ceased using during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2014; and $0.4 million for the impairment of assets that have no future use located at closed facilities. We reversed approximately $1.4 million of our severance accrual related to charges taken in fiscal 2013, primarily due to severance costs being lower than our estimates. As of November 1, 2014, the Company still employed 311 of the 341 employees included in these cost reduction actions. These employees must continue to be employed by the Company until their employment is involuntarily terminated in order to receive the severance benefit. We expect these actions will result in estimated annual cost savings of approximately $46.2 million, once fully implemented. We expect that annual cost savings resulting from these actions will be used to make additional investments in products that we expect will drive revenue growth in the future.

Interest and fees related to the 90-day term loan facility used to fund the Acquisition caused our interest expense to increase year-over-year from fiscal 2013. 30The year-over-year increase in nonoperating income in fiscal 2013 as compared to fiscal 2012 was primarily the result of recognizing a gain of $85.4 million from the sale of a product line, as more fully described below under the heading Divestitures, partially offset by the net loss on extinguishment of debt of approximately $10.2 million in conjunction with the redemption of our $375 million aggregate principal amount of 5.0% senior unsecured notes in fiscal 2013 as more fully described below under the heading Liquidity and Capital Resources.Provision for Income Taxes Change Fiscal Year 2014 over 2013 2013 over 2012 2014 2013 2012 $ Change % Change $ Change % ChangeProvision for Income Taxes$100,025 $141,836 $162,297 $(41,811) (29)% $(20,461) (13)%Effective Income Tax Rate13.7% 17.4% 19.9% Our effective tax rate reflects the applicable tax rate in effect in the various tax jurisdictions around the world where our income is earned.The tax rate for all periods presented was below the U.S. federal statutory tax rate of 35%, primarily due to lower statutory tax rates applicable to our operations in the foreign jurisdictions in which we earn income. Income from non-U.S. jurisdictions accounted for approximately 78% of our total revenues for fiscal 2014, resulting in a material portion of our pretax income being earned and taxed outside the U.S., primarily in Bermuda and Ireland, at rates ranging from 0% to 35%. The impact on our provision for income taxes of income earned in foreign jurisdictions being taxed at rates different than the U.S. statutory rate was a benefit of approximately $179.3 million and a foreign effective tax rate of approximately 8.7% in fiscal 2014 compared to a benefit of approximately $162.3 million and a foreign effective tax rate of approximately 11.4% for fiscal 2013. A reduction in the ratio of domestic taxable income to worldwide taxable income effectively lowers the overall tax rate, due to the fact that the tax rates in the majority of foreign jurisdictions where we earn income are significantly lower than the U.S. statutory rate. In addition, our effective income tax rate can be impacted each year by discrete factors or events. Our effective tax rate for fiscal 2014 was not significantly impacted by discrete items. Our effective tax rate for fiscal 2013 was lower by approximately 3% due to $6.6 million recorded as a result of the reversal of certain prior period tax liabilities and a tax benefit of $6.3 million from the reinstatement of the U.S. federal research and development tax credit in January 2013 retroactive to January 1, 2012.The decrease in our effective tax rate for fiscal 2013 compared to fiscal 2012 was primarily due to income earned in lower tax rate jurisdictions as a result of an international tax restructuring effective January 1, 2013. In addition, our effective tax rate for fiscal 2013 was lower by approximately 3% as a result of various discrete items including the reinstatement of the U.S. federal research and development tax credit and the reversal of certain prior period tax liabilities. These decreases in our effective tax rate were partially offset by the recording of a tax reserve of $36.5 million related to one open tax matter related to Section 965 of the Internal Revenue Code which increased our effective tax rate by approximately 5%, and the tax effect of the gain on the sale of a product line in fiscal 2013, which increased our effective tax rate by approximately 3%.

Divestitures On October 31, 2013, we completed the sale of the assets and intellectual property related to our microphone product line to InvenSense, Inc. (InvenSense). We received $100.0 million in cash for the assets and intellectual property and after providing for the write-off of inventory, fixed assets and other costs incurred to complete the transaction, recorded a net gain of $85.4 million in nonoperating income during fiscal 2013. We have agreed to provide InvenSense with various transition services subsequent to the closing. The sale of the assets and intellectual property related to the microphone product line did not qualify as a discontinued operation as it was not considered to be a component of the Company per the applicable guidance. AcquisitionsOn July 22, 2014, we completed our acquisition of Hittite (the Acquisition), a company that designs and develops high performance integrated circuits, modules, subsystems and instrumentation for radio frequency, microwave and millimeterwave applications. The total consideration paid to acquire Hittite was approximately $2.4 billion, financed through a combination of existing cash on hand and a 90-day term loan facility of $2.0 billion. We recognized assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their estimated fair values at the date of acquisition, resulting in the recognition of $1.4 billion of goodwill and $666.4 million of intangible assets, including $0.9 million of in-process research and development intangible assets. We recognized approximately $41.2 million of transaction-related costs, including legal, accounting, severance, debt financing, interest and other related fees that were expensed in fiscal 2014. These costs are included in the consolidated statements of income in operating expenses within SMG&A expenses as well as non-operating expenses. This acquisition resulted in the creation of a new operating segment. We continue to operate and track our results in one reportable segment based on the aggregation of six operating segments.The following unaudited pro forma consolidated financial information presents our combined results of operations after giving effect to the Acquisition and assumes that the Acquisition, which closed on July 22, 2014, was completed on November 4, 2012 (the first day of the Company’s 2013 fiscal year). The pro forma consolidated financial information has been calculated after applying our accounting policies and includes adjustments for amortization expense of acquired intangible assets, transaction-related costs, increase in cost of sales for inventory acquired and depreciation of property, plant and equipment, and interest expense for the debt incurred to fund the Acquisition, together with the consequential tax effects. These pro forma results have been prepared for comparative purposes only and do not purport to be indicative of our operating results that would have been achieved had the Acquisition actually taken place on November 4, 2012. In addition, these results are not intended to be a projection of future results and do not reflect events that may occur after the Acquisition, including but not limited to revenue enhancements, cost savings or operating synergies that the combined Company may achieve as a result of the Acquisition.

The balance of our cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments was held outside the United States in various foreign subsidiaries. As we intend toreinvest our foreign earnings indefinitely, this cash held outside the United States is not available to meet certain aspects of our cash requirements in the United States, including cash dividends and common stock repurchases. If these funds are needed for U.S. operations or can no longer be permanently reinvested outside the United States, the Company would be required to accrue and pay U.S. taxes to repatriate these funds. Our cash and cash equivalents consist of highly liquid investments with maturities of three months or less at the time of acquisition, including money market funds, and our short-term investments consist primarily of corporate obligations, such as commercial paper and floating rate notes, bonds and bank time deposits. We 32maintain these balances with high credit quality counterparties, continually monitor the amount of credit exposure to any one issuer and diversify our investments in order to minimize our credit risk.We believe that our existing sources of liquidity and cash expected to be generated from future operations, together with existing and anticipated available long-term financing, will be sufficient to fund operations, capital expenditures, research and development efforts, dividend payments (if any) and repurchases of our stock (if any) under our stock repurchase program in the immediate future and for at least the next twelve months. Fiscal Year 2014 2013 2012 Net Cash Provided by Operations$871,602 $912,345 $814,542 Net Cash Provided by Operations as a % of Revenue30.4% 34.6% 30.2% Net Cash Used for Investing Activities$(114,751) $(949,926) $(1,339,690) Net Used for Financing Activities$(576,610) $(100,557) $(349,627) At November 1, 2014, cash and cash equivalents totaled $569.2 million. The following changes contributed to the net increase in cash and cash equivalents of $177.1 million in fiscal 2014.Operating Activities During fiscal 2014, we generated cash from operating activities of $871.6 million, a decrease of $40.7 million compared to the $912.3 million generated in fiscal 2013. Results of operations, after non-cash adjustments to net income, contributed $739.2 million compared to a contribution of $731.5 million for the year ended November 2, 2013. The contribution by results of operations was offset by changes in net cash inflows from working capital changes.Investing Activities During fiscal 2014, cash used for investing activities included $1.9 billion of cash payments, net of cash acquired, in connection with the Acquisition, $2.0 billion for the net purchases of available-for-sale short term investments and $177.9 million for property, plant and equipment additions.Financing Activities During fiscal 2014, cash used for financing activities included, proceeds of $200.1 million from employee stock option exercises. We distributed $454.2 million to our shareholders in dividend payments and paid $356.3 million for the repurchase of 7.2 million shares of our common stock.Working Capital Fiscal Year 2014 2013 $ Change% ChangeAccounts Receivable$396,605 $325,144 $71,46122%Days Sales Outstanding*44 44 Inventory$367,927 $283,337 $84,59030%Days Cost of Sales in Inventory*102 111 _______________________________________*We use the annualized fourth quarter revenue in our calculation of days sales outstanding and we use the annualized fourth quarter cost of sales in our calculation of days cost of sales in inventory.The increase in accounts receivable was primarily the result of accounts receivable acquired as part of the Acquisition and higher product shipments in the final month of fiscal 2014 as compared to the final month of fiscal 2013. Overall, our days in sales outstanding remained consistent year-over-year. Inventory as of November 1, 2014 increased as compared to the end of the fourth quarter of fiscal 2013 primarily as a result of inventory acquired as part of the Acquisition and increased manufacturing production to support anticipated higher 33sales demand. Our inventory levels are impacted by our need to support forecasted sales demand and variations between those forecasts and actual demand. Days cost of sales in inventory decreased from 111 days at the end of the fourth quarter of fiscal 2013 to 102 days at the end of fiscal 2014, as a result of recording approximately $53.6 million of additional cost related to the sale of acquired inventory written up to fair value as a result of the Acquisition. We expect days cost of sales in inventory to return to normal levels in the first quarter of fiscal 2015.Current liabilities increased to $709.1 million at November 1, 2014 from $570.5 million recorded at the end of fiscal 2013 primarily due to increases in accrued salaries, benefits and severance including amounts related to the Acquisition and, to a lesser extent, an increase in deferred income on shipments to distributors, more fully described below.As of November 1, 2014 and November 2, 2013, we had gross deferred revenue of $349.7 million and $309.2 million, respectively, and gross deferred cost of sales of $71.3 million and $61.8 million, respectively. Deferred income on shipments to distributors increased in fiscal 2014 primarily as a result of higher demand for products, as well as the Acquisition and, to a lesser, extent a mix shift in favor of higher margin products sold into the channel. Sales to distributors are made under agreements that allow distributors to receive price-adjustment credits and to return qualifying products for credit, as determined by us, in order to reduce the amounts of slow-moving, discontinued or obsolete product from their inventory. Given the uncertainties associated with the levels of price-adjustment credits to be granted to distributors, the sales price to the distributors is not fixed or determinable until the distributors resell the products to their customers. Therefore, we defer revenue recognition from sales to distributors until the distributors have sold the products to their customers. The amount of price-adjustments is dependent on future overall market conditions, and therefore the levels of these adjustments could fluctuate significantly from period to period. To the extent that we experience a significant increase in the amount of credits we issue to our distributors, there could be a material impact on the ultimate revenue and gross margin recognized relating to these transactions. DebtAs of November 1, 2014, we had $872.8 million of carrying value outstanding on our long term debt. The difference in the carrying value of the debt and the principal amount of the debt is due to the unamortized discount on these instruments that will accrete to the face value of the debt over the term of the debt. Our debt obligations consist of the following:$375.0 million aggregate principal amount of 3.0% senior unsecured notesOn April 4, 2011, we issued $375.0 million aggregate principal amount of 3.0% senior unsecured notes due April 15, 2016 (the 2016 Notes) with semi-annual fixed interest payments due on April 15 and October 15 of each year, commencing October 15, 2011.$500.0 million aggregate principal amount of 2.875% senior unsecured notesOn June 3, 2013, we issued $500.0 million aggregate principal amount of 2.875% senior unsecured notes due June 1, 2023 (the 2023 Notes) with semi-annual fixed interest payments due on June 1 and December 1 of each year, commencing December 1, 2013.The indentures governing the 2016 Notes and the 2023 Notes contain covenants that may limit our ability to: incur, create, assume or guarantee any debt for borrowed money secured by a lien upon a principal property; enter into sale and lease-back transactions with respect to a principal property; and consolidate with or merge into, or transfer or lease all or substantially all of our assets to, any other party. As of November 1, 2014, we were compliant with these covenants. See Note 16 in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements contained in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further information on our outstanding debt.Revolving Credit FacilityDuring December 2012, we terminated our $165.0 million unsecured revolving credit facility with certain institutional lenders entered into in May 2008. On December 19, 2012, we entered into a five-year, $500.0 million senior unsecured revolving credit facility with certain institutional lenders. To date, we have not borrowed under this credit facility but we may borrow in the future and use the proceeds for repayment of existing indebtedness, stock repurchases, acquisitions, capital expenditures, working capital and other lawful corporate purposes. The terms of the facility impose restrictions on our ability to undertake certain transactions, to create certain liens on assets and to incur certain subsidiary indebtedness. In addition, the credit agreement contains a consolidated leverage ratio covenant of total consolidated funded debt to consolidated earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA) of not greater than 3.0 to 1.0. As of November 1, 2014, we were compliant with these covenants.$145.0 million term loan facility34On December 22, 2010, Analog Devices Holdings B.V., our wholly owned subsidiary, entered into a credit agreement with Bank of America, N.A., London Branch as administrative agent. The borrower's obligations were guaranteed by us. The credit agreement provided for a $145.0 million term loan facility, which was set to mature on December 22, 2013. During the first quarter of fiscal 2013, we repaid the remaining outstanding principal balance on the loan of $60.1 million and the credit agreement was terminated. $375.0 million aggregate principal amount of 5.0% senior unsecured notesDuring the third quarter of fiscal 2013, we redeemed our outstanding 5.0% senior unsecured notes which were due on July 1, 2014 (the 2014 Notes). The redemption price was 104.744% of the principal amount of the 2014 Notes. We recognized a net loss on the debt extinguishment of approximately $10.2 million recorded in other, net expense within nonoperating (income) expense. The loss was comprised of the make-whole premium of $17.8 million paid to bondholders on the 2014 Notes in accordance with the terms of the 2014 Notes, the recognition of the remaining $8.6 million of unamortized proceeds received from the termination of the interest rate swap associated with the debt, and the write-off of approximately $1.0 million of debt issuance and discount costs that remained to be amortized. The write-off of the remaining unamortized portion of debt issuance costs, discount and swap proceeds are reflected in our consolidated statements of cash flows within operating activities, and the make-whole premium is reflected within financing activities. $2.0 billion term loan facilityOn July 22, 2014, we entered into a 90-day term loan facility in an aggregate principal amount of $2.0 billion with Credit Suisse AG, as Administrative Agent, and each lender from time to time party thereto (the Term Loan Agreement) to finance the Acquisition. On August 29, 2014, we repaid in full the outstanding principal balance due under the Term Loan Agreement.Stock Repurchase ProgramOur common stock repurchase program has been in place since August 2004. In the aggregate, our Board of Directors have authorized us to repurchase $5.6 billion of our common stock under the program. Under the program, we may repurchase outstanding shares of our common stock from time to time in the open market and through privately negotiated transactions. Unless terminated earlier by resolution of our Board of Directors, the repurchase program will expire when we have repurchased all shares authorized under the program. As of November 1, 2014, we had repurchased a total of approximately 137.0 million shares of our common stock for approximately $4.8 billion under this program. As of November 1, 2014, an additional $748.2 million worth of shares remains available for repurchase under the current authorized program. The repurchased shares are held as authorized but unissued shares of common stock. We also from time to time repurchase shares in settlement of employee minimum tax withholding obligations due upon the vesting of restricted stock units or the exercise of stock options. Any future common stock repurchases will be based on several factors, including our financial performance, outlook, liquidity and the amount of cash we have available in the United States. Capital ExpendituresNet additions to property, plant and equipment were $177.9 million in fiscal 2014 and were funded with a combination of cash on hand and cash generated from operations. We expect capital expenditures for fiscal 2015 to be in the range of $150 million to $165 million, of which approximately $20 million relates to new facilities and upgrades to existing facilities. These capital expenditures will be funded with a combination of cash on hand and cash generated from operations. DividendsOn November 24, 2014, our Board of Directors declared a cash dividend of $0.37 per outstanding share of common stock. The dividend will be paid on December 16, 2014 to all shareholders of record at the close of business on December 5, 2014 and is expected to total approximately $115.1 million. We currently expect quarterly dividends to continue at $0.37 per share, although they remain subject to determination and declaration by our Board of Directors. The payment of future dividends, if any, will be based on several factors, including our financial performance, outlook and liquidity. 35 Contractual ObligationsThe table below summarizes our contractual obligations and the amounts we owe under these contracts in specified periods as of November 1, 2014: Payment due by period Less than More than(thousands) Total 1 Year 1-3 Years 3-5 Years 5 YearsContractual obligations: Operating leases (a) $52,293 $22,781 $22,278 $6,781 $453Debt obligations 875,000 — 375,000 — 500,000Interest payments associated with long-term debt obligations 146,250 25,625 34,375 28,750 57,500Deferred compensation plan (b) 21,393 283 — — 21,110Pension funding (c) 15,763 15,763 — — —Total $1,110,699 $64,452 $431,653 $35,531 $579,063_______________________________________(a)Certain of our operating lease obligations include escalation clauses. These escalating payment requirements are reflected in the table.(b)These payments relate to obligations under our deferred compensation plan. The deferred compensation plan allows certain members of management and other highly-compensated employees and non-employee directors to defer receipt of all or any portion of their compensation. The amount in the “More than 5 Years” column of the table represents the remaining total balance under the deferred compensation plan to be paid to participants who have not terminated employment. Since we cannot reasonably estimate the timing of withdrawals for participants who have not yet terminated employment, we have included the future obligation to these participants in the “More than 5 Years” column of the table.(c)Our funding policy for our foreign defined benefit plans is consistent with the local requirements of each country. The payment obligations in the table are estimates of our expected contributions to these plans for fiscal year 2015. The actual future payments may differ from the amounts presented in the table and reasonable estimates of payments beyond one year are not practical because of potential future changes in variables, such as plan asset performance, interest rates and the rate of increase in compensation levels.Purchase orders for the purchase of raw materials and other goods and services are not included in the table above. We are not able to determine the total amount of these purchase orders that represent contractual obligations, as purchase orders may represent authorizations to purchase rather than binding agreements. In addition, our purchase orders generally allow for cancellation without significant penalties. We do not have significant agreements for the purchase of raw materials or other goods specifying minimum quantities or set prices that exceed our expected short-term requirements.Our 2014 acquisition of Metroic Limited and our 2011 acquisition of Lyric Semiconductor, Inc. involve the potential payment of contingent consideration. The table above does not reflect any such obligations, which could be up to $5.0 million, as the timing and amounts are uncertain. See Note 6 in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements contained in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for more information regarding our acquisitions.As of November 1, 2014, our total liabilities associated with deferred taxes and uncertain tax positions was $70.6 million, which are included in “Other non-current liabilities” in our consolidated balance sheet contained in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Due to the complexity associated with our deferred taxes and tax uncertainties, we cannot make a reasonably reliable estimate of the period in which we expect to settle the non-current liabilities associated with these deferred taxes and uncertain tax positions. Therefore, we have not included these deferred taxes and uncertain tax positions in the above contractual obligations table.The expected timing of payments and the amounts of the obligations discussed above are estimated based on current information available as of November 1, 2014.Off-balance Sheet FinancingAs of November 1, 2014, we had no off-balance sheet financing arrangements.36New Accounting PronouncementsFrom time to time, new accounting pronouncements are issued by the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) and are adopted by us as of the specified effective date. Unless otherwise discussed, management believes that the impact of recently issued standards will not have a material impact on our future financial condition and results of operations. See Note 2t, New Accounting Pronouncements, of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements contained in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for a description of recently issued and adopted accounting pronouncements, including the dates of adoption and impact on our historical financial condition and results of operations.Revenue RecognitionIn May 2014, the FASB issued ASU No. 2014-09 (ASU 2014-09), Revenue from Contracts with Customers, which supersedes nearly all existing revenue recognition guidance under U.S. GAAP. The core principle of ASU 2014-09 is that an entity should recognize revenue to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. Additionally, the guidance requires improved disclosures to help users of financial statements better understand the nature, amount, timing, and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows arising from contracts with customers. ASU 2014-09 is effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2016, including interim periods within that reporting period, which is the Company’s first quarter of fiscal 2018. Early application is not permitted. The guidance allows for the amendment to be applied either retrospectively to each prior reporting period presented or retrospectively as a cumulative-effect adjustment as of the date of adoption. The Company is in the process of evaluating the impact of adoption on its consolidated financial statements.Critical Accounting Policies and EstimatesManagement’s discussion and analysis of the financial condition and results of operations is based upon the consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue and expenses, and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. We base our estimates and judgments on historical experience, knowledge of current conditions and beliefs of what could occur in the future based on available information. We consider the following accounting policies to be both those most important to the portrayal of our financial condition and those that require the most subjective judgment. If actual results differ significantly from management’s estimates and projections, there could be a material effect on our financial statements. We also have other policies that we consider key accounting policies, such as our policy for revenue recognition, including the deferral of revenue on sales to distributors until the products are sold to the end user; however, the application of these policies does not require us to make significant estimates or judgments that are difficult or subjective.Revenue RecognitionRevenue from product sales to customers is generally recognized when title passes, which is upon shipment in the U.S. and for certain foreign counties. Shipments to other foreign countries is subsequent to product shipment. Title for these shipments to these other foreign countries ordinarily passes within a week of shipment. Accordingly, we defer the revenue recognized relating to these other foreign countries until title has passed. For multiple element arrangements, we allocate arrangement consideration among the elements based on the relative fair values of those elements as determined using vendor-specific objective evidence or third-party evidence. We use our best estimate of selling price to allocate arrangement consideration between the deliverables in cases where neither vendor-specific objective evidence nor third-party evidence is available. A reserve for sales returns and allowances for customers is recorded based on historical experience or specific identification of an event necessitating a reserve. Revenue from contracts with the United States government, government prime contractors and some commercial customers is generally recorded on a percentage of completion basis, using either units delivered or costs incurred as the measurement basis for progress toward completion. The output measure is used to measure results directly and is generally the best measure of progress toward completion in circumstances in which a reliable measure of output can be established. Estimated revenue in excess of amounts billed is reported as unbilled receivables. Contract accounting requires judgment in estimating costs and assumptions related to technical issues and delivery schedule. Contract costs include material, subcontract costs, labor and an allocation of indirect costs. The estimation of costs at completion of a contract is subject to numerous variables involving contract costs and estimates as to the length of time to complete the contract. Changes in contract performance, estimated gross margin, including the impact of final contract settlements, and estimated losses are recognized in the period in which the changes or losses are determined. 37Inventory ValuationWe value inventories at the lower of cost (first-in, first-out method) or market. Because of the cyclical nature of the semiconductor industry, changes in inventory levels, obsolescence of technology, and product life cycles, we write down inventories to net realizable value. We employ a variety of methodologies to determine the net realizable value of inventory. While a portion of the calculation is determined via reference to the age of inventory and lower of cost or market calculations, an element of the calculation is subject to significant judgments made by us about future demand for our inventory. If actual demand for our products is less than our estimates, additional adjustments to existing inventories may need to be recorded in future periods. To date, our actual results have not been materially different than our estimates, and we do not expect them to be materially different in the future.Allowance for Doubtful AccountsWe maintain allowances for doubtful accounts, when appropriate, for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments. If the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate, our actual losses may exceed our estimates, and additional allowances would be required. To date, our actual results have not been materially different than our estimates, and we do not expect them to be materially different in the future.Long-Lived AssetsWe review property, plant, and equipment and finite lived intangible assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of assets may not be recoverable. Recoverability of these assets is determined by comparison of their carrying value to future undiscounted cash flows that the assets are expected to generate over their remaining economic lives. If such assets are considered to be impaired, the impairment to be recognized in earnings equals the amount by which the carrying value of the assets exceeds their fair value determined by either a quoted market price, if any, or a value determined by utilizing a discounted cash flow technique. Although we have recognized no material impairment adjustments related to our property, plant, and equipment and identified intangible assets during the past three fiscal years, except those made in conjunction with restructuring actions, deterioration in our business in the future could lead to such impairment adjustments in future periods. Evaluation of impairment of long-lived assets requires estimates of future operating results that are used in the preparation of the expected future undiscounted cash flows. Actual future operating results and the remaining economic lives of our long-lived assets could differ from the estimates used in assessing the recoverability of these assets. These differences could result in impairment charges, which could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations. In addition, in certain instances, assets may not be impaired but their estimated useful lives may have decreased. In these situations, we amortize the remaining net book values over the revised useful lives. We review indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment annually, on the first day of the fourth quarter (on or about August 1) or more frequently if indicators of impairment exist. The Company performs a qualitative assessment on its indefinite-lived intangible assets to determine whether it is more likely-than not that the indefinite-lived intangible asset is impaired. If it is determined that the fair value of the indefinite-lived intangible asset is less than the carrying value, the Company would compare the fair value of the intangible asset with its carrying amount and recognize into earnings any amount by which the carrying value of the assets exceeds the fair value.GoodwillGoodwill is subject to annual impairment tests or more frequently if indicators of potential impairment exist and suggest that the carrying value of goodwill may not be recoverable from estimated discounted future cash flows. We test goodwill for impairment at the reporting unit level (operating segment or one level below an operating segment) on an annual basis in the fourth quarter (on or about August 1) or more frequently if we believe indicators of impairment exist. For our latest annual impairment assessment which occurred on August 3, 2014, we identified our reporting units to be our six operating segments, which meet the aggregation criteria for one reportable segment. The performance of the test involves a two-step process. The first step of the impairment test involves comparing the fair values of the applicable reporting units with their aggregate carrying values, including goodwill. We generally determine the fair value of our reporting units using the income approach methodology of valuation that includes the discounted cash flow method as well as other generally accepted valuation methodologies, which requires significant judgment by management. If the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds the reporting unit’s fair value, we perform the second step of the goodwill impairment test to determine the amount of impairment loss. The second step of the goodwill impairment test involves comparing the implied fair value of the affected reporting unit’s goodwill with the carrying value of that goodwill. These impairment tests may result in impairment losses that could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations.38Business CombinationsUnder the acquisition method of accounting, we recognize tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their estimated fair values. We record the excess of the fair value of the purchase price over the value of the net assets acquired as goodwill. The accounting for business combinations requires us to make significant estimates and assumptions, especially with respect to intangible assets and the fair value of contingent payment obligations. Critical estimates in valuing purchased technology, customer lists and other identifiable intangible assets include future cash flows that we expect to generate from the acquired assets. If the subsequent actual results and updated projections of the underlying business activity change compared with the assumptions and projections used to develop these values, we could experience impairment charges which could be material. In addition, we have estimated the economic lives of certain acquired assets and these lives are used to calculate depreciation and amortization expense. If our estimates of the economic lives change, depreciation or amortization expenses could be accelerated or slowed.We record contingent consideration resulting from a business combination at its fair value on the acquisition date. We generally determine the fair value of the contingent consideration using the income approach methodology of valuation. Each reporting period thereafter, we revalue these obligations and record increases or decreases in their fair value as an adjustment to operating expenses within the consolidated statement of income. Changes in the fair value of the contingent consideration can result from changes in assumed discount periods and rates, and from changes pertaining to the achievement of the defined milestones. Significant judgment is employed in determining the appropriateness of these assumptions as of the acquisition date and for each subsequent period. Accordingly, future business and economic conditions, as well as changes in any of the assumptions described above, can materially impact the amount of contingent consideration expense we record in any given period.Accounting for Income TaxesWe must make certain estimates and judgments in determining income tax expense for financial statement purposes. These estimates and judgments occur in the calculation of tax credits, benefits, and deductions, and in the calculation of certain tax assets and liabilities, which arise from differences in the timing of the recognition of revenue and expense for tax and financial statement purposes, as well as the interest and penalties relating to these uncertain tax positions. We assessed the likelihood of the realization of deferred tax assets and concluded that a valuation allowance is needed to reserve the amount of the deferred tax assets that may not be realized due to the uncertainty of the timing and amount of the realization of certain state credit carryovers. In reaching our conclusion, we evaluated certain relevant criteria including the existence of deferred tax liabilities that can be used to realize deferred tax assets, the taxable income in prior carryback years in the impacted state jurisdictions that can be used to absorb net operating losses and taxable income in future years. Our judgments regarding future profitability may change due to future market conditions, changes in U.S. or international tax laws and other factors. These changes, if any, may require material adjustments to these deferred tax assets, resulting in a reduction in net income or an increase in net loss in the period when such determinations are made, which in turn, may result in an increase or decrease to our tax provision in a subsequent period.We account for uncertain tax positions by determining if it is “more likely than not” that a tax position will be sustained by the appropriate taxing authorities prior to recording any benefit in the financial statements. An uncertain income tax position is not recognized if it has less than a 50% likelihood of being sustained. For those tax positions where it is more likely than not that a tax benefit will be sustained, we have recorded the largest amount of tax benefit with a greater than 50% likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement with a taxing authority that has full knowledge of all relevant information. For those income tax positions where it is not more likely than not that a tax benefit will be sustained, no tax benefit has been recognized in the financial statements. We reevaluate these uncertain tax positions on a quarterly basis. This evaluation is based on factors including, but not limited to, changes in known facts or circumstances, changes in tax law, effectively settled issues under audit, and new audit activity. A change in these factors would result in the recognition of a tax benefit or an additional charge to the tax provision.In the ordinary course of global business, there are many transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax outcome is uncertain. Some of these uncertainties arise as a consequence of cost reimbursement and royalty arrangements among related entities. Although we believe our estimates are reasonable, no assurance can be given that the final tax outcome of these matters will not be different than that which is reflected in our historical income tax provisions and accruals. In the event our assumptions are incorrect, the differences could have a material impact on our income tax provision and operating results in the period in which such determination is made. In addition to the factors described above, our current and expected effective tax rate is based on then-current tax law. Significant changes during the year in enacted tax law could affect these estimates.39Stock-Based CompensationStock-based compensation expense associated with stock options and related awards is recognized in the consolidated statements of income. Determining the amount of stock-based compensation to be recorded requires us to develop estimates to be used in calculating the grant-date fair value of stock options. We calculate the grant-date fair values using the Black-Scholes valuation model. The use of valuation models requires us to make estimates of the following items:Expected volatility — We are responsible for estimating volatility and have considered a number of factors, including third-party estimates, when estimating volatility. We currently believe that the exclusive use of implied volatility results in the best estimate of the grant-date fair value of employee stock options because it reflects the market’s current expectations of future volatility. In evaluating the appropriateness of exclusively relying on implied volatility, we concluded that: (1) options in our common stock are actively traded with sufficient volume on several exchanges; (2) the market prices of both the traded options and the underlying shares are measured at a similar point in time to each other and on a date close to the grant date of the employee share options; (3) the traded options have exercise prices that are both near-the-money and close to the exercise price of the employee share options; and (4) the remaining maturities of the traded options used to estimate volatility are at least one year.Expected term — We use historical employee exercise and option expiration data to estimate the expected term assumption for the Black-Scholes grant-date valuation. We believe that this historical data is currently the best estimate of the expected term of a new option, and that generally, all of our employees exhibit similar exercise behavior. In general, the longer the expected term used in the Black-Scholes valuation model, the higher the grant-date fair value of the option.Risk-free interest rate — The yield on zero-coupon U.S. Treasury securities for a period that is commensurate with the expected term assumption is used as the risk-free interest rate.Expected dividend yield — Expected dividend yield is calculated by annualizing the cash dividend declared by our Board of Directors for the current quarter and dividing that result by the closing stock price on the date of grant of the option. Until such time as our Board of Directors declares a cash dividend for an amount that is different from the current quarter’s cash dividend, the current dividend will be used in deriving this assumption. Cash dividends are not paid on options, restricted stock or restricted stock units.The amount of stock-based compensation expense recognized during a period is based on the value of the portion of the awards that are ultimately expected to vest. Forfeitures are estimated at the time of grant and revised, if necessary, in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates. The term “forfeitures” is distinct from “cancellations” or “expirations” and represents only the unvested portion of the surrendered option. Based on an analysis of our historical forfeitures, we have applied an annual forfeiture rate of 4.4% to all unvested stock-based awards as of November 1, 2014. This analysis is re-evaluated quarterly and the forfeiture rate is adjusted as necessary. Ultimately, the actual expense recognized over the vesting period will only be for those awards that vest.ContingenciesFrom time to time, we receive demands from third parties alleging that our products or manufacturing processes infringe the patent or intellectual property rights of these parties. We periodically assess each matter to determine if a contingent liability should be recorded. In making this determination, we may, depending on the nature of the matter, consult with internal and external legal counsel and technical experts. Based on the information we obtain, combined with our judgment regarding all the facts and circumstances of each matter, we determine whether it is probable that a contingent loss may be incurred and whether the amount of such loss can be reasonably estimated. If a loss is probable and reasonably estimable, we record a contingent loss. In determining the amount of a contingent loss, we consider advice received from experts in the specific matter, current status of legal proceedings, settlement negotiations that may be ongoing, prior case history and other factors. If the judgments and estimates made by us are incorrect, we may need to record additional contingent losses that could materially adversely impact our results of operations.Post-Retirement Benefits We have significant pension costs and liabilities related to our foreign defined benefit pension plans that are developed from actuarial valuations specific to each country. Inherent in these valuations are key assumptions including discount rates, expected return on plan assets, mortality rates, merit and promotion increases. We are required to consider current market conditions, including changes in interest rates, in making our assumptions. Changes in the related pension costs or liabilities may occur in the future due to changes in our assumptions. Our assumptions as to the expected long-term rates of return on plan assets are based upon the composition of plan assets, historical long-term rates of return on similar assets and current and expected market conditions. The discount rate used for non-U.S. plans reflects the market rate for high-quality fixed-income investments on our annual measurement date, which for fiscal 2014 was November 1, 2014 and is subject to change each year. 40The discount rates used for plans outside the U.S. are based on a combination of relevant indices regarding corporate and government securities, the duration of the liability and appropriate judgment. Net actuarial gains or losses subject to amortization are amortized over the expected average remaining service lifetime to the extent that they exceed 10% of the greater of the projected benefit obligation and market related value of assets. Changes in pension income/costs or assets/liabilities may occur in the future due to changes in the assumptions and changes in asset values. If the actual results and events of our pension plan differ from our current assumptions, our benefit obligations may be over-or under-valued. See the disclosures about pension obligations, the composition of plan assets, assumptions and other matters in Note 13 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements contained in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. We performed a sensitivity analysis on the discount rate and long-term rate of return on assets, which are key assumptions in determining our net periodic post-retirement benefit cost. The table below illustrates the impact of an increase(decrease) of 25 basis points in these assumptions for the year ended November 1, 2014.

QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISKInterest Rate ExposureOur interest income and expense are sensitive to changes in the general level of interest rates. In this regard, changes in interest rates affect the interest earned on our marketable securities and short term investments, as well as the fair value of our investments and debt.Based on our marketable securities and short-term investments outstanding as of November 1, 2014 and November 2, 2013, our annual interest income would change by approximately $29 million and $46 million, respectively, for each 100 basis point increase in interest rates.To provide a meaningful assessment of the interest rate risk associated with our investment portfolio, we performed a sensitivity analysis to determine the impact a change in interest rates would have on the value of our investment portfolio assuming a 100 basis point parallel shift in the yield curve. Based on investment positions as of November 1, 2014 and November 2, 2013, a hypothetical 100 basis point increase in interest rates across all maturities would result in a $7 million and $15 million decline, respectively in the fair market value of the portfolio. Such losses would only be realized if we sold the investments prior to maturity.As of November 1, 2014, we had $875 million in principal amount of senior unsecured notes outstanding, which consisted of $375 million 3% senior unsecured notes (the 2016 Notes), due April 15, 2016 and $500 million 2.875% senior unsecured notes (the 2023 Notes), due June 1, 2023. As of November 1, 2014, a hypothetical 100 basis point increase in market interest rates would reduce the fair value of our 2016 Notes outstanding by approximately $5 million. As of November 1, 2014, a similar increase in market interest rates would reduce the fair value of our 2023 Notes by $35 million. Foreign Currency ExposureAs more fully described in Note 2i in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements contained in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, we regularly hedge our non-U.S. dollar-based exposures by entering into forward foreign currency exchange contracts. The terms of these contracts are for periods matching the duration of the underlying exposure and generally range from one month to twelve months. Currently, our largest foreign currency exposure is the Euro, primarily because our European operations have the highest proportion of our local currency denominated expenses. Relative to foreign currency exposures existing at November 1, 2014 and November 2, 2013, a 10% unfavorable movement in foreign currency exchange rates over the course of the year would result in approximately $8 million of gains and $2 million of losses, respectively, in changes in earnings or cash flows.The market risk associated with our derivative instruments results from currency exchange rates that are expected to offset the market risk of the underlying transactions, assets and liabilities being hedged. The counterparties to the agreements relating to our foreign exchange instruments consist of a number of major international financial institutions with high credit ratings. Based on the credit ratings of our counterparties as of November 1, 2014, we do not believe that there is significant risk of nonperformance by them. While the contract or notional amounts of derivative financial instruments provide one measure of 41the volume of these transactions, they do not represent the amount of our exposure to credit risk. The amounts potentially subject to credit risk (arising from the possible inability of counterparties to meet the terms of their contracts) are generally limited to the amounts, if any, by which the counterparties’ obligations under the contracts exceed our obligations to the counterparties.The following table illustrates the effect that a 10% unfavorable or favorable movement in foreign currency exchange rates, relative to the U.S. dollar, would have on the fair value of our forward exchange contracts as of November 1, 2014 and November 2, 2013: November 1, 2014 November 2, 2013Fair value of forward exchange contracts (liability) asset$(10,093) $2,267Fair value of forward exchange contracts after a 10% unfavorable movement in foreign currency exchange rates asset$7,918 $22,763Fair value of forward exchange contracts after a 10% favorable movement in foreign currency exchange rates liability$(27,051) $(17,216)The calculation assumes that each exchange rate would change in the same direction relative to the U.S. dollar. In addition to the direct effects of changes in exchange rates, such changes typically affect the volume of sales or the foreign currency sales price as competitors’ products become more or less attractive. Our sensitivity analysis of the effects of changes in foreign currency exchange rates does not factor in a potential change in sales levels or local currency selling prices.42REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRMThe Board of Directors and Shareholders Analog Devices, Inc.We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Analog Devices, Inc. as of November 1, 2014 and November 2, 2013, and the related consolidated statements of income, comprehensive income, shareholders’ equity, and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended November 1, 2014.

The total consideration paid to acquire Hittite was approximately $2.4 billion, financed through a combination of existing cash on hand and a 90-day term loan facility of $2.0 billion. The acquisition of Hittite is referred to as the Acquisition. See Note 6, Acquisitions, of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements contained in Item 8 of this Annual Report on From 10-K for further discussion related to the Acquisition.Revenue Trends by End MarketThe following table summarizes revenue by end market. The categorization of revenue by end market is determined using a variety of data points including the technical characteristics of the product, the “sold to” customer information, the “ship to” customer information and the end customer product or application into which our product will be incorporated. As data systems for capturing and tracking this data evolve and improve, the categorization of products by end market can vary over time. When this occurs, we reclassify revenue by end market for prior periods. Such reclassifications typically do not materially change the sizing of, or the underlying trends of results within, each end market. 2015 2014 2013 Revenue % ofTotalProductRevenue Y/Y% Revenue % ofTotalProductRevenue* Revenue % ofTotalProductRevenue*Industrial$1,496,198 44% 11% $1,343,255 47% $1,220,141 46%Automotive526,124 15% —% 525,712 18% 483,771 18%Consumer729,965 21% 123% 327,223 11% 401,368 15%Communications682,805 20% 2% 668,583 23% 528,409 20%Total Revenue$3,435,092 100% 20% $2,864,773 100% $2,633,689 100%*The sum of the individual percentages does not equal the total due to rounding.The year-over-year increase in the industrial and communications end market revenue in fiscal 2015 was the result of the Acquisition. Consumer end market revenue increased in fiscal 2015 as compared to fiscal 2014 as a result of increased demand for products sold into the portable sector of this end market.The year-to-year increase in communications end market revenue in fiscal 2014 was primarily a result of increased wireless base station deployment activity and, to a lesser extent, an increase in revenue as a result of the Acquisition. Industrial end market revenue increased in fiscal 2014 as compared to fiscal 2013 as a result of an increase in demand in this end market, which was most significant for products sold into the instrumentation and automation sectors and, to a lesser extent, an increase in revenue as a result of the Acquisition. The year-to-year increase in automotive end market revenue in fiscal 2014 was primarily a result of increasing electronic content in vehicles and higher demand for new vehicles. The year-to-year decrease in revenue in the consumer end market in fiscal 2014 was primarily the result of the sale of our microphone product line in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2013.26Revenue Trends by Geographic RegionRevenue by geographic region, based upon the primary location of our customers' design activity for its products, for fiscal 2015, 2014 and 2013 was as follows: Change Fiscal Year 2015 over 2014 2014 over 2013 2015 2014 2013 $ Change % Change $ Change % ChangeUnited States$1,325,279 $821,554 $821,269 $503,725 61 % $285 — %Rest of North and South America97,189 96,957 99,215 232 — % (2,258) (2)%Europe939,230 924,477 840,585 14,753 2 % 83,892 10 %Japan319,569 308,054 292,804 11,515 4 % 15,250 5 %China511,365 459,260 349,575 52,105 11 % 109,685 31 %Rest of Asia242,460 254,471 230,241 (12,011) (5)% 24,230 11 %Total Revenue$3,435,092 $2,864,773 $2,633,689 $570,319 20 % $231,084 9 %In fiscal years 2015, 2014 and 2013, the predominant countries comprising “Rest of North and South America” are Canada and Mexico; the predominant countries comprising “Europe” are Germany, Sweden, France and the United Kingdom; and the predominant countries comprising “Rest of Asia” are South Korea and Taiwan.The sales increase in fiscal 2015 as compared to fiscal 2014 in the United States was primarily the result of increased demand for consumer products sold into the portable sector and the Acquisition. The sales increase in fiscal 2015 as compared to fiscal 2014 in Europe was primarily the result of the Acquisition, partially offset by a decrease in demand for products used in wireless base stations. The sales increase in fiscal 2015 as compared to fiscal 2014 in Japan was primarily a result of the Acquisition, partially offset by a decrease in demand for products used in home entertainment. The sales increase in fiscal 2015 as compared to fiscal 2014 in China was primarily a result of the Acquisition. The sales decrease in fiscal 2015 as compared to fiscal 2014 in the Rest of Asia was primarily the result of a decrease in demand in most end markets, partially offset by the Acquisition.On a regional basis, the year-over-year sales increases for fiscal 2014 in most regions were the result of an increase in demand in the communications, industrial and automotive end markets and an increase in revenue as a result of the Acquisition, partially offset by a lower demand for products used in consumer applications.

This expense was partially offset by the improved utilization levels in our manufacturing facilities and, to a lesser extent, a mix shift in favor of higher margin products being sold as a result of the Acquisition.27Research and Development (R&D) Change Fiscal Year 2015 over 2014 2014 over 2013 2015 2014 2013 $ Change % Change $ Change % ChangeR&D Expenses$637,459 $559,686 $513,035 $77,773 14% $46,651 9%R&D Expenses as a % of Revenue18.6% 19.5% 19.5% R&D expenses increased in fiscal 2015 as compared to fiscal 2014 primarily as a result of increases in operational spending resulting from the Acquisition, variable compensation expense linked to our overall profitability and revenue growth and R&D employee and related benefit expenses.R&D expenses increased in fiscal 2014 as compared to fiscal 2013 primarily due to an increase in variable compensation expense linked to our overall profitability and revenue growth, higher R&D employee and related benefit expenses, and a general increase in other operational spending. Approximately $15.0 million of the overall increase year-over-year was a result of the Acquisition. R&D expenses as a percentage of revenue will fluctuate from year-to-year depending on the amount of revenue and the success of new product development efforts, which we view as critical to our future growth. We have hundreds of R&D projects underway, none of which we believe are material on an individual basis. We expect to continue the development of innovative technologies and processes for new products. We believe that a continued commitment to R&D is essential to maintain product leadership with our existing products as well as to provide innovative new product offerings, and therefore, we expect to continue to make significant R&D investments in the future.Selling, Marketing, General and Administrative (SMG&A) Change Fiscal Year 2015 over 2014 2014 over 2013 2015 2014 2013 $ Change % Change $ Change % ChangeSMG&A Expenses$478,972 $454,676 $396,233 $24,296 5% $58,443 15%SMG&A Expenses as a % of Revenue13.9% 15.9% 15.0% SMG&A expenses increased in fiscal 2015 as compared to fiscal 2014 as a result of increases in variable compensation expense linked to our overall profitability and revenue growth, SMG&A employee and related benefit expenses, as well as operational spending resulting from the Acquisition. These increases were partially offset by a decrease in Acquisition-related transition costs and other activity.SMG&A expenses increased in fiscal 2014 as compared to fiscal 2013 primarily due to Acquisition-related transaction costs and other activity of approximately $33.3 million. The remainder of the increases were primarily due to higher variable compensation expense linked to our overall profitability and revenue growth, higher SMG&A employee and related benefit expenses as a result of an increased headcount attributable to the Acquisition and, to a lesser extent, increases in other operational spending. The increases in SMG&A employee and related benefit expenses were partially offset by a lower stock-based compensation expense as fiscal 2013 included $6.3 million related to the accelerated vesting of restricted stock units following the death of the Company's then-CEO in the second quarter of fiscal 2013.Amortization of IntangiblesDuring fiscal 2015, we recognized approximately $88.3 million of amortization expense within operating expense. Approximately $87.8 million of this expense related to the $665.5 million of amortizable intangible assets acquired as a result of the Acquisition. These intangible assets are being amortized on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful lives. During fiscal 2014, we recognized approximately $26.0 million of amortization expense within operating expenses of which approximately $25.9 million related to the $665.5 million of amortizable intangible assets acquired as a result of the Acquisition. These intangible assets are being amortized on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful lives.28Special ChargesWe monitor global macroeconomic conditions on an ongoing basis, and continue to assess opportunities for improved operational effectiveness and efficiency and better alignment of expenses with revenues. As a result of these assessments, we have undertaken various restructuring actions over the past several years. The expense reductions relating to ongoing actions are described below.During fiscal 2014, we recorded special charges of approximately $37.3 million. These special charges included $37.9 million for severance and fringe benefit costs in accordance with our ongoing benefit plan or statutory requirements at foreign locations for 341 manufacturing, engineering and SMG&A employees; $0.5 million for lease obligations costs for facilities that we ceased using during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2014; and $0.4 million for the impairment of assets that have no future use located at closed facilities. We reversed approximately $1.4 million of our severance accrual related to charges taken in fiscal 2013, primarily due to severance costs being lower than our estimates. We terminated the employment of all employees associated with this action. We expect this action will result in estimated annual cost savings of approximately $46.2 million, once fully implemented.During fiscal 2013, we recorded special charges of approximately $29.8 million for severance and fringe benefit costs in accordance with our ongoing benefit plan or statutory requirements at foreign locations for 235 engineering and SMG&A employees. We terminated the employment of all employees associated with this action. This action resulted in annual cost savings of approximately $32.6 million.We expect that annual cost savings resulting from these actions will be used to make additional investments in products that we expect will drive revenue growth in the future. Other Operating Expense During fiscal 2015, we converted the benefits provided to participants in our Irish defined benefits pension plan to benefits provided under our Irish defined contribution plan. Retired pension plan participants received an annuity. As a result, in fiscal 2015 we recorded settlement charges, legal, accounting and other professional fees totaling $223.7 million to settle all existing and future Irish pension plan liabilities.Operating Income Change Fiscal Year 2015 over 2014 2014 over 2013 2015 2014 2013 $ Change % Change $ Change % ChangeOperating income$830,841 $752,484 $753,075 $78,357 10% $(591) — %Operating income as a % of Revenue24.2% 26.3% 28.6% The increase in operating income in fiscal 2015 as compared to fiscal 2014 was primarily the result of an increase in revenue of $570.3 million, a 190 basis point increase in gross margin percentage and a $37.3 million decrease in special charges, partially offset by a $223.7 million increase in other operating expense, a $77.8 million increase in R&D expenses, a $24.3 million increase in SMG&A expenses and a $62.3 million increase in amortization of intangibles more fully described above under the headings Research and Development (R&D), Selling, Marketing, General and Administrative (SMG&A), Amortization of Intangibles, Special Charges and Other Operating Expense.The decrease in operating income in fiscal 2014 as compared to fiscal 2013 was primarily the result of an increase in revenue of $231.1 million , which was offset by a 40 basis point decrease in gross margin percentage, a $46.7 million increase in R&D expenses, a $58.4 million increase in SMG&A expenses, a $25.8 million increase in amortization of intangibles, and a $7.5 million increase in special charges as more fully described above under the headings Research and Development (R&D), Selling, Marketing, General and Administrative (SMG&A), Amortization of Intangibles and Special Charges.29Nonoperating (Income) Expense Change Fiscal Year 2015 over 2014 2014 over 2013 2015 2014 2013 $ Change $ ChangeInterest expense$27,030 $34,784 $27,102 $(7,754) $7,682Interest income(8,625) (12,173) (12,753) 3,548 580Other, net2,322 528 (76,597) 1,794 77,125Total nonoperating (income) expense$20,727 $23,139 $(62,248) $(2,412) $85,387The decrease in nonoperating expense in fiscal 2015 as compared to fiscal 2014 was primarily the result of the repayment of the 90-day term loan facility used to fund the Acquisition in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2014, partially offset by a decrease in interest income primarily as a result of lower cash balances throughout fiscal 2015 as compared to fiscal 2014.The change in nonoperating expense in fiscal 2014 as compared to fiscal 2013 was primarily the result of recognizing other income of $85.4 million from the sale of a product line in fiscal 2013, as more fully described below under the heading Divestitures, partially offset by the net loss on extinguishment of debt of approximately $10.2 million in conjunction with the redemption of our $375 million aggregate principal amount of 5.0% senior unsecured notes in fiscal 2013 as more fully described below under the heading Liquidity and Capital Resources. Interest and fees related to the 90-day term loan facility used to fund the Acquisition caused our interest expense to increase year-over-year from fiscal 2013.Provision for Income Taxes Change Fiscal Year 2015 over 2014 2014 over 2013 2015 2014 2013 $ Change % Change $ Change % ChangeProvision for Income Taxes$113,236 $100,025 $141,836 $13,211 13% $(41,811) (29)%Effective Income Tax Rate14.0% 13.7% 17.4% Our effective tax rate reflects the applicable tax rate in effect in the various tax jurisdictions around the world where our income is earned. The tax rate for all periods presented was below the U.S. federal statutory tax rate of 35%, primarily due to lower statutory tax rates applicable to our operations in the foreign jurisdictions in which we earn income. Income from non-U.S. jurisdictions accounted for approximately 86% of our total revenues for fiscal 2015, resulting in a material portion of our pretax income being earned and taxed outside the U.S., primarily in Bermuda and Ireland, at rates ranging from 0% to 35%. The impact on our provision for income taxes of income earned in foreign jurisdictions being taxed at rates different than the U.S. statutory rate was a benefit of approximately $198.1 million and a foreign effective tax rate of approximately 10.6% in fiscal 2015, compared to a benefit of approximately $179.3 million and a foreign effective tax rate of approximately 7.7% in fiscal 2014. A reduction in the ratio of domestic taxable income to worldwide taxable income effectively lowers the overall tax rate, due to the fact that the tax rates in the majority of foreign jurisdictions where we earn income are significantly lower than the U.S. statutory rate. In addition, our effective income tax rate can be impacted each year by discrete factors or events. Our effective tax rate for fiscal 2015 was reduced as a result of $13.0 million recorded as a result of the reversal of certain prior period tax liabilities, a tax benefit of $7.0 million from the reinstatement of the U.S. federal research and development tax credit in December 2014 retroactive to January 1, 2014 and a tax benefit of $3.8 million as a result of an acquisition accounting adjustment. In addition our effective tax rate for fiscal 2015 included $2.0 million of discrete tax expense items associated with the U.S. provision to return adjustments. Our effective tax rate for fiscal 2014 was not significantly impacted by discrete items.Income from non-U.S. jurisdictions accounted for approximately 78% of our total revenues for fiscal 2014, resulting in a material portion of our pretax income being earned and taxed outside the U.S., primarily in Bermuda and Ireland, at rates ranging from 0% to 35%. The impact on our provision for income taxes of income earned in foreign jurisdictions being taxed at rates different than the U.S. statutory rate was a benefit of approximately $179.3 million and a foreign effective tax rate of approximately 7.7% in fiscal 2014 compared to a benefit of approximately $162.3 million and a foreign effective tax rate of approximately 10.0% for fiscal 2013. A reduction in the ratio of domestic taxable income to worldwide taxable income effectively lowers the overall tax rate, due to the fact that the tax rates in the majority of foreign jurisdictions where we earn income are significantly lower than the U.S. statutory rate. In addition, our effective income tax rate can be impacted each year by discrete factors or events. Our effective tax rate for fiscal 2014 was not significantly impacted by discrete items. Our 30effective tax rate for fiscal 2013 was lower by approximately 3% due to $6.6 million recorded as a result of the reversal of certain prior period tax liabilities and a tax benefit of $6.3 million from the reinstatement of the U.S. federal research and development tax credit in January 2013 retroactive to January 1, 2012.Net Income Change Fiscal Year 2015 over 2014 2014 over 2013 2015 2014 2013 $ Change % Change $ Change % ChangeNet Income$696,878 $629,320 $673,487 $67,558 11% $(44,167) (7)%Net Income, as a % of Revenue20.3% 22.0% 25.6% Diluted EPS$2.20 $1.98 $2.14 $0.22 11% $(0.16) (7)%The increase in net income in fiscal 2015 as compared to fiscal 2014 was primarily a result of the $78.4 million increase in operating income partially offset by the $13.2 million increase in provision for income taxes.The decrease in net income in fiscal 2014 as compared to fiscal 2013 was primarily a result of the $85.4 million decrease in nonoperating income partially offset by the $41.8 million decrease in provision for income taxes.The impact of inflation and foreign currency exchange rate movement on our results of operations during the past three fiscal years has not been significant.DivestituresOn October 31, 2013, we completed the sale of the assets and intellectual property related to our microphone product line to InvenSense, Inc. (InvenSense). We received $100.0 million in cash for the assets and intellectual property and after providing for the write-off of inventory, fixed assets and other costs incurred to complete the transaction, recorded a net gain of $85.4 million in nonoperating income during fiscal 2013. The sale of the assets and intellectual property related to the microphone product line did not qualify as a discontinued operation as it was not considered to be a component of the Company per the applicable guidance.AcquisitionsOn July 22, 2014, we completed our acquisition of Hittite (the Acquisition), a company that designed and developed high performance integrated circuits, modules, subsystems and instrumentation for radio frequency, microwave and millimeterwave applications. The total consideration paid to acquire Hittite was approximately $2.4 billion, financed through a combination of existing cash on hand and a 90-day term loan facility of $2.0 billion. We recognized assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their estimated fair values at the date of acquisition, resulting in the recognition of $1.4 billion of goodwill and $666.4 million of intangible assets, including $0.9 million of in-process research and development intangible assets. We recognized approximately $50.9 million of transaction-related costs, including legal, accounting, severance, debt financing, interest and other related fees of which approximately $9.7 million were expensed in fiscal 2015 and $41.2 million in fiscal 2014. These costs are included in the consolidated statements of income in operating expenses within SMG&A expenses as well as non-operating expenses. The Acquisition resulted in the creation of a new operating segment. We continue to operate and track our results in one reportable segment based on the aggregation of six operating segments.The following unaudited pro forma consolidated financial information presents our combined results of operations after giving effect to the Acquisition and assumes that the Acquisition, which closed on July 22, 2014, was completed on November 4, 2012 (the first day of the Company’s 2013 fiscal year). The pro forma consolidated financial information has been calculated after applying our accounting policies and includes adjustments for amortization expense of acquired intangible assets, transaction-related costs, increase in cost of sales for inventory acquired and depreciation of property, plant and equipment, and interest expense for the debt incurred to fund the Acquisition, together with the consequential tax effects. These pro forma results have been prepared for comparative purposes only and do not purport to be indicative of our operating results that would have been achieved had the Acquisition actually taken place on November 4, 2012. In addition, these results are not intended to be a projection of future results and do not reflect events that may occur after the Acquisition, including but not limited to revenue enhancements, cost savings or operating synergies that the combined Company may achieve as a result of the Acquisition. 31 (thousands, except per share data) November 1, 2014November 2, 2013Revenue $3,075,468$2,907,504Net income $778,049$641,217Basic net income per common share $2.48$2.08Diluted net income per common share $2.44$2.04Liquidity and Capital ResourcesAt October 31, 2015, our principal source of liquidity was $3.0 billion of cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments, of which approximately $657.8 million was held in the United States. The balance of our cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments was held outside the United States in various foreign subsidiaries. As we intend to reinvest our foreign earnings indefinitely, this cash held outside the United States is not available to meet certain aspects of our cash requirements in the United States, including cash dividends and common stock repurchases. If these funds are needed for U.S. operations or can no longer be permanently reinvested outside the United States, we would be required to accrue and pay U.S. taxes to repatriate these funds. Our cash and cash equivalents consist of highly liquid investments with maturities of three months or less at the time of acquisition, including money market funds, and our short-term investments consist primarily of corporate obligations, such as commercial paper and floating rate notes, bonds and bank time deposits. We maintain these balances with high credit quality counterparties, continually monitor the amount of credit exposure to any one issuer and diversify our investments in order to minimize our credit risk.We believe that our existing sources of liquidity and cash expected to be generated from future operations, together with existing and anticipated available long-term financing, will be sufficient to fund operations, capital expenditures, research and development efforts, dividend payments (if any) and repurchases of our stock (if any) under our stock repurchase program in the immediate future and for at least the next twelve months. Fiscal Year 2015 2014 2013Net Cash Provided by Operations$907,798 $871,602 $912,345Net Cash Provided by Operations as a % of Revenue26.4% 30.4% 34.6%Net Cash Used for Investing Activities$(17,125) $(114,751) $(949,926)Net Used for Financing Activities$(571,603) $(576,610) $(100,557)At October 31, 2015, cash and cash equivalents totaled $884.4 million. The following changes contributed to the net increase in cash and cash equivalents of $315.1 million in fiscal 2015.Operating ActivitiesDuring fiscal 2015, we generated cash from operating activities of $907.8 million, an increase of $36.2 million compared to the $871.6 million generated in fiscal 2014. Results of operations, after non-cash adjustments to net income, contributed $917.8 million compared to a contribution of $726.6 million in fiscal 2014. The contribution by results of operations was offset by changes in net cash inflows from working capital changes.Investing ActivitiesDuring fiscal 2015, cash used for investing activities included $154.0 million for property, plant and equipment additions, and $7.1 million for payments for acquisitions. We received $152.2 million in proceeds from the net sales of available-for-sale short term investments and s.Financing ActivitiesDuring fiscal 2015, cash used for financing activities included, proceeds of $122.6 million from employee stock option exercises. We distributed $491.1 million to our shareholders in dividend payments and paid $227.0 million for the repurchase of 4.1 million shares of our common stock.32Working Capital Fiscal Year 2015 2014 $ Change% ChangeAccounts Receivable$466,527 $396,605 $69,92218%Days Sales Outstanding46 46 Inventory$412,314 $367,927 $44,38712%Days Cost of Sales in Inventory121 115 The increase in accounts receivable was primarily the result of higher product shipments in the final month of the fourth quarter of fiscal 2015 as compared to the final month of the fourth quarter of fiscal 2014. Overall, our days in sales outstanding remained consistent year-over-year. Inventory as of October 31, 2015 increased as compared to the end of the fourth quarter of fiscal 2014 primarily as a result of increased manufacturing production to support anticipated higher sales demand. Our inventory levels are impacted by our need to support forecasted sales demand and variations between those forecasts and actual demand. Days cost of sales in inventory increased from 115 days at the end of the fourth quarter of fiscal 2014 to 121 days at the end of fiscal 2015 as a result of recognizing approximately $53.6 million of additional cost related to the sale of acquired inventory written up to fair value as a result of the Acquisition in fiscal 2014.Current liabilities increased to $1.1 billion at October 31, 2015 from $709.1 million recorded at the end of fiscal 2014. The increase was primarily the result of the classification of our $375.0 million aggregate principal amount of 3.0% seniorunsecured notes due April 15, 2016 as current and, to a lesser extent, increases in accounts payable, deferred income on shipments to distributors as more fully described below and accrued liabilities. These increases were partially offset by decreases in income taxes payable.As of October 31, 2015 and November 1, 2014, we had gross deferred revenue of $379.9 million and $349.7 million, respectively, and gross deferred cost of sales of $79.8 million and $71.3 million, respectively. Deferred income on shipments to distributors increased in fiscal 2015 primarily as a result of higher demand for products sold into the channel. Sales to distributors are made under agreements that allow distributors to receive price-adjustment credits and to return qualifying products for credit, as determined by us, in order to reduce the amounts of slow-moving, discontinued or obsolete product from their inventory. Given the uncertainties associated with the levels of price-adjustment credits to be granted to distributors, the sales price to the distributors is not fixed or determinable until the distributors resell the products to their customers. Therefore, we defer revenue recognition from sales to distributors until the distributors have sold the products to their customers. The amount of price-adjustments is dependent on future overall market conditions, and therefore the levels of these adjustments could fluctuate significantly from period to period. To the extent that we experience a significant increase in the amount of credits we issue to our distributors, there could be a material impact on the ultimate revenue and gross margin recognized relating to these transactions. DebtAs of October 31, 2015, we had $873.3 million of carrying value outstanding on our debt. The difference in the carrying value of the debt and the principal amount of the debt is due to the unamortized discount on these instruments that will accrete to the face value of the debt over the term of the debt. Our debt obligations consist of the following:$375.0 million aggregate principal amount of 3.0% senior unsecured notesOn April 4, 2011, we issued $375.0 million aggregate principal amount of 3.0% senior unsecured notes due April 15, 2016 (the 2016 Notes) with semi-annual fixed interest payments due on April 15 and October 15 of each year, commencing October 15, 2011.$500.0 million aggregate principal amount of 2.875% senior unsecured notesOn June 3, 2013, we issued $500.0 million aggregate principal amount of 2.875% senior unsecured notes due June 1, 2023 (the 2023 Notes) with semi-annual fixed interest payments due on June 1 and December 1 of each year, commencing December 1, 2013.The indentures governing the 2016 Notes and the 2023 Notes contain covenants that may limit our ability to: incur, create, assume or guarantee any debt for borrowed money secured by a lien upon a principal property; enter into sale and lease-back transactions with respect to a principal property; and consolidate with or merge into, or transfer or lease all or substantially all of our assets to, any other party. As of October 31, 2015, we were compliant with these covenants. See Note 16 33in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements contained in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further information on our outstanding debt.Revolving Credit FacilityOn July 10, 2015, we amended and restated our existing senior unsecured revolving credit facility with certain institutional lenders (the Credit Agreement) dated as of December 19, 2012. The Credit Agreement expires on July 10, 2020, and provides that we may borrow up to $750.0 million. To date, we have not borrowed under this credit facility, but we may borrow in the future and use the proceeds for repayment of existing indebtedness, stock repurchases, acquisitions, capital expenditures, working capital and other lawful corporate purposes. The terms of the facility impose restrictions on our ability to undertake certain transactions, to create certain liens on assets and to incur certain subsidiary indebtedness. In addition, the Credit Agreement contains a consolidated leverage ratio covenant of total consolidated funded debt to consolidated earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA) of not greater than 3.0 to 1.0. As of October 31, 2015, we were compliant with these covenants. $2.0 billion term loan facilityOn July 22, 2014, we entered into a 90-day term loan facility in an aggregate principal amount of $2.0 billion with Credit Suisse AG, as Administrative Agent, and each lender from time to time party thereto (the Term Loan Agreement) to finance the Acquisition. On August 29, 2014, we repaid in full the outstanding principal balance due under the Term Loan Agreement.Stock Repurchase ProgramOur common stock repurchase program has been in place since August 2004. In the aggregate, our Board of Directors have authorized us to repurchase $5.6 billion of our common stock under the program. Under the program, we may repurchase outstanding shares of our common stock from time to time in the open market and through privately negotiated transactions. Unless terminated earlier by resolution of our Board of Directors, the repurchase program will expire when we have repurchased all shares authorized under the program. As of October 31, 2015, we had repurchased a total of approximately 140.7 million shares of our common stock for approximately $5.0 billion under this program. As of October 31, 2015, an additional $544.5 million worth of shares remains available for repurchase under the current authorized program. The repurchased shares are held as authorized but unissued shares of common stock. We also from time to time repurchase shares in settlement of employee minimum tax withholding obligations due upon the vesting of restricted stock units. Any future common stock repurchases will be based on several factors, including our financial performance, outlook, liquidity and the amount of cash we have available in the United States.Capital ExpendituresNet additions to property, plant and equipment were $154.0 million in fiscal 2015 and were funded with a combination of cash on hand and cash generated from operations. We expect capital expenditures for fiscal 2016 to be in the range of $140 million to $160 million. These capital expenditures will be funded with a combination of cash on hand and cash generated from operations.DividendsOn November 23, 2015, our Board of Directors declared a cash dividend of $0.40 per outstanding share of common stock. The dividend will be paid on December 15, 2015 to all shareholders of record at the close of business on December 4, 2015 and is expected to total approximately $124.8 million. We currently expect quarterly dividends to continue at $0.40 per share, although they remain subject to determination and declaration by our Board of Directors. The payment of future dividends, if any, will be based on several factors, including our financial performance, outlook and liquidity.34Contractual ObligationsThe table below summarizes our contractual obligations and the amounts we owe under these contracts in specified periods as of October 31, 2015: Payment due by period Less than More than(thousands) Total 1 Year 1-3 Years 3-5 Years 5 YearsContractual obligations: Operating leases (a) $59,488 $21,780 $24,975 $7,470 $5,263Debt obligations 875,000 375,000 — — 500,000Interest payments associated with debt obligations 120,625 20,000 28,750 28,750 43,125Deferred compensation plan (b) 24,124 — — — 24,124Pension funding (c) 4,236 4,236 — — —Purchase Orders (d) 10,000 10,000 — — —Total $1,093,473 $431,016 $53,725 $36,220 $572,512_______________________________________(a)Certain of our operating lease obligations include escalation clauses. These escalating payment requirements are reflected in the table.(b)These payments relate to obligations under our deferred compensation plan. The deferred compensation plan allows certain members of management and other highly-compensated employees and non-employee directors to defer receipt of all or any portion of their compensation. The amount in the “More than 5 Years” column of the table represents the remaining total balance under the deferred compensation plan to be paid to participants who have not terminated employment. Since we cannot reasonably estimate the timing of withdrawals for participants who have not yet terminated employment, we have included the future obligation to these participants in the “More than 5 Years” column of the table.(c)Our funding policy for our foreign defined benefit plans is consistent with the local requirements of each country. The payment obligations in the table are estimates of our expected contributions to these plans for fiscal year 2016. The actual future payments may differ from the amounts presented in the table and reasonable estimates of payments beyond one year are not practical because of potential future changes in variables, such as plan asset performance, interest rates and the rate of increase in compensation levels.(d)Represents a non-cancelable inventory purchase obligation for certain raw materials though March 31, 2016 as part of a planned transition from a principal foundry supplier. We generally do not have significant agreements for the purchase of raw materials or other goods specifying minimum quantities or set prices that exceed our expected short-term requirements. Other purchase orders for the purchase of raw materials and other goods and services are not included in the table above. We are not able to determine the total amount of these purchase orders that represent contractual obligations, as purchase orders may represent authorizations to purchase rather than binding agreements. In addition, our purchase orders generally allow for cancellation without significant penalties. Certain of our acquisitions involve the potential payment of contingent consideration. The table above does not reflect any such obligations, which could be up to $3.0 million, as the timing and amounts are uncertain. As of October 31, 2015, our total liabilities associated with deferred taxes and uncertain tax positions was $81.0 million, which are included in “Other non-current liabilities” in our consolidated balance sheet contained in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Due to the complexity associated with our deferred taxes and tax uncertainties, we cannot make a reasonably reliable estimate of the period in which we expect to settle the non-current liabilities associated with these deferred taxes and uncertain tax positions. Therefore, we have not included these deferred taxes and uncertain tax positions in the above contractual obligations table.The expected timing of payments and the amounts of the obligations discussed above are estimated based on current information available as of October 31, 2015.Off-balance Sheet FinancingAs of October 31, 2015, we had no off-balance sheet financing arrangements.35New Accounting PronouncementsFrom time to time, new accounting pronouncements are issued by the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) and are adopted by us as of the specified effective date. Unless otherwise discussed, management believes that the impact of recently issued standards will not have a material impact on our future financial condition and results of operations. See Note 2t, New Accounting Pronouncements, of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements contained in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for a description of recently issued and adopted accounting pronouncements, including the dates of adoption and impact on our historical financial condition and results of operations.Revenue RecognitionIn May 2014, the FASB issued ASU 2014-09 (ASU 2014-09), Revenue from Contracts with Customers, which supersedes nearly all existing revenue recognition guidance under U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP). The core principle of ASU 2014-09 is that an entity should recognize revenue to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. Additionally, the guidance requires improved disclosures to help users of financial statements better understand the nature, amount, timing, and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows arising from contracts with customers. In August 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-14 Revenue from Contracts with Customers Deferral of the Effective Date, which defers the effective date of the new revenue recognition standard by one year, and as a result, public entities would apply the new revenue standard to annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017 and interim periods therein, which is the Company's first quarter of fiscal 2019. Early adoption is permitted for all entities only as of annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2016, including interim reporting periods within that reporting period. The guidance allows for the amendment to be applied either retrospectively to each prior reporting period presented or retrospectively as a cumulative-effect adjustment as of the date of adoption. We are in the process of evaluating the impact of adoption on its consolidated financial statements.Critical Accounting Policies and EstimatesManagement’s discussion and analysis of the financial condition and results of operations is based upon the consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue and expenses, and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. We base our estimates and judgments on historical experience, knowledge of current conditions and beliefs of what could occur in the future based on available information. We consider the following accounting policies to be both those most important to the portrayal of our financial condition and those that require the most subjective judgment. If actual results differ significantly from management’s estimates and projections, there could be a material effect on our financial statements. We also have other policies that we consider key accounting policies, such as our policy for revenue recognition, including the deferral of revenue on sales to distributors until the products are sold to the end user; however, the application of these policies does not require us to make significant estimates or judgments that are difficult or subjective.Revenue RecognitionRevenue from product sales to customers is generally recognized when title passes, which is upon shipment in the U.S. and for certain foreign counties. Revenue from product sales to other foreign countries is subsequent to product shipment. Title for these shipments to these other foreign countries ordinarily passes within a week of shipment. Accordingly, we defer the revenue recognized relating to these other foreign countries until title has passed. For multiple element arrangements, we allocate arrangement consideration among the elements based on the relative fair values of those elements as determined using vendor-specific objective evidence or third-party evidence. We use our best estimate of selling price to allocate arrangement consideration between the deliverables in cases where neither vendor-specific objective evidence nor third-party evidence is available. A reserve for sales returns and allowances for customers is recorded based on historical experience or specific identification of an event necessitating a reserve. Revenue from contracts with the United States government, government prime contractors and some commercial customers is generally recorded on a percentage of completion basis, using either units delivered or costs incurred as the measurement basis for progress toward completion. The output measure is used to measure results directly and is generally the best measure of progress toward completion in circumstances in which a reliable measure of output can be established. Estimated revenue in excess of amounts billed is reported as unbilled receivables. Contract accounting requires judgment in estimating costs and assumptions related to technical issues and delivery schedule. Contract costs include material, subcontract costs, labor and an allocation of indirect costs. The estimation of costs at completion of a contract is subject to numerous variables involving contract costs and estimates as to the length of time to complete the contract. Changes in contract performance, estimated gross margin, including the impact of final contract settlements, and estimated losses are recognized in the period in which the changes or losses are determined. 36Inventory ValuationWe value inventories at the lower of cost (first-in, first-out method) or market. Because of the cyclical nature of the semiconductor industry, changes in inventory levels, obsolescence of technology, and product life cycles, we write down inventories to net realizable value. We employ a variety of methodologies to determine the net realizable value of inventory. While a portion of the calculation is determined via reference to the age of inventory and lower of cost or market calculations, an element of the calculation is subject to significant judgments made by us about future demand for our inventory. If actual demand for our products is less than our estimates, additional adjustments to existing inventories may need to be recorded in future periods. To date, our actual results have not been materially different than our estimates, and we do not expect them to be materially different in the future.Allowance for Doubtful AccountsWe maintain allowances for doubtful accounts, when appropriate, for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments. If the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate, our actual losses may exceed our estimates, and additional allowances would be required. To date, our actual results have not been materially different than our estimates, and we do not expect them to be materially different in the future.Long-Lived AssetsWe review property, plant, and equipment and finite lived intangible assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of assets may not be recoverable. Recoverability of these assets is determined by comparison of their carrying value to future undiscounted cash flows that the assets are expected to generate over their remaining economic lives. If such assets are considered to be impaired, the impairment to be recognized in earnings equals the amount by which the carrying value of the assets exceeds their fair value determined by either a quoted market price, if any, or a value determined by utilizing a discounted cash flow technique. Although we have recognized no material impairment adjustments related to our property, plant, and equipment and identified intangible assets during the past three fiscal years, except those made in conjunction with restructuring actions, deterioration in our business in the future could lead to such impairment adjustments in future periods. Evaluation of impairment of long-lived assets requires estimates of future operating results that are used in the preparation of the expected future undiscounted cash flows. Actual future operating results and the remaining economic lives of our long-lived assets could differ from the estimates used in assessing the recoverability of these assets. These differences could result in impairment charges, which could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations. In addition, in certain instances, assets may not be impaired but their estimated useful lives may have decreased. In these situations, we amortize the remaining net book values over the revised useful lives. We review indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment annually, on the first day of the fourth quarter (on or about August 1) or more frequently if indicators of impairment exist. We perform a qualitative assessment on its indefinite-lived intangible assets to determine whether it is more likely-than not that the indefinite-lived intangible asset is impaired. If it is determined that the fair value of the indefinite-lived intangible asset is less than the carrying value, we would compare the fair value of the intangible asset with its carrying amount and recognize into earnings any amount by which the carrying value of the assets exceeds the fair value.GoodwillGoodwill is subject to annual impairment tests or more frequently if indicators of potential impairment exist and suggest that the carrying value of goodwill may not be recoverable from estimated discounted future cash flows. We test goodwill for impairment at the reporting unit level (operating segment or one level below an operating segment) on an annual basis in the fourth quarter (on or about August 1) or more frequently if we believe indicators of impairment exist. For our latest annual impairment assessment which occurred on August 2, 2015, we identified our reporting units to be our six operating segments. The performance of the test involves a two-step process. The first step of the impairment test involves comparing the fair values of the applicable reporting units with their aggregate carrying values, including goodwill. We generally determine the fair value of our reporting units using the income approach methodology of valuation that includes the discounted cash flow method as well as other generally accepted valuation methodologies, which requires significant judgment by management. If the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds the reporting unit’s fair value, we perform the second step of the goodwill impairment test to determine the amount of impairment loss. The second step of the goodwill impairment test involves comparing the implied fair value of the affected reporting unit’s goodwill with the carrying value of that goodwill. These impairment tests may result in impairment losses that could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations.Business CombinationsUnder the acquisition method of accounting, we recognize tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their estimated fair values. We record the excess of the fair value of the purchase consideration 37over the value of the net assets acquired as goodwill. The accounting for business combinations requires us to make significant estimates and assumptions, especially with respect to intangible assets and the fair value of contingent payment obligations. Critical estimates in valuing purchased technology, customer lists and other identifiable intangible assets include future cash flows that we expect to generate from the acquired assets. If the subsequent actual results and updated projections of the underlying business activity change compared with the assumptions and projections used to develop these values, we could experience impairment charges which could be material. In addition, we have estimated the economic lives of certain acquired assets and these lives are used to calculate depreciation and amortization expense. If our estimates of the economic lives change, depreciation or amortization expenses could be accelerated or slowed.We record contingent consideration resulting from a business combination at its fair value on the acquisition date. We generally determine the fair value of the contingent consideration using the income approach methodology of valuation. Each reporting period thereafter, we revalue these obligations and record increases or decreases in their fair value as an adjustment to operating expenses within the consolidated statement of income. Changes in the fair value of the contingent consideration can result from changes in assumed discount periods and rates, and from changes pertaining to the achievement of the defined milestones. Significant judgment is employed in determining the appropriateness of these assumptions as of the acquisition date and for each subsequent period. Accordingly, future business and economic conditions, as well as changes in any of the assumptions described above, can materially impact the amount of contingent consideration expense we record in any given period.Accounting for Income TaxesWe must make certain estimates and judgments in determining income tax expense for financial statement purposes. These estimates and judgments occur in the calculation of tax credits, benefits, and deductions, and in the calculation of certain tax assets and liabilities, which arise from differences in the timing of the recognition of revenue and expense for tax and financial statement purposes, as well as the interest and penalties relating to these uncertain tax positions. We assessed the likelihood of the realization of deferred tax assets and concluded that a valuation allowance is needed to reserve the amount of the deferred tax assets that may not be realized due to the uncertainty of the timing and amount of the realization of certain state credit carryovers. In reaching our conclusion, we evaluated certain relevant criteria including the existence of deferred tax liabilities that can be used to realize deferred tax assets, the taxable income in prior carryback years in the impacted state jurisdictions that can be used to absorb net operating losses and taxable income in future years. Our judgments regarding future profitability may change due to future market conditions, changes in U.S. or international tax laws and other factors. These changes, if any, may require material adjustments to these deferred tax assets, resulting in a reduction in net income or an increase in net loss in the period when such determinations are made, which in turn, may result in an increase or decrease to our tax provision in a subsequent period.We account for uncertain tax positions by determining if it is “more likely than not” that a tax position will be sustained by the appropriate taxing authorities prior to recording any benefit in the financial statements. An uncertain income tax position is not recognized if it has less than a 50% likelihood of being sustained. For those tax positions where it is more likely than not that a tax benefit will be sustained, we have recorded the largest amount of tax benefit with a greater than 50% likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement with a taxing authority that has full knowledge of all relevant information. For those income tax positions where it is not more likely than not that a tax benefit will be sustained, no tax benefit has been recognized in the financial statements. We reevaluate these uncertain tax positions on a quarterly basis. This evaluation is based on factors including, but not limited to, changes in known facts or circumstances, changes in tax law, effectively settled issues under audit, and new audit activity. A change in these factors would result in the recognition of a tax benefit or an additional charge to the tax provision.In the ordinary course of global business, there are many transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax outcome is uncertain. Some of these uncertainties arise as a consequence of cost reimbursement and royalty arrangements among related entities. Although we believe our estimates are reasonable, no assurance can be given that the final tax outcome of these matters will not be different than that which is reflected in our historical income tax provisions and accruals. In the event our assumptions are incorrect, the differences could have a material impact on our income tax provision and operating results in the period in which such determination is made. In addition to the factors described above, our current and expected effective tax rate is based on then-current tax law. Significant changes during the year in enacted tax law could affect these estimates.Stock-Based CompensationStock-based compensation expense associated with stock options and related awards is recognized in the consolidated statements of income. Determining the amount of stock-based compensation to be recorded requires us to develop estimates to be used in calculating the grant-date fair value of stock options and market-based restricted stock units. We calculate the grant-date fair values of stock options using the Black-Scholes valuation model. The use of valuation models requires us to make estimates of key assumptions such as expected option term and stock price volatility to determine the fair value of a stock 38option. The estimate of these key assumptions is based on historical information and judgment regarding market factors and trends. As it relates to our market-based restricted stock units, we utilize the Monte Carlo simulation valuation model to value these awards. The Monte Carlo simulation model utilizes multiple input variables that determine the probability of satisfying the performance conditions stipulated in the award grant and calculates the fair market value for the market-based restricted stock units granted. The Monte Carlo simulation model also uses stock price volatility and other variables to estimate the probability of satisfying the performance conditions, including the possibility that the market condition may not be satisfied, and the resulting fair value of the award. We recognize the expense related to these on a straight-line basis over the vesting period, which is generally five years for stock options and three years for restricted stock units. See Note 3 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements contained in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for more information related to stock based compensation.ContingenciesFrom time to time, in the ordinary course of business, various claims, charges and litigation are asserted or commenced against us arising from, or related to, contractual matters, patents, trademarks, personal injury, environmental matters, product liability, insurance coverage and personnel and employment disputes. We periodically assess each matter to determine if a contingent liability should be recorded. In making this determination, we may, depending on the nature of the matter, consult with internal and external legal counsel and technical experts. Based on the information we obtain, combined with our judgment regarding all the facts and circumstances of each matter, we determine whether it is probable that a contingent loss may be incurred and whether the amount of such loss can be reasonably estimated. If a loss is probable and reasonably estimable, we record a contingent loss. In determining the amount of a contingent loss, we consider advice received from experts in the specific matter, current status of legal proceedings, settlement negotiations that may be ongoing, prior case history and other factors. If the judgments and estimates made by us are incorrect, we may need to record additional contingent losses that could materially adversely impact our results of operations.39ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISKInterest Rate ExposureOur interest income and expense are sensitive to changes in the general level of interest rates. In this regard, changes in interest rates affect the interest earned on our marketable securities and short term investments, as well as the fair value of our investments and debt.Based on our marketable securities and short-term investments outstanding as of October 31, 2015 and November 1, 2014, our annual interest income would change by approximately $27 million and $29 million, respectively, for each 100 basis point increase in interest rates.To provide a meaningful assessment of the interest rate risk associated with our investment portfolio, we performed a sensitivity analysis to determine the impact a change in interest rates would have on the value of our investment portfolio assuming a 100 basis point parallel shift in the yield curve. Based on investment positions as of October 31, 2015 and November 1, 2014, a hypothetical 100 basis point increase in interest rates across all maturities would result in a $5 million and $7 million decline, respectively in the fair market value of the portfolio. Such losses would only be realized if we sold the investments prior to maturity.As of October 31, 2015, we had $875 million in principal amount of senior unsecured notes outstanding, which consisted of $375 million 3% senior unsecured notes due April 15, 2016 (the 2016 Notes) and $500 million 2.875% senior unsecured notes due June 1, 2023 (the 2023 Notes). As of October 31, 2015, a hypothetical 100 basis point increase in market interest rates would reduce the fair value of our 2016 Notes outstanding by approximately $2 million. As of October 31, 2015, a similar increase in market interest rates would reduce the fair value of our 2023 Notes by $32 million. Foreign Currency ExposureAs more fully described in Note 2i in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements contained in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, we regularly hedge our non-U.S. dollar-based exposures by entering into forward foreign currency exchange contracts. The terms of these contracts are for periods matching the duration of the underlying exposure and generally range from one to twelve months. Currently, our largest foreign currency exposure is the Euro, primarily because our European operations have the highest proportion of our local currency denominated expenses. Relative to foreign currency exposures existing at October 31, 2015 and November 1, 2014, a 10% unfavorable movement in foreign currency exchange rates over the course of the year would result in approximately $8 million of losses and $8 million of gains, respectively, in changes in earnings or cash flows.The market risk associated with our derivative instruments results from currency exchange rates that are expected to offset the market risk of the underlying transactions, assets and liabilities being hedged. The counterparties to the agreements relating to our foreign exchange instruments consist of a number of major international financial institutions with high credit ratings. Based on the credit ratings of our counterparties as of October 31, 2015, we do not believe that there is significant risk of nonperformance by them. While the contract or notional amounts of derivative financial instruments provide one measure of the volume of these transactions, they do not represent the amount of our exposure to credit risk. The amounts potentially subject to credit risk (arising from the possible inability of counterparties to meet the terms of their contracts) are generally limited to the amounts, if any, by which the counterparties’ obligations under the contracts exceed our obligations to the counterparties.The following table illustrates the effect that a 10% unfavorable or favorable movement in foreign currency exchange rates, relative to the U.S. dollar, would have on the fair value of our forward exchange contracts as of October 31, 2015 and November 1, 2014: October 31, 2015 November 1, 2014Fair value of forward exchange contracts liability$(3,083) $(10,093)Fair value of forward exchange contracts after a 10% unfavorable movement in foreign currency exchange rates asset$13,595 $7,918Fair value of forward exchange contracts after a 10% favorable movement in foreign currency exchange rates liability$(18,736) $(27,051)The calculation assumes that each exchange rate would change in the same direction relative to the U.S. dollar. In addition to the direct effects of changes in exchange rates, such changes typically affect the volume of sales or the foreign currency sales price as competitors’ products become more or less attractive. Our sensitivity analysis of the effects of changes in foreign currency exchange rates does not factor in a potential change in sales levels or local currency selling prices.40REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRMThe Board of Directors and Shareholders Analog Devices, Inc.We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Analog Devices, Inc. as of October 31, 2015 and November 1, 2014, and the related consolidated statements of income, comprehensive income, shareholders' equity and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended October 31, 2015.

Under the terms of the Merger Agreement, Linear stockholders will receive, for each outstanding share of Linear common stock, $46.00 in cash and 0.2321 of a share of our common stock at the closing. Based on the number of outstanding shares of Linear common stock as of July 26, 2016 and our 5-day volume weighted average price as of July 21, 2016, the value of the total consideration to be paid by us is estimated to be approximately $14.8 billion. On October 18, 2016, Linear stockholders approved the Merger Agreement. As of October 29, 2016 we had received antitrust clearance in the United States and Germany. Subsequently, we have also received antitrust clearances in Japan and Israel. We currently expect the transaction to be completed by the end of the second quarter of our fiscal year ended October 28, 2017 (fiscal 2017), subject to receipt of the remaining required regulatory clearances and the satisfaction or waiver of the other conditions contained in the Merger Agreement.We intend to fund the acquisition with the issuance of approximately 58.0 million new shares of our common stock and approximately $11.6 billion of new short- and long-term indebtedness. The financing is supported by fully underwritten bridge financing commitments and is expected to consist of term loans and bonds. See Note 6, Acquisitions and Note 16, Debt, of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements contained in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further information.Acquisition of Hittite Microwave Corporation (Hittite)On July 22, 2014, we completed the acquisition of Hittite, a company that designed and developed high performance integrated circuits, modules, subsystems and instrumentation for radio frequency, microwave and millimeterwave applications. The total consideration paid to acquire Hittite was approximately $2.4 billion, financed through a combination of existing cash on hand and a 90-day term loan facility of $2.0 billion. The acquisition of Hittite is referred to as the Hittite Acquisition. See Note 6, Acquisitions, of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements contained in Item 8 of this Annual Report on From 10-K for further discussion related to the Hittite Acquisition.Revenue Trends by End MarketThe following table summarizes revenue by end market. The categorization of revenue by end market is determined using a variety of data points including the technical characteristics of the product, the “sold to” customer information, the “ship to” customer information and the end customer product or application into which our product will be incorporated. As data systems for capturing and tracking this data evolve and improve, the categorization of products by end market can vary over time. When this occurs, we reclassify revenue by end market for prior periods. Such reclassifications typically do not materially change the sizing of, or the underlying trends of results within, each end market.28 2016 2015 2014 Revenue % ofTotalProductRevenue Y/Y% Revenue % ofTotalProductRevenue Revenue % ofTotalProductRevenue*Industrial$1,502,019 44% — % $1,494,898 44% $1,344,906 47%Automotive540,940 16% 3 % 525,893 15% 525,123 18%Consumer688,289 20% (6)% 729,860 21% 327,434 11%Communications690,161 20% 1 % 684,441 20% 667,310 23%Total Revenue$3,421,409 100% — % $3,435,092 100% $2,864,773 100%*The sum of the individual percentages does not equal the total due to rounding.Automotive end market revenue increased year-over-year in fiscal 2016 primarily as a result of increased demand for our powertrain, advanced driver assistance systems, and infotainment products. The year-over-year decrease in the consumer end market in fiscal 2016 was primarily the result of lower demand for products sold into portable consumer applications.The year-over-year increase in the industrial and communications end markets revenue in fiscal 2015 was the result of the Hittite Acquisition. Consumer end market revenue increased in fiscal 2015 as compared to fiscal 2014 as a result of increased demand for products sold into the portable sector of this end market.Revenue Trends by Geographic RegionRevenue by geographic region, based upon the primary location of our customers' design activity for its products, for fiscal 2016, 2015 and 2014 was as follows: Change Fiscal Year 2016 over 2015 2015 over 2014 2016 2015 2014 $ Change % Change $ Change % ChangeUnited States$1,299,629 $1,325,279 $821,554 $(25,650) (2)% $503,725 61 %Rest of North and South America95,957 97,189 96,957 (1,232) (1)% 232 — %Europe924,849 939,230 924,477 (14,381) (2)% 14,753 2 %Japan291,649 319,569 308,054 (27,920) (9)% 11,515 4 %China575,690 511,365 459,260 64,325 13 % 52,105 11 %Rest of Asia233,635 242,460 254,471 (8,825) (4)% (12,011) (5)%Total Revenue$3,421,409 $3,435,092 $2,864,773 $(13,683) — % $570,319 20 %In fiscal years 2016, 2015 and 2014, the predominant countries comprising “Rest of North and South America” are Canada and Mexico; the predominant countries comprising “Europe” are Germany, Sweden, France and the United Kingdom; and the predominant countries comprising “Rest of Asia” are South Korea and Taiwan. On a regional basis, the sales increase in China in fiscal 2016 as compared to fiscal 2015 was primarily the result of an increase in demand in the industrial, communications and automotive end markets. The sales decrease in Japan in fiscal 2016 as compared to fiscal 2015 was primarily, a result of a decrease in demand for our products in the industrial end market. The sales decrease in fiscal 2016 as compared to fiscal 2015 in the United States was primarily the result of a decrease in demand in the consumer end markets.The sales increase in fiscal 2015 as compared to fiscal 2014 in the United States was primarily the result of increased demand for consumer products sold into the portable sector and the Hittite Acquisition. The sales increase in fiscal 2015 as compared to fiscal 2014 in Europe was primarily the result of the Hittite Acquisition, partially offset by a decrease in demand for products used in wireless base stations. The sales increase in fiscal 2015 as compared to fiscal 2014 in Japan was primarily a result of the Hittite Acquisition, partially offset by a decrease in demand for products used in home entertainment. The sales increase in fiscal 2015 as compared to fiscal 2014 in China was primarily a result of the Hittite Acquisition. The sales decrease in fiscal 2015 as compared to fiscal 2014 in the Rest of Asia was primarily the result of a decrease in demand in most end markets, partially offset by the Hittite Acquisition.29Gross Margin Change Fiscal Year 2016 over 2015 2015 over 2014 2016 2015 2014 $ Change % Change $ Change % ChangeGross Margin$2,227,173 $2,259,262 $1,830,188 $(32,089) (1)% $429,074 23%Gross Margin %65.1% 65.8% 63.9% Gross margin percentage in fiscal 2016 decreased by 70 basis points compared to fiscal 2015, primarily as a result of lower utilization rates in our manufacturing facilities partially offset by a mix shift in favor of higher margin products being sold.Gross margin percentage in fiscal 2015 increased 190 basis points compared to fiscal 2014 primarily as a result of the impact of purchased inventory recognized in fiscal 2014 as a result of the Hittite Acquisition.Research and Development (R&D) Change Fiscal Year 2016 over 2015 2015 over 2014 2016 2015 2014 $ Change % Change $ Change % ChangeR&D Expenses$653,816 $637,459 $559,686 $16,357 3% $77,773 14%R&D Expenses as a % of Revenue19.1% 18.6% 19.5% R&D expenses increased in fiscal 2016 as compared to fiscal 2015 primarily as a result of increases in R&D employee and related benefit expenses and operational spending, partially offset by a decrease in variable compensation expense linked to our overall profitability and revenue growth.R&D expenses increased in fiscal 2015 as compared to fiscal 2014 primarily as a result of increases in operational spending resulting from the Hittite Acquisition, variable compensation expense linked to our overall profitability and revenue growth and R&D employee and related benefit expenses.R&D expenses as a percentage of revenue will fluctuate from year-to-year depending on the amount of revenue and the success of new product development efforts, which we view as critical to our future growth. We have hundreds of R&D projects underway, none of which we believe are material on an individual basis. We expect to continue the development of innovative technologies and processes for new products. We believe that a continued commitment to R&D is essential to maintain product leadership with our existing products as well as to provide innovative new product offerings, and therefore, we expect to continue to make significant R&D investments in the future.Selling, Marketing, General and Administrative (SMG&A) Change Fiscal Year 2016 over 2015 2015 over 2014 2016 2015 2014 $ Change % Change $ Change % ChangeSMG&A Expenses$461,438 $478,972 $454,676 $(17,534) (4)% $24,296 5%SMG&A Expenses as a % of Revenue13.5% 13.9% 15.9% SMG&A expenses decreased in fiscal 2016 as compared to fiscal 2015 primarily as a result of decreases in operational spending and variable compensation expense linked to our overall profitability and revenue growth, partially offset by an increase in SMG&A employee and related benefit expenses.SMG&A expenses increased in fiscal 2015 as compared to fiscal 2014 as a result of increases in variable compensation expense linked to our overall profitability and revenue growth, SMG&A employee and related benefit expenses, as well as operational spending resulting from the Hittite Acquisition. These increases were partially offset by a decrease in Acquisition-related transition costs and other activity.30Amortization of Intangibles Change Fiscal Year 2016 over 2015 2015 over 2014 2016 2015 2014 $ Change % Change $ Change % ChangeAmortization expenses$70,123 $88,318 $26,020 $(18,195) (21)% $62,298 239%Amortization expenses as a % of revenue2.0% 2.6% 0.9% Amortization expenses decreased in fiscal 2016 as compared to fiscal 2015 as a result of certain intangible assets becoming fully amortized during fiscal 2015.Amortization expenses increased in fiscal 2015 as compared to fiscal 2014 as a result of acquired amortizable intangible assets from the Hittite Acquisition. These intangible assets are being amortized on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful lives. Special ChargesWe monitor global macroeconomic conditions on an ongoing basis, and continue to assess opportunities for improved operational effectiveness and efficiency and better alignment of expenses with revenues. As a result of these assessments, we have undertaken various restructuring actions over the past several years. The expense reductions relating to ongoing actions are described below.During fiscal 2016, we recorded a special charge of approximately $13.7 million for severance and fringe benefit costs in accordance with the Company's ongoing benefit plan for 123 manufacturing, engineering and SMG&A employees. As of October 29, 2016, we still employed 44 of the 123 employees included in these cost reduction actions. These employees must continue to be employed by the Company until their employment is terminated in order to receive the severance benefit. We expect this action will result in estimated annual cost savings of approximately $12.3 million once fully implemented.During fiscal 2014, we recorded special charges of approximately $37.3 million. These special charges included $37.9 million for severance and fringe benefit costs in accordance with our ongoing benefit plan or statutory requirements at foreign locations for 341 manufacturing, engineering and SMG&A employees; $0.5 million for lease obligations costs for facilities that we ceased using during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2014; and $0.4 million for the impairment of assets that have no future use located at closed facilities. We reversed approximately $1.4 million of our severance accrual related to charges taken in fiscal 2013, primarily due to severance costs being lower than our estimates. We terminated the employment of all employees associated with this action. This action resulted in annual cost savings of approximately $46.2 million.We expect that annual cost savings resulting from these actions will be used to make additional investments in products that we expect will drive revenue growth in the future. Other Operating Expense During fiscal 2015, we converted the benefits provided to participants in our Irish defined benefits pension plan to benefits provided under our Irish defined contribution plan. Retired pension plan participants received an annuity. As a result, in fiscal 2015 we recorded settlement charges, legal, accounting and other professional fees totaling $223.7 million to settle all existing and future Irish pension plan liabilities.Operating Income Change Fiscal Year 2016 over 2015 2015 over 2014 2016 2015 2014 $ Change % Change $ Change % ChangeOperating income$1,028,112 $830,841 $752,484 $197,271 24% $78,357 10%Operating income as a % of Revenue30.0% 24.2% 26.3% 31The increase in operating income in fiscal 2016 as compared to fiscal 2015 was primarily the result of a $223.7 million decrease in other operating expense more fully described above under the heading Other Operating Expense, partially offset by a 70 basis point decrease in gross margin percentage. The increase in operating income in fiscal 2015 as compared to fiscal 2014 was primarily the result of an increase in revenue of $570.3 million, a 190 basis point increase in gross margin percentage and a $37.3 million decrease in special charges, partially offset by a $223.7 million increase in other operating expense, a $77.8 million increase in R&D expenses, a $24.3 million increase in SMG&A expenses and a $62.3 million increase in amortization of intangibles more fully described above under the headings Research and Development (R&D), Selling, Marketing, General and Administrative (SMG&A), Amortization of Intangibles, Special Charges and Other Operating Expense.Nonoperating (Income) Expense Change Fiscal Year 2016 over 2015 2015 over 2014 2016 2015 2014 $ Change $ ChangeInterest expense$88,757 $27,030 $34,784 $61,727 $(7,754)Interest income(21,221) (8,625) (12,173) (12,596) 3,548Other, net3,655 2,322 528 1,333 1,794Total nonoperating expense$71,191 $20,727 $23,139 $50,464 $(2,412)The increase in nonoperating expense in fiscal 2016 as compared to fiscal 2015 was primarily the result of an increase in interest expense as a result of the issuance of $850.0 million aggregate principal amount of 3.9% senior unsecured notes due December 15, 2025 (the 2025 Notes) and $400.0 million aggregate principal amount of 5.3% senior unsecured notes due December 15, 2045 (the 2045 Notes) in fiscal 2016, and as a result of fees related to financing commitments entered into in anticipation of the proposed acquisition of Linear. These increases were partially offset by a decrease in interest expense as a result of the redemption of the $375.0 million aggregate principal amount of 3.0% senior unsecured notes (the 2016 Notes) in fiscal 2016. See Note 16, Debt, of the Notes to our Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements contained in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further information on the issuance of the 2025 Notes and the 2045 Notes and redemption of the 2016 Notes. The increase in nonoperating expense as a result of the increase in interest expense in fiscal 2016 as compared to fiscal 2015 was partially offset by an increase in interest income due to higher interest rates earned on our investments and the investment of higher cash balances in fiscal 2016 as compared to fiscal 2015.The decrease in nonoperating expense in fiscal 2015 as compared to fiscal 2014 was primarily the result of the repayment of the 90-day term loan facility used to fund the Hittite Acquisition in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2014, partially offset by a decrease in interest income primarily as a result of lower cash balances throughout fiscal 2015 as compared to fiscal 2014.Provision for Income Taxes Change Fiscal Year 2016 over 2015 2015 over 2014 2016 2015 2014 $ Change % Change $ Change % ChangeProvision for Income Taxes$95,257 $113,236 $100,025 $(17,979) (16)% $13,211 13%Effective Income Tax Rate10.0% 14.0% 13.7% Our effective tax rate reflects the applicable tax rate in effect in the various tax jurisdictions around the world where our income is earned. The tax rate for all periods presented was below the U.S. federal statutory tax rate of 35%, primarily due to lower statutory tax rates applicable to our operations in the foreign jurisdictions in which we earn income. Non-U.S. jurisdictions accounted for approximately 78% of our total revenues for the fiscal 2016, resulting in a material portion of our pretax income being earned and taxed outside the U.S., primarily in Bermuda and Ireland, at rates ranging from 0% to 35%. The impact on our provision for income taxes of income earned in foreign jurisdictions being taxed at rates different than the U.S. statutory rate was a benefit of approximately $264.3 million and a foreign effective tax rate of approximately 6.1% in fiscal 2016 compared to a benefit of approximately $198.1 million and a foreign effective tax rate of approximately 10.6% fiscal 2015. A reduction in the ratio of domestic taxable income to worldwide taxable income effectively lowers the overall tax rate, due to the fact that the tax rates in the majority of foreign jurisdictions where we earn income are significantly lower than the U.S. 32statutory rate. In addition, our effective income tax rate can be impacted each year by discrete factors or events. Our effective tax rate for fiscal 2016 included a tax benefit of $7.5 million from the reinstatement of the U.S. federal research and development tax credit in December 2015 retroactive to January 1, 2015. Our effective tax rate for fiscal 2015 was reduced as a result of $13.0 million recorded from the reversal of certain prior period tax liabilities, a tax benefit of $7.0 million from the reinstatement of the U.S. federal research and development tax credit in December 2014 retroactive to January 1, 2014 and a tax benefit of $3.8 million as a result of an acquisition accounting adjustment. In addition our effective tax rate for fiscal 2015 included $2.0 million of discrete tax expense items associated with the U.S. provision to return adjustments.Non-U.S. jurisdictions accounted for approximately 78% of our total revenues for fiscal 2015, resulting in a material portion of our pretax income being earned and taxed outside the U.S., primarily in Bermuda and Ireland, at rates ranging from 0% to 35%. The impact on our provision for income taxes of income earned in foreign jurisdictions being taxed at rates different than the U.S. statutory rate was a benefit of approximately $198.1 million and a foreign effective tax rate of approximately 10.6% in fiscal 2015, compared to a benefit of approximately $179.3 million and a foreign effective tax rate of approximately 7.7% in fiscal 2014. A reduction in the ratio of domestic taxable income to worldwide taxable income effectively lowers the overall tax rate, due to the fact that the tax rates in the majority of foreign jurisdictions where we earn income are significantly lower than the U.S. statutory rate. In addition, our effective income tax rate can be impacted each year by discrete factors or events. Our effective tax rate for fiscal 2015 was reduced as a result of $13.0 million recorded from the reversal of certain prior period tax liabilities, a tax benefit of $7.0 million from the reinstatement of the U.S. federal research and development tax credit in December 2014 retroactive to January 1, 2014 and a tax benefit of $3.8 million as a result of an acquisition accounting adjustment. In addition our effective tax rate for fiscal 2015 included $2.0 million of discrete tax expense items associated with the U.S. provision to return adjustments. Our effective tax rate for fiscal 2014 was not significantly impacted by discrete items.Net Income Change Fiscal Year 2016 over 2015 2015 over 2014 2016 2015 2014 $ Change % Change $ Change % ChangeNet Income$861,664 $696,878 $629,320 $164,786 24% $67,558 11%Net Income, as a % of Revenue25.2% 20.3% 22.0% Diluted EPS$2.76 $2.20 $1.98 $0.56 25% $0.22 11%The increase in net income in fiscal 2016 as compared to fiscal 2015 was primarily a result of the $197.3 million increase in operating income and the $18.0 million decrease in provision for income taxes, partially offset by the $50.5 million increase in nonoperating expense.The increase in net income in fiscal 2015 as compared to fiscal 2014 was primarily a result of the $78.4 million increase in operating income, partially offset by the $13.2 million increase in provision for income taxes.The impact of inflation and foreign currency exchange rate movement on our results of operations during the past three fiscal years has not been significant.AcquisitionsOn July 22, 2014, we completed our acquisition of Hittite, a company that designed and developed high performance integrated circuits, modules, subsystems and instrumentation for radio frequency, microwave and millimeterwave applications. The total consideration paid to acquire Hittite was approximately $2.4 billion, financed through a combination of existing cash on hand and a 90-day term loan facility of $2.0 billion. We recognized assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their estimated fair values at the date of acquisition, resulting in the recognition of $1.4 billion of goodwill and $666.4 million of intangible assets, including $0.9 million of in-process research and development intangible assets. We recognized approximately $50.9 million of transaction-related costs, including legal, accounting, severance, debt financing, interest and other related fees of which approximately $9.7 million were expensed in fiscal 2015 and $41.2 million in fiscal 2014. These costs are included in the consolidated statements of income in operating expenses within SMG&A expenses as well as non-operating expenses. The Hittite Acquisition resulted in the creation of a new operating segment. We continue to operate and track our results in one reportable segment based on the aggregation of seven operating segments.The following unaudited pro forma consolidated financial information presents our combined results of operations after giving effect to the Hittite Acquisition and assumes that the Hittite Acquisition, which closed on July 22, 2014, was completed 33on November 4, 2012 (the first day of the Company’s 2013 fiscal year). The pro forma consolidated financial information has been calculated after applying our accounting policies and includes adjustments for amortization expense of acquired intangible assets, transaction-related costs, increase in cost of sales for inventory acquired and depreciation of property, plant and equipment, and interest expense for the debt incurred to fund the Hittite Acquisition, together with the consequential tax effects. These pro forma results have been prepared for comparative purposes only and do not purport to be indicative of our operating results that would have been achieved had the Hittite Acquisition actually taken place on November 4, 2012. In addition, these results are not intended to be a projection of future results and do not reflect events that may occur after the Hittite Acquisition, including but not limited to revenue enhancements, cost savings or operating synergies that the combined Company may achieve as a result of the Hittite Acquisition. (thousands, except per share data) November 1, 2014Revenue $3,075,468Net income $778,049Basic net income per common share $2.48Diluted net income per common share $2.44Liquidity and Capital ResourcesAt October 29, 2016, our principal source of liquidity was $4.1 billion of cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments, of which approximately $725.8 million was held in the United States. The balance of our cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments was held outside the United States in various foreign subsidiaries. As we intend to reinvest substantially all of our foreign earnings indefinitely, the majority of cash held outside the United States is not available to meet certain aspects of our cash requirements in the United States, including cash dividends, principal and interest payments, and common stock repurchases. If these funds are needed for U.S. operations or can no longer be indefinitely reinvested outside the United States, we would be required to accrue and pay U.S. taxes to repatriate these funds and such amounts could be material. Our cash and cash equivalents consist of highly liquid investments with maturities of three months or less at the time of acquisition, including money market funds, and our short-term investments consist primarily of corporate obligations, such as commercial paper and floating rate notes, bonds and bank time deposits. We maintain these balances with high credit quality counterparties, continually monitor the amount of credit exposure to any one issuer and diversify our investments in order to minimize our credit risk. In connection with our proposed acquisition of Linear, in fiscal 2016 we obtained bridge financing commitments and entered into a term loan facility consisting of a 3-year unsecured term loan facility in the principal amount of $2.5 billion and a 5-year unsecured term loan facility in the principal amount of $2.5 billion. We expect to finance the proposed acquisition using both short- and long-term indebtedness totaling approximately $11.6 billion. In addition, in fiscal 2016 we amended and restated our existing revolving credit facility to allow for the increase in the amount of commitments to $1.0 billion from $750.0 million, subject to closing the acquisition of Linear and the satisfaction of certain other conditions. During the period prior to closing, we expect to incur fees and expenses related to the financing arrangements and the acquisition. See Note 16, Debt, of the Notes to our Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements contained in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further information. We believe that our existing sources of liquidity and cash expected to be generated from future operations, together with existing and anticipated available long-term financing, will be sufficient to fund operations, capital expenditures, research and development efforts and dividend payments (if any) in the immediate future and for at least the next twelve months. Fiscal Year 2016 2015 2014Net Cash Provided by Operations$1,280,895 $907,798 $871,602Net Cash Provided by Operations as a % of Revenue37.4% 26.4% 30.4%Net Cash Used for Investing Activities$(1,218,270) $(17,125) $(114,751)Net Used for Financing Activities$(22,917) $(571,603) $(576,610)At October 29, 2016, cash and cash equivalents totaled $921.1 million. The following changes contributed to the net increase in cash and cash equivalents of $36.8 million in fiscal 2016.34Operating Activities Cash provided by operating activities is net income adjusted for certain non-cash items and changes in assets and liabilities. The increase in cash provided by operating activities during fiscal 2016 as compared to fiscal 2015 was primarily due to changes in working capital and higher net income adjusted for non-cash items. Changes in working capital included a decrease in inventory and an increase in accounts receivable more fully described below under the heading Working Capital. Investing Activities Investing cash flows consist primarily of capital expenditures, investment purchases, maturities and sales of available-for-sale securities, as well as cash used for acquisitions. The increase in cash used for investing activities during fiscal 2016 as compared to fiscal 2015 was primarily due to an increase in the net purchases of available-for-sale securities and an increase in payments for acquisitions, partially offset by a decrease in property, plant and equipment additions.Financing Activities Financing cash flows consist primarily of payments of dividends to stockholders, repurchases of common stock, issuance and repayment of long-term debt, and proceeds from the sale of shares of common stock pursuant to employee equity incentive plans. The decrease in cash used for financing activities during fiscal 2016 as compared to fiscal 2015 was primarily due to net proceeds of $1.2 billion received from the issuance of the 2025 Notes and 2045 Notes, partially offset by $378.2 million of payments for the redemption of our 2016 Notes, an increase in stock repurchases of $143.1 million, a decrease in proceeds from the sale of shares of common stock pursuant to employee equity incentive plans of $61.1 million, payments of $33.4 million related to derivative instruments, payments of $26.6 million in deferred financing fees related to the proposed acquisition of Linear and an increase in dividend payments to shareholders of $22.1 million.

Days sales outstanding increased primarily as a result of an increase in average accounts receivable of 9% over the prior year.Inventory as of October 29, 2016 decreased as compared to the end of the fourth quarter of fiscal 2015 primarily as a result of our efforts to balance manufacturing production, demand and inventory levels. Our inventory levels are impacted by our need to support forecasted sales demand and variations between those forecasts and actual demand. Current liabilities decreased to $782.9 million at October 29, 2016 from $1.1 billion recorded at the end of fiscal 2015. The decrease was primarily the result of the redemption of the 2016 Notes in the first quarter of fiscal 2016, partially offset by an increase in deferred income on shipments to distributors as more fully described below.As of October 29, 2016 and October 31, 2015, we had gross deferred revenue of $432.3 million and $379.9 million, respectively, and gross deferred cost of sales of $80.8 million and $79.8 million, respectively. Deferred income on shipments to distributors increased in fiscal 2016 primarily as a result of higher demand for products sold into the channel. Sales to distributors are made under agreements that allow distributors to receive price-adjustment credits and to return qualifying products for credit, as determined by us, in order to reduce the amounts of slow-moving, discontinued or obsolete product from 35their inventory. Given the uncertainties associated with the levels of price-adjustment credits to be granted to distributors, the sales price to the distributors is not fixed or determinable until the distributors resell the products to their customers. Therefore, we defer revenue recognition from sales to distributors until the distributors have sold the products to their customers. The amount of price-adjustments is dependent on future overall market conditions, and therefore the levels of these adjustments could fluctuate significantly from period to period. To the extent that we experience a significant increase in the amount of credits we issue to our distributors, there could be a material impact on the ultimate revenue and gross margin recognized relating to these transactions. DebtAs of October 29, 2016, we had $1,732.2 million of carrying value outstanding on our debt. The difference in the carrying value of the debt and the principal amount of the debt is due to the unamortized discount and issuance fees on these instruments that will accrete to the face value of the debt over the term of the debt. Our debt obligations consist of the following: $500.0 Million Aggregate Principal Amount of 2.875% Senior Unsecured Notes (2023 Notes) On June 3, 2013, we issued the 2023 Notes with semi-annual fixed interest payments due on June 1 and December 1 of each year, commencing December 1, 2013.$850.0 Million Aggregate Principal Amount of 3.9% Senior Unsecured Notes (2025 Notes) and $400.0 Million Aggregate Principal Amount of 5.3% Senior Unsecured Notes (2045 Notes)On December 14, 2015, we issued the 2025 Notes and the 2045 Notes with semi-annual fixed interest payments due on June 15 and December 15 of each year, commencing June 15, 2016. The indentures governing the 2023 Notes, 2025 Notes and 2045 Notes contain covenants that may limit our ability to: incur, create, assume or guarantee any debt for borrowed money secured by a lien upon a principal property; enter into sale and lease-back transactions with respect to a principal property; and consolidate with or merge into, or transfer or lease all or substantially all of our assets to, any other party. As of October 29, 2016, we were compliant with these covenants. See Note 16, Debt, of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements contained in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further information on our outstanding debt.Revolving Credit FacilityOn July 10, 2015, we amended and restated our existing senior unsecured revolving credit facility with certain institutional lenders (the Credit Agreement) dated as of December 19, 2012. On September 23, 2016, we subsequently amended and restated the Credit Agreement. The Credit Agreement expires on July 10, 2020 and provides that the Company may borrow up to $750.0 million. Subject to closing the acquisition of Linear and the satisfaction of certain other conditions, the aggregate amount of commitments under the facility will increase to $1.0 billion from $750.0 million and the maximum covenant level will be temporally revised. To date, we have not borrowed under this credit facility, but we may borrow in the future and use the proceeds for repayment of existing indebtedness, stock repurchases, acquisitions, capital expenditures, working capital and other lawful corporate purposes. The terms of the facility impose restrictions on our ability to undertake certain transactions, to create certain liens on assets and to incur certain subsidiary indebtedness. In addition, the Credit Agreement contains a consolidated leverage ratio covenant of total consolidated funded debt to consolidated earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA) of not greater than 3.0 to 1.0. As of October 29, 2016, we were compliant with these covenants. See Note 15, Revolving Credit Facility, of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements contained in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further information on our revolving credit facility. Stock Repurchase ProgramOur common stock repurchase program has been in place since August 2004. In the aggregate, our Board of Directors has authorized us to repurchase $6.2 billion of our common stock under the program. Under the program, we may repurchase outstanding shares of our common stock from time to time in the open market and through privately negotiated transactions. Unless terminated earlier by resolution of our Board of Directors, the repurchase program will expire when we have repurchased all shares authorized under the program. As of October 29, 2016, we had repurchased a total of approximately 147.0 million shares of our common stock for approximately $5.4 billion under this program. As of October 29, 2016, an additional $792.5 million worth of shares remains available for repurchase under the current authorized program. The repurchased shares are held as authorized but unissued shares of common stock. We also from time to time repurchase shares in settlement of employee minimum tax withholding obligations due upon the vesting of restricted stock units. As a result of our proposed acquisition of Linear, we have temporarily suspended our share repurchase program. While we do not plan to resume share repurchases in the near term, we expect to continue repurchasing our common stock over the long-term.36Capital ExpendituresNet additions to property, plant and equipment were $127.4 million in fiscal 2016 and were funded with a combination of cash on hand and cash generated from operations. We expect capital expenditures for fiscal 2017 to be in the range of $125.0 million to $145.0 million. These capital expenditures will be funded with a combination of cash on hand and cash generated from operations.DividendsOn November 21, 2016, our Board of Directors declared a cash dividend of $0.42 per outstanding share of common stock. The dividend will be paid on December 13, 2016 to all shareholders of record at the close of business on December 2, 2016 and is expected to total approximately $129.4 million. We currently expect quarterly dividends to continue at $0.42 per share, although they remain subject to determination and declaration by our Board of Directors. The payment of future dividends, if any, will be based on several factors, including our financial performance, outlook and liquidity.Contractual ObligationsThe table below summarizes our contractual obligations and the amounts we owe under these contracts in specified periods as of October 29, 2016: Payment due by period Less than More than(thousands) Total 1 Year 1-3 Years 3-5 Years 5 YearsContractual obligations: Operating leases (a) $82,625 $34,328 $33,431 $11,472 $3,394Bridge financing obligations (b) 7,162 7,162 — — —Debt obligations 1,750,000 — — — 1,750,000Interest payments associated with debt obligations 1,040,950 68,725 137,450 137,450 697,325Deferred compensation plan (c) 26,916 764 — — 26,152Pension funding (d) 5,187 5,187 — — —Total $2,912,840 $116,166 $170,881 $148,922 $2,476,871_______________________________________(a)Certain of our operating lease obligations include escalation clauses. These escalating payment requirements are reflected in the table.(b)This payment reflects the amount of commitment and structuring fees related to bridge financing commitments, due upon the closing or termination of the proposed acquisition of Linear. The timing of due date of the payment is estimated based upon the estimated closing of date of the acquisition. See Note 16, Debt, of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements contained in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for more information on the bridge financing commitments. (c)These payments relate to obligations under our deferred compensation plan. The deferred compensation plan allows certain members of management and other highly-compensated employees and non-employee directors to defer receipt of all or any portion of their compensation. The amount in the “More than 5 Years” column of the table represents the remaining total balance under the deferred compensation plan to be paid to participants who have not terminated employment. Since we cannot reasonably estimate the timing of withdrawals for participants who have not yet terminated employment, we have included the future obligation to these participants in the “More than 5 Years” column of the table.(d)Our funding policy for our foreign defined benefit plans is consistent with the local requirements of each country. The payment obligations in the table are estimates of our expected contributions to these plans for fiscal year 2017. The actual future payments may differ from the amounts presented in the table and reasonable estimates of payments beyond one year are not practical because of potential future changes in variables, such as plan asset performance, interest rates and the rate of increase in compensation levels.Certain of our acquisitions involve the potential payment of contingent consideration. The table above does not reflect any such obligations, which could be up to $8.5 million, as the timing and amounts are uncertain. The table above does not reflect future obligations related to the long-term financing we have not yet incurred but expect to incur in connection with our proposed acquisition of Linear, as these obligations will be contingent upon the closing of the acquisition. These obligations consist of the expected issuance of approximately $11.6 billion in both short- and long-term 37indebtedness, plus the interest expense associated with them. See Note 16, Debt, of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements contained in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for more information on the financing commitments. As of October 29, 2016, our total liabilities associated with uncertain tax positions was $81.7 million, which are included in “Other non-current liabilities” in our consolidated balance sheet contained in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Due to the complexity associated with our deferred taxes and tax uncertainties, we cannot make a reasonably reliable estimate of the period in which we expect to settle the non-current liabilities associated with these deferred taxes and uncertain tax positions. Therefore, we have not included these deferred taxes and uncertain tax positions in the above contractual obligations table.The expected timing of payments and the amounts of the obligations discussed above are estimated based on current information available as of October 29, 2016.Off-balance Sheet ArrangementsAs of October 29, 2016, we had no off-balance sheet financing arrangements.New Accounting PronouncementsFrom time to time, new accounting pronouncements are issued by the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) and are adopted by us as of the specified effective date. Unless otherwise discussed, management believes that the impact of recently issued standards will not have a material impact on our future financial condition and results of operations. See Note 2t, New Accounting Pronouncements, of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements contained in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for a description of recently issued and adopted accounting pronouncements, including the dates of adoption and impact on our historical financial condition and results of operations.Revenue RecognitionIn May 2014, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update (ASU) 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (ASU 2014-09), which supersedes nearly all existing revenue recognition guidance under U.S. GAAP. The core principle of ASU 2014-09 is that an entity should recognize revenue to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. Additionally, the guidance requires improved disclosures to help users of financial statements better understand the nature, amount, timing, and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows arising from contracts with customers. The FASB has issued several amendments and updates to the new revenue standard, including guidance related to when an entity should recognize revenue gross as a principal or net as an agent and how an entity should identify performance obligations. As amended, ASU 2014-09 is effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning after December 15, 2017, which is our first quarter of fiscal 2019. Early adoption is permitted for all entities only as of annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2016, including interim reporting periods within that reporting period. As described in Note 2n, Revenue Recognition, of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements contained in Item 8 of this Annual Report on From 10-K, we defer revenue and the related cost of sales on shipments to distributors until the distributors resell the products to their customers. Upon adoption of ASU 2014-09, we will no longer be permitted to defer revenue until sale by the distributor to the end customer, but rather, will be required to estimate the effects of returns and allowances provided to distributors and record revenue at the time of sale to the distributor. We are continuing to evaluate the future impact and method of adoption of ASU 2014-09 and related amendments on our consolidated financial statements and related disclosures. We are considering early adoption of the new standard using the modified retrospective method in fiscal 2018. Our ability to early adopt the standard is dependent on system readiness and the completion of the analysis necessary to meet the requirements under ASU 2014-09. Critical Accounting Policies and EstimatesManagement’s discussion and analysis of the financial condition and results of operations is based upon the consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue and expenses, and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. We base our estimates and judgments on historical experience, knowledge of current conditions and beliefs of what could occur in the future based on available information. We consider the following accounting policies to be both those most important to the portrayal of our financial condition and those that require the most subjective judgment. If actual results differ significantly from management’s estimates and projections, there could be a material effect on our financial statements. We also have other policies that we consider key accounting policies, such as our policy for revenue recognition, including the deferral of revenue on sales to distributors until the products are sold to the end user; however, the application of these policies does not require us to make significant estimates or judgments that are difficult or subjective.38Revenue RecognitionRevenue from product sales to customers is generally recognized when title passes, which is upon shipment in the U.S. and for certain foreign counties. Revenue from product sales to other foreign countries is subsequent to product shipment. Title for these shipments to these other foreign countries ordinarily passes within a week of shipment. Accordingly, we defer the revenue recognized relating to these other foreign countries until title has passed. For multiple element arrangements, we allocate arrangement consideration among the elements based on the relative fair values of those elements as determined using vendor-specific objective evidence or third-party evidence. We use our best estimate of selling price to allocate arrangement consideration between the deliverables in cases where neither vendor-specific objective evidence nor third-party evidence is available. A reserve for sales returns and allowances for customers is recorded based on historical experience or specific identification of an event necessitating a reserve. Revenue from contracts with the United States government, government prime contractors and some commercial customers is generally recorded on a percentage of completion basis, using either units delivered or costs incurred as the measurement basis for progress toward completion. The output measure is used to measure results directly and is generally the best measure of progress toward completion in circumstances in which a reliable measure of output can be established. Estimated revenue in excess of amounts billed is reported as unbilled receivables. Contract accounting requires judgment in estimating costs and assumptions related to technical issues and delivery schedule. Contract costs include material, subcontract costs, labor and an allocation of indirect costs. The estimation of costs at completion of a contract is subject to numerous variables involving contract costs and estimates as to the length of time to complete the contract. Changes in contract performance, estimated gross margin, including the impact of final contract settlements, and estimated losses are recognized in the period in which the changes or losses are determined. In all regions of the world, we defer revenue and the related cost of sales on shipments to distributors until the distributors resell the products to their customers. As a result, our revenue fully reflects end customer purchases and is not impacted by distributor inventory levels. Sales to distributors are made under agreements that allow distributors to receive price-adjustment credits and to return qualifying products for credit, as determined by us, in order to reduce the amounts of slow-moving, discontinued or obsolete product from their inventory. These agreements limit such returns to a certain percentage of the value of our shipments to that distributor during the prior quarter. In addition, distributors are allowed to return unsold products if we terminate the relationship with the distributor. Given the uncertainties associated with the levels of price-adjustment credits to be granted to distributors, the sales price to the distributor is not fixed or determinable until the distributor resells the products to their customers. Therefore, we defer revenue recognition from sales to distributors until the distributors have sold the products to their customers.Inventory ValuationWe value inventories at the lower of cost (first-in, first-out method) or market. Because of the cyclical nature of the semiconductor industry, changes in inventory levels, obsolescence of technology, and product life cycles, we write down inventories to net realizable value. We employ a variety of methodologies to determine the net realizable value of inventory. While a portion of the calculation is determined via reference to the age of inventory and lower of cost or market calculations, an element of the calculation is subject to significant judgments made by us about future demand for our inventory. If actual demand for our products is less than our estimates, additional adjustments to existing inventories may need to be recorded in future periods. To date, our actual results have not been materially different than our estimates, and we do not expect them to be materially different in the future.Allowance for Doubtful AccountsWe maintain allowances for doubtful accounts, when appropriate, for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments. If the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate, our actual losses may exceed our estimates, and additional allowances would be required. To date, our actual results have not been materially different than our estimates, and we do not expect them to be materially different in the future.Long-Lived AssetsWe review property, plant, and equipment and finite lived intangible assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of assets may not be recoverable. Recoverability of these assets is determined by comparison of their carrying value to the estimated future undiscounted cash flows that the assets are expected to generate over their remaining estimated lives. If such assets are considered to be impaired, the impairment to be recognized in earnings equals the amount by which the carrying value of the assets exceeds their fair value determined by either a quoted market price, if any, or a value determined by utilizing a discounted cash flow technique. Although we have recognized no material impairment adjustments related to our property, plant, and equipment and identified intangible assets during the past three fiscal years, 39except those made in conjunction with restructuring actions, deterioration in our business in the future could lead to such impairment adjustments in future periods. Evaluation of impairment of long-lived assets requires estimates of future operating results that are used in the preparation of the expected future undiscounted cash flows. Actual future operating results and the remaining economic lives of our long-lived assets could differ from the estimates used in assessing the recoverability of these assets. These differences could result in impairment charges, which could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations. In addition, in certain instances, assets may not be impaired but their estimated useful lives may have decreased. In these situations, we amortize the remaining net book values over the revised useful lives. We review indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment annually, on the first day of the fourth quarter (on or about August 1) or more frequently if indicators of impairment exist. We perform a qualitative assessment on our indefinite-lived intangible assets to determine whether it is more likely-than not that the indefinite-lived intangible asset is impaired. If it is determined that the fair value of the indefinite-lived intangible asset is less than the carrying value, we would compare the fair value of the intangible asset with its carrying amount and recognize an impairment equal to any amount by which the carrying value of the assets exceeds the fair value.GoodwillGoodwill is subject to annual impairment tests or more frequently if indicators of potential impairment exist and suggest that the carrying value of goodwill may not be recoverable from estimated discounted future cash flows. We test goodwill for impairment at the reporting unit level (operating segment or one level below an operating segment) on an annual basis in the fourth quarter (on or about August 1) or more frequently if we believe indicators of impairment exist. For our latest annual impairment assessment that occurred as of July 31, 2016, we identified our reporting units to be our seven operating segments. The performance of the test involves a two-step process. The first step of the impairment test involves comparing the fair values of the applicable reporting units with their aggregate carrying values, including goodwill. We determine the fair value of our reporting units using a weighting of the income and market approaches. Under the income approach, we use a discounted cash flow methodology which requires management to make significant estimates and assumptions related to forecasted revenues, gross profit margins, operating income margins, working capital cash flow, perpetual growth rates, and long-term discount rates, among others. For the market approach, we use the guideline public company method. Under this method we utilize information from comparable publicly traded companies with similar operating and investment characteristics as the reporting units, to create valuation multiples that are applied to the operating performance of the reporting unit being tested, in order to obtain their respective fair values. In order to assess the reasonableness of the calculated reporting unit fair values, we reconcile the aggregate fair values of our reporting units determined, as described above, to its current market capitalization, allowing for a reasonable control premium. If the carrying amount of a reporting unit, calculated using the above approaches, exceeds the reporting unit’s fair value, we perform the second step of the goodwill impairment test to determine the amount of impairment loss. The second step of the goodwill impairment test involves comparing the implied fair value of the affected reporting unit’s goodwill with the carrying value of that reporting unit's goodwill.Business CombinationsUnder the acquisition method of accounting, we recognize tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their estimated fair values. We record the excess of the fair value of the purchase consideration over the value of the net assets acquired as goodwill. The accounting for business combinations requires us to make significant estimates and assumptions, especially with respect to intangible assets and the fair value of contingent payment obligations. Critical estimates in valuing purchased technology, customer lists and other identifiable intangible assets include future cash flows that we expect to generate from the acquired assets. If the subsequent actual results and updated projections of the underlying business activity change compared with the assumptions and projections used to develop these values, we could experience impairment charges which could be material. In addition, we have estimated the economic lives of certain acquired assets and these lives are used to calculate depreciation and amortization expense. If our estimates of the economic lives change, depreciation or amortization expenses could be accelerated or slowed.We record contingent consideration resulting from a business combination at its fair value on the acquisition date. We generally determine the fair value of the contingent consideration using the income approach methodology of valuation. Each reporting period thereafter, we revalue these obligations and record increases or decreases in their fair value as an adjustment to operating expenses within the consolidated statement of income. Changes in the fair value of the contingent consideration can result from changes in assumed discount periods and rates, and from changes pertaining to the achievement of the defined milestones. Significant judgment is employed in determining the appropriateness of these assumptions as of the acquisition date and for each subsequent period. Accordingly, future business and economic conditions, as well as changes in any of the assumptions described above, can materially impact the amount of contingent consideration expense we record in any given period.40Accounting for Income TaxesWe must make certain estimates and judgments in determining income tax expense for financial statement purposes. These estimates and judgments occur in the calculation of tax credits, benefits, and deductions, and in the calculation of certain tax assets and liabilities, which arise from differences in the timing of the recognition of revenue and expense for tax and financial statement purposes, as well as the interest and penalties relating to these uncertain tax positions. We assessed the likelihood of the realization of deferred tax assets and concluded that a valuation allowance is needed to reserve the amount of the deferred tax assets that may not be realized due to the uncertainty of the timing and amount of the realization of certain state credit carryovers. In reaching our conclusion, we evaluated certain relevant criteria including the existence of deferred tax liabilities that can be used to realize deferred tax assets, the taxable income in prior carryback years in the impacted state jurisdictions that can be used to absorb net operating losses and taxable income in future years. Our judgments regarding future profitability may change due to future market conditions, changes in U.S. or international tax laws and other factors. These changes, if any, may require material adjustments to these deferred tax assets, resulting in a reduction in net income or an increase in net loss in the period when such determinations are made, which in turn, may result in an increase or decrease to our tax provision in a subsequent period.We account for uncertain tax positions by determining if it is “more likely than not” that a tax position will be sustained by the appropriate taxing authorities prior to recording any benefit in the financial statements. An uncertain income tax position is not recognized if it has less than a 50% likelihood of being sustained. For those tax positions where it is more likely than not that a tax benefit will be sustained, we have recorded the largest amount of tax benefit with a greater than 50% likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement with a taxing authority that has full knowledge of all relevant information. For those income tax positions where it is not more likely than not that a tax benefit will be sustained, no tax benefit has been recognized in the financial statements. We reevaluate these uncertain tax positions on a quarterly basis. This evaluation is based on factors including, but not limited to, changes in known facts or circumstances, changes in tax law, effectively settled issues under audit, and new audit activity. A change in these factors would result in the recognition of a tax benefit or an additional charge to the tax provision.In the ordinary course of global business, there are many transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax outcome is uncertain. Some of these uncertainties arise as a consequence of cost reimbursement and royalty arrangements among related entities. Although we believe our estimates are reasonable, no assurance can be given that the final tax outcome of these matters will not be different than that which is reflected in our historical income tax provisions and accruals. In the event our assumptions are incorrect, the differences could have a material impact on our income tax provision and operating results in the period in which such determination is made. In addition to the factors described above, our current and expected effective tax rate is based on then-current tax law. Significant changes during the year in enacted tax law could affect these estimates.Stock-Based CompensationStock-based compensation expense associated with stock options and related awards is recognized in the consolidated statements of income. Determining the amount of stock-based compensation to be recorded requires us to develop estimates to be used in calculating the grant-date fair value of stock options and market-based restricted stock units. We calculate the grant-date fair values of stock options using the Black-Scholes valuation model. The use of valuation models requires us to make estimates of key assumptions such as expected option term and stock price volatility to determine the fair value of a stock option. The estimate of these key assumptions is based on historical information and judgment regarding market factors and trends. As it relates to our market-based restricted stock units, we utilize the Monte Carlo simulation valuation model to value these awards. The Monte Carlo simulation model utilizes multiple input variables that determine the probability of satisfying the performance conditions stipulated in the award grant and calculates the fair market value for the market-based restricted stock units granted. The Monte Carlo simulation model also uses stock price volatility and other variables to estimate the probability of satisfying the performance conditions, including the possibility that the market condition may not be satisfied, and the resulting fair value of the award. We recognize the expense related to these on a straight-line basis over the vesting period, which is generally five years for stock options and three years for restricted stock units. See Note 3, Stock-Based Compensation and Shareholders' Equity, of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements contained in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for more information related to stock based compensation.ContingenciesFrom time to time, in the ordinary course of business, various claims, charges and litigation are asserted or commenced against us arising from, or related to, contractual matters, patents, trademarks, personal injury, environmental matters, product liability, insurance coverage and personnel and employment disputes. We periodically assess each matter to determine if a contingent liability should be recorded. In making this determination, we may, depending on the nature of the matter, consult with internal and external legal counsel and technical experts. Based on the information we obtain, combined with our judgment regarding all the facts and circumstances of each matter, we determine whether it is probable that a contingent loss 41may be incurred and whether the amount of such loss can be reasonably estimated. If a loss is probable and reasonably estimable, we record a contingent loss. In determining the amount of a contingent loss, we consider advice received from experts in the specific matter, current status of legal proceedings, settlement negotiations that may be ongoing, prior case history and other factors. If the judgments and estimates made by us are incorrect, we may need to record additional contingent losses that could materially adversely impact our results of operations.42ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISKInterest Rate ExposureOur interest income and expense are sensitive to changes in the general level of interest rates. In this regard, changes in interest rates affect the interest earned on our marketable securities and short term investments, as well as the fair value of our investments and debt.Based on our marketable securities and short-term investments outstanding as of October 29, 2016 and October 31, 2015, our annual interest income would change by approximately $41 million and $27 million, respectively, for each 100 basis point increase in interest rates.To provide a meaningful assessment of the interest rate risk associated with our investment portfolio, we performed a sensitivity analysis to determine the impact a change in interest rates would have on the value of our investment portfolio assuming a 100 basis point parallel shift in the yield curve. Based on investment positions as of October 29, 2016 and October 31, 2015, a hypothetical 100 basis point increase in interest rates across all maturities would result in a $7 million and $5 million decline, respectively in the fair market value of the portfolio. Such losses would only be realized if we sold the investments prior to maturity.As of October 29, 2016, we had $1,750.0 million in principal amount of senior unsecured notes outstanding, which consisted of $500 million of 2.875% senior unsecured notes due June 1, 2023 (the 2023 Notes), $850 million of 3.9% senior unsecured notes due December 15, 2025 (the 2025 Notes) and $400 million of 5.3% senior unsecured notes due December 15, 2045 (the 2045 Notes). As of October 29, 2016, a hypothetical 100 basis point increase in market interest rates would reduce the fair value of our 2023 Notes, 2025 Notes and 2045 Notes outstanding by approximately $29 million, $66 million and $58 million, respectively.Foreign Currency ExposureAs more fully described in Note 2i in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements contained in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, we regularly hedge our non-U.S. dollar-based exposures by entering into forward foreign currency exchange contracts. The terms of these contracts are for periods matching the duration of the underlying exposure and generally range from one to twelve months. Currently, our largest foreign currency exposure is the Euro, primarily because our European operations have the highest proportion of our local currency denominated expenses. Relative to foreign currency exposures existing at October 29, 2016 and October 31, 2015, a 10% unfavorable movement in foreign currency exchange rates over the course of the year would result in approximately $8 million of losses and $8 million of gains, respectively, in changes in earnings or cash flows.The market risk associated with our derivative instruments results from currency exchange rates that are expected to offset the market risk of the underlying transactions, assets and liabilities being hedged. The counterparties to the agreements relating to our foreign exchange instruments consist of a number of major international financial institutions with high credit ratings. Based on the credit ratings of our counterparties as of October 29, 2016, we do not believe that there is significant risk of nonperformance by them. While the contract or notional amounts of derivative financial instruments provide one measure of the volume of these transactions, they do not represent the amount of our exposure to credit risk. The amounts potentially subject to credit risk (arising from the possible inability of counterparties to meet the terms of their contracts) are generally limited to the amounts, if any, by which the counterparties’ obligations under the contracts exceed our obligations to the counterparties.The following table illustrates the effect that a 10% unfavorable or favorable movement in foreign currency exchange rates, relative to the U.S. dollar, would have on the fair value of our forward exchange contracts as of October 29, 2016 and October 31, 2015: October 29, 2016 October 31, 2015Fair value of forward exchange contracts liability$(5,231) $(3,083)Fair value of forward exchange contracts after a 10% unfavorable movement in foreign currency exchange rates asset$11,744 $13,595Fair value of forward exchange contracts after a 10% favorable movement in foreign currency exchange rates liability$(23,277) $(18,736)The calculation assumes that each exchange rate would change in the same direction relative to the U.S. dollar. In addition to the direct effects of changes in exchange rates, such changes typically affect the volume of sales or the foreign currency sales price as competitors’ products become more or less attractive. Our sensitivity analysis of the effects of changes in foreign currency exchange rates does not factor in a potential change in sales levels or local currency selling prices.43REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRMThe Board of Directors and Shareholders Analog Devices, Inc.We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Analog Devices, Inc. as of October 29, 2016 and October 31, 2015, and the related consolidated statements of income, comprehensive income, shareholders' equity and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended October 29, 2016.

The categorization of revenue by end market is determined using a variety of data points including the technical characteristics of the product, the “sold to” customer information, the “ship to” customer information and the end customer product or application into which our product will be incorporated. As data systems for capturing and tracking this data evolve and improve, the categorization of products by end market can vary over time. When this occurs, we reclassify revenue by end market for prior periods. Such reclassifications typically do not materially change the sizing of, or the underlying trends of results within, each end market. 2017 2016 2015 Revenue % ofTotalProductRevenue Y/Y% Revenue % ofTotalProductRevenue Revenue % ofTotalProductRevenueIndustrial$2,361,549 46% 58% $1,497,070 44% $1,495,887 44%Automotive782,961 15% 45% 541,774 16% 526,493 15%Consumer1,047,606 21% 52% 687,697 20% 727,585 21%Communications915,387 18% 32% 694,868 20% 685,127 20%Total Revenue$5,107,503 100% 49% $3,421,409 100% $3,435,092 100%The industrial end market included $489.7 million of revenue as a result of the Acquisition in the fiscal year ended October 28, 2017 (fiscal 2017). Industrial end market revenue increased year-over-year, primarily as a result of the Acquisition and a broad-based increase in demand for our products in this end market. The automotive end market included $199.8 million of revenue as a result of the Acquisition in fiscal 2017. Automotive end market revenue increased year-over-year, primarily as a result of the Acquisition and a broad-based increase in demand for our products. The consumer end market included $36.2 million of revenue as a result of the Acquisition in fiscal 2017. Consumer end market revenue increased year-over-year, primarily as a result of an increased demand for products used in portable consumer applications and as a result of the Acquisition. The communications end market included $187.6 million of revenue as a result of the Acquisition in fiscal 2017. Communications end market revenue increased year-over-year primarily as a result of the Acquisition.28Automotive end market revenue increased year-over-year in the fiscal year ended October 29, 2016 (fiscal 2016) primarily as a result of increased demand for our powertrain, advanced driver assistance systems, and infotainment products. The year-over-year decrease in the consumer end market in fiscal 2016 was primarily the result of lower demand for products sold into portable consumer applications.Revenue Trends by Geographic RegionRevenue by geographic region, based upon the primary end customer location for fiscal 2017, fiscal 2016 and the fiscal year ended October 31, 2015 (fiscal 2015) was as follows: Change Fiscal Year 2017 over 2016 2016 over 2015 2017 2016 2015 $ Change % Change $ Change % ChangeUnited States$1,999,041 $1,299,629 $1,325,279 $699,412 54% $(25,650) (2)%Rest of North and South America103,077 95,957 97,189 7,120 7% (1,232) (1)%Europe1,211,435 924,849 939,230 286,586 31% (14,381) (2)%Japan506,114 291,649 319,569 214,465 74% (27,920) (9)%China842,532 575,690 511,365 266,842 46% 64,325 13 %Rest of Asia445,304 233,635 242,460 211,669 91% (8,825) (4)%Total Revenue$5,107,503 $3,421,409 $3,435,092 $1,686,094 49% $(13,683) — %In fiscal 2017, fiscal 2016 and fiscal 2015, the predominant countries comprising “Rest of North and South America” are Canada and Mexico; the predominant countries comprising “Europe” are Germany, Sweden, France and the United Kingdom; and the predominant countries comprising “Rest of Asia” are South Korea and Taiwan.On a regional basis, the United States and Rest of North and South America included $201.4 million and $6.4 million, respectively, of revenue as a result of the Acquisition in fiscal 2017. The increase in the United States year-over-year in fiscal 2017 was primarily a result of an increase in demand of our products sold into the consumer and industrial end markets and as a result of the Acquisition. Europe and Japan included $211.2 million and $123.7 million of revenue, respectively, as a result of the Acquisition in fiscal 2017.The sales increase in Europe and Japan year-over-year in fiscal 2017 was primarily a result of the Acquisition and an increase in demand of our products sold into the industrial end market. China included $213.6 million of revenue as a result of the Acquisition in fiscal 2017. The sales increase in China year-over-year in fiscal 2017 was primarily a result of the Acquisition and an increase in demand of our products sold into the industrial and automotive end markets. The Rest of Asia included $156.9 million of revenue as a result of the Acquisition in fiscal 2017. The sales increase in the Rest of Asia year-over year in 2017 was primarily a result of the Acquisition and an increase in demand of our products sold into the industrial and communications end markets. On a regional basis, the sales increase in China in fiscal 2016 as compared to fiscal 2015 was primarily the result of an increase in demand in the industrial, communications and automotive end markets. The sales decrease in Japan in fiscal 2016 as compared to fiscal 2015 was primarily a result of a decrease in demand for our products in the industrial end market. The sales decrease in the United States in fiscal 2016 as compared to fiscal 2015 was primarily the result of a decrease in demand in the consumer end markets.Gross Margin Change Fiscal Year 2017 over 2016 2016 over 2015 2017 2016 2015 $ Change % Change $ Change % ChangeGross Margin$3,061,596 $2,227,173 $2,259,262 $834,423 37% $(32,089) (1)%Gross Margin %59.9% 65.1% 65.8% Gross margin percentage in fiscal 2017 decreased by 520 basis points compared to fiscal 2016, primarily as a result of recording additional cost related to Acquisition accounting adjustments, including $358.7 million related to the sale of acquired inventory written up to fair value, $83.0 million related to amortization of acquired developed technology intangible assets, and $22.9 million of depreciation related to the write up of fixed assets to fair value. The increases in cost of sales as a result of 29Acquisition accounting adjustments were partially offset by favorable factory variances as a result of increased utilization at our manufacturing facilities.Gross margin percentage in fiscal 2016 decreased by 70 basis points compared to fiscal 2015, primarily as a result of lower utilization rates in our manufacturing facilities, partially offset by a mix shift in favor of higher margin products being sold.Research and Development (R&D) Change Fiscal Year 2017 over 2016 2016 over 2015 2017 2016 2015 $ Change % Change $ Change % ChangeR&D Expenses$968,602 $653,816 $637,459 $314,786 48% $16,357 3%R&D Expenses as a % of Revenue19.0% 19.1% 18.6% R&D expenses increased in fiscal 2017 as compared to fiscal 2016. Approximately $205.2 million of the overall increase was a result of the Acquisition. The remainder of the increase was primarily the result of an increase in variable compensation expense linked to our overall profitability and revenue growth and an increase in R&D employee and related benefit expenses and to a lesser extent an increase in operational spending. R&D expenses increased in fiscal 2016 as compared to fiscal 2015 primarily as a result of increases in R&D employee and related benefit expenses and operational spending, partially offset by a decrease in variable compensation expense linked to our overall profitability and revenue growth.R&D expenses as a percentage of revenue will fluctuate from year-to-year depending on the amount of revenue and the success of new product development efforts, which we view as critical to our future growth. We have hundreds of R&D projects underway, none of which we believe are material on an individual basis. We expect to continue the development of innovative technologies and processes for new products. We believe that a continued commitment to R&D is essential to maintain product leadership with our existing products as well as to provide innovative new product offerings, and therefore, we expect to continue to make significant R&D investments in the future.Selling, Marketing, General and Administrative (SMG&A) Change Fiscal Year 2017 over 2016 2016 over 2015 2017 2016 2015 $ Change % Change $ Change % ChangeSMG&A Expenses$691,046 $461,438 $478,972 $229,608 50% $(17,534) (4)%SMG&A Expenses as a % of Revenue13.5% 13.5% 13.9% SMG&A expenses increased in fiscal 2017 as compared to fiscal 2016 primarily as a result of the Acquisition and Acquisition-related costs.

Acquisition-related costs, which includes legal, accounting and other related fees resulting from the Acquisition increased $56.9 million in fiscal 2017 as compared to fiscal 2016. The remainder of the increase in SMG&A expenses was a result of increases in variable compensation expense linked to our overall profitability and revenue growth and an increase in SMG&A employee and related benefit expenses. SMG&A expenses decreased in fiscal 2016 as compared to fiscal 2015 primarily as a result of decreases in operational spending and variable compensation expense linked to our overall profitability and revenue growth, partially offset by an increase in SMG&A employee and related benefit expenses.30Amortization of Intangibles Change Fiscal Year 2017 over 2016 2016 over 2015 2017 2016 2015 $ Change % Change $ Change % ChangeAmortization expenses$297,351 $70,123 $88,318 $227,228 324% $(18,195) (21)%Amortization expenses as a % of revenue5.8% 2.0% 2.6% Amortization expenses increased in fiscal 2017 as compared to fiscal 2016 primarily as a result of the purchase of intangible assets as part of the Acquisition and to a lesser extent, other acquisitions in fiscal 2016 and fiscal 2017.Amortization expenses decreased in fiscal 2016 as compared to fiscal 2015 as a result of certain intangible assets becoming fully amortized during fiscal 2015.Special ChargesWe monitor global macroeconomic conditions on an ongoing basis, and continue to assess opportunities for improved operational effectiveness and efficiency and better alignment of expenses with revenues. As a result of these assessments, we have undertaken various restructuring actions over the past several years. The expense reductions relating to ongoing actions are described below.Early Retirement Offer ActionDuring the first quarter of fiscal 2017, we initiated an early retirement offer. This resulted in a special charge of approximately $41.3 million for severance, related benefits, and other costs in accordance with this program for 225 manufacturing, engineering and SMG&A employees. As of October 28, 2017, we still employed 26 of the 225 employees included in this cost reduction action. These employees must continue to be employed by us until their employment is terminated in order to receive the severance benefits. We expect this action will result in estimated annual salary, variable compensation and employee benefit savings of approximately $28.4 million once fully implemented.Reduction of Operating Costs ActionDuring the first quarter of fiscal 2017, we recorded special charges of approximately $8.1 million for severance and fringe benefit costs in accordance with our ongoing benefit plan or statutory requirements at foreign locations for 177 manufacturing, engineering and SMG&A employees. As of October 28, 2017, we still employed 10 of the 177 employees included in this cost reduction action. These employees must continue to be employed by us until their employment is terminated in order to receive the severance benefits. We expect this action will result in estimated annual salary, variable compensation and employee benefit savings of approximately $5.0 million once fully implemented.During fiscal 2016, we recorded special charges of approximately $13.7 million for severance and fringe benefit costs in accordance with our ongoing benefit plan for 123 manufacturing, engineering and SMG&A employees. As of October 28, 2017, we still employed 23 of the 123 employees included in these cost reduction actions. These employees must continue to be employed by us until their employment is terminated in order to receive the severance benefit.We expect that annual cost savings resulting from these actions will be used to make additional investments in products that we expect will drive revenue growth in the future. Other Operating ExpenseDuring fiscal 2015, we converted the benefits provided to participants in our Irish defined benefits pension plan to benefits provided under our Irish defined contribution plan. Retired pension plan participants received an annuity. As a result, in fiscal 2015 we recorded settlement charges, legal, accounting and other professional fees totaling $223.7 million to settle all existing and future Irish pension plan liabilities.31Operating Income Change Fiscal Year 2017 over 2016 2016 over 2015 2017 2016 2015 $ Change % Change $ Change % ChangeOperating income$1,055,134 $1,028,112 $830,841 $27,022 3% $197,271 24%Operating income as a % of Revenue20.7% 30.0% 24.2% The increase in operating income in fiscal 2017 as compared to fiscal 2016 was primarily the result of a $834.4 million increase in gross margin, partially offset by a $314.8 million increase in R&D expenses, a $229.6 million increase in SMG&A expenses, a $227.2 million increase in amortization expenses and a $35.8 million increase in special charges as more fully described above under the headings Research and Development (R&D), Selling, Marketing, General and Administrative (SMG&A), Amortization of Intangibles and Special Charges. The increase in operating income in fiscal 2016 as compared to fiscal 2015 was primarily the result of a $223.7 million decrease in other operating expense more fully described above under the heading Other Operating Expense, partially offset by a 70 basis point decrease in gross margin percentage.

See Note 16, Debt, of the Notes to our Consolidated Financial Statements contained in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further information on the debt issuances and commitments related to the Acquisition. The increase in nonoperating expense as a result of the increase in interest expense was partially offset by an increase in interest income due to higher interest rates earned on our investments, partially offset by lower cash balances in fiscal 2017 as compared to fiscal 2016.The increase in nonoperating expense in fiscal 2016 as compared to fiscal 2015 was primarily the result of an increase in interest expense as a result of the issuance of senior unsecured notes in fiscal 2016, and as a result of fees related to financing commitments entered into in anticipation of the Acquisition. These increases were partially offset by a decrease in interest expense as a result of the redemption of the $375.0 million aggregate principal amount of 3.0% senior unsecured notes (the 2016 Notes) in fiscal 2016. See Note 16, Debt, of the Notes to our Consolidated Financial Statements contained in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further information for further information on the issuance and redemption of these notes. The increase in nonoperating expense as a result of the increase in interest expense in fiscal 2016 as compared to fiscal 2015 was partially offset by an increase in interest income due to higher interest rates earned on our investments and the investment of higher cash balances in fiscal 2016 as compared to fiscal 2015.32Provision for Income Taxes Change Fiscal Year 2017 over 2016 2016 over 2015 2017 2016 2015 $ Change % Change $ Change % ChangeProvision for Income Taxes$101,226 $95,257 $113,236 $5,969 6% $(17,979) (16)%Effective Income Tax Rate12.2% 10.0% 14.0% Our effective tax rate reflects the applicable tax rate in effect in the various tax jurisdictions around the world where our income is earned. Our effective income tax rate can also be impacted each year by discrete factors or events.The tax rate for fiscal 2017 is below the U.S. federal statutory tax rate of 35% primarily due to lower statutory tax rates applicable to our operations in the foreign jurisdictions in which we earn income and a tax benefit of $50.5 million related to the reduction of reserves and related interest resulting from the U.S. Tax Court’s favorable ruling, offset by approximately $98.2 million of tax expense incurred during the year as part of the post-Acquisition integration. See Note 14, Income Taxes, of the Notes to our Consolidated Financial Statements contained in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further information on the U.S. Tax Court ruling. The tax rate for all other periods presented was below the U.S. federal statutory tax rate of 35%, primarily due to lower statutory tax rates applicable to our operations in the foreign jurisdictions in which we earn income. For example, the Company has a partial tax holiday in Singapore through August 2019 and a partial tax holiday through July 2025 in Malaysia. The impact on our provision for income taxes of income earned in foreign jurisdictions being taxed at rates different than the U.S. statutory rate was a foreign effective tax rate of approximately 7.8% in fiscal 2017 compared to a foreign effective tax rate of approximately 6.1% in fiscal 2016. Additionally, our effective tax rate in fiscal 2017 also included a tax benefit of approximately $15.0 million for the release of a state tax credit valuation allowance as a result of the Acquisition. Our effective tax rate for the fiscal 2016 included a tax benefit of $7.5 million from the reinstatement of the U.S. federal research and development tax credit in December 2015 retroactive to January 1, 2015. Our effective tax rate for fiscal 2015 was reduced as a result of $13.0 million recorded from the reversal of certain prior period tax liabilities, a tax benefit of $7.0 million from the reinstatement of the U.S. federal research and development tax credit in December 2014 retroactive to January 1, 2014 and a tax benefit of $3.8 million as a result of an acquisition accounting adjustment. In addition, our effective tax rate for fiscal 2015 included $2.0 million of discrete tax expense items associated with the U.S. provision to return adjustments.Non-U.S. jurisdictions accounted for approximately 77.3% of our total revenues in fiscal 2017, compared to approximately 77.7% of our total revenues for fiscal 2016 and 78.0% of our total revenues for fiscal 2015. This revenue generated outside of the U.S. results in a material portion of our pretax income being taxed outside the U.S., primarily in Bermuda and Ireland, at tax rates ranging from 0% to 35%. The impact on our effective tax rate related to income earned in foreign jurisdictions was reduced for fiscal 2017 as compared to fiscal 2016, as a result of increased depreciation, amortization and other expenses associated with Linear operations which are within foreign jurisdictions and subject to lower tax rates. A change in the mix of revenue and income earned in the U.S. and outside of the U.S. will have a direct impact on the overall effective tax rate in any given period.Net Income Change Fiscal Year 2017 over 2016 2016 over 2015 2017 2016 2015 $ Change % Change $ Change % ChangeNet Income$727,259 $861,664 $696,878 $(134,405) (16)% $164,786 24%Net Income, as a % of Revenue14.2% 25.2% 20.3% Diluted EPS$2.07 $2.76 $2.20 $(0.69) (25)% $0.56 25%The decrease in net income in fiscal 2017 as compared to fiscal 2016 was primarily a result of a $155.5 million increase in nonoperating expense and a $6.0 million increase in provision for income taxes, partially offset by a $27.0 million increase in operating income.The increase in net income in fiscal 2016 as compared to fiscal 2015 was primarily a result of a $197.3 million increase in operating income and a $18.0 million decrease in provision for income taxes, partially offset by a $50.5 million increase in nonoperating expense.33The impact of inflation and foreign currency exchange rate movement on our results of operations during the past three fiscal years has not been significant.Liquidity and Capital ResourcesAt October 28, 2017, our principal source of liquidity was $1.0 billion of cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments, of which approximately $379.2 million was held in the United States. The balance of our cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments was held outside the United States in various foreign subsidiaries. As we intend to reinvest substantially all of our foreign earnings indefinitely, the majority of cash held outside the United States is not available to meet certain aspects of our cash requirements in the United States, including cash dividends, and principal and interest payments. If these funds are needed for U.S. operations or can no longer be indefinitely reinvested outside the United States, under current tax law we would be required to accrue and pay U.S. taxes to repatriate these funds and such amounts could be material. Our cash and cash equivalents consist of highly liquid investments with maturities of three months or less, including money market funds. We maintain these balances with high credit quality counterparties, continually monitor the amount of credit exposure to any one issuer and diversify our investments in order to minimize our credit risk. In connection with the accounting for the Acquisition, we recorded approximately $1.6 billion of cash and marketable securities from Linear, which was remitted from foreign jurisdictions as part of our post-Acquisition integration. Also as part of the post-Acquisition integration, we remitted legacy cash held outside of the United States of approximately $3.6 billion. The remittances resulted in approximately $98.2 million in net tax expense recorded in fiscal 2017. We currently intend to use significant amounts of our remaining cash and cash equivalents held outside of the United States to finance obligations and current operations of our foreign businesses. On the Acquisition Date, we entered into a 90-day Bridge Credit Agreement that provided for unsecured loans in an aggregate principal amount of up to $4.1 billion and borrowed under a term loan agreement consisting of a 3-year unsecured term loan in the principal amount of $2.5 billion, due March 10, 2020 and a 5-year unsecured term loan in the principal amount of $2.5 billion, due March 10, 2022. In fiscal 2017, we repaid $550.0 million of principal on the 3-year unsecured term loan, repaid $400.0 million of principal on the 5-year unsecured term loan, and repaid all of the $4.1 billion of outstanding loans under the Bridge Credit Agreement. In addition, in fiscal 2016, we amended and restated our existing revolving credit facility to allow for the increase in the amount of commitments from $750.0 million to $1.0 billion at the closing of the Acquisition. See Note 15, Revolving Credit Facility and Note 16, Debt of the Notes to our Consolidated Financial Statements contained in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further information.We believe that our existing sources of liquidity and cash expected to be generated from future operations, together with existing and anticipated available long-term financing, will be sufficient to fund operations, capital expenditures, research and development efforts and dividend payments (if any) in the immediate future and for at least the next twelve months. Fiscal Year 2017 2016 2015Net Cash Provided by Operating Activities$1,112,592 $1,280,895 $907,798Net Cash Provided by Operating Activities as a % of Revenue21.8% 37.4% 26.4%Net Cash Used for Investing Activities$(6,618,014) $(1,218,270) $(17,125)Net Cash Provided by (Used for) Financing Activities$5,628,578 $(22,917) $(571,603)At October 28, 2017, cash and cash equivalents totaled $1,047.8 million. The following changes contributed to the net increase in cash and cash equivalents of $126.7 million in fiscal 2017.Operating ActivitiesCash provided by operating activities is net income adjusted for certain non-cash items and changes in assets and liabilities.The decrease in cash provided by operating activities during fiscal 2017, as compared to fiscal 2016, was primarily due to higher tax payments as a result of the post-Acquisition integration, and other changes in working capital. Investing ActivitiesInvesting cash flows consist primarily of capital expenditures, investment purchases, maturities and sales of available-for-sale securities, as well as cash used for acquisitions.The increase in cash used for investing activities during fiscal 2017 as compared to fiscal 2016, was primarily the result of cash payments made for the Acquisition, partially offset by a decrease in maturities of available for sale securities.34The increase in cash used for investing activities during fiscal 2016 as compared to fiscal 2015 was primarily due to an increase in the net purchases of available-for-sale securities and an increase in payments for acquisitions, partially offset by a decrease in property, plant and equipment additions.Financing ActivitiesFinancing cash flows consist primarily of payments of dividends to stockholders, repurchases of common stock, issuance and repayment of long-term debt, and proceeds from the sale of shares of common stock pursuant to employee equity incentive plans.The increase in cash provided by financing activities during fiscal 2017, as compared to fiscal 2016, was primarily due to an increase in net debt proceeds of $9.9 billion received from the issuance of senior unsecured notes, financing commitments entered into in connection with the Acquisition, consisting of a 90-day Bridge Credit Agreement and a term loan agreement, and a decrease in stock repurchases of $323.5 million due to the temporary suspension of our share repurchase program in connection with the Acquisition. These decreases were partially offset by payments of $5.1 billion related to financing commitments entered into in connection with the Acquisition consisting of repayments of $550.0 million of principal on the 3-year unsecured term loan, repayments of $400.0 million of principal on the 5-year unsecured term loan, and repayment of the $4.1 billion of outstanding loans under the Bridge Credit Agreement.The decrease in cash used for financing activities during fiscal 2016 as compared to fiscal 2015 was primarily due to net proceeds of $1.2 billion received from the issuance of the 2025 Notes and 2045 Notes, partially offset by $378.2 million of payments for the redemption of our 2016 Notes, an increase in stock repurchases of $143.1 million, a decrease in proceeds from the sale of shares of common stock pursuant to employee equity incentive plans of $61.1 million, payments of $33.4 million related to derivative instruments, payments of $26.6 million in deferred financing fees related to the acquisition of Linear and an increase in dividend payments to shareholders of $22.1 million.Working Capital Fiscal Year 2017 2016 $ Change% ChangeAccounts Receivable, net$688,953 $477,609 $211,34444%Days Sales Outstanding*43 50 Inventory$550,816 $376,555 $174,26146%Days Cost of Sales in Inventory*104 121 * We use the average of the current year and prior year ending net accounts receivable and ending inventory balance in our calculation of days sales outstanding and days cost of sales in inventory, respectively. Cost of sales amounts used in the calculation of days cost of sales in inventory for fiscal 2017 include Acquisition accounting adjustments related to the sale of acquired inventory written up to fair value, amortization of developed technology intangible assets acquired and depreciation related to the write up of fixed assets to fair value. The increase in accounts receivable in dollars was primarily the result of the Acquisition and to a lesser extent higher product shipments in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2017 as compared to the fourth quarter of fiscal 2016. The increase in inventory in dollars was primarily the result of the Acquisition and our efforts to balance manufacturing production, demand and inventory levels. Current liabilities increased to $1.6 billion at October 28, 2017 from $782.9 million recorded at the end of fiscal 2016. The increase was primarily due to an increase in the current portion of our debt, an increase in accrued liabilities as a result of the Acquisition, increases in accrued interest and accrued special charges, an increase in accounts payable resulting from higher production volumes and the Acquisition and an increase in deferred income on shipments made to distributors as more fully described below. As of October 28, 2017 and October 29, 2016, we had gross deferred revenue of $589.5 million and $432.3 million, respectively, and gross deferred cost of sales of $115.5 million and $80.8 million, respectively. Deferred income on shipments to distributors increased in fiscal 2017 primarily as a result of the Acquisition and higher demand for products sold into the channel. Sales to certain distributors are made under agreements that allow distributors to receive price-adjustment credits and to return qualifying products for credit, as determined by us, in order to reduce the amounts of slow-moving, discontinued or obsolete product from their inventory. Given the uncertainties associated with the levels of price-adjustment credits to be granted to certain distributors, the sales price to the distributors is not fixed or determinable until the distributors resell the products to their customers. Therefore, we defer revenue recognition from sales to certain distributors until such distributors 35have sold the products to their customers. The amount of price-adjustments is dependent on future overall market conditions, and therefore the levels of these adjustments could fluctuate significantly from period to period. To the extent that we experience a significant increase in the amount of credits we issue to our distributors, there could be a material impact on the ultimate revenue and gross margin recognized relating to these transactions.DebtAs of October 28, 2017, we had $7.9 billion of carrying value outstanding on our long-term debt. The difference in the carrying value of the debt and the principal is due to the unamortized discount and issuance fees on these instruments that will accrete to the face value over the term of the debt. Our debt obligations consist of the following:$500.0 Million Aggregate Principal Amount of 2.875% Senior Unsecured Notes (2023 Notes)On June 3, 2013, we issued the 2023 Notes with semi-annual fixed interest payments due on June 1 and December 1 of each year, commencing December 1, 2013.$850.0 Million Aggregate Principal Amount of 3.9% Senior Unsecured Notes (2025 Notes) and $400.0 Million Aggregate Principal Amount of 5.3% Senior Unsecured Notes (2045 Notes)On December 14, 2015, we issued the 2025 Notes and the 2045 Notes with semi-annual fixed interest payments due on June 15 and December 15 of each year, commencing June 15, 2016. $400 Million Aggregate Principal Amount of 2.5% Senior Unsecured Notes (2021 Notes), $550 Million Aggregate Principal Amount of 3.125% Senior Unsecured Notes (December 2023 Notes), $900 Million Aggregate Principal Amount of 3.5% Senior Unsecured Notes (2026 Notes) and $250 Million Aggregate Principal Amount of 4.5% Senior Unsecured Notes (2036 Notes)On December 5, 2016, we issued the 2021 Notes, the December 2023 Notes, the 2026 Notes and the 2036 Notes with semi-annual fixed interest payments due on June 5 and December 5 of each year, commencing June 5, 2017. The indentures governing the 2021 Notes, 2023 Notes, December 2023 Notes, 2025 Notes, 2026 Notes, 2036 Notes and 2045 Notes contain covenants that may limit our ability to: incur, create, assume or guarantee any debt for borrowed money secured by a lien upon a principal property; enter into sale and lease-back transactions with respect to a principal property; and consolidate with or merge into, or transfer or lease all or substantially all of our assets to, any other party. As of October 28, 2017, we were compliant with these covenants. See Note 16, Debt, of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements contained in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further information on our outstanding debt.$5.0 Billion Aggregate Principal Term LoansOn the Acquisition Date, we drew down on a 3-year unsecured term loan in the principal amount of $2.5 billion, due March 10, 2020 and a 5-year unsecured term loan in the principal amount of $2.5 billion, due March 10, 2022. In fiscal 2017, we repaid $550.0 million of principal on the 3-year unsecured term loan and repaid $400.0 million of principal on the 5-year unsecured term loan.Revolving Credit FacilityWe have a senior unsecured revolving credit facility with certain institutional lenders (the Credit Agreement) that expires on July 10, 2020. The Credit Agreement provides that we may borrow up to $1.0 billion. To date, we have not borrowed under this credit facility, but we may borrow in the future and use the proceeds for repayment of existing indebtedness, stock repurchases, acquisitions, capital expenditures, working capital and other lawful corporate purposes. The terms of the Credit Agreement impose restrictions on our ability to undertake certain transactions, to create certain liens on assets and to incur certain subsidiary indebtedness. In addition, the Credit Agreement contains a consolidated leverage ratio covenant of total consolidated funded debt to consolidated earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA) of not greater than 5.0 to 1.0. The debt covenant will be reduced over time to 3.0 to 1.0 starting in May 2018. As of October 28, 2017, we were compliant with these covenants. See Note 15, Revolving Credit Facility, of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements contained in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further information on our revolving credit facility.Stock Repurchase ProgramOur common stock repurchase program has been in place since August 2004. In the aggregate, our Board of Directors has authorized us to repurchase $6.2 billion of our common stock under the program. Under the program, we may repurchase outstanding shares of our common stock from time to time in the open market and through privately negotiated transactions. Unless terminated earlier by resolution of our Board of Directors, the repurchase program will expire when we have 36repurchased all shares authorized under the program. As of October 28, 2017, we had repurchased a total of approximately 147.0 million shares of our common stock for approximately $5.4 billion under this program. As of October 28, 2017, an additional $792.5 million remains available for repurchase under the current authorized program. The repurchased shares are held as authorized but unissued shares of common stock. In connection with the Acquisition, we have temporarily suspended our share repurchase program. While we do not plan to resume share repurchases in the near term, we expect to continue repurchasing our common stock over the long-term. We also from time to time repurchase shares in settlement of employee minimum tax withholding obligations due upon the vesting of restricted stock units. Capital ExpendituresNet additions to property, plant and equipment were $204.1 million in fiscal 2017 and were funded with a combination of cash on hand and cash generated from operations. We expect capital expenditures for the fiscal year ending November 3, 2018 (fiscal 2018) to be in the range of $230.0 million to $270.0 million. These capital expenditures will be funded with a combination of cash on hand and cash generated from operations.DividendsOn November 20, 2017, our Board of Directors declared a cash dividend of $0.45 per outstanding share of common stock. The dividend will be paid on December 12, 2017 to all shareholders of record at the close of business on December 1, 2017 and is expected to total approximately $166 million. We currently expect quarterly dividends to continue at $0.45 per share, although they remain subject to determination and declaration by our Board of Directors. The payment of future dividends, if any, will be based on several factors, including our financial performance, outlook and liquidity.Contractual ObligationsThe table below summarizes our contractual obligations and the amounts we owe under these contracts in specified periods as of October 28, 2017: Payment due by period Less than More than(thousands) Total 1 Year 1-3 Years 3-5 Years 5 YearsContractual obligations: Operating leases (a) $142,913 $41,795 $41,142 $22,398 $37,578Debt obligations (b) 7,900,000 300,000 1,937,500 2,212,500 3,450,000Interest payments associated with debt obligations 1,956,164 232,202 437,494 327,212 959,256Deferred compensation plan (c) 33,510 938 — — 32,572Pension funding (d) 4,978 4,978 — — —Total $10,037,565 $579,913 $2,416,136 $2,562,110 $4,479,406_______________________________________(a)Certain of our operating lease obligations include escalation clauses. These escalating payment requirements are reflected in the table.(b)On November 10, 2017 we pre-paid $300.0 million of principal on the 3-year unsecured term loan. This amount was not contractually due under the terms of the loan. As such this amount is classified as current debt as of October 28, 2017. (c)These payments relate to obligations under our deferred compensation plan. The deferred compensation plan allows certain members of management and other highly-compensated employees and non-employee directors to defer receipt of all or any portion of their compensation. The amount in the “More than 5 Years” column of the table represents the remaining total balance under the deferred compensation plan to be paid to participants who have not terminated employment. Since we cannot reasonably estimate the timing of withdrawals for participants who have not yet terminated employment, we have included the future obligation to these participants in the “More than 5 Years” column of the table.(d)Our funding policy for our foreign defined benefit plans is consistent with the local requirements of each country. The payment obligations in the table are estimates of our expected contributions to these plans for fiscal year 2018. The actual future payments may differ from the amounts presented in the table and reasonable estimates of payments beyond one year are not practical because of potential future changes in variables, such as plan asset performance, interest rates and the rate of increase in compensation levels.Certain of our acquisitions involve the potential payment of contingent consideration. The table above does not reflect any such obligations, which could be up to $8.5 million, as the timing and amounts are uncertain. 37As of October 28, 2017, our total liabilities associated with uncertain tax positions was $49.6 million, which are included in “Other non-current liabilities” in our consolidated balance sheet contained in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Due to the complexity associated with our deferred taxes and tax uncertainties, we cannot make a reasonably reliable estimate of the period in which we expect to settle the non-current liabilities associated with these deferred taxes and uncertain tax positions. Therefore, we have not included these deferred taxes and uncertain tax positions in the above contractual obligations table.The expected timing of payments and the amounts of the obligations discussed above are estimated based on current information available as of October 28, 2017.Off-balance Sheet ArrangementsAs of October 28, 2017, we had no off-balance sheet financing arrangements.New Accounting PronouncementsFrom time to time, new accounting pronouncements are issued by the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) and are adopted by us as of the specified effective date. Unless otherwise discussed, management believes that the impact of recently issued standards will not have a material impact on our future financial condition and results of operations. See Note 2t, New Accounting Pronouncements, of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements contained in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for a description of recently issued and adopted accounting pronouncements, including the dates of adoption and impact on our historical financial condition and results of operations.Revenue RecognitionIn May 2014, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update (ASU) 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (ASU 2014-09), which supersedes nearly all existing revenue recognition guidance under generally accepted accounting principles in the United States (U.S. GAAP). The core principle of ASU 2014-09 is that an entity should recognize revenue to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. Additionally, the guidance requires improved disclosures to help users of financial statements better understand the nature, amount, timing, and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows arising from contracts with customers. The FASB has issued several amendments and updates to the new revenue standard, including guidance related to when an entity should recognize revenue gross as a principal or net as an agent and how an entity should identify performance obligations. As amended, ASU 2014-09 is effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning after December 15, 2017, which is our first quarter of the fiscal year ending November 2, 2019 (fiscal 2019). Early adoption is permitted for all entities only as of annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2016, including interim reporting periods within that reporting period. We have developed a project plan for the implementation of the guidance, including a review of all revenue streams to identify any differences in the timing, measurement or presentation of revenue recognition. We have reviewed our revenue streams and are nearing completion in assessing all potential impacts of the standard, including any impacts from recently issued amendments, and retrospectively adjusting financial information for prior fiscal years under the full retrospective transition method. We have also made progress on our impact assessment of the Acquisition. While we are still in the process of completing our evaluation of the standard, we currently believe the most significant impact will be related to the timing of recognition of sales to certain distributors. As described in Note 2n, Revenue Recognition, of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements contained in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, we currently defer revenue and the related cost of sales on shipments to certain distributors until the distributors resell the products to their customers. Upon adoption of ASU 2014-09, we will no longer be permitted to defer revenue until sale by the distributor to the end customer, but rather, will be required to estimate the effects of returns and allowances provided to distributors and record revenue at the time of sale to the distributor. We are continuing to evaluate the future impact and method of adoption of ASU 2014-09 and related amendments on our consolidated financial statements and related disclosures. We will adopt ASU 2014-09, using the full retrospective method, upon its effective date for us which is our first quarter of fiscal 2019. Critical Accounting Policies and EstimatesManagement’s discussion and analysis of the financial condition and results of operations is based upon the consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue and expenses, and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. We base our estimates and judgments on historical experience, knowledge of current conditions and beliefs of what could occur in the future based on available information. We consider the following accounting policies to be both those most important to the portrayal of our financial condition and those that require the most subjective judgment. If actual results differ significantly from management’s estimates and projections, there could be a 38material effect on our financial statements. We also have other policies that we consider key accounting policies, such as our policy for revenue recognition, including the deferral of revenue on sales to distributors until the products are sold to the end user; however, the application of these policies does not require us to make significant estimates or judgments that are difficult or subjective.Revenue RecognitionRevenue from product sales to customers is generally recognized when title passes, which is upon shipment in the U.S. and in certain foreign counties. Revenue from product sales to other foreign countries is recognized subsequent to product shipment. Title for these shipments to these other foreign countries ordinarily passes within a week of shipment. Accordingly, we defer the revenue recognized relating to these other foreign countries until title has passed. For multiple element arrangements, we allocate arrangement consideration among the elements based on the relative fair values of those elements as determined using vendor-specific objective evidence or third-party evidence. We use our best estimate of selling price to allocate arrangement consideration between the deliverables in cases where neither vendor-specific objective evidence nor third-party evidence is available. A reserve for sales returns and allowances for customers is recorded based on historical experience or specific identification of an event necessitating a reserve. Revenue from contracts with the United States government, government prime contractors and some commercial customers is generally recorded on a percentage of completion basis, using either units delivered or costs incurred as the measurement basis for progress toward completion. The output measure is used to measure results directly and is generally the best measure of progress toward completion in circumstances in which a reliable measure of output can be established. Estimated revenue in excess of amounts billed is reported as unbilled receivables. Contract accounting requires judgment in estimating costs and assumptions related to technical issues and delivery schedule. Contract costs include material, subcontract costs, labor and an allocation of indirect costs. The estimation of costs at completion of a contract is subject to numerous variables involving contract costs and estimates as to the length of time to complete the contract. Changes in contract performance, estimated gross margin, including the impact of final contract settlements, and estimated losses are recognized in the period in which the changes or losses are determined. Revenue from product sales to certain international distributors are made under agreements that permit limited stock return privileges but not sales price rebates. Revenue on these sales is recognized upon shipment at which time title passes. We defer revenue and the related cost of sales on shipments to U.S. distributors and certain international distributors until the distributors resell the products to their customers. As a result, our revenue fully reflects end customer purchases and is not impacted by distributor inventory levels. Sales to certain of these distributors are made under agreements that allow such distributors to receive price-adjustment credits and to return qualifying products for credit, as determined by us, in order to reduce the amounts of slow-moving, discontinued or obsolete product from their inventory. These agreements limit such returns to a certain percentage of the value of our shipments to that distributor during the prior quarter. In addition, such distributors are allowed to return unsold products if the Company terminates the relationship with the distributor. Given the uncertainties associated with the levels of price-adjustment credits to be granted to certain distributors, the sales price to the distributor is not fixed or determinable until the distributor resells the products to their customers. Therefore, we defer revenue recognition from sales to certain distributors until such distributors have sold the products to their customers.Inventory ValuationWe value inventories at the lower of cost (first-in, first-out method) or market. Because of the cyclical nature of the semiconductor industry, changes in inventory levels, obsolescence of technology, and product life cycles, we write down inventories to net realizable value. We employ a variety of methodologies to determine the net realizable value of inventory. While a portion of the calculation is determined via reference to the age of inventory and lower of cost or market calculations, an element of the calculation is subject to significant judgments made by us about future demand for our inventory. If actual demand for our products is less than our estimates, additional adjustments to existing inventories may need to be recorded in future periods. To date, our actual results have not been materially different than our estimates, and we do not expect them to be materially different in the future.Allowance for Doubtful AccountsWe maintain allowances for doubtful accounts, when appropriate, for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments. If the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate, our actual losses may exceed our estimates, and additional allowances would be required. To date, our actual results have not been materially different than our estimates, and we do not expect them to be materially different in the future.39Long-Lived AssetsWe review property, plant, and equipment and finite lived intangible assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of assets may not be recoverable. Recoverability of these assets is determined by comparison of their carrying value to the estimated future undiscounted cash flows that the assets are expected to generate over their remaining estimated lives. If such assets are considered to be impaired, the impairment to be recognized in earnings equals the amount by which the carrying value of the assets exceeds their fair value determined by either a quoted market price, if any, or a value determined by utilizing a discounted cash flow technique. Although we have recognized no material impairment adjustments related to our property, plant, and equipment and identified intangible assets during the past three fiscal years, except those made in conjunction with restructuring actions, deterioration in our business in the future could lead to such impairment adjustments in future periods. Evaluation of impairment of long-lived assets requires estimates of future operating results that are used in the preparation of the expected future undiscounted cash flows. Actual future operating results and the remaining economic lives of our long-lived assets could differ from the estimates used in assessing the recoverability of these assets. These differences could result in impairment charges, which could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations. In addition, in certain instances, assets may not be impaired but their estimated useful lives may have decreased. In these situations, we amortize the remaining net book values over the revised useful lives. We review indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment annually, on the first day of the fourth quarter (on or about August 1) or more frequently if indicators of impairment exist. We perform a qualitative assessment on our indefinite-lived intangible assets to determine whether it is more likely-than not that the indefinite-lived intangible asset is impaired. If it is determined that the fair value of the indefinite-lived intangible asset is less than the carrying value, we would compare the fair value of the intangible asset with its carrying amount and recognize an impairment equal to any amount by which the carrying value of the assets exceeds the fair value.GoodwillGoodwill is subject to annual impairment tests or more frequently if indicators of potential impairment exist and suggest that the carrying value of goodwill may not be recoverable from estimated discounted future cash flows. We test goodwill for impairment at the reporting unit level (operating segment or one level below an operating segment) on an annual basis in the fourth quarter (on or about August 1) or more frequently if we believe indicators of impairment exist. For our latest annual impairment assessment that occurred as of July 30, 2017, we identified our reporting units to be our eight operating segments. The goodwill impairment test requires an entity to compare the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying amount. If fair value is determined to be less than carrying value, an impairment loss is recognized for the amount of the carrying value that exceeds the amount of the reporting unit's fair value, not to exceed the total amount of goodwill allocated to the reporting unit. Additionally, we consider income tax effects from any tax deductible goodwill on the carrying amount of the reporting unit when measuring the goodwill impairment loss, if applicable. We determine the fair value of our reporting units using a weighting of the income and market approaches. Under the income approach, we use a discounted cash flow methodology which requires management to make significant estimates and assumptions related to forecasted revenues, gross profit margins, operating income margins, working capital cash flow, perpetual growth rates, and long-term discount rates, among others. For the market approach, we use the guideline public company method. Under this method we utilize information from comparable publicly traded companies with similar operating and investment characteristics as the reporting units, to create valuation multiples that are applied to the operating performance of the reporting unit being tested, in order to obtain their respective fair values. In order to assess the reasonableness of the calculated reporting unit fair values, we reconcile the aggregate fair values of our reporting units determined, as described above, to its current market capitalization, allowing for a reasonable control premium. Business CombinationsUnder the acquisition method of accounting, we recognize tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their estimated fair values. We record the excess of the fair value of the purchase consideration over the value of the net assets acquired as goodwill. The accounting for business combinations requires us to make significant estimates and assumptions, especially with respect to intangible assets and the fair value of contingent payment obligations. Critical estimates in valuing purchased technology, customer lists and other identifiable intangible assets include future cash flows that we expect to generate from the acquired assets. If the subsequent actual results and updated projections of the underlying business activity change compared with the assumptions and projections used to develop these values, we could experience impairment charges which could be material. In addition, we have estimated the economic lives of certain acquired assets and these lives are used to calculate depreciation and amortization expense. If our estimates of the economic lives change, depreciation or amortization expenses could be accelerated or slowed.We record contingent consideration resulting from a business combination at its fair value on the acquisition date. We generally determine the fair value of the contingent consideration using the income approach methodology of valuation. Each reporting period thereafter, we revalue these obligations and record increases or decreases in their fair value as an adjustment to 40operating expenses within the consolidated statement of income. Changes in the fair value of the contingent consideration can result from changes in assumed discount periods and rates, and from changes pertaining to the achievement of the defined milestones. Significant judgment is employed in determining the appropriateness of these assumptions as of the acquisition date and for each subsequent period. Accordingly, future business and economic conditions, as well as changes in any of the assumptions described above, can materially impact the amount of contingent consideration expense we record in any given period.Accounting for Income TaxesWe must make certain estimates and judgments in determining income tax expense for financial statement purposes. These estimates and judgments occur in the calculation of tax credits, benefits, and deductions, and in the calculation of certain tax assets and liabilities, which arise from differences in the timing of the recognition of revenue and expense for tax and financial statement purposes, as well as the interest and penalties relating to these uncertain tax positions. We assessed the likelihood of the realization of deferred tax assets and concluded that a valuation allowance is needed to reserve the amount of the deferred tax assets that may not be realized due to the uncertainty of the timing and amount of the realization of certain state credit carryovers. In reaching our conclusion, we evaluated certain relevant criteria including the existence of deferred tax liabilities that can be used to realize deferred tax assets, the taxable income in prior carryback years in the impacted state jurisdictions that can be used to absorb net operating losses and taxable income in future years. Our judgments regarding future profitability may change due to future market conditions, changes in U.S. or international tax laws and other factors. These changes, if any, may require material adjustments to these deferred tax assets, resulting in a reduction in net income or an increase in net loss in the period when such determinations are made, which in turn, may result in an increase or decrease to our tax provision in a subsequent period.We account for uncertain tax positions by determining if it is “more likely than not” that a tax position will be sustained by the appropriate taxing authorities prior to recording any benefit in the financial statements. An uncertain income tax position is not recognized if it has less than a 50% likelihood of being sustained. For those tax positions where it is more likely than not that a tax benefit will be sustained, we have recorded the largest amount of tax benefit with a greater than 50% likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement with a taxing authority that has full knowledge of all relevant information. For those income tax positions where it is not more likely than not that a tax benefit will be sustained, no tax benefit has been recognized in the financial statements. We reevaluate these uncertain tax positions on a quarterly basis. This evaluation is based on factors including, but not limited to, changes in known facts or circumstances, changes in tax law, effectively settled issues under audit, and new audit activity. A change in these factors would result in the recognition of a tax benefit or an additional charge to the tax provision.In the ordinary course of global business, there are many transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax outcome is uncertain. Some of these uncertainties arise as a consequence of cost reimbursement and royalty arrangements among related entities. Although we believe our estimates are reasonable, no assurance can be given that the final tax outcome of these matters will not be different than that which is reflected in our historical income tax provisions and accruals. In the event our assumptions are incorrect, the differences could have a material impact on our income tax provision and operating results in the period in which such determination is made. In addition to the factors described above, our current and expected effective tax rate is based on then-current tax law. Significant changes during the year in enacted tax law could affect these estimates.Stock-Based CompensationStock-based compensation expense associated with stock options and related awards is recognized in the consolidated statements of income. Determining the amount of stock-based compensation to be recorded requires us to develop estimates to be used in calculating the grant-date fair value of stock options and market-based restricted stock units. We calculate the grant-date fair values of stock options using the Black-Scholes valuation model. The use of valuation models requires us to make estimates of key assumptions such as expected option term and stock price volatility to determine the fair value of a stock option. The estimate of these key assumptions is based on historical information and judgment regarding market factors and trends. As it relates to our market-based restricted stock units, we utilize the Monte Carlo simulation valuation model to value these awards. The Monte Carlo simulation model utilizes multiple input variables that determine the probability of satisfying the performance conditions stipulated in the award grant and calculates the fair market value for the market-based restricted stock units granted. The Monte Carlo simulation model also uses stock price volatility and other variables to estimate the probability of satisfying the performance conditions, including the possibility that the market condition may not be satisfied, and the resulting fair value of the award. We recognize the expense related to these on a straight-line basis over the vesting period, which is generally five years for stock options and three years for restricted stock units. See Note 3, Stock-Based Compensation and Shareholders' Equity, of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements contained in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for more information related to stock based compensation.41ContingenciesFrom time to time, in the ordinary course of business, various claims, charges and litigation are asserted or commenced against us arising from, or related to, contractual matters, patents, trademarks, personal injury, environmental matters, product liability, insurance coverage and personnel and employment disputes. We periodically assess each matter to determine if a contingent liability should be recorded. In making this determination, we may, depending on the nature of the matter, consult with internal and external legal counsel and technical experts. Based on the information we obtain, combined with our judgment regarding all the facts and circumstances of each matter, we determine whether it is probable that a contingent loss may be incurred and whether the amount of such loss can be reasonably estimated. If a loss is probable and reasonably estimable, we record a contingent loss. In determining the amount of a contingent loss, we consider advice received from experts in the specific matter, current status of legal proceedings, settlement negotiations that may be ongoing, prior case history and other factors. If the judgments and estimates made by us are incorrect, we may need to record additional contingent losses that could materially adversely impact our results of operations.42ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISKInterest Rate ExposureOur interest income and expense are sensitive to changes in the general level of interest rates. In this regard, changes in interest rates affect the interest earned on our marketable securities and short term investments, as well as the fair value of our investments and debt.In fiscal 2017, we borrowed $2.5 billion of 3-year term loans, $2.5 billion of 5-year term loans and a $4.1 billion bridge loan as part of the financing for the Acquisition. During fiscal 2017, we repaid $550.0 million of principal on the 3-year unsecured term loan, repaid $400.0 million of principal on the 5-year unsecured term loan and repaid all of the $4.1 billion of the bridge loan. The term loans accrue interest at a floating rate, equal to the LIBOR rate corresponding with the tenor of the borrowing period plus the applicable spread (112.5 basis points for the bridge loan and 3-year term loan and 125 basis points for the 5-year term loan). Based on the $4.1 billion of floating rate debt outstanding as of October 28, 2017, our annual interest expense would change by approximately $23.7 million for each 100 basis point increase in interest rates.Based on our marketable securities and short-term investments outstanding as of October 28, 2017 and October 29, 2016, our annual interest income would change by approximately $10.5 million and $41 million, respectively, for each 100 basis point increase in interest rates.To provide a meaningful assessment of the interest rate risk associated with our investment portfolio, we performed a sensitivity analysis to determine the impact a change in interest rates would have on the value of our investment portfolio assuming a 100 basis point parallel shift in the yield curve. Based on investment positions as of October 28, 2017 and October 29, 2016, a hypothetical 100 basis point increase in interest rates across all maturities would result in a $0.1 million and $7 million decline, respectively, in the fair market value of the portfolio. Such losses would only be realized if we sold the investments prior to maturity.As of October 28, 2017, we had $3.9 billion in principal amount of senior unsecured notes outstanding, with a fair value of $4.0 billion. The fair value of our notes is subject to interest rate risk, market risk, and other factors. Generally, the fair value of our notes will increase as interest rates fall and decrease as interest rates rise. The fair values of our notes as of October 28, 2017 and October 29, 2016, assuming a hypothetical 100 basis point increase in market interest rates, are as follows: October 28, 2017 October 29, 2016(thousands)Principal Amount OutstandingFair Value Fair Value given an increase in interest rates of 100 basis points Principal Amount OutstandingFair Value as of October 29, 2016 Fair Value given an increase in interest rates of 100 basis points2021 Notes, due December 2021$400,000399,530 384,374 $—$— $—2023 Notes, due June 2023$500,000498,582 473,727 $500,000$501,307 $472,3872023 Notes, due December 2023$550,000554,411 524,718 $—$— $—2025 Notes, due December 2025$850,000884,861 825,700 $850,000$901,523 $835,1622026 Notes, due December 2026$900,000902,769 835,891 $—$— $—2036 Notes, due December 2036$250,000259,442 228,671 $—$— $—2045 Notes, due December 2045$400,000460,588 396,506 $400,000$425,109 $367,134Foreign Currency ExposureAs more fully described in Note 2i, Derivative and Hedging Agreements, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements contained in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, we regularly hedge our non-U.S. dollar-based exposures by entering into forward foreign currency exchange contracts. The terms of these contracts are for periods matching the duration of the underlying exposure and generally range from one to twelve months. Currently, our largest foreign currency exposure is the Euro, primarily because our European operations have the highest proportion of our local currency denominated expenses. Relative to foreign currency exposures existing at October 28, 2017 and October 29, 2016, a 10% unfavorable movement in foreign currency exchange rates over the course of the year would result in approximately $10.1 million of losses and $8.0 million of losses, respectively, in changes in earnings or cash flows.The market risk associated with our derivative instruments results from currency exchange rates that are expected to offset the market risk of the underlying transactions, assets and liabilities being hedged. The counterparties to the agreements relating to our foreign exchange instruments consist of a number of major international financial institutions with high credit ratings. Based on the credit ratings of our counterparties as of October 28, 2017, we do not believe that there is significant risk 43of nonperformance by them. While the contract or notional amounts of derivative financial instruments provide one measure of the volume of these transactions, they do not represent the amount of our exposure to credit risk. The amounts potentially subject to credit risk (arising from the possible inability of counterparties to meet the terms of their contracts) are generally limited to the amounts, if any, by which the counterparties’ obligations under the contracts exceed our obligations to the counterparties.The following table illustrates the effect that a 10% unfavorable or favorable movement in foreign currency exchange rates, relative to the U.S. dollar, would have on the fair value of our forward exchange contracts as of October 28, 2017 and October 29, 2016: October 28, 2017 October 29, 2016Fair value of forward exchange contracts liability$(1,527) $(5,231)Fair value of forward exchange contracts after a 10% unfavorable movement in foreign currency exchange rates asset$18,557 $11,744Fair value of forward exchange contracts after a 10% favorable movement in foreign currency exchange rates liability$(20,415) $(23,277)The calculation assumes that each exchange rate would change in the same direction relative to the U.S. dollar. In addition to the direct effects of changes in exchange rates, such changes typically affect the volume of sales or the foreign currency sales price as competitors’ products become more or less attractive. Our sensitivity analysis of the effects of changes in foreign currency exchange rates does not factor in a potential change in sales levels or local currency selling prices.44REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRMThe Board of Directors and Shareholders Analog Devices, Inc.We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Analog Devices, Inc. as of October 28, 2017 and October 29, 2016, and the related consolidated statements of income, comprehensive income, shareholders' equity and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended October 28, 2017.

The categorization of revenue by end market is determined using a variety of data points including the technical characteristics of the product, the “sold to” customer information, the “ship to” customer information and the end customer product or application into which our product will be incorporated. As data systems for capturing and tracking this data evolve and improve, the categorization of products by end market can vary over time. When this occurs, we reclassify revenue by end market for prior periods. Such reclassifications typically do not materially change the sizing of, or the underlying trends of results within, each end market. 2018 2017 2016 Revenue % ofTotalProductRevenue Y/Y% Revenue % ofTotalProductRevenue Revenue % ofTotalProductRevenue*Industrial$3,102,508 50% 32 % $2,342,404 46% $1,478,452 43%Automotive988,741 16% 23 % 803,211 16% 558,631 16%Consumer856,778 14% (18)% 1,044,697 20% 688,176 20%Communications1,252,915 20% 37 % 917,191 18% 696,150 20%Total Revenue$6,200,942 100% 21 % $5,107,503 100% $3,421,409 100%* The sum of the individual percentages may not equal the total due to rounding.Industrial - The Industrial end market included $951.1 million of revenue in the fiscal year ended November 3, 2018 (fiscal 2018), as compared to $489.7 million of revenue in the fiscal year ended October 28, 2017 (fiscal 2017), as a result of the Acquisition. Industrial end market revenue increased in fiscal 2018, as compared to fiscal 2017, primarily as a result of the Acquisition, a broad-based increase in demand for our products in this end market and an additional week of operations in fiscal 2018 as compared to fiscal 2017.

Additionally, the increase in gross margin percentage in fiscal 2018, as compared to fiscal 2017 was a result of a mix shift in favor of higher margin products being sold resulting from the Acquisition and lower cost of sales resulting from favorable factory variances related to increased utilization at our manufacturing facilities. The increase in gross margin percentage in fiscal 2018 was partially offset by increases in amortization expense of developed technology intangible assets and depreciation expense related to fixed assets as a result of a full year of expense for each related to the Acquisition.Gross margin percentage in fiscal 2017 decreased by 520 basis points compared to fiscal 2016, primarily as a result of recording additional cost related to Acquisition accounting adjustments, including $358.7 million related to the sale of acquired inventory written up to fair value, $83.0 million related to amortization of acquired developed technology intangible assets, and $22.9 million of depreciation related to fixed assets as a result of the Acquisition. The increases in cost of sales as a result of Acquisition accounting adjustments were partially offset by favorable factory variances as a result of increased utilization at our manufacturing facilities.Research and Development (R&D) Change Fiscal Year 2018 over 2017 2017 over 2016 2018 2017 2016 $ Change % Change $ Change % ChangeR&D Expenses$1,165,410 $968,602 $653,816 $196,808 20% $314,786 48%R&D Expenses as a % of Revenue18.8% 19.0% 19.1% R&D expenses increased in fiscal 2018 as compared to fiscal 2017. Approximately $147.8 million of the overall increase was a result of the Acquisition. The remainder of the increase was primarily the result of increases in operational spending and R&D employee and related benefit expenses, partially offset by a decrease in variable compensation expense linked to our overall profitability and revenue growth. The additional week of operations in fiscal 2018 as compared to fiscal 2017 also contributed to the increase in operational spending and R&D employee and related benefit expenses in fiscal 2018.R&D expenses increased in fiscal 2017 as compared to fiscal 2016. Approximately $205.2 million of the overall increase was a result of the Acquisition. The remainder of the increase was primarily the result of an increase in variable compensation expense linked to our overall profitability and revenue growth and an increase in R&D employee and related benefit expenses and to a lesser extent an increase in operational spending. R&D expenses as a percentage of revenue will fluctuate from year-to-year depending on the amount of revenue and the success of new product development efforts, which we view as critical to our future growth. We have hundreds of R&D 28projects underway, none of which we believe are material on an individual basis. We expect to continue the development of innovative technologies and processes for new products. We believe that a continued commitment to R&D is essential to maintain product leadership with our existing products as well as to provide innovative new product offerings, and therefore, we expect to continue to make significant R&D investments in the future.Selling, Marketing, General and Administrative (SMG&A) Change Fiscal Year 2018 over 2017 2017 over 2016 2018 2017 2016 $ Change % Change $ Change % ChangeSMG&A Expenses$695,937 $691,046 $461,438 $4,891 1% $229,608 50%SMG&A Expenses as a % of Revenue11.2% 13.5% 13.5% SMG&A expenses increased in fiscal 2018 as compared to fiscal 2017 primarily as a result of a $55.5 million increase in SMG&A expenses as a result of the Acquisition, partially offset by a decrease of $50.6 million in Acquisition-related transaction costs, which include legal, accounting, other related fees and integration costs resulting from the Acquisition.SMG&A expenses increased in fiscal 2017 as compared to fiscal 2016 primarily as a result of the Acquisition and Acquisition-related costs. Approximately $119.8 million of the total increase was a result of the Acquisition. Acquisition-related costs, which include legal, accounting, other related fees and integration costs resulting from the Acquisition, increased $56.9 million in fiscal 2017 as compared to fiscal 2016. The remainder of the increase in SMG&A expenses was a result of increases in variable compensation expense linked to our overall profitability and revenue growth and an increase in SMG&A employee and related benefit expenses.

As a result of these assessments, we have undertaken various restructuring actions over the past several years.In fiscal 2018, we recorded special charges of $44.5 million as a result of our decision to consolidate certain wafer and test facility operations acquired as part of the Acquisition. Over the next two to four years, we plan to close our Hillview wafer fabrication facility located in Milpitas, California and our Singapore test facility. We intend to transfer Hillview wafer fabrication production to our other internal facilities and to external foundries. In addition, we are planning to transition testing operations currently handled in our Singapore facility to our facilities in Penang, Malaysia and the Philippines, in addition to our outsourced assembly and test partners. The special charge recognized as a result of this action consists of severance and related benefit costs. We expect that this action will result in estimated annual salary, variable compensation and employee benefit savings of approximately $60.0 million once fully implemented.Special charges of $16.9 million, $8.1 million and $13.7 million were recorded in fiscal 2018, fiscal 2017 and fiscal 2016, respectively, in an effort to reduce overall operating costs. In addition, in fiscal 2017 we recorded a special charge of 29$41.3 million related to an early retirement offer action, which we expect will result in estimated annual salary, variable compensation, and employee benefit savings of approximately $28.4 million once fully implemented.Operating Income Change Fiscal Year 2018 over 2017 2017 over 2016 2018 2017 2016 $ Change % Change $ Change % ChangeOperating income$1,881,735 $1,055,134 $1,028,112 $826,601 78% $27,022 3%Operating income as a % of Revenue30.3% 20.7% 30.0% The increase in operating income in fiscal 2018 as compared to fiscal 2017 was the result of a $1.2 billion increase in gross margin, partially offset by a $196.8 million increase in R&D expenses, a $131.6 million increase in amortization expense, an $11.8 million increase in special charges, and a $4.9 million increase in SMG&A expenses as more fully described above under the headings Research and Development (R&D), Amortization of Intangibles, Special Charges and Selling, Marketing, General and Administrative (SMG&A).The increase in operating income in fiscal 2017 as compared to fiscal 2016 was the result of a $834.4 million increase in gross margin, partially offset by a $314.8 million increase in R&D expenses, a $229.6 million increase in SMG&A expenses, a $227.2 million increase in amortization expenses and a $35.8 million increase in special charges as more fully described above under the headings Research and Development (R&D), Selling, Marketing, General and Administrative (SMG&A), Amortization of Intangibles and Special Charges.Nonoperating (Income) Expense Change Fiscal Year 2018 over 2017 2017 over 2016 2018 2017 2016 $ Change $ ChangeInterest expense$253,589 $250,840 $88,757 $2,749 $162,083Interest income(9,383) (30,333) (21,221) 20,950 (9,112)Other, net(988) 6,142 3,655 (7,130) 2,487Total nonoperating expense$243,218 $226,649 $71,191 $16,569 $155,458The year-over-year increase in nonoperating expense in fiscal 2018 was primarily the result of a decrease in interest income as a result of lower invested cash balances in fiscal 2018 as compared to fiscal 2017, and an increase in interest expense related to financing commitments entered into in fiscal 2017 in connection with the Acquisition and $750 million of senior unsecured notes issued in the second quarter of fiscal 2018, partially offset by a reduction in fees related to financing commitments which were entered into prior to and upon the Acquisition, which terminated during fiscal 2017.The increase in nonoperating expense in fiscal 2017 as compared to fiscal 2016 was primarily the result of an increase in interest expense as a result of the issuance of $1.3 billion of senior unsecured notes in the first quarter of fiscal 2016, $2.1 billion of senior unsecured notes in the first quarter of fiscal 2017, and as a result of fees paid and financing commitments entered into in connection with the Acquisition, including a 90-day Bridge Credit Agreement in the principal amount of $4.1 billion, a 3-year unsecured term loan in the principal amount of $2.5 billion and a 5-year unsecured term loan in the principal amount of $2.5 billion. The increase in nonoperating expense as a result of the increase in interest expense was partially offset by an increase in interest income due to higher interest rates earned on our investments, partially offset by lower cash balances in fiscal 2017 as compared to fiscal 2016.See Note 14, Debt, of the Notes to our Consolidated Financial Statements contained in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further information on debt issuances and commitments related to the Acquisition. 30Provision for Income Taxes Change Fiscal Year 2018 over 2017 2017 over 2016 2018 2017 2016 $ Change % Change $ Change % ChangeProvision for Income Taxes$143,085 $101,226 $95,257 $41,859 41% $5,969 6%Effective Income Tax Rate8.7% 12.2% 10.0% Our effective tax rate reflects the applicable tax rate in effect in the various tax jurisdictions around the world where our income is earned. Our effective income tax rate can also be impacted each year by discrete factors or events.The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 (Tax Legislation), enacted on December 22, 2017, contains significant changes to U.S. tax law, including lowering the U.S. corporate income tax rate to 21.0%, implementing a territorial tax system, and imposing a one-time tax on deemed repatriated earnings of foreign subsidiaries. As of November 3, 2018, we have not completed our accounting for the tax effects of the enactment of the Tax Legislation. However, as described below, we have made reasonable estimates of the effects on its existing deferred tax balances and the one-time transition tax in fiscal 2018.The Tax Legislation reduced the U.S. statutory tax rate from 35.0% to 21.0%, effective January 1, 2018, which results in a blended statutory income tax rate for us of 23.4% for fiscal 2018. For the fiscal year ending November 2, 2019 (fiscal 2019), our U.S. federal statutory income tax rate will be 21.0%.The tax rate for fiscal 2018 was below our blended U.S. federal statutory tax rate of 23.4% for fiscal 2018 resulting from the passage of the Tax Legislation, primarily due to lower statutory tax rates applicable to our operations in the foreign jurisdictions in which we earn income and $25.6 million of tax benefit related to the release of uncertain tax positions due to lapses in statute of limitation. Similarly, fiscal 2017 was below the then U.S. statutory tax rate of 35%, primarily due to lower statutory tax rates applicable to our operations in the foreign jurisdictions in which we earn income and a tax benefit of $50.5 million related to the reduction of reserves and related interest resulting from the U.S. Tax Court’s favorable ruling, offset by approximately $98.2 million of tax expense incurred during the year as part of the post-Acquisition integration. In addition, our effective tax rate for fiscal 2018 includes a provisional estimate for a tax benefit of $637.0 million from remeasuring our U.S. deferred tax assets and liabilities at the lower 21.0% U.S. federal statutory tax rate. Fiscal 2018 also includes a provisional estimate of $691.0 million for the discrete tax charge from the Tax Legislation’s one-time transition tax associated with our undistributed foreign earnings, which is comprised of a $755.0 million transitional tax liability less a deferred tax liability of $64.0 million that was recorded in prior years.Additionally, we recorded discrete benefits for excess tax benefits from share-based payments of $26.2 million in fiscal 2018. Our effective tax rate for fiscal 2017 also included a tax benefit of $15.0 million for the release of a state tax credit valuation allowance as a result of the Acquisition.The Tax Legislation contains many provisions that are effective for tax years beginning on or after January 1, 2018. Because we are a fiscal year U.S. taxpayer, certain provisions, such as the foreign-derived intangible income deduction on certain foreign-source income and new limitations on certain business deductions, will begin applying to us for our fiscal year ending November 2, 2019 (fiscal 2019). For fiscal 2018, the most significant impacts include a lower U.S. federal corporate income tax rate, a re-measurement of certain net deferred taxes to reflect the revised tax rates and a new transition tax on the deemed repatriation of certain foreign earnings. Non-U.S. jurisdictions accounted for approximately 75.9% of our total revenues for fiscal 2018, compared to approximately 77.3% of our total revenues fiscal 2017. This revenue generated outside of the U.S. results in a material portion of our pretax income being taxed outside the U.S., primarily in Bermuda, Ireland and Singapore, at tax rates ranging from 0% to 33.3%. We have a partial tax holiday in Malaysia through July 2025. A partial tax holiday in Singapore had been in place through August 2019, but was terminated effective September 2018 due to negotiations with the Economic Development Board. The aggregate dollar benefits derived from these tax holidays approximated $27.7 million and $27.4 million in fiscal 2018 and 2017, respectively. The impact of the tax holidays during fiscal 2018 increased the basic and diluted net income per common share by $0.07 each. The impact of the tax holidays during fiscal 2017 increased the basic and diluted net income per common share by $0.08 each. The impact on our provision for income taxes on income earned in foreign jurisdictions being taxed at rates different than the U.S. federal statutory rate was a benefit of approximately $434.8 million and a foreign effective tax rate of approximately 7.4% for fiscal 2018, compared to a benefit of approximately $385.1 million and a foreign effective tax rate of approximately 7.8% for fiscal 2017. A reduction in the ratio of domestic taxable income to worldwide taxable income effectively lowers our overall tax rate, due to the fact that the tax rates in the majority of foreign jurisdictions 31where we earn income are lower than the U.S. statutory rate. In addition, our effective income tax rate can be impacted each year by amounts for discrete factors or events, and acquisition-related accounting adjustments.See Note 12, Income Taxes, of the Notes to our Consolidated Financial Statements contained in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further discussion.

The impact of inflation and foreign currency exchange rate movement on our results of operations during the past three fiscal years has not been significant.Liquidity and Capital ResourcesAt November 3, 2018, our principal source of liquidity was $816.6 million of cash and cash equivalents, of which approximately $383.5 million was held in the United States. The balance of our cash and cash equivalents was held outside the United States in various foreign subsidiaries. We continue to assert our intent to reinvest substantially all of our foreign earnings indefinitely, however we are in the process of analyzing the impact that the Tax Legislation has on this indefinite reinvestment assertion. As we intend to reinvest substantially all of our foreign earnings indefinitely, certain cash held outside the United States may not be available for repatriation as dividends to the United States in the future. If such funds are needed for U.S. operations, we would be required to accrue and pay foreign withholding and U.S. state income taxes to the extent not already subject to taxation. Our cash and cash equivalents consist of highly liquid investments with maturities of three months or less, including money market funds. We maintain these balances with high credit quality counterparties, continually monitor the amount of credit exposure to any one issuer and diversify our investments in order to minimize our credit risk.On the Acquisition Date, we entered into a 90-day Bridge Credit Agreement that provided for unsecured loans in an aggregate principal amount of up to $4.1 billion and borrowed under a term loan agreement consisting of a 3-year unsecured term loan in the principal amount of $2.5 billion, due March 10, 2020 and a 5-year unsecured term loan in the principal amount of $2.5 billion, due March 10, 2022. As of November 3, 2018, we have paid $2.1 billion of principal on the 3-year unsecured term loan, paid $1.2 billion of principal on the 5-year unsecured term loan and repaid all of the $4.1 billion of outstanding loans under the Bridge Credit Agreement. See Note 13, Revolving Credit Facility and Note 14, Debt of the Notes to our Consolidated Financial Statements contained in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further information.We believe that our existing sources of liquidity and cash expected to be generated from future operations, together with existing and anticipated available long-term financing, will be sufficient to fund operations, capital expenditures, research and development efforts and dividend payments (if any) in the immediate future and for at least the next twelve months.

The following changes contributed to the net change in cash and cash equivalents in fiscal 2018 and fiscal 2017.Operating ActivitiesCash provided by operating activities is net income adjusted for certain non-cash items and changes in assets and liabilities.The increase in cash provided by operating activities during fiscal 2018, as compared to fiscal 2017, was primarily a result of higher net income adjusted for non-cash items, and changes in working capital, primarily resulting from increases in tax liabilities related to the one-time transition tax recognized as a result of the Tax Legislation.The decrease in cash provided by operating activities during fiscal 2017, as compared to fiscal 2016, was primarily due to higher tax payments as a result of the post-Acquisition integration, and other changes in working capital.Investing ActivitiesInvesting cash flows consist primarily of capital expenditures, investment purchases, maturities and sales of available-for-sale securities, as well as cash used for acquisitions.The decrease in cash used for investing activities during fiscal 2018, as compared to fiscal 2017, was primarily the result of a decrease in payments for acquisitions, partially offset by a decrease of proceeds from the sale of available for sale securities.The increase in cash used for investing activities during fiscal 2017, as compared to fiscal 2016, was primarily the result of cash payments made for the Acquisition, partially offset by a decrease in maturities of available for sale securities.Financing ActivitiesFinancing cash flows consist primarily of payments of dividends to stockholders, repurchases of common stock, issuance and repayment of long-term debt, and proceeds from the sale of shares of common stock pursuant to employee equity incentive plans.The decrease in cash provided by financing activities during fiscal 2018, as compared to fiscal 2017, was primarily due to a decrease in net proceeds of $10.4 billion received from the issuance of senior unsecured notes and financing commitments, and lower repayments of principal on the 3-year and 5-year unsecured term loans. The increase in cash provided by financing activities during fiscal 2017, as compared to fiscal 2016, was primarily due to an increase in net debt proceeds of $9.9 billion received from the issuance of senior unsecured notes, financing commitments entered into in connection with the Acquisition, consisting of a 90-day Bridge Credit Agreement and a term loan agreement, and a decrease in stock repurchases of $323.5 million due to the temporary suspension of our share repurchase program in connection with the Acquisition. These decreases were partially offset by payments of $5.1 billion related to financing commitments entered into in connection with the Acquisition.

Cost of sales amounts used in the calculation of days cost of sales in inventory for fiscal 2018 and fiscal 2017 include Acquisition accounting adjustments related to amortization of developed technology intangible assets acquired and depreciation related to fixed assets acquired. Fiscal 2017 also included cost of sales amounts for inventory acquired in the Acquisition. The decrease in accounts receivable for fiscal 2018 compared to fiscal 2017 was primarily the result of the timing of shipments and the collection of receivables.33 Inventory in dollars increased in fiscal 2018 as compared to fiscal 2017, primarily as a result of our efforts to balance manufacturing production, demand and inventory levels. Our inventory levels are impacted by our need to support forecasted sales demand and variations between those forecasts and actual demand.Current liabilities decreased to $1.4 billion at November 3, 2018 from $1.6 billion recorded at the end of fiscal 2017. The decrease was primarily due to a decrease in the current portion of our debt. As of November 3, 2018 and October 28, 2017, we had gross deferred revenue of $603.8 million and $589.5 million, respectively, and gross deferred cost of sales of $116.4 million and $115.5 million, respectively. Deferred income on shipments to distributors decreased in fiscal 2018 primarily as a result of the distributors' sales to their customers in fiscal 2018 exceeding our shipments to our distributors during this same time period. Sales to certain distributors are made under agreements that allow distributors to receive price-adjustment credits and to return qualifying products for credit, as determined by us, in order to reduce the amounts of slow-moving, discontinued or obsolete product from their inventory. Given the uncertainties associated with the levels of price-adjustment credits to be granted to certain distributors, the sales price to the distributors is not fixed or determinable until the distributors resell the products to their customers. Therefore, we defer revenue recognition from sales to certain distributors until such distributors have sold the products to their customers. The amount of price-adjustments is dependent on future overall market conditions, and therefore the levels of these adjustments could fluctuate significantly from period to period. To the extent that we experience a significant increase in the amount of credits we issue to our distributors, there could be a material impact on the ultimate revenue and gross margin recognized relating to these transactions.DebtAs of November 3, 2018, we had $6.3 billion of carrying value outstanding on our long-term debt. The difference in the carrying value of the debt and the principal is due to the unamortized discount and issuance fees on these instruments that will accrete to the face value over the term of the debt. Our debt obligations consist of the following:$500.0 Million Aggregate Principal Amount of 2.875% Senior Unsecured Notes (2023 Notes)On June 3, 2013, we issued the 2023 Notes with semi-annual fixed interest payments due on June 1 and December 1 of each year, commencing December 1, 2013.$850.0 Million Aggregate Principal Amount of 3.9% Senior Unsecured Notes (2025 Notes) and $400.0 Million Aggregate Principal Amount of 5.3% Senior Unsecured Notes (2045 Notes)On December 14, 2015, we issued the 2025 Notes and the 2045 Notes with semi-annual fixed interest payments due on June 15 and December 15 of each year, commencing June 15, 2016. $400 Million Aggregate Principal Amount of 2.5% Senior Unsecured Notes (2021 Notes), $550 Million Aggregate Principal Amount of 3.125% Senior Unsecured Notes (December 2023 Notes), $900 Million Aggregate Principal Amount of 3.5% Senior Unsecured Notes (2026 Notes) and $250 Million Aggregate Principal Amount of 4.5% Senior Unsecured Notes (2036 Notes)On December 5, 2016, we issued the 2021 Notes, the December 2023 Notes, the 2026 Notes and the 2036 Notes with semi-annual fixed interest payments due on June 5 and December 5 of each year, commencing June 5, 2017.$300.0 Million Aggregate Principal Amount of 2.85% Senior Unsecured Notes (2020 Notes) and $450.0 Million Aggregate Principal Amount of 2.95% Senior Unsecured Notes (January 2021 Notes)On March 12, 2018, we issued the 2020 Notes with semi-annual fixed interest payments due on March 12 and September 12 of each year, commencing September 12, 2018, and the January 2021 Notes with semi-annual fixed interest payments due on January 12 and July 12 of each year, commencing July 12, 2018.The indentures governing the 2020 Notes, 2021 Notes, January 2021 Notes, 2023 Notes, December 2023 Notes, 2025 Notes, 2026 Notes, 2036 Notes and 2045 Notes contain covenants that may limit our ability to: incur, create, assume or guarantee any debt for borrowed money secured by a lien upon a principal property; enter into sale and lease-back transactions with respect to a principal property; and consolidate with or merge into, or transfer or lease all or substantially all of our assets to, any other party. As of November 3, 2018, we were compliant with these covenants. See Note 14, Debt, of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements contained in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further information on our outstanding debt.34$5.0 Billion Aggregate Principal Term LoansOn the Acquisition Date, we drew down on a 3-year unsecured term loan in the principal amount of $2.5 billion, due March 10, 2020 and a 5-year unsecured term loan in the principal amount of $2.5 billion, due March 10, 2022. The term loans bear interest at a rate per annum equal to the Eurodollar Rate plus a margin based on our debt ratings from time to time of between 0.75% and 1.63% in the case of the 3-year unsecured term loan, and a margin of between 0.88% and 1.75% in the case of the 5-year unsecured term loan. As of November 3, 2018, we have paid $2.1 billion of principal on the 3-year unsecured term loan and paid $1.2 billion of principal on the 5-year unsecured term loan.Revolving Credit FacilityWe have a senior unsecured revolving credit facility with certain institutional lenders that expires on July 10, 2020. The agreement for such revolving credit facility (Credit Agreement) provides that we may borrow up to $1.0 billion. To date, we have not borrowed under this credit facility, but we may borrow in the future and use the proceeds for repayment of existing indebtedness, stock repurchases, acquisitions, capital expenditures, working capital and other lawful corporate purposes. The terms of the Credit Agreement impose restrictions on our ability to undertake certain transactions, to create certain liens on assets and to incur certain subsidiary indebtedness. In addition, the Credit Agreement contains a consolidated leverage ratio covenant of total consolidated funded debt to consolidated earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA) of not greater than 4.5 to 1.0. The debt covenant will be reduced over time to 3.0 to 1.0, which began in May 2018. As of November 3, 2018, we were compliant with these covenants. See Note 13, Revolving Credit Facility, of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements contained in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further information on our revolving credit facility.Stock Repurchase ProgramOur common stock repurchase program has been in place since August 2004. In the aggregate, our Board of Directors has authorized us to repurchase $8.2 billion of our common stock under the program. Under the program, we may repurchase outstanding shares of our common stock from time to time in the open market and through privately negotiated transactions. Unless terminated earlier by resolution of our Board of Directors, the repurchase program will expire when we have repurchased all shares authorized under the program. In connection with the Acquisition, we temporarily suspended the share repurchase program. On August 21, 2018, we reinstated the share repurchase program, and as of November 3, 2018, we had repurchased a total of approximately 148.9 million shares of its common stock for approximately $5.6 billion under this program. An additional $2.6 billion remains available for repurchase of shares under the current authorized program. The repurchased shares are held as authorized but unissued shares of common stock. We also, from time to time, repurchase shares in settlement of employee tax withholding obligations due upon the vesting of restricted stock units/awards or the exercise of stock options. Capital ExpendituresNet additions to property, plant and equipment were $254.9 million in fiscal 2018 and were funded with a combination of cash on hand and cash generated from operations. We expect capital expenditures for fiscal 2019 to be approximately 4% of fiscal 2019 revenue. These capital expenditures will be funded with a combination of cash on hand and cash generated from operations.DividendsOn November 19, 2018, our Board of Directors declared a cash dividend of $0.48 per outstanding share of common stock. The dividend will be paid on December 10, 2018 to all shareholders of record at the close of business on November 29, 2018 and is expected to total approximately $178 million. We currently expect quarterly dividends to continue at $0.48 per share, although they remain subject to determination and declaration by our Board of Directors. The payment of future dividends, if any, will be based on several factors, including our financial performance, outlook and liquidity.35Contractual ObligationsThe table below summarizes our contractual obligations and the amounts we owe under these contracts in specified periods as of November 3, 2018: Payment due by period Less than More than(thousands) Total 1 Year 1-3 Years 3-5 Years 5 YearsContractual obligations: Transition tax (a) $755,000 $61,600 $120,592 $120,592 $452,216Operating leases (b) 390,252 39,293 86,204 63,266 201,489Debt obligations (c) 6,375,000 67,000 1,108,000 2,250,000 2,950,000Interest payments associated with debt obligations 1,740,053 223,796 404,124 281,539 830,594Deferred compensation plan (d) 41,001 1,148 — — 39,853Pension funding (e) 4,149 4,149 — — —Total $9,305,455 $396,986 $1,718,920 $2,715,397 $4,474,152_______________________________________(a)The Tax Legislation, enacted on December 22, 2017, contains significant changes to U.S. tax law, including lowering the U.S. corporate income tax rate to 21.0%, implementing a territorial tax system, and imposing a one-time tax on deemed repatriated earnings of foreign subsidiaries. As part of transitioning to the territorial tax system, the Tax Legislation includes a one-time transition tax that we intend to elect to pay over a period of eight years that begins in fiscal 2019 on an interest free basis.(b)Certain of our operating lease obligations include escalation clauses. These escalating payment requirements are reflected in the table.(c)Debt obligations are assumed to be held to maturity. (d)These payments relate to obligations under our deferred compensation plan. The deferred compensation plan allows certain members of management and other highly-compensated employees and non-employee directors to defer receipt of all or any portion of their compensation. The amount in the “More than 5 Years” column of the table represents the remaining total balance under the deferred compensation plan to be paid to participants who have not terminated employment. Since we cannot reasonably estimate the timing of withdrawals for participants who have not yet terminated employment, we have included the future obligation to these participants in the “More than 5 Years” column of the table.(e)Our funding policy for our foreign defined benefit plans is consistent with the local requirements of each country. The payment obligations in the table are estimates of our expected contributions to these plans for fiscal year 2019. The actual future payments may differ from the amounts presented in the table and reasonable estimates of payments beyond one year are not practical because of potential future changes in variables, such as plan asset performance, interest rates and the rate of increase in compensation levels.As of November 3, 2018, our total liabilities associated with uncertain tax positions was $16.8 million, which are included in non-current income taxes payable in our consolidated balance sheet contained in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Due to the complexity associated with our deferred taxes and tax uncertainties, we cannot make a reasonably reliable estimate of the period in which we expect to settle the non-current liabilities associated with these deferred taxes and uncertain tax positions. Therefore, we have not included these deferred taxes and uncertain tax positions in the above contractual obligations table.The expected timing of payments and the amounts of the obligations discussed above are estimated based on current information available as of November 3, 2018.Off-balance Sheet ArrangementsAs of November 3, 2018, we had no off-balance sheet financing arrangements.New Accounting PronouncementsFrom time to time, new accounting pronouncements are issued by the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) and are adopted by us as of the specified effective date. Unless otherwise discussed, management believes that the impact of recently issued standards will not have a material impact on our future financial condition and results of operations. See Note 2t, New Accounting Pronouncements, of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements contained in Item 8 of this Annual 36Report on Form 10-K for a description of recently issued and adopted accounting pronouncements, including the dates of adoption and impact on our historical financial condition and results of operations.Revenue Recognition In May 2014, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (ASU 2014-09), which supersedes nearly all existing revenue recognition guidance under generally accepted accounting principles in the United States (U.S. GAAP). The core principle of ASU 2014-09 is that an entity should recognize revenue to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. Additionally, the guidance requires improved disclosures to help users of financial statements better understand the nature, amount, timing, and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows arising from contracts with customers. The FASB has issued several amendments and updates to the new revenue standard, including guidance related to when an entity should recognize revenue gross as a principal or net as an agent and how an entity should identify performance obligations. As amended, ASU 2014-09 is effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning after December 15, 2017, which is our first quarter of fiscal 2019. We are approaching the final stage of our project plan for the implementation of the guidance. We have reviewed our revenue streams, including those from the Acquisition, and are nearing completion in assessing all potential impacts of the standard on our consolidated financial statements and related disclosures, including any impacts from recently issued amendments, and retrospectively adjusting financial information for prior fiscal years. The most significant impact of adopting the new standard will be related to the timing of recognition of sales to certain distributors. As described in Note 2, Revenue Recognition, of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements contained in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, we currently defer revenue and the related cost of sales on shipments to certain distributors until the distributors resell the products to their customers. Upon adoption of ASU 2014-09, we will no longer be permitted to defer revenue until sale by the distributor to the end customer, but rather, will be required to estimate the effects of returns and allowances provided to distributors and record revenue at the time of sale to the distributor. We will adopt ASU 2014-09, using the full retrospective method, upon its effective date for us which is our first quarter of fiscal 2019.Critical Accounting Policies and EstimatesManagement’s discussion and analysis of the financial condition and results of operations is based upon the consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue and expenses, and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. We base our estimates and judgments on historical experience, knowledge of current conditions and beliefs of what could occur in the future based on available information. We consider the following accounting policies to be both those most important to the portrayal of our financial condition and those that require the most subjective judgment. If actual results differ significantly from management’s estimates and projections, there could be a material effect on our financial statements. We also have other policies that we consider key accounting policies, such as our policy for revenue recognition, including the deferral of revenue on sales to distributors until the products are sold to the end user; however, the application of these policies does not require us to make significant estimates or judgments that are difficult or subjective.Revenue RecognitionRevenue from product sales to customers is generally recognized when title passes, which is upon shipment in the U.S. and in certain foreign counties. Revenue from product sales to other foreign countries is recognized subsequent to product shipment. Title for these shipments to these other foreign countries ordinarily passes within a week of shipment. Accordingly, we defer the revenue recognized relating to these other foreign countries until title has passed. For multiple element arrangements, we allocate arrangement consideration among the elements based on the relative fair values of those elements as determined using vendor-specific objective evidence or third-party evidence. We use our best estimate of selling price to allocate arrangement consideration between the deliverables in cases where neither vendor-specific objective evidence nor third-party evidence is available. A reserve for sales returns and allowances for customers is recorded based on historical experience or specific identification of an event necessitating a reserve. Revenue from contracts with the United States government, government prime contractors and some commercial customers is generally recorded on a percentage of completion basis, using either units delivered or costs incurred as the measurement basis for progress toward completion. The output measure is used to measure results directly and is generally the best measure of progress toward completion in circumstances in which a reliable measure of output can be established. Estimated revenue in excess of amounts billed is reported as unbilled receivables. Contract accounting requires judgment in estimating costs and assumptions related to technical issues and delivery schedule. Contract costs include material, subcontract costs, labor and an allocation of indirect costs. The estimation of costs at completion of a contract is subject to numerous 37variables involving contract costs and estimates as to the length of time to complete the contract. Changes in contract performance, estimated gross margin, including the impact of final contract settlements, and estimated losses are recognized in the period in which the changes or losses are determined. Revenue from product sales to certain international distributors are made under agreements that permit limited stock return privileges but not sales price rebates. Revenue on these sales is recognized upon shipment at which time title passes. We defer revenue and the related cost of sales on shipments to U.S. distributors and certain international distributors until the distributors resell the products to their customers. As a result, our revenue fully reflects end customer purchases and is not impacted by distributor inventory levels. Sales to certain of these distributors are made under agreements that allow such distributors to receive price-adjustment credits and to return qualifying products for credit, as determined by us, in order to reduce the amounts of slow-moving, discontinued or obsolete product from their inventory. These agreements limit such returns to a certain percentage of the value of our shipments to that distributor during the prior quarter. In addition, such distributors are allowed to return unsold products if we terminate the relationship with the distributor. Given the uncertainties associated with the levels of price-adjustment credits to be granted to certain distributors, the sales price to the distributor is not fixed or determinable until the distributor resells the products to their customers. Therefore, we defer revenue recognition from sales to certain distributors until such distributors have sold the products to their customers.Inventory ValuationWe value inventories at the lower of cost (first-in, first-out method) or market. Because of the cyclical nature of the semiconductor industry, changes in inventory levels, obsolescence of technology, and product life cycles, we write down inventories to net realizable value. We employ a variety of methodologies to determine the net realizable value of inventory. While a portion of the calculation is determined via reference to the age of inventory and lower of cost or market calculations, an element of the calculation is subject to significant judgments made by us about future demand for our inventory. If actual demand for our products is less than our estimates, additional adjustments to existing inventories may need to be recorded in future periods. To date, our actual results have not been materially different than our estimates, and we do not expect them to be materially different in the future.Long-Lived AssetsWe review property, plant, and equipment and finite lived intangible assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of assets may not be recoverable. Recoverability of these assets is determined by comparison of their carrying value to the estimated future undiscounted cash flows that the assets are expected to generate over their remaining estimated lives. If such assets are considered to be impaired, the impairment to be recognized in earnings equals the amount by which the carrying value of the assets exceeds their fair value determined by either a quoted market price, if any, or a value determined by utilizing a discounted cash flow technique. Although we have recognized no material impairment adjustments related to our property, plant, and equipment and identified intangible assets during the past three fiscal years, except those made in conjunction with restructuring actions, deterioration in our business in the future could lead to such impairment adjustments in future periods. Evaluation of impairment of long-lived assets requires estimates of future operating results that are used in the preparation of the expected future undiscounted cash flows. Actual future operating results and the remaining economic lives of our long-lived assets could differ from the estimates used in assessing the recoverability of these assets. These differences could result in impairment charges, which could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations. In addition, in certain instances, assets may not be impaired but their estimated useful lives may have decreased. In these situations, we amortize the remaining net book values over the revised useful lives. We review indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment annually, on the first day of the fourth quarter (on or about August 5) or more frequently if indicators of impairment exist. We perform a qualitative assessment on our indefinite-lived intangible assets to determine whether it is more likely-than not that the indefinite-lived intangible asset is impaired. If it is determined that the fair value of the indefinite-lived intangible asset is less than the carrying value, we would compare the fair value of the intangible asset with its carrying amount and recognize an impairment equal to any amount by which the carrying value of the assets exceeds the fair value.GoodwillGoodwill is subject to annual impairment tests or more frequently if indicators of potential impairment exist and suggest that the carrying value of goodwill may not be recoverable from estimated discounted future cash flows. We test goodwill for impairment at the reporting unit level (operating segment or one level below an operating segment) on an annual basis in the fourth quarter (on or about August 5) or more frequently if we believe indicators of impairment exist. We have the option to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its net book value. If we elect not to use this option, or we determine that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its net book value, then we perform the quantitative goodwill impairment test. In prior periods, we did not elect 38to use the qualitative option for assessing goodwill and instead proceeded directly to the quantitative goodwill impairment analysis. The goodwill impairment test requires an entity to compare the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying amount. If fair value is determined to be less than carrying value, an impairment loss is recognized for the amount of the carrying value that exceeds the amount of the reporting unit's fair value, not to exceed the total amount of goodwill allocated to the reporting unit. Additionally, we consider income tax effects from any tax deductible goodwill on the carrying amount of the reporting unit when measuring the goodwill impairment loss, if applicable. We determine the fair value of our reporting units using a weighting of the income and market approaches. Under the income approach, we use a discounted cash flow methodology which requires management to make significant estimates and assumptions related to forecasted revenues, gross profit margins, operating income margins, working capital cash flow, perpetual growth rates, and long-term discount rates, among others. For the market approach, we use the guideline public company method. Under this method we utilize information from comparable publicly traded companies with similar operating and investment characteristics as the reporting units, to create valuation multiples that are applied to the operating performance of the reporting unit being tested, in order to obtain their respective fair values. In order to assess the reasonableness of the calculated reporting unit fair values, we reconcile the aggregate fair values of our reporting units determined, as described above, to its current market capitalization, allowing for a reasonable control premium. In our latest annual impairment evaluation that occurred as of August 5, 2018, we used the qualitative method of assessing goodwill for all eight of our identified reporting units, which we determined are the same as our eight operating segments. For each of the reporting units, we determined that it was not more likely than not that the fair values were less than their net book values. In making this determination, we considered several factors, including the following:–the amount by which the fair values of each reporting unit exceeded their carrying values as of the date of the most recent quantitative impairment analysis, which indicated there would need to be substantial negative developments in the markets in which these reporting units operate in order for there to be potential impairment;–the carrying values of these reporting units as of August 5, 2018 compared to the previously calculated fair values as of the date of the most recent quantitative impairment analysis;–the current forecasts as compared to the forecasts included in the most recent quantitative impairment analysis;–public information from competitors and other industry information to determine if there were any significant adverse trends in our competitors' businesses, such as significant declines in market capitalization or significant goodwill impairment charges that could be an indication that the goodwill of our reporting units was potentially impaired;–changes in the value of major U.S. stock indices that could suggest declines in overall market stability that could impact the valuation of our reporting units;–changes in our market capitalization and overall enterprise valuation to determine if there were any significant decreases that could be an indication that the valuation of our reporting units had significantly decreased; and–whether there had been any significant increases to the weighted-average cost of capital (WACC) rates for each reporting unit, which could materially lower our prior valuation conclusions under a discounted cash flow approach.Business CombinationsUnder the acquisition method of accounting, we recognize tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their estimated fair values. We record the excess of the fair value of the purchase consideration over the value of the net assets acquired as goodwill. The accounting for business combinations requires us to make significant estimates and assumptions, especially with respect to intangible assets and the fair value of contingent payment obligations. Critical estimates in valuing purchased technology, customer lists and other identifiable intangible assets include future cash flows that we expect to generate from the acquired assets. If the subsequent actual results and updated projections of the underlying business activity change compared with the assumptions and projections used to develop these values, we could experience impairment charges which could be material. In addition, we have estimated the economic lives of certain acquired assets and these lives are used to calculate depreciation and amortization expense. If our estimates of the economic lives change, depreciation or amortization expenses could be accelerated or slowed.We record contingent consideration resulting from a business combination at its fair value on the acquisition date. We generally determine the fair value of the contingent consideration using the income approach methodology of valuation. Each reporting period thereafter, we revalue these obligations and record increases or decreases in their fair value as an adjustment to operating expenses within the consolidated statement of income. Changes in the fair value of the contingent consideration can result from changes in assumed discount periods and rates, and from changes pertaining to the achievement of the defined milestones. Significant judgment is employed in determining the appropriateness of these assumptions as of the acquisition date and for each subsequent period. Accordingly, future business and economic conditions, as well as changes in any of the assumptions described above, can materially impact the amount of contingent consideration expense we record in any given period.39Accounting for Income TaxesWe must make certain estimates and judgments in determining income tax expense for financial statement purposes. These estimates and judgments occur in the calculation of tax credits, benefits, and deductions, and in the calculation of certain tax assets and liabilities, which arise from differences in the timing of the recognition of revenue and expense for tax and financial statement purposes, as well as the interest and penalties relating to these uncertain tax positions. We assessed the likelihood of the realization of deferred tax assets and concluded that a valuation allowance is needed to reserve the amount of the deferred tax assets that may not be realized due to the uncertainty of the timing and amount of the realization of certain state credit carryovers. In reaching our conclusion, we evaluated certain relevant criteria including the existence of deferred tax liabilities that can be used to realize deferred tax assets, the taxable income in prior carryback years in the impacted state jurisdictions that can be used to absorb net operating losses and taxable income in future years. Our judgments regarding future profitability may change due to future market conditions, changes in U.S. or international tax laws and other factors. These changes, if any, may require material adjustments to these deferred tax assets, resulting in a reduction in net income or an increase in net loss in the period when such determinations are made, which in turn, may result in an increase or decrease to our tax provision in a subsequent period.We account for uncertain tax positions by determining if it is “more likely than not” that a tax position will be sustained by the appropriate taxing authorities prior to recording any benefit in the financial statements. An uncertain income tax position is not recognized if it has less than a 50% likelihood of being sustained. For those tax positions where it is more likely than not that a tax benefit will be sustained, we have recorded the largest amount of tax benefit with a greater than 50% likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement with a taxing authority that has full knowledge of all relevant information. For those income tax positions where it is not more likely than not that a tax benefit will be sustained, no tax benefit has been recognized in the financial statements. We reevaluate these uncertain tax positions on a quarterly basis. This evaluation is based on factors including, but not limited to, changes in known facts or circumstances, changes in tax law, effectively settled issues under audit, and new audit activity. A change in these factors would result in the recognition of a tax benefit or an additional charge to the tax provision.In the ordinary course of global business, there are many transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax outcome is uncertain. Some of these uncertainties arise as a consequence of cost reimbursement and royalty arrangements among related entities. Although we believe our estimates are reasonable, no assurance can be given that the final tax outcome of these matters will not be different than that which is reflected in our historical income tax provisions and accruals. In the event our assumptions are incorrect, the differences could have a material impact on our income tax provision and operating results in the period in which such determination is made. In addition to the factors described above, our current and expected effective tax rate is based on then-current tax law. Significant changes during the year in enacted tax law could affect these estimates. The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 (Tax Legislation) significantly changes existing U.S. tax law and includes numerous provisions that affect our business. See Note 12, Income Taxes, of the of the Notes to our Consolidated Financial Statements contained in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further discussion.Stock-Based CompensationStock-based compensation expense associated with stock options and related awards is recognized in the consolidated statements of income. Determining the amount of stock-based compensation to be recorded requires us to develop estimates to be used in calculating the grant-date fair value of stock options and market-based restricted stock units. We calculate the grant-date fair values of stock options using the Black-Scholes valuation model. The use of valuation models requires us to make estimates of key assumptions such as expected option term and stock price volatility to determine the fair value of a stock option. The estimate of these key assumptions is based on historical information and judgment regarding market factors and trends. We recognize the expense related to equity awards on a straight-line basis over the vesting period. See Note 3, Stock-Based Compensation and Shareholders' Equity, of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements contained in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for more information related to stock based compensation.ContingenciesFrom time to time, in the ordinary course of business, various claims, charges and litigation are asserted or commenced against us arising from, or related to, contractual matters, patents, trademarks, personal injury, environmental matters, product liability, insurance coverage and personnel and employment disputes. We periodically assess each matter to determine if a contingent liability should be recorded. In making this determination, we may, depending on the nature of the matter, consult with internal and external legal counsel and technical experts. Based on the information we obtain, combined with our judgment regarding all the facts and circumstances of each matter, we determine whether it is probable that a contingent loss may be incurred and whether the amount of such loss can be reasonably estimated. If a loss is probable and reasonably estimable, we record a contingent loss. In determining the amount of a contingent loss, we consider advice received from 40experts in the specific matter, current status of legal proceedings, settlement negotiations that may be ongoing, prior case history and other factors. If the judgments and estimates made by us are incorrect, we may need to record additional contingent losses that could materially adversely impact our results of operations.41ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISKInterest Rate ExposureOur interest income and expense are sensitive to changes in the general level of interest rates. In this regard, changes in interest rates affect the interest earned on our marketable securities and short term investments, as well as the fair value of our investments and debt. In the fiscal year ended October 28, 2017, we borrowed $2.5 billion of 3-year term loans and $2.5 billion of 5-year term loans as part of the financing for the acquisition of Linear Technology Corporation. As of November 3, 2018, we have paid $2.1 billion of principal on the 3-year unsecured term loan and paid $1.2 billion of principal on the 5-year unsecured term loan. The term loans accrue interest at a floating rate, equal to the LIBOR rate corresponding with the tenor of the borrowing period plus the applicable spread (112.5 basis points for the 3-year term loan and 125 basis points for the 5-year term loan). Based on the $1.8 billion of floating rate debt outstanding as of November 3, 2018, of which $1 billion is hedged, our annual interest expense would change by approximately $7.8 million for each 100 basis point increase in interest rates.Based on our marketable securities and short-term investments outstanding as of November 3, 2018 and October 28, 2017, our annual interest income would change by approximately $8.2 million and $10.5 million, respectively, for each 100 basis point increase in interest rates.To provide a meaningful assessment of the interest rate risk associated with our investment portfolio, we performed a sensitivity analysis to determine the impact a change in interest rates would have on the value of our investment portfolio assuming a 100 basis point parallel shift in the yield curve. Based on investment positions as of November 3, 2018 and October 28, 2017, a hypothetical 100 basis point increase in interest rates across all maturities would not materially impact the fair market value of the portfolio as of November 3, 2018 and would result in a $7.0 million decline in the fair market value of the portfolio as of October 28, 2017. Such losses would only be realized if we sold the investments prior to maturity.As of November 3, 2018, we had $4.6 billion in principal amount of senior unsecured notes outstanding, with a fair value of $4.5 billion. The fair value of our notes is subject to interest rate risk, market risk, and other factors. Generally, the fair value of our notes will increase as interest rates fall and decrease as interest rates rise. The fair values of our notes as of November 3, 2018 and October 28, 2017, assuming a hypothetical 100 basis point increase in market interest rates, are as follows: November 3, 2018 October 28, 2017(thousands)Principal Amount Outstanding Fair Value Fair Value given an increase in interest rates of 100 basis points Principal Amount Outstanding Fair Value Fair Value given an increase in interest rates of 100 basis points2020 Notes, due March 2020$300,000 298,147 294,237 $— $— $—2021 Notes, due January 2021$450,000 444,568 435,334 $— $— $—2021 Notes, due December 2021$400,000 386,375 375,215 $400,000 $399,530 $384,3742023 Notes, due June 2023$500,000 479,189 459,377 $500,000 $498,582 $473,7272023 Notes, due December 2023$550,000 529,120 505,176 $550,000 $554,411 $524,7182025 Notes, due December 2025$850,000 829,611 780,432 $850,000 $884,861 $825,7002026 Notes, due December 2026$900,000 848,027 791,549 $900,000 $902,769 $835,8912036 Notes, due December 2036$250,000 232,627 206,716 $250,000 $259,442 $228,6712045 Notes, due December 2045$400,000 407,984 354,806 $400,000 $460,588 $396,506Foreign Currency ExposureAs more fully described in Note 2i, Derivative and Hedging Agreements, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements contained in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, we regularly hedge our non-U.S. dollar-based exposures by entering into forward foreign currency exchange contracts. The terms of these contracts are for periods matching the duration of the underlying exposure and generally range from one to twelve months. Currently, our largest foreign currency exposure is the Euro, primarily because our European operations have the highest proportion of our local currency denominated expenses. Relative to foreign currency exposures existing at November 3, 2018 and October 28, 2017, a 10% unfavorable movement in foreign currency exchange rates over the course of the year would result in approximately $14.1 million of losses and $10.1 million of losses, respectively, in changes in earnings or cash flows.42The market risk associated with our derivative instruments results from currency exchange rates that are expected to offset the market risk of the underlying transactions, assets and liabilities being hedged. The counterparties to the agreements relating to our foreign exchange instruments consist of a number of major international financial institutions with high credit ratings. Based on the credit ratings of our counterparties as of November 3, 2018, we do not believe that there is significant risk of nonperformance by them. While the contract or notional amounts of derivative financial instruments provide one measure of the volume of these transactions, they do not represent the amount of our exposure to credit risk. The amounts potentially subject to credit risk (arising from the possible inability of counterparties to meet the terms of their contracts) are generally limited to the amounts, if any, by which the counterparties’ obligations under the contracts exceed our obligations to the counterparties.The following table illustrates the effect that a 10% unfavorable or favorable movement in foreign currency exchange rates, relative to the U.S. dollar, would have on the fair value of our forward exchange contracts as of November 3, 2018 and October 28, 2017: November 3, 2018 October 28, 2017Fair value of forward exchange contracts liability$(7,150) $(1,527)Fair value of forward exchange contracts after a 10% unfavorable movement in foreign currency exchange rates asset$13,591 $18,557Fair value of forward exchange contracts after a 10% favorable movement in foreign currency exchange rates liability$(26,532) $(20,415)The calculation assumes that each exchange rate would change in the same direction relative to the U.S. dollar. In addition to the direct effects of changes in exchange rates, such changes typically affect the volume of sales or the foreign currency sales price as competitors’ products become more or less attractive. Our sensitivity analysis of the effects of changes in foreign currency exchange rates does not factor in a potential change in sales levels or local currency selling prices.43REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRMThe Board of Directors and Shareholders Analog Devices, Inc.Opinion on the Financial StatementsWe have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Analog Devices, Inc. (the Company) as of November 3, 2018 and October 28, 2017, the related consolidated statements of income, comprehensive income, shareholders' equity and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended November 3, 2018, and the related notes and financial statement schedule listed in the Index at Item 15(a)(2) (collectively referred to as the “consolidated financial statements”). In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company at November 3, 2018 and October 28, 2017, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended November 3, 2018, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of November 3, 2018, based on criteria established in Internal Control-Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework), and our report dated November 27, 2018 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.Basis for Opinion These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion./s/ Ernst & Young LLPWe have served as the Company’s auditor since 1967.

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (all tabular amounts in thousands except per share amounts)The following discussion includes a comparison of our Results of Operations and Liquidity and Capital Resources for the fiscal year ended November 2, 2019 (fiscal 2019) and the fiscal year ended November 3, 2018 (fiscal 2018). Our fiscal year is the 52-week or 53-week period ending on the Saturday closest to the last day in October. Fiscal 2019 and fiscal 2017 were 52-week fiscal periods, while fiscal 2018 was a 53-week period. The additional week in fiscal 2018 was included in the first quarter ended February 3, 2018. Therefore, fiscal 2018 included an additional week of operations as compared to fiscal 2019 and fiscal 2017. Results of OperationsWith the exception of items impacted by the adoption of ASU 2014-09 and resulting restatements, a discussion of changes in our results of operations from the fiscal year ended October 28, 2017 (fiscal 2017) to fiscal 2018 has been omitted from this Form 10-K, but may be found in “Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” of our Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended November 3, 2018 filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on November 27, 2018.Overview Fiscal Year2019 over 20182018 over 2017 20192018 (1)2017 (1) $ Change% Change $ Change% ChangeRevenue$5,991,065 $6,224,689 $5,246,354 $(233,624) (4)%$978,335 19 %Gross margin %67.0 %68.3 %60.4 %Net income$1,363,011 $1,506,980 $805,379 $(143,969) (10)%$701,601 87 %Net income as a % of revenue22.8 %24.2 %15.4 %Diluted EPS$3.65 $4.00 $2.29 $(0.35) (9)%$1.71 75 %_______________________________________(1) Balances have been restated to reflect the adoption of Accounting Standards Update (ASU) 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (ASU 2014-09). See Note 2a, Principles of Consolidation, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.Acquisition of Linear Technology CorporationOn March 10, 2017 (Acquisition Date), we completed the acquisition of Linear Technology Corporation (Linear), a designer, manufacturer and marketer of high performance analog integrated circuits. The total consideration paid to acquire Linear was approximately $15.8 billion, consisting of $11.1 billion in cash financed through existing cash on hand, net proceeds from bridge and term loan facilities and proceeds received from the issuance of senior unsecured notes, $4.6 billion from the issuance of our common stock and $0.1 billion of consideration related to the replacement of outstanding equity awards held by Linear employees. The acquisition of Linear is referred to as the Acquisition. The Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K include the financial results of Linear prospectively from the Acquisition Date. See Note 6, Acquisitions and Note 14, Debt, of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements contained in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further information.26Revenue Trends by End MarketThe following table summarizes revenue by end market. The categorization of revenue by end market is determined using a variety of data points including the technical characteristics of the product, the “sold to” customer information, the ""ship to"" customer information and the end customer product or application into which our product will be incorporated. As data systems for capturing and tracking this data and our methodology evolves and improves, the categorization of products by end market can vary over time. When this occurs, we reclassify revenue by end market for prior periods. Such reclassifications typically do not materially change the sizing of, or the underlying trends of results within each end market. 20192018 (1)2017 (1)Revenue% ofTotalProductRevenue (2)Y/Y%Revenue% ofTotalProductRevenue (2)Y/Y%Revenue% ofTotalProductRevenue (2)Industrial$3,003,927 50 %(4)%$3,129,569 50 %35 %$2,324,686 44 %Communications1,284,087 21 %12 %1,151,359 18 %27 %908,594 17 %Automotive933,143 16 %(8)%1,009,927 16 %33 %758,115 14 %Consumer769,908 13 %(18)%933,834 15 %(26)%1,254,959 24 %Total Revenue$5,991,065 100 %(4)%$6,224,689 100 %19 %$5,246,354 100 %_______________________________________(1)Balances have been restated to reflect the adoption of ASU 2014-09. See Note 2a, Principles of Consolidation, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements contained in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.(2)The sum of the individual percentages may not equal the total due to rounding.Industrial - Industrial end market revenues decreased in fiscal 2019, as compared to fiscal year 2018, primarily as a result of a decrease in demand for products sold into the automation and memory test sectors of this end market and one less week of operations in fiscal 2019 as compared to fiscal 2018, partially offset by an increase in demand for products sold into the aerospace and defense sector of this end market. Industrial end market revenue increased in fiscal 2018, as compared to fiscal 2017, primarily as a result of the Acquisition, which accounted for approximately $414.5 million of the increase, a broad-based increase in demand for our products in this end market and an additional week of operations in fiscal 2018 as compared to fiscal 2017. Communications - Communications end market revenue increased in fiscal 2019, as compared to fiscal year 2018, as a result of an increase in demand for our products sold into the wireless sector of this end market, partially offset by one less week of operations in fiscal 2019 as compared to fiscal 2018. Communications end market revenue increased in fiscal 2018, as compared to fiscal 2017, primarily as a result of the Acquisition, which accounted for approximately $43.5 million of the increase, a broad-based increase in demand for our products in this end market and an additional week of operations in fiscal 2018 as compared to fiscal 2017.Automotive - Automotive end market revenue decreased in fiscal 2019, as compared to fiscal 2018, primarily as a result of a broad-based decrease in demand for our products and one less week of operations in fiscal 2019, as compared to fiscal 2018. Automotive end market revenue increased in fiscal 2018, as compared to fiscal 2017, primarily as a result of the Acquisition, which accounted for approximately $92.6 million, a broad-based increase in demand for our products in this end market and an additional week of operations in fiscal 2018 as compared to fiscal 2017. Consumer - Consumer end market revenues decreased in fiscal 2019, as compared to fiscal 2018, primarily as a result of decreased demand for products used in portable consumer applications and one less week of operations in fiscal 2019 as compared to the fiscal 2018. Consumer end market revenue decreased in fiscal 2018, as compared to fiscal 2017, primarily as a result of a decreased demand for products used in portable consumer applications, partially offset by an increase in revenue due to the Acquisition and an additional week of operations in fiscal 2018 as compared to fiscal 2017. 27Revenue by Sales ChannelThe following tables summarize revenue by channel. We sell our products globally through a direct sales force, third party distributors, independent sales representatives and via our website. Distributors are customers that buy products with the intention of reselling them. Direct customers are non-distributor customers and consist primarily of original equipment manufacturers (OEMs). Other customers include the U.S. government, government prime contractors and some commercial customers. 20192018 (1)2017 (1)Revenue% ofTotalRevenue (2)Revenue% ofTotalRevenue (2)Revenue% ofTotalRevenue (2)Distributors$3,409,161 57 %$3,424,145 55 %$2,749,335 52 %Direct customers2,506,065 42 %2,721,885 44 %2,424,514 46 %Other75,839 1 %78,659 1 %72,505 1 %Total Revenue$5,991,065 100 %$6,224,689 100 %$5,246,354 100 %_______________________________________(1)Balances have been restated to reflect the adoption of ASU 2014-09.

The sales increase in the United States year-over-year in fiscal 2018 was primarily a result of the Acquisition, which accounted for approximately $255.3 million of the increase, contributing to an increase in demand for our products sold into the Industrial, Communications and Automotive end markets and an additional week of operations in fiscal 2018, as compared to fiscal 2017, partially offset by a decrease in demand for our products sold into the Consumer end market. The sales decrease in Europe year-over-year in fiscal 2019 was primarily a result of a broad-based decrease in demand for our products and one less week of operations in fiscal 2019 as compared to fiscal 2018, partially offset by an increase in demand for products sold into the Communications end market and aerospace and defense sectors of the Industrial end market. The sales increase in Europe year-over-year in fiscal 2018 was primarily a result of the Acquisition, which accounted for 28approximately $145.9 million of the increase, and contributing to an increase in demand for our products sold into the Industrial end market and an additional week of operations in fiscal 2018, as compared to fiscal 2017.The sales decrease in Japan year-over-year in fiscal 2019 was primarily a result of a broad-based decrease in demand for our products and one less week of operations in fiscal 2019 as compared to fiscal 2018, partially offset by an increase in demand for products sold into the Automotive end market. The sales increase in Japan year-over-year in fiscal 2018 was a result of the Acquisition, which accounted for approximately $89.2 million of the increase.The sales increase in China year-over-year in fiscal 2019 was primarily a result of an increase in demand for our products sold into the Communications end market, partially offset by decreased demand for products sold into the Consumer and Automotive end markets and one less week of operations in fiscal 2019 as compared to fiscal 2018. The sales increase in China year-over-year in fiscal 2018 was primarily a result of the Acquisition, which accounted for approximately $93.1 million of the increase, contributing to a broad-based increase in demand for our products sold into all end markets and an additional week of operations in fiscal 2018 as compared to fiscal 2017.Sales in the Rest of Asia year-over-year in fiscal 2019 remained relatively flat as increase in demand for our products sold into the Communications and Automotive end markets, were partially offset by decreased demand for products sold into the Industrial end market and one less week of operations in fiscal 2019 as compared to fiscal 2018. The sales increase in the Rest of Asia year-over-year in fiscal 2018 was primarily a result of the Acquisition, which accounted for approximately $63.4 million of the increase, contributing to a broad-based increase in demand for our products sold into the Industrial, Communications and Automotive end markets and an additional week of operations in fiscal 2018 as compared to fiscal 2017.Gross MarginChange Fiscal Year2019 over 20182018 over 2017 20192018 (1)2017 (1)$ Change% Change$ Change% ChangeGross margin$4,013,750 $4,250,396 $3,168,241 $(236,646) (6)%$1,082,155 34 %Gross margin %67.0 %68.3 %60.4 %_______________________________________(1)Balances have been restated to reflect the adoption of ASU 2014-09. See Note 2a, Principles of Consolidation, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements contained in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.Gross margin percentage in fiscal 2019 decreased by 130 basis points compared to fiscal 2018, primarily as a result of lower internal utilization of our wafer fabrication facilities and a write-down of inventory primarily associated with a customer within our Communications end market.Gross margin percentage in fiscal 2018 increased by 790 basis points compared to fiscal 2017, primarily because fiscal 2017 included cost of sales adjustments of $358.7 million related to the sale of acquired Linear inventory written up to fair value. Additionally, the increase in gross margin percentage in fiscal 2018, as compared to fiscal 2017 was a result of a mix shift in favor of higher margin products being sold resulting from the Acquisition and lower cost of sales resulting from favorable factory variances related to increased utilization at our manufacturing facilities. The increase in gross margin percentage in fiscal 2018 was partially offset by increases in amortization expense of developed technology intangible assets and depreciation expense related to fixed assets as a result of a full year of expense for each related to the Acquisition.Research and Development (R&D)Change Fiscal Year2019 over 20182018 over 2017 201920182017$ Change % Change $ Change % Change R&D expenses$1,130,348 $1,165,047 $968,133 $(34,699) (3)%$196,914 20 %R&D expenses as a % of revenue18.9 %18.7 %18.5 %R&D expenses decreased in fiscal 2019 as compared to fiscal 2018 primarily as a result of decreases in variable compensation expense and one less week of operations in fiscal 2019 as compared to fiscal 2018, partially offset by increases in operational spending and R&D employee and related benefit expenses. R&D expenses as a percentage of revenue will fluctuate from year-to-year depending on the amount of revenue and the success of new product development efforts, which we view as critical to our future growth. We have hundreds of R&D projects underway, none of which we believe are material on an individual basis. We expect to continue the development of innovative technologies and processes for new products. We believe that a continued commitment to R&D is essential to 29maintain product leadership with our existing products as well as to provide innovative new product offerings, and therefore, we expect to continue to make significant R&D investments in the future.Selling, Marketing, General and Administrative (SMG&A)Change Fiscal Year2019 over 20182018 over 2017 201920182017$ Change% Change$ Change% ChangeSMG&A expenses$648,094 $695,540 $690,533 $(47,446) (7)%$5,007 1 %SMG&A expenses as a % of revenue10.8 %11.2 %13.2 %SMG&A expenses decreased in fiscal 2019 as compared to fiscal 2018, primarily as a result of decreases in variable compensation expense, acquisition-related costs and one less week of operations in fiscal 2019 as compared to fiscal 2018, partially offset an increase in operational spending.Amortization of IntangiblesChange Fiscal Year2019 over 20182018 over 2017 201920182017$ Change% Change$ Change% ChangeAmortization expenses$429,041 $428,902 $297,351 $139 — %$131,551 44 %Amortization expenses as a % of revenue7.2 %6.9 %5.7 %Amortization expenses was relatively flat in fiscal 2019 as compared to fiscal 2018 as we did not have any significant acquisitions of intangible assets in fiscal 2019. Intangible assets are being amortized on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful lives. Special ChargesWe monitor global macroeconomic conditions on an ongoing basis and continue to assess opportunities for improved operational effectiveness and efficiency, as well as a better alignment of expenses with revenues. As a result of these assessments, we have undertaken various restructuring actions over the past several years.Repositioning Action: During fiscal 2019, we recorded special charges of $88.1 million as a result of organizational initiatives to reposition our global workforce skill set to align with our long-term strategic plan. Approximately $73.9 million of these actions was for severance and fringe benefit costs in accordance with either our ongoing benefit plan or statutory requirements. The remaining $14.2 million related to the write-off of acquired intellectual property due to the Company’s decision to discontinue certain product development strategies. Once fully implemented, the repositioning actions are expected to result in net annualized cash savings of approximately $48.0 million. Closure of manufacturing facilities: As a result of our fiscal 2018 decision to consolidate certain wafer and test facility operations acquired as part of the Acquisition, we recorded special charges of $7.6 million during fiscal 2019, totaling $52.0 million on a cumulative basis through November 2, 2019. Over the next one to three years, we plan to close our Hillview wafer fabrication facility located in Milpitas, California and our Singapore test facility. We intend to transfer Hillview wafer fabrication production to our other internal facilities and to external foundries. In addition, we are planning to transition testing operations currently handled in our Singapore facility to our facilities in Penang, Malaysia and the Philippines, in addition to our outsourced assembly and test partners. The special charge recognized as a result of this action consists of severance and related benefit costs. We expect that this action will result in estimated annual salary, variable compensation and employee benefit savings of approximately $60.0 million once fully implemented.30Operating IncomeChange Fiscal Year2019 over 20182018 over 2017 20192018 (1)2017 (1)$ Change% Change$ Change% ChangeOperating income$1,710,608 $1,899,589 $1,162,761 $(188,981) (10)%$736,828 63 %Operating income as a % of revenue28.6 %30.5 %22.2 %_______________________________________(1)Balances have been restated to reflect the adoption of ASU 2014-09. See Note 2a, Principles of Consolidation, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements contained in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.The decrease in operating income in fiscal 2019 as compared to fiscal 2018 was primarily the result of a $236.6 million decrease in gross margin and a $34.3 million increase in special charges, partially offset by a $47.4 million decrease in SMG&A expenses and a $34.7 million decrease in R&D expenses as more fully described above under the headings Gross Margin, Special Charges, Selling, Marketing, General and Administrative (SMG&A) and Research and Development (R&D).The increase in operating income in fiscal 2018 as compared to fiscal 2017 was the result of a $1.1 billion increase in gross margin, partially offset by a $196.9 million increase in R&D expenses, a $131.6 million increase in amortization expense, an $11.8 million increase in special charges, and a $5.0 million increase in SMG&A expenses.Nonoperating (Income) ExpensesChange Fiscal Year2019 over 20182018 over 2017 201920182017$ Change$ ChangeInterest expense$229,075 $253,589 $250,840 $(24,514) $2,749 Interest income(10,229) (9,383) (30,333) (846) 20,950 Other, net6,034 69 7,507 5,965 (7,438) Total nonoperating expenses$224,880 $244,275 $228,014 $(19,395) $16,261 The year-over-year decrease in nonoperating expense in fiscal 2019 was primarily the result of a decrease in interest expense including lower amortized finance fees, which were accelerated as a result of principal repayments related to our previously outstanding 3-year and 5-year term loans, partially offset by an increase in other, net expenses resulting from the impairment of investments during fiscal 2019.See Note 14, Debt, of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements contained in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further information on debt issuances and commitments related to the Acquisition.

See Note 2a, Principles of Consolidation, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements contained in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.Our effective tax rate reflects the applicable tax rate in effect in the various tax jurisdictions around the world where our income is earned. Our effective income tax rate can also be impacted each year by discrete factors or events.The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 (Tax Legislation), enacted on December 22, 2017, contains significant changes to U.S. tax law, including lowering the U.S. corporate income tax rate to 21.0%, implementing a territorial tax system, and imposing a one-time tax on deemed repatriated earnings of foreign subsidiaries. We completed our accounting for the income tax effects of the Tax Legislation during fiscal 2019, in accordance with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 118. 31The tax rate for fiscal 2019 was below the U.S. statutory tax rate of 21% partially due to lower statutory tax rates applicable to our operations in the foreign jurisdictions from which we earn income and tax incentives such as the foreign derived intangible income deduction and research and development tax credits. These items are partially offset by the global intangible low-tax income (GILTI) tax. The tax rate for fiscal 2019 includes a $17.2 million tax benefit from a voluntary accounting policy change in the statutory statements of a foreign subsidiary, an $11.2 million tax benefit from an increase in tax credits upon filing our fiscal 2018 federal income tax return and excess tax benefits from stock-based compensation payments of $28.7 million. Similarly, our tax rate for fiscal 2018 was below our then blended U.S. federal statutory tax rate of 23.4%, primarily due to lower statutory tax rates applicable to our operations in the foreign jurisdictions in which we earn income and $25.6 million of tax benefit related to the release of uncertain tax positions due to lapses in statute of limitations. In addition, our effective tax rate for fiscal 2018 includes a provisional estimate for a discrete tax benefit of $637.0 million from remeasuring our U.S. deferred tax assets and liabilities at the lower 21.0% U.S. federal statutory tax rate and a provisional estimate of $691.0 million for the discrete tax charge from the Tax Legislation’s one-time transition tax associated with our undistributed foreign earnings, which is comprised of a $755.0 million transitional tax less a deferred tax liability of $64.0 million that was recorded in prior years and excess tax benefits from stock-based compensation payments of $26.2 million.Non-U.S. jurisdictions accounted for approximately 75.9% of our total revenues for both fiscal 2019 and fiscal 2018. This revenue generated outside of the U.S. results in a material portion of our pretax income being taxed outside the U.S. In fiscal 2019, this was primarily in Ireland and Singapore, at tax rates ranging from 12.5% to 17% and in fiscal 2018, this was primarily in Bermuda, Ireland and Singapore, at tax rates ranging from 0 to 33.3%. The impact on our provision for income taxes on income earned in foreign jurisdictions being taxed at rates different than the U.S. federal statutory rate was a benefit of approximately $242.9 million and a foreign effective tax rate of approximately 21.1% for fiscal 2019 as compared to a benefit of approximately $420.8 million and a foreign effective tax rate of approximately 5.2% for fiscal 2018. Our foreign effective tax rates for both periods are inclusive of certain non-deductible expenses which can result in tax rates higher than the applicable statutory tax rates. In addition, our effective income tax rate can be impacted each year by amounts for discrete factors or events and acquisition-related accounting adjustments.See Note 12, Income Taxes, of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements contained in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further discussion.

See Note 2a, Principles of Consolidation, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements contained in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.The decrease in net income in fiscal 2019 as compared to fiscal 2018 was a result of a $189.0 million decrease in operating income, partially offset by a $25.6 million decrease in provision for income taxes and a $19.4 million decrease in nonoperating expense.The increase in net income in fiscal 2018 as compared to fiscal 2017 was a result of a $736.8 million increase in operating income, partially offset by a $19.0 million increase in provision for income taxes and a $16.3 increase in nonoperating expense.The impact of inflation and foreign currency exchange rate movement on our results of operations during the past three fiscal years has not been significant.32Liquidity and Capital ResourcesAt November 2, 2019, our principal source of liquidity was $648.3 million of cash and cash equivalents, of which approximately $295.7 million was held in the United States. The balance of our cash and cash equivalents was held outside the United States in various foreign subsidiaries. As we intend to reinvest substantially all of our foreign earnings indefinitely, certain cash held outside the United States may not be available for repatriation as dividends to the United States in the future. If such funds are needed for U.S. operations, we would be required to accrue and pay foreign withholding and U.S. state income taxes to the extent not already subject to taxation. Our cash and cash equivalents consist of highly liquid investments with maturities of three months or less, including money market funds. We maintain these balances with high credit quality counterparties, continually monitor the amount of credit exposure to any one issuer and diversify our investments in order to minimize our credit risk.On the Acquisition Date, we entered into a 90-day Bridge Credit Agreement that provided for unsecured loans in an aggregate principal amount of up to $4.1 billion and borrowed under a term loan agreement consisting of a 3-year unsecured term loan in the principal amount of $2.5 billion, due March 10, 2020 and a 5-year unsecured term loan in the principal amount of $2.5 billion, due March 10, 2022. During fiscal year 2019, we refinanced both term loans into one 3-year unsecured term loan in the principal amount of $1.25 billion, due March 10, 2022. As of November 2, 2019, we have repaid $325 million of principal on the 3-year unsecured term loan. See Note 13, Revolving Credit Facility and Note 14, Debt of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements contained in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further information.We believe that our existing sources of liquidity and cash expected to be generated from future operations, together with existing and anticipated available long-term financing, will be sufficient to fund operations, capital expenditures, research and development efforts and dividend payments (if any) in the immediate future and for at least the next twelve months.

See Note 2a, Principles of Consolidation, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements contained in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.At November 2, 2019, cash and cash equivalents totaled $648.3 million. The following changes contributed to the net change in cash and cash equivalents in fiscal 2019 and fiscal 2018. A discussion of changes in our results of operations from fiscal 2017 to fiscal 2018 has been omitted from this Form 10-K, but may be found in “Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” of our Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended November 3, 2018 filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on November 27, 2018.Operating ActivitiesCash provided by operating activities is net income adjusted for certain non-cash items and changes in assets and liabilities. The decrease in cash provided by operating activities during fiscal 2019, as compared to fiscal 2018, was primarily a result of changes in tax liabilities related to the one-time transition tax as a result of the Tax Legislation.Investing ActivitiesInvesting cash flows consist primarily of capital expenditures and cash used for acquisitions. The decrease in cash used for investing activities during fiscal 2019, as compared to fiscal 2018, was primarily the result of decreased payments for acquisitions, partially offset by increased capital spending.Financing ActivitiesFinancing cash flows consist primarily of payments of dividends to stockholders, repurchases of common stock, issuance and repayment of debt, and proceeds from the sale of shares of common stock pursuant to employee equity incentive plans. The decrease in cash used for financing activities during fiscal 2019, as compared to fiscal 2018, was primarily due to an increase in proceeds from debt related to the June 2019 term loan agreement and a decrease in debt repayments, partially offset by increases in stock repurchases and dividend payments.33Working Capital Fiscal Year 20192018$ Change% ChangeAccounts receivable, net$635,136 $639,717 $(4,581) (1)%Days sales outstanding (1) (2)39 39 Inventory$609,886 $586,760 $23,126 4 %Days cost of sales in inventory (1) (2)110 105 _______________________________________(1)Balances have been restated to reflect the adoption of ASU 2014-09.

The decrease in accounts receivable for fiscal 2019 compared to fiscal 2018 was primarily the result of normal variations in the timing of collections and billings. Inventory in dollars increased in fiscal 2019 as compared to fiscal 2018, primarily as a result of our efforts to balance manufacturing production, demand and inventory levels. Our inventory levels are impacted by our need to support forecasted sales demand and variations between those forecasts and actual demand.Current liabilities increased to $1.5 billion at November 2, 2019 from $1.1 billion recorded at the end of fiscal 2018. The increase was primarily due to increases in the current portion of our debt and income taxes payable. DebtAs of November 2, 2019, we had $5.5 billion of carrying value outstanding on our debt. The difference in the carrying value of the debt and the principal is due to the unamortized discount and issuance fees on these instruments that will accrete to the face value over the term of the debt. Our debt obligations consist of the following:$500.0 Million Aggregate Principal Amount of 2.875% Senior Unsecured Notes (2023 Notes)On June 3, 2013, we issued the 2023 Notes with semi-annual fixed interest payments due on June 1 and December 1 of each year, commencing December 1, 2013.$850.0 Million Aggregate Principal Amount of 3.9% Senior Unsecured Notes (2025 Notes) and $400.0 Million Aggregate Principal Amount of 5.3% Senior Unsecured Notes (2045 Notes)On December 14, 2015, we issued the 2025 Notes and the 2045 Notes with semi-annual fixed interest payments due on June 15 and December 15 of each year, commencing June 15, 2016. $400 Million Aggregate Principal Amount of 2.5% Senior Unsecured Notes (2021 Notes), $550 Million Aggregate Principal Amount of 3.125% Senior Unsecured Notes (December 2023 Notes), $900 Million Aggregate Principal Amount of 3.5% Senior Unsecured Notes (2026 Notes) and $250 Million Aggregate Principal Amount of 4.5% Senior Unsecured Notes (2036 Notes)On December 5, 2016, we issued the 2021 Notes, the December 2023 Notes, the 2026 Notes and the 2036 Notes with semi-annual fixed interest payments due on June 5 and December 5 of each year, commencing June 5, 2017.$300.0 Million Aggregate Principal Amount of 2.85% Senior Unsecured Notes (2020 Notes) and $450.0 Million Aggregate Principal Amount of 2.95% Senior Unsecured Notes (January 2021 Notes)On March 12, 2018, we issued the 2020 Notes with semi-annual fixed interest payments due on March 12 and September 12 of each year, commencing September 12, 2018, and the January 2021 Notes with semi-annual fixed interest payments due on January 12 and July 12 of each year, commencing July 12, 2018. The indentures governing the 2020 Notes, 2021 Notes, January 2021 Notes, 2023 Notes, December 2023 Notes, 2025 Notes, 2026 Notes, 2036 Notes and 2045 Notes contain covenants that may limit our ability to: incur, create, assume or guarantee any debt or borrowed money secured by a lien upon a principal property; enter into sale and lease-back transactions with respect to a principal property; and consolidate with or merge into, or transfer or lease all or substantially all of our assets to, any other party. As of November 2, 2019, we were compliant with these covenants. See Note 14, Debt, of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements contained in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further information on our outstanding debt.34$5.0 Billion Aggregate Principal Term LoansOn the Acquisition Date, we drew down on a 3-year unsecured term loan in the principal amount of $2.5 billion, due March 10, 2020 and a 5-year unsecured term loan in the principal amount of $2.5 billion, due March 10, 2022. The term loans bore interest at a rate per annum equal to the Eurodollar Rate plus a margin based on our debt ratings from time to time of between 0.75% and 1.63% in the case of the 3-year unsecured term loan, and a margin of between 0.88% and 1.75% in the case of the 5-year unsecured term loan. As of November 2, 2019, we have repaid the 3-year and 5-year unsecured term loans in full. $1.25 Billion Principal Term LoanOn June 28, 2019, we entered into a term loan credit agreement with JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. as administrative agent and the other banks identified therein as lenders, under which we borrowed unsecured term loans in the aggregate principal amount of $1.25 billion, maturing March 10, 2022, to refinance our then-outstanding 3-year and 5-year unsecured term loans. Loans under the term loan credit agreement may be either Eurodollar Rate Loans or Base Rate Loans at our option. Each Eurodollar Rate Loan will bear interest at a rate per annum equal to the Adjusted LIBO Rate plus a margin based on our debt ratings from time to time of between 0.625% and 1.500%. Each Base Rate Loan will bear interest at a rate per annum equal to the Base Rate plus a margin based on our debt ratings from time to time of between 0.00% and 0.500%. As of November 2, 2019, we have repaid $325.0 million of principal on the term loans.Revolving Credit FacilityOn June 28, 2019, we entered into a second amended and restated revolving credit agreement with Bank of America N.A. as administrative agent and the other banks identified therein as lenders (Revolving Credit Agreement), which further amended and restated our amended and restated revolving credit agreement dated as of September 23, 2016. The Revolving Credit Agreement provides for a five year unsecured revolving credit facility in an aggregate principal amount of up to $1.25 billion, expiring on June 28, 2024. Loans under the Revolving Credit Agreement can be Eurocurrency Rate Loans or Base Rate Loans at our option. Each Eurocurrency Rate Loan will bear interest at a rate per annum equal to the Eurocurrency Rate plus a margin based on our debt ratings from time to time of between 0.690% and 1.375%. Each Base Rate Loan will bear interest at a rate per annum equal to the Base Rate plus a margin based on our debt ratings from time to time of between 0.00% and 0.375%. In December 2018, we borrowed $75.0 million under the previous revolving credit facility and utilized the proceeds for the repayment of existing indebtedness and working capital requirements. We repaid the $75.0 million plus interest of $0.2 million in January 2019. As of November 2, 2019, we have no outstanding borrowings under the revolving credit facility, but we may borrow in the future and use the proceeds for repayment of existing indebtedness, stock repurchases, acquisitions, capital expenditures, working capital and other lawful corporate purposes. The terms of the Revolving Credit Agreement impose restrictions on our ability to undertake certain transactions, to create certain liens on assets and to incur certain subsidiary indebtedness. In addition, the Revolving Credit Agreement contains a consolidated leverage ratio covenant of total consolidated funded debt to consolidated earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA) of not greater than 4.0 to 1.0. The debt covenant will be reduced over time to 3.5 to 1.0, beginning in fiscal 2020 depending upon facts and circumstances. As of November 2, 2019, we were compliant with these covenants. See Note 13, Revolving Credit Facility, of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements contained in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further information on our revolving credit facility.Stock Repurchase ProgramOur common stock repurchase program has been in place since August 2004. In the aggregate, our Board of Directors has authorized us to repurchase $8.2 billion of our common stock under the program. Under the program, we may repurchase outstanding shares of our common stock from time to time in the open market and through privately negotiated transactions. Unless terminated earlier by resolution of our Board of Directors, the repurchase program will expire when we have repurchased all shares authorized under the program. In connection with the Acquisition, we temporarily suspended the share repurchase program. On August 21, 2018, we reinstated the share repurchase program, and as of November 2, 2019, we had repurchased a total of approximately 154.4 million shares of its common stock for approximately $6.1 billion under this program. An additional $2.1 billion remains available for repurchase of shares under the current authorized program. The repurchased shares are held as authorized but unissued shares of common stock. We also, from time to time, repurchase shares in settlement of employee tax withholding obligations due upon the vesting of restricted stock units/awards or the exercise of stock options. Capital ExpendituresNet additions to property, plant and equipment were $275.4 million in fiscal 2019 and were funded with a combination of cash on hand and cash generated from operations. We expect capital expenditures for fiscal 2020 to be slightly below 4% of 35fiscal 2020 revenue. These capital expenditures will be funded with a combination of cash on hand and cash generated from operations.DividendsOn November 25, 2019, our Board of Directors declared a cash dividend of $0.54 per outstanding share of common stock. The dividend will be paid on December 17, 2019 to all shareholders of record at the close of business on December 6, 2019 and is expected to total approximately $198.9 million. We currently expect quarterly dividends to continue in future periods, although they remain subject to determination and declaration by our Board of Directors. The payment of future dividends, if any, will be based on several factors, including our financial performance, outlook and liquidity.36Contractual ObligationsThe table below summarizes our contractual obligations and the amounts we owe under these contracts in specified periods as of November 2, 2019: Payment due by period Less than More than(thousands)Total1 Year1-3 Years3-5 Years5 YearsContractual obligations: Transition tax (1)$659,773 $33,032 $119,379 $171,608 $335,754 Operating leases (2)448,721 79,789 108,331 70,430 190,171 Debt obligations (3)5,525,000 300,000 1,775,000 1,050,000 2,400,000 Interest payments associated with debt obligations1,456,063 182,268 314,539 234,356 724,900 Deferred compensation plan (4)48,302 1,148 — — 47,154 Pension funding (5)7,565 7,565 — — — Total$8,145,424 $603,802 $2,317,249 $1,526,394 $3,697,979 _______________________________________(1)The Tax Legislation, enacted on December 22, 2017, contains significant changes to U.S. tax law, including lowering the U.S. corporate income tax rate to 21.0%, implementing a territorial tax system, and imposing a one-time tax on deemed repatriated earnings of foreign subsidiaries that we elected to pay over a period of eight years that begins in fiscal 2019 on an interest free basis.(2)Certain of our operating lease obligations include escalation clauses. These escalating payment requirements are reflected in the table.(3)Debt obligations are assumed to be held to maturity. (4)These payments relate to obligations under our deferred compensation plan. The deferred compensation plan allows certain members of management and other highly-compensated employees and non-employee directors to defer receipt of all or any portion of their compensation. The amount in the “More than 5 Years” column of the table represents the remaining total balance under the deferred compensation plan to be paid to participants who have not terminated employment. Since we cannot reasonably estimate the timing of withdrawals for participants who have not yet terminated employment, we have included the future obligation to these participants in the “More than 5 Years” column of the table.(5)Our funding policy for our foreign defined benefit plans is consistent with the local requirements of each country. The payment obligations in the table are estimates of our expected contributions to these plans for fiscal year 2019. The actual future payments may differ from the amounts presented in the table and reasonable estimates of payments beyond one year are not practical because of potential future changes in variables, such as plan asset performance, interest rates and the rate of increase in compensation levels.As of November 2, 2019, our total liabilities associated with uncertain tax positions was $27.7 million, which are included in non-current income taxes payable in our consolidated balance sheets contained in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Due to the complexity associated with our deferred taxes and tax uncertainties, we cannot make a reasonably reliable estimate of the period in which we expect to settle the non-current liabilities associated with these deferred taxes and uncertain tax positions. Therefore, we have not included these deferred taxes and uncertain tax positions in the above contractual obligations table.The expected timing of payments and the amounts of the obligations discussed above are estimated based on current information available as of November 2, 2019.Off-balance Sheet ArrangementsAs of November 2, 2019, we had no off-balance sheet financing arrangements.New Accounting PronouncementsFrom time to time, new accounting pronouncements are issued by the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) and are adopted by us as of the specified effective date. Unless otherwise discussed, management believes that the impact of recently issued standards will not have a material impact on our future financial condition and results of operations. See Note 2s, New Accounting Pronouncements, of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements contained in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for a description of recently issued and adopted accounting pronouncements, including the dates of adoption and impact on our historical financial condition and results of operations.Critical Accounting Policies and EstimatesManagement’s discussion and analysis of the financial condition and results of operations is based upon the Consolidated Financial Statements, which have been prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue and expenses, and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. We base our estimates and judgments on historical experience, knowledge 37of current conditions and beliefs of what could occur in the future based on available information. We consider the following accounting policies to be both those most important to the portrayal of our financial condition and those that require the most subjective judgment. If actual results differ significantly from management’s estimates and projections, there could be a material effect on our financial statements. We also have other policies that we consider key accounting policies; however, the application of these policies does not require us to make significant estimates or judgments that are difficult or subjective.Revenue RecognitionRecognition of revenue occurs when a customer obtains control of promised goods or services in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the providing entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. As a result of the adoption of new revenue accounting rules in the first quarter of fiscal 2019, we revised our revenue recognition policy. We now recognize revenue upon transfer of control of promised products or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration that we expect to receive in exchange for those products or services. Under this rule, we recognize revenue when all of the following criteria are met: (1) we have entered into a binding agreement, (2) the performance obligations have been identified, (3) the transaction price to the customer has been determined, (4) the transaction price has been allocated to the performance obligations in the contract, and (5) the performance obligations have been satisfied. The majority of our shipping terms permit us to recognize revenue at point of shipment or delivery. Certain shipping terms require the goods to be through customs or be received by the customer before title passes. In those instances, we defer the revenue recognized until title has passed. Shipping costs are charged to selling, marketing, general and administrative expense as incurred. Sales taxes are excluded from revenue.Revenue from contracts with the United States government, government prime contractors and certain commercial customers is recorded over time using either units delivered or costs incurred as the measurement basis for progress toward completion. These measures are used to measure results directly and is generally the best measure of progress toward completion in circumstances in which a reliable measure of output can be established. Estimated revenue in excess of amounts billed is reported as unbilled receivables. Contract accounting requires judgment in estimating costs and assumptions related to technical issues and delivery schedule. Contract costs include material, subcontract costs, labor and an allocation of indirect costs. The estimation of costs at completion of a contract is subject to numerous variables involving contract costs and estimates as to the length of time to complete the contract. Changes in contract performance, estimated gross margin, including the impact of final contract settlements, and estimated losses are recognized in the period in which the changes or losses are determined.Performance Obligations: Substantially all of our contracts with customers contain a single performance obligation, the sale of mixed-signal integrated circuit (IC) products. Such sales represent a single performance obligation because the sale is one type of good or includes multiple goods that are neither capable of being distinct nor separable from the other promises in the contract. This performance obligation is satisfied when control of the product is transferred to the customer, which occurs upon shipment or delivery. Unsatisfied performance obligations primarily represent contracts for products with future delivery dates and with an original expected duration of one year or less. As allowed under ASU 2014-09, we have opted to not disclose the amount of unsatisfied performance obligations as these contracts have original expected durations of less than one year. We generally warrant that our products will meet their published specifications, and that we will repair or replace defective products, for one year from the date title passes from us to the customer. Specific accruals are recorded for known product warranty issues. Transaction Price: The transaction price reflects our expectations about the consideration we will be entitled to receive from the customer and may include fixed or variable amounts. Fixed consideration primarily includes sales to direct customers and sales to distributors in which both the sale to the distributor and the sale to the end customer occur within the same reporting period. Variable consideration includes sales in which the amount of consideration that we will receive is unknown as of the end of a reporting period. Such consideration primarily includes credits issued to the distributor due to price protection and sales made to distributors under agreements that allow certain rights of return, referred to as stock rotation. Price protection represents price discounts granted to certain distributors to allow the distributor to earn an appropriate margin on sales negotiated with certain customers and in the event of a price decrease subsequent to the date the product was shipped and billed to the distributor. Stock rotation allows distributors limited levels of returns in order to reduce the amounts of slow-moving, discontinued or obsolete product from their inventory. A liability for distributor credits covering variable consideration is made based on management's estimate of historical experience rates as well as considering economic conditions and contractual terms. To date, actual distributor claims activity has been materially consistent with the provisions we have made based on our historical estimates.Contract Balances: Accounts receivable represents our unconditional right to receive consideration from its customers. Payments are typically due within 30 to 45 days of invoicing and do not include a significant financing component. To date, there have been no material impairment losses on accounts receivable. There were no material contract assets or contract liabilities recorded on the consolidated balance sheets in any of the periods presented.38Inventory ValuationWe value inventories at the lower of cost (first-in, first-out method) or market. Because of the cyclical nature of the semiconductor industry, changes in inventory levels, obsolescence of technology, and product life cycles, we write down inventories to net realizable value. We employ a variety of methodologies to determine the net realizable value of inventory. While a portion of the calculation is determined via reference to the age of inventory and lower of cost or market calculations, an element of the calculation is subject to significant judgments made by us about future demand for our inventory. If actual demand for our products is less than our estimates, additional adjustments to existing inventories may need to be recorded in future periods. To date, our actual results have not been materially different than our estimates, and we do not expect them to be materially different in the future.Long-Lived AssetsWe review property, plant, and equipment and finite lived intangible assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of assets may not be recoverable. Recoverability of these assets is determined by comparison of their carrying value to the estimated future undiscounted cash flows that the assets are expected to generate over their remaining estimated lives. If such assets are considered to be impaired, the impairment to be recognized in earnings equals the amount by which the carrying value of the assets exceeds their fair value determined by either a quoted market price, if any, or a value determined by utilizing a discounted cash flow technique. Although we have recognized no material impairment adjustments related to our property, plant, and equipment and identified intangible assets during the past three fiscal years, except those made in conjunction with restructuring actions, deterioration in our business in the future could lead to such impairment adjustments in future periods. Evaluation of impairment of long-lived assets requires estimates of future operating results that are used in the preparation of the expected future undiscounted cash flows. Actual future operating results and the remaining economic lives of our long-lived assets could differ from the estimates used in assessing the recoverability of these assets. These differences could result in impairment charges, which could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations. In addition, in certain instances, assets may not be impaired but their estimated useful lives may have decreased. In these situations, we amortize the remaining net book values over the revised useful lives. We review indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment annually, on the first day of the fourth quarter (on or about August 4) or more frequently if indicators of impairment exist. We perform a qualitative assessment on our indefinite-lived intangible assets to determine whether it is more likely-than not that the indefinite-lived intangible asset is impaired. If it is determined that the fair value of the indefinite-lived intangible asset is less than the carrying value, we would compare the fair value of the intangible asset with its carrying amount and recognize an impairment equal to any amount by which the carrying value of the assets exceeds the fair value.GoodwillGoodwill is subject to annual impairment tests or more frequently if indicators of potential impairment exist and suggest that the carrying value of goodwill may not be recoverable from estimated discounted future cash flows. We test goodwill for impairment at the reporting unit level, which we determined to be the same level as our eight identified operating segments, on an annual basis in the fourth quarter (on or about August 4) or more frequently if we believe indicators of impairment exist. We have the option to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its net book value. If we elect not to use this option, or we determine that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its net book value, then we perform the quantitative goodwill impairment test. The quantitative goodwill impairment test requires an entity to compare the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying amount. If fair value is determined to be less than carrying value, an impairment loss is recognized for the amount of the carrying value that exceeds the amount of the reporting unit's fair value, not to exceed the total amount of goodwill allocated to the reporting unit. Additionally, we consider income tax effects from any tax deductible goodwill on the carrying amount of the reporting unit when measuring the goodwill impairment loss, if applicable. We determine the fair value of our reporting units using a weighting of the income and market approaches. Under the income approach, we use a discounted cash flow methodology which requires management to make significant estimates and assumptions related to forecasted revenues, gross profit margins, operating income margins, working capital cash flow, perpetual growth rates, and long-term discount rates, among others. For the market approach, we use the guideline public company method. Under this method we utilize information from comparable publicly traded companies with similar operating and investment characteristics as the reporting units, to create valuation multiples that are applied to the operating performance of the reporting unit being tested, in order to obtain their respective fair values. In order to assess the reasonableness of the calculated reporting unit fair values, we reconcile the aggregate fair values of our reporting units determined, as described above, to its current market capitalization, allowing for a reasonable control premium. 39In fiscal 2017 and prior periods, we did not elect to use the qualitative option for assessing goodwill and instead proceeded directly to the quantitative goodwill impairment analysis. In fiscal 2018, we used the qualitative method of assessing goodwill for all eight of our reporting units. In our latest annual impairment evaluation that occurred as of August 4, 2019, we used the qualitative method of assessing goodwill for seven of our eight reporting units and the quantitative method for one reporting unit. For each of the reporting units evaluated using the qualitative method, we determined that it was not more likely than not that the fair values were less than their net book values. In making this determination, we considered several factors, including the following:–the amount by which the fair values of each reporting unit exceeded their carrying values as of the date of the most recent quantitative impairment analysis, which indicated there would need to be substantial negative developments in the markets in which these reporting units operate in order for there to be potential impairment;–the carrying values of these reporting units as of August 4, 2019 compared to the previously calculated fair values as of the date of the most recent quantitative impairment analysis;–the current forecasts as compared to the forecasts included in the most recent quantitative impairment analysis;–public information from competitors and other industry information to determine if there were any significant adverse trends in our competitors' businesses, such as significant declines in market capitalization or significant goodwill impairment charges that could be an indication that the goodwill of our reporting units was potentially impaired;–changes in the value of major U.S. stock indices that could suggest declines in overall market stability that could impact the valuation of our reporting units;–changes in our market capitalization and overall enterprise valuation to determine if there were any significant decreases that could be an indication that the valuation of our reporting units had significantly decreased; and–whether there had been any significant increases to the weighted-average cost of capital (WACC) rates for each reporting unit, which could materially lower our prior valuation conclusions under a discounted cash flow approach.For the reporting unit we assessed goodwill using the quantitative method, we calculated its fair value and compared it with its carrying value. In calculating fair value, we used a weighting of the income and market approaches. Under the income approach, we used a discounted cash flow methodology which required significant estimates and assumptions related to forecasted revenues, gross profit margins, operating income margins, working capital cash flow, perpetual growth rates, and long-term discount rates, among others. For the market approach, we used the guideline public company method. Under this method we utilized information from comparable publicly traded companies with similar operating and investment characteristics as the reporting unit, to create valuation multiples that were applied to the operating performance of the reporting unit, in order to obtain its fair value. As a result of this analysis, we concluded the reporting unit’s fair value exceeded its carrying amount as of the assessment date and no risk of impairment existed. Business CombinationsUnder the acquisition method of accounting, we recognize tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their estimated fair values. We record the excess of the fair value of the purchase consideration over the value of the net assets acquired as goodwill. The accounting for business combinations requires us to make significant estimates and assumptions, especially with respect to intangible assets and the fair value of contingent payment obligations. Critical estimates in valuing purchased technology, customer lists and other identifiable intangible assets include future cash flows that we expect to generate from the acquired assets. If the subsequent actual results and updated projections of the underlying business activity change compared with the assumptions and projections used to develop these values, we could experience impairment charges which could be material. In addition, we have estimated the economic lives of certain acquired assets and these lives are used to calculate depreciation and amortization expense. If our estimates of the economic lives change, depreciation or amortization expenses could be accelerated or slowed.We record contingent consideration resulting from a business combination at its fair value on the acquisition date. We generally determine the fair value of the contingent consideration using the income approach methodology of valuation. Each reporting period thereafter, we revalue these obligations and record increases or decreases in their fair value as an adjustment to operating expenses within the consolidated statements of income. Changes in the fair value of the contingent consideration can result from changes in assumed discount periods and rates, and from changes pertaining to the achievement of the defined milestones. Significant judgment is employed in determining the appropriateness of these assumptions as of the acquisition date and for each subsequent period. Accordingly, future business and economic conditions, as well as changes in any of the assumptions described above, can materially impact the amount of contingent consideration expense we record in any given period.40Accounting for Income TaxesWe must make certain estimates and judgments in determining income tax expense for financial statement purposes. These estimates and judgments occur in the calculation of tax credits, benefits, and deductions, and in the calculation of certain tax assets and liabilities, which arise from differences in the timing of the recognition of revenue and expense for tax and financial statement purposes, as well as the interest and penalties relating to these uncertain tax positions. We assessed the likelihood of the realization of deferred tax assets and concluded that a valuation allowance is needed to reserve the amount of the deferred tax assets that may not be realized due to the uncertainty of the timing and amount of the realization of certain state credit carryovers. In reaching our conclusion, we evaluated certain relevant criteria including the existence of deferred tax liabilities that can be used to realize deferred tax assets, the taxable income in prior carryback years in the impacted state jurisdictions that can be used to absorb net operating losses and taxable income in future years. Our judgments regarding future profitability may change due to future market conditions, changes in U.S. or international tax laws and other factors. These changes, if any, may require material adjustments to these deferred tax assets, resulting in a reduction in net income or an increase in net loss in the period when such determinations are made, which in turn, may result in an increase or decrease to our tax provision in a subsequent period.We account for uncertain tax positions by determining if it is “more likely than not” that a tax position will be sustained by the appropriate taxing authorities prior to recording any benefit in the financial statements. An uncertain income tax position is not recognized if it has less than a 50% likelihood of being sustained. For those tax positions where it is more likely than not that a tax benefit will be sustained, we have recorded the largest amount of tax benefit with a greater than 50% likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement with a taxing authority that has full knowledge of all relevant information. For those income tax positions where it is not more likely than not that a tax benefit will be sustained, no tax benefit has been recognized in the financial statements. We reevaluate these uncertain tax positions on a quarterly basis. This evaluation is based on factors including, but not limited to, changes in known facts or circumstances, changes in tax law, effectively settled issues under audit, and new audit activity. A change in these factors would result in the recognition of a tax benefit or an additional charge to the tax provision.In the ordinary course of global business, there are many transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax outcome is uncertain. Some of these uncertainties arise as a consequence of cost reimbursement and royalty arrangements among related entities. Although we believe our estimates are reasonable, no assurance can be given that the final tax outcome of these matters will not be different than that which is reflected in our historical income tax provisions and accruals. In the event our assumptions are incorrect, the differences could have a material impact on our income tax provision and operating results in the period in which such determination is made. In addition to the factors described above, our current and expected effective tax rate is based on then-current tax law. Significant changes during the year in enacted tax law could affect these estimates.See Note 12, Income Taxes, of the of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements contained in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further discussion.Stock-Based CompensationStock-based compensation expense associated with stock options and related awards is recognized in the consolidated statements of income. Determining the amount of stock-based compensation to be recorded requires us to develop estimates to be used in calculating the grant-date fair value of stock options and market-based restricted stock units. We calculate the grant-date fair values of stock options using the Black-Scholes valuation model. The use of valuation models requires us to make estimates of key assumptions such as expected option term and stock price volatility to determine the fair value of a stock option. The estimate of these key assumptions is based on historical information and judgment regarding market factors and trends. We recognize the expense related to equity awards on a straight-line basis over the vesting period. See Note 3, Stock-Based Compensation and Shareholders' Equity, of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements contained in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for more information related to stock based compensation.ContingenciesFrom time to time, in the ordinary course of business, various claims, charges and litigation are asserted or commenced against us arising from, or related to, among other things, contractual matters, patents, trademarks, personal injury, environmental matters, product liability, insurance coverage, employment or employment benefits. We periodically assess each matter to determine if a contingent liability should be recorded. In making this determination, we may, depending on the nature of the matter, consult with internal and external legal counsel and technical experts. Based on the information we obtain, combined with our judgment regarding all the facts and circumstances of each matter, we determine whether it is probable that a contingent loss may be incurred and whether the amount of such loss can be reasonably estimated. If a loss is probable and reasonably estimable, we record a contingent loss. In determining the amount of a contingent loss, we consider advice received from experts in the specific matter, current status of legal proceedings, settlement negotiations that may be ongoing, prior case 41history and other factors. If the judgments and estimates made by us are incorrect, we may need to record additional contingent losses that could materially adversely impact our results of operations.42 ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISKInterest Rate ExposureOur interest income and expense are sensitive to changes in the general level of interest rates. In this regard, changes in interest rates affect the interest earned or paid on our marketable securities and debt, as well as the fair value of our investments and debt.During fiscal 2019, we entered into a term loan credit agreement, under which we borrowed unsecured term loans in the aggregate principal amount of $1.25 billion, maturing March 10, 2022. Loans under the term loan agreement may be Eurodollar Rate Loans or Base Rate Loans at our option. Each Eurodollar Rate Loan will bear interest at a rate per annum equal to the Adjusted LIBO Rate plus a margin based on our debt ratings from time to time of between 0.625% and 1.500%. Each Base Rate Loan will bear interest at a rate per annum equal to the Base Rate plus a margin based on our debt ratings from time to time of between 0.000% and 0.500%. In fiscal 2019, we made principal payments on the term loans in the amount of $325.0 million. Based on the $925 million of floating rate debt outstanding as of November 2, 2019, our annual interest expense would change by approximately $9.3 million for each 100 basis point increase in interest rates. We utilize interest rate derivatives to manage interest rate exposure on both outstanding debt as well as future issuances. As of November 2, 2019, for each 100 basis point decrease in the ten-year U.S. Treasury rate, the fair value of our outstanding derivative instruments would change by approximately $100 million.Based on our marketable securities outstanding as of November 2, 2019 and November 3, 2018, our annual interest income would change by approximately $6.5 million and $8.2 million, respectively, for each 100 basis point increase in interest rates.To provide a meaningful assessment of the interest rate risk associated with our investment portfolio, we performed a sensitivity analysis to determine the impact a change in interest rates would have on the value of our investment portfolio assuming a 100 basis point parallel shift in the yield curve. Based on investment positions as of November 2, 2019 and November 3, 2018, a hypothetical 100 basis point increase in interest rates across all maturities would not materially impact the fair market value of the portfolio in either period. If significant, such losses would only be realized if we sold the investments prior to maturity.As of November 2, 2019, we had $4.6 billion in principal amount of senior unsecured notes outstanding, with a fair value of $4.9 billion. The fair value of our notes is subject to interest rate risk, market risk, and other factors. Generally, the fair value of our notes will increase as interest rates fall and decrease as interest rates rise. The fair values of our notes as of November 2, 2019 and November 3, 2018, assuming a hypothetical 100 basis point increase in market interest rates, are as follows:November 2, 2019November 3, 2018(thousands)Principal Amount OutstandingFair Value Fair Value given an increase in interest rates of 100 basis pointsPrincipal Amount OutstandingFair Value Fair Value given an increase in interest rates of 100 basis points2020 Notes, due March 2020$300,000 $300,872 $299,793 $300,000 $298,147 $294,237 2021 Notes, due January 2021450,000 454,634 449,354 450,000 444,568 435,334 2021 Notes, due December 2021400,000 402,591 394,524 400,000 386,375 375,215 2023 Notes, due June 2023500,000 511,190 494,186 500,000 479,189 459,377 2023 Notes, due December 2023550,000 567,159 545,897 550,000 529,120 505,176 2025 Notes, due December 2025850,000 914,567 866,162 850,000 829,611 780,432 2026 Notes, due December 2026900,000 940,192 883,276 900,000 848,027 791,549 2036 Notes, due December 2036250,000 270,891 240,492 250,000 232,627 206,716 2045 Notes, due December 2045400,000 491,439 423,591 400,000 407,984 354,806 43Foreign Currency ExposureAs more fully described in Note 2i, Derivative and Hedging Agreements, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements contained in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, we regularly hedge our non-U.S. dollar-based exposures by entering into forward foreign currency exchange contracts. The terms of these contracts are for periods matching the duration of the underlying exposure and generally range from one to twelve months. Currently, our largest foreign currency exposure is the Euro, primarily because our European operations have the highest proportion of our local currency denominated expenses. Relative to foreign currency exposures existing at November 2, 2019 and November 3, 2018, a 10% unfavorable movement in foreign currency exchange rates over the course of the year would result in approximately $12.1 million of losses and $14.1 million of losses, respectively, in changes in earnings or cash flows.The market risk associated with our derivative instruments results from currency exchange rates that are expected to offset the market risk of the underlying transactions, assets and liabilities being hedged. The counterparties to the agreements relating to our foreign exchange instruments consist of a number of major international financial institutions with high credit ratings. Based on the credit ratings of our counterparties as of November 2, 2019, we do not believe that there is significant risk of nonperformance by them. While the contract or notional amounts of derivative financial instruments provide one measure of the volume of these transactions, they do not represent the amount of our exposure to credit risk. The amounts potentially subject to credit risk (arising from the possible inability of counterparties to meet the terms of their contracts) are generally limited to the amounts, if any, by which the counterparties’ obligations under the contracts exceed our obligations to the counterparties.The following table illustrates the effect that a 10% unfavorable or favorable movement in foreign currency exchange rates, relative to the U.S. dollar, would have on the fair value of our forward exchange contracts as of November 2, 2019 and November 3, 2018:November 2, 2019November 3, 2018Fair value of forward exchange contracts liability$— $(7,150) Fair value of forward exchange contracts after a 10% unfavorable movement in foreign currency exchange rates asset$20,810 $13,591 Fair value of forward exchange contracts after a 10% favorable movement in foreign currency exchange rates liability$(19,269) $(26,532) The calculation assumes that each exchange rate would change in the same direction relative to the U.S. dollar. In addition to the direct effects of changes in exchange rates, such changes typically affect the volume of sales or the foreign currency sales price as competitors’ products become more or less attractive. Our sensitivity analysis of the effects of changes in foreign currency exchange rates does not factor in a potential change in sales levels or local currency selling prices.44REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRMThe Board of Directors and Shareholders Analog Devices, Inc.Opinion on the Financial StatementsWe have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Analog Devices, Inc. (the Company) as of November 2, 2019 and November 3, 2018, the related consolidated statements of income, comprehensive income, shareholders' equity and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended November 2, 2019, and the related notes and financial statement schedule listed in the Index at Item 15(a)(2) (collectively referred to as the “consolidated financial statements”). In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company at November 2, 2019 and November 3, 2018, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended November 2, 2019, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of November 2, 2019, based on criteria established in Internal Control-Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework), and our report dated November 26, 2019 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.Adoption of ASU No. 2014-09As discussed in Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company changed its method of accounting for revenue in the year ended November 2, 2019 due to the adoption of Accounting Standards Update (ASU) No. 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606), and the related amendments. Adoption of ASU No. 2016-16As discussed in Note 12 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company changed its method of accounting for the income tax consequences of intra-entity transfers, other than inventory, in the year ended November 2, 2019 due to the adoption of ASU No. 2016-16, Income Taxes (Topic 740): Intra-Entity Transfers of Assets Other Than Inventory.Basis for Opinion These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.Critical Audit Matters The critical audit matters communicated below are matters arising from the current period audit of the financial statements that were communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relate to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matters below, providing separate opinions on the critical audit matters or on the accounts or disclosures to which they relate.45Revenue Recognition – Measuring Variable ConsiderationDescription of the MatterAs described in Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company's sales contracts provide certain distributors with credits for price protection and rights of return, which results in variable consideration. During 2019, sales to distributors were $3.4 billion net of expected price protection discounts and rights of return for which the liability balance as of November 2, 2019 was $227.0 million.Auditing the Company's measurement of variable consideration under distributor contracts involved especially challenging judgment because the calculation involves subjective management assumptions about estimates of expected price protection discounts and returns. For example, estimated variable consideration included in the transaction price reflects management's evaluation of contractual terms, historical experience and assumptions about future economic conditions. Changes in those assumptions can have a material effect on the amount of variable consideration recognized.How We Addressed the Matter in Our AuditWe obtained an understanding, evaluated the design and tested the operating effectiveness of controls over the Company's process to calculate the variable consideration. For example, we tested controls over the appropriateness of assumptions management used as well as controls over the completeness and accuracy of the data underlying estimates of expected price protection discounts and returns.Our audit procedures included, among others, inspecting contractual terms in distributor agreements and testing the underlying data used in management’s calculation for completeness and accuracy as well as evaluating the significant assumptions used in the estimation of variable consideration. We evaluated the Company’s methods and assumptions used in the estimates, which included comparing the assumptions to historical trends. We inspected and tested the results of the Company's retrospective review analysis of actual returns and price protection discounts claimed by distributors, evaluated the estimates made based on historical experience and performed sensitivity analyses of the Company’s significant assumptions to assess the impact on the variable consideration. We also evaluated whether the Company appropriately considered new information that could significantly change the estimated future price protection discounts or returns.Goodwill – Quantitative Impairment AssessmentDescription of the MatterThe Company’s consolidated goodwill balance was $12.3 billion as of November 2, 2019. As described in Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company evaluates goodwill for impairment at the reporting unit level annually and performed a quantitative goodwill impairment assessment for one of its eight reporting units. The quantitative impairment assessment involves the comparison of the fair value of a reporting unit to its carrying amount. The Company used a weighting of the income and market approaches to determine the fair value of the reporting unit. Auditing management's quantitative goodwill impairment test involved a high degree of auditor judgment due to the significant estimation required to determine the fair value of the reporting unit. In particular, the fair value estimate was sensitive to significant assumptions, such as forecasted revenues, gross profit margins, operating income margins, long-term discount rate, perpetual growth rate, identification of comparable publicly traded companies and estimated valuation multiples.How We Addressed the Matter in Our AuditWe obtained an understanding, evaluated the design and tested the operating effectiveness of controls over the Company's quantitative goodwill impairment assessment process. For example, we tested controls over management's review of the valuation model and the significant assumptions used. To test the estimated fair value of the reporting unit, our audit procedures included, among others, assessing methodologies and testing the significant assumptions discussed above and the underlying data used by the Company in its analysis. We tested significant assumptions by comparing to current and forecasted industry and economic trends, analyst reports, and forecasted peer company information. We evaluated management’s ability to accurately forecast by comparing actual results to historical forecasts. We also performed sensitivity analyses of certain assumptions to evaluate changes in the fair value that would result from changes in the assumptions. With the assistance of our valuation specialists, we evaluated the selection of the long-term discount rate and perpetual growth rate, including testing the underlying source information and the mathematical accuracy of the calculations by developing a range of independent estimates and comparing those to the rates selected by management. We also involved our valuation specialists to evaluate the market approach, including evaluating the reasonableness of the selected comparable publicly traded companies and the resulting market multiples calculation. 46/s/ Ernst & Young LLPWe have served as the Company’s auditor since 1967.

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (all tabular amounts in thousands except per share amounts)The following discussion includes a comparison of our Results of Operations and Liquidity and Capital Resources for the fiscal years ended October 31, 2020 (fiscal 2020), the fiscal year ended November 2, 2019 (fiscal 2019) and the fiscal year ended November 3, 2018 (fiscal 2018). Our fiscal year is the 52-week or 53-week period ending on the Saturday closest to the last day in October. Fiscal 2020 and fiscal 2019 were 52-week fiscal periods, while fiscal 2018 was a 53-week period. The additional week in fiscal 2018 was included in the first quarter ended February 3, 2018. Therefore, fiscal 2018 included an additional week of operations as compared to fiscal 2020 and fiscal 2019. Impact of COVID-19 on our BusinessThe pandemic caused by the novel strain of the coronavirus (COVID-19) has resulted in government authorities implementing numerous measures to try to contain the virus, such as travel bans and restrictions, quarantines, shelter in place orders and shutdowns. These measures have impacted and likely will continue to impact our workforce and operations, the operations of our customers and those of our respective vendors and suppliers. We have significant operations worldwide, including in the United States, the Philippines, Ireland, Singapore, Malaysia, China and India. Each of these countries has been affected by the pandemic and taken measures to try to contain it, resulting in disruptions at some of our manufacturing operations and facilities. Since the beginning of the third quarter of fiscal 2020, our manufacturing operations and supply chain generally stabilized at normal levels, but that could change in the future given that the COVID-19 situation remains dynamic.The spread of COVID-19 has caused us to modify our business practices (including restricting employee travel, modifying employee work locations and cancelling physical participation in meetings, events and conferences) and we may take further actions as may be required by government authorities or that we determine are in the best interests of our employees, customers, partners, suppliers and shareholders.While we are confident that our strategy and long-term contingency planning have positioned us well to weather the current uncertainty, we cannot at this time fully quantify or forecast the impact of COVID-19 on our business. The degree to which COVID-19 impacts our business, financial condition and results of operations will depend on future developments, which are highly uncertain, and we cannot provide assurance as to the duration and spread of the pandemic, its severity, the actions to contain the virus or treat its impact, or how quickly and to what extent normal economic and operating conditions can resume.Proposed Acquisition of Maxim Integrated Products, Inc.On July 12, 2020, we entered into a definitive agreement (the Merger Agreement) to acquire Maxim Integrated Products, Inc. (Maxim), an independent manufacturer of innovative analog and mixed-signal products and technologies. Under the terms of the Merger Agreement, Maxim stockholders will receive, for each outstanding share of Maxim common stock, 0.630 of a share of our common stock. The estimated merger consideration is approximately $23.0 billion based on the closing price of our common stock on November 20, 2020. Following the recent approval of Maxim stockholders and our shareholders, as well as the expiration of the waiting-period applicable to U.S. regulatory approval, the transaction is subject to customary closing conditions, including receipt of certain non-U.S. regulatory approvals. See Note 6, Acquisitions, of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements contained in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further information.

See Note 2a, Principles of Consolidation, of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.Revenue Trends by End MarketThe following table summarizes revenue by end market. The categorization of revenue by end market is determined using a variety of data points including the technical characteristics of the product, the “sold to” customer information, the ""ship to"" customer information and the end customer product or application into which our product will be incorporated. As data systems for capturing and tracking this data and our methodology evolve and improve, the categorization of products by end market can vary over time. When this occurs, we reclassify revenue by end market for prior periods. Such reclassifications typically do not materially change the sizing of, or the underlying trends of results within, each end market. 202020192018 (1)Revenue% ofTotalProductRevenue (2)Y/Y%Revenue% ofTotalProductRevenue (2)Y/Y%Revenue% ofTotalProductRevenue (2)Industrial$2,987,542 53 %(1)%$3,011,411 50 %(4)%$3,143,566 51 %Communications1,195,946 21 %(8)%1,294,960 22 %12 %1,155,826 19 %Automotive779,276 14 %(16)%930,613 16 %(8)%1,006,886 16 %Consumer640,292 11 %(15)%754,081 13 %(18)%918,411 15 %Total Revenue$5,603,056 100 %(6)%$5,991,065 100 %(4)%$6,224,689 100 %_______________________________________(1)Balances have been restated to reflect the adoption of ASU 2014-09. See Note 2a, Principles of Consolidation, of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements contained in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.(2)The sum of the individual percentages may not equal the total due to rounding.Revenue decreased across all end markets in fiscal 2020 as compared to fiscal 2019. The revenue decreases in the Automotive end market were more pronounced as this market was impacted by lower vehicle sales and a global slowdown in production as many of our customers were required to suspend their operations in response to shelter in place orders from governments around the world in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. The revenue decreases in the Consumer end market resulted from a broad-based decrease in demand for our products in this end market, including lower demand for products used in portable consumer applications. The decline in the Communications end market was primarily the result of the timing of infrastructure deployment cycles and the ramp up of these cycles in certain regions during fiscal 2019. The percentage decline in our Industrial end market was less than the overall percentage decline in total revenue as the broad-based weakness across many applications was offset by growth in the instrumentation test, healthcare and energy sectors of this end market.Revenue by Sales ChannelThe following tables summarize revenue by sales channel. We sell our products globally through a direct sales force, third party distributors, independent sales representatives and via our website. Distributors are customers that buy products with the intention of reselling them. Direct customers are non-distributor customers and consist primarily of original equipment manufacturers (OEMs). Other customers include the U.S. government, government prime contractors and certain commercial customers for which revenue is recorded over time. 31202020192018 (1)Revenue% ofTotalRevenue (2)Revenue% ofTotalRevenue (2)Revenue% ofTotalRevenue (2)Distributors$3,216,302 57 %$3,409,161 57 %$3,424,145 55 %Direct customers2,300,493 41 %2,506,065 42 %2,721,885 44 %Other86,261 2 %75,839 1 %78,659 1 %Total Revenue$5,603,056 100 %$5,991,065 100 %$6,224,689 100 %_______________________________________(1)Balances have been restated to reflect the adoption of ASU 2014-09.

However, revenue in China increased in fiscal 2020 as compared to fiscal 2019 as a result of the region's relatively quick recovery from COVID-19 related shutdowns as compared to other regions, as well as increases in demand across our broad market customers and stable revenue in the Communications end market attributable to the 5G ramp up. The sales decrease in the United States year-over-year in fiscal 2020 was most pronounced in the Consumer end market. The sales decrease in Europe year-over-year in fiscal 2020 was primarily driven by products sold into the Automotive and Industrial end markets, while demand for products sold into the Communications end market was relatively flat. The sales decrease in Japan year-over-year in fiscal 2020 was broad-based as all end markets decreased from fiscal 2019. The sales decrease in Rest of Asia year-over-year in fiscal 2020 was primarily related to a decrease in our Communications revenue.32Gross MarginChange Fiscal Year2020 over 20192019 over 2018 202020192018 (1)$ Change% Change$ Change% ChangeGross margin$3,690,478 $4,013,750 $4,250,396 $(323,272)(8)%$(236,646)(6)%Gross margin %65.9 %67.0 %68.3 %_______________________________________(1)Balances have been restated to reflect the adoption of ASU 2014-09. See Note 2a, Principles of Consolidation, of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements contained in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.Gross margin percentage in fiscal 2020 decreased by 110 basis points compared to fiscal 2019, primarily as a result of lower internal utilization of our factories due to decreased customer demand and temporary shutdowns at some of our manufacturing locations in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, partially offset by a write-down of inventory in fiscal 2019, which did not repeat in fiscal 2020.Research and Development (R&D)Change Fiscal Year2020 over 20192019 over 2018 202020192018$ Change% Change$ Change% ChangeR&D expenses$1,050,519 $1,130,348 $1,165,047 $(79,829)(7)%$(34,699)(3)%R&D expenses as a % of revenue18.7 %18.9 %18.7 %R&D expenses decreased in fiscal 2020 as compared to fiscal 2019 primarily as a result of lower discretionary spending, partially in response to uncertainty associated with the COVID-19 pandemic, as well as lower R&D employee-related salary and benefit expenses and lower variable compensation expense. R&D expenses as a percentage of revenue will fluctuate from year-to-year depending on the amount of revenue and the success of new product development efforts, which we view as critical to our future growth. We expect to continue the development of innovative technologies and processes for new products. We believe that a continued commitment to R&D is essential to maintain product leadership with our existing products as well as to provide innovative new product offerings, and therefore, we expect to continue to make significant R&D investments in the future.Selling, Marketing, General and Administrative (SMG&A)Change Fiscal Year2020 over 20192019 over 2018 202020192018$ Change% Change$ Change% ChangeSMG&A expenses$659,923 $648,094 $695,540 $11,829 2 %$(47,446)(7)%SMG&A expenses as a % of revenue11.8 %10.8 %11.2 %SMG&A expenses increased in fiscal 2020 as compared to fiscal 2019, primarily as a result of a $40.0 million charitable contribution to the Analog Devices Foundation made in the first quarter of fiscal 2020 and $20.1 million in acquisition-related transaction costs in connection with the proposed acquisition of Maxim, partially offset by lower discretionary spending in response to uncertainty associated with the COVID-19 pandemic, lower SMG&A employee-related salary and benefit expense and lower variable compensation expense.Special ChargesWe monitor global macroeconomic conditions on an ongoing basis and continue to assess opportunities for improved operational effectiveness and efficiency, as well as a better alignment of expenses with revenues. As a result of these assessments, we have undertaken various restructuring actions over the past several years.Repositioning Actions: As a result of organizational initiatives to better align our global workforce with our long-term strategic plan, we recorded special charges of $49.4 million in fiscal 2020. The repositioning actions taken in fiscal 2020 are not expected to result in any future net annualized savings as the reduction in salary and benefits from workforce reductions will be redeployed to other areas of the business as part of the reorganizational initiative. 33Closure of Manufacturing Facilities: As a result of our decision to consolidate certain wafer and test facility operations acquired as part of the acquisition of Linear Technology Corporation (Linear), we recorded special charges of $2.9 million in fiscal 2020. Once fully implemented, we expect that these actions will result in estimated annual salary, variable compensation and employee benefit savings of approximately $60.0 million.Operating IncomeChange Fiscal Year2020 over 20192019 over 2018 202020192018 (1)$ Change% Change$ Change% ChangeOperating income$1,498,244 $1,710,608 $1,899,589 $(212,364)(12)%$(188,981)(10)%Operating income as a % of revenue26.7 %28.6 %30.5 %_______________________________________(1)Balances have been restated to reflect the adoption of ASU 2014-09.

See Note 2a, Principles of Consolidation, of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements contained in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.Our effective tax rates for fiscal 2020 and fiscal 2019 were below the U.S. statutory rate of 21% due to lower statutory tax rates applicable to our operations in the foreign jurisdictions in which we earn income. For fiscal 2020, our pretax income was primarily generated in Ireland at a tax rate of 12.5%. For fiscal 2019, our pretax income was primarily generated in Ireland and Singapore, at tax rates ranging from 12.5% to 17% in these jurisdictions. Our tax rate for fiscal 2020 was also impacted by discrete items, primarily related to $25.9 million of income tax benefits resulting from the resolution of the Internal Revenue Service audit of Linear’s pre-acquisition federal income tax returns for fiscal 2015 through fiscal 2017, as well as other income tax benefits recorded upon the filing of our fiscal 2019 federal income tax return and excess tax benefits from stock-based compensation payments of $16.2 million. The tax rate for fiscal 2019 includes a $17.2 million tax benefit from a voluntary accounting policy change in the statutory statements of a foreign subsidiary, an $11.2 million tax benefit from an increase in tax credits upon filing our fiscal 2018 federal income tax return and excess tax benefits from stock-based compensation payments of $28.7 million.

See Note 2a, Principles of Consolidation, of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements contained in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.The decrease in net income in fiscal 2020 as compared to fiscal 2019 was a result of a $212.4 million decrease in operating income, partially offset by a $38.3 million decrease in nonoperating expense and a $31.9 million decrease in provision for income taxes, as more fully described above under the headings Operating Income, Nonoperating (Income) Expense and Provision for Income Taxes.Liquidity and Capital ResourcesAt October 31, 2020, our principal source of liquidity was $1,055.9 million of cash and cash equivalents, of which approximately $241.9 million was held in the United States and the balance of our cash and cash equivalents was held outside the United States in various foreign subsidiaries. We manage our worldwide cash requirements by, among other things, reviewing available funds held by our foreign subsidiaries and the cost effectiveness by which those funds can be accessed in the United States. We do not expect current regulatory restrictions or taxes on repatriation to have a material adverse effect on our overall liquidity, financial condition or results of operations. Our cash and cash equivalents consist of highly liquid investments with maturities of three months or less, including money market funds. We maintain these balances with high credit quality counterparties, continually monitor the amount of credit exposure to any one issuer and diversify our investments in order to minimize our credit risk.We believe that our existing sources of liquidity and cash expected to be generated from future operations, together with existing and anticipated available long-term financing, will be sufficient to fund operations, capital expenditures, research and development efforts, transaction costs associated with our proposed acquisition of Maxim and dividend payments (if any) in the immediate future and for at least the next twelve months.

See Note 2a, Principles of Consolidation, of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements contained in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.The following changes contributed to the net change in cash and cash equivalents from fiscal 2019 to fiscal 2020. A discussion of changes in our liquidity and capital resources from fiscal 2018 to fiscal 2019 has been omitted from this Form 10-K, but may be found in “Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” of our Form 10-K for fiscal 2019 filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on November 26, 2019.Operating ActivitiesCash provided by operating activities is net income adjusted for certain non-cash items and changes in assets and liabilities. The decrease in cash provided by operating activities during fiscal 2020 as compared to fiscal 2019 was primarily a result of lower net income, adjusted for non-cash items, and a decrease from changes in working capital.Investing ActivitiesInvesting cash flows generally consist of capital expenditures and cash used for acquisitions. The decrease in cash used for investing activities during fiscal 2020 as compared to fiscal 2019 was primarily the result of a decrease in cash used for capital expenditures.35Financing ActivitiesFinancing cash flows consist primarily of payments of dividends to stockholders, repurchases of common stock, issuance and repayment of debt, and proceeds from the sale of shares of common stock pursuant to employee equity incentive plans. The decrease in cash used for financing activities during fiscal 2020 as compared to fiscal 2019 was primarily the result of a net increase related to our debt instruments and a decrease in common stock repurchases, partially offset by an increase in dividend payments and a decrease in net proceeds from employee stock plans.

The increase in accounts receivable for fiscal 2020 compared to fiscal 2019 was primarily the result of normal variations in the timing of collections and billings. Inventory in dollars decreased in fiscal 2020 as compared to fiscal 2019, primarily as a result of our efforts to balance manufacturing production, demand and inventory levels. Our inventory levels are impacted by our need to support forecasted sales demand and variations between those forecasts and actual demand.Current liabilities decreased to $1,365.0 million at October 31, 2020 from $1,508.6 million recorded at the end of fiscal 2019. The decrease was primarily due to decreases in the current portion our debt, partially offset by increases in accrued liabilities.Revolving Credit Facility On June 28, 2019, we entered into a second amended and restated revolving credit agreement with Bank of America N.A. as administrative agent and the other banks identified therein as lenders (Revolving Credit Agreement), which further amended and restated our amended and restated revolving credit agreement dated as of September 23, 2016. The Revolving Credit Agreement provides for a five year unsecured revolving credit facility in an aggregate principal amount of up to $1.25 billion, expiring on June 28, 2024. Loans under the Revolving Credit Agreement can be Eurocurrency Rate Loans or Base Rate Loans at our option. Each Eurocurrency Rate Loan will bear interest at a rate per annum equal to the Eurocurrency Rate plus a margin based on our debt ratings from time to time of between 0.690% and 1.375%. Each Base Rate Loan will bear interest at a rate per annum equal to the Base Rate plus a margin based on our debt ratings from time to time of between 0.00% and 0.375%. In December 2018, we borrowed $75.0 million under the previous revolving credit facility and utilized the proceeds for the repayment of existing indebtedness and working capital requirements. We repaid the $75.0 million plus interest of $0.2 million in January 2019. In March 2020, we borrowed $350.0 million under this revolving credit facility and utilized the proceeds for the repayment of existing indebtedness and working capital requirements. We repaid the $350.0 million plus interest of $0.6 million in April 2020. As of October 31, 2020, we have no outstanding borrowings under the revolving credit facility, but we may borrow in the future and use the proceeds for repayment of existing indebtedness, stock repurchases, acquisitions, capital expenditures, working capital and other lawful corporate purposes. The terms of the Revolving Credit Agreement impose restrictions on our ability to undertake certain transactions, to create certain liens on assets and to incur certain subsidiary indebtedness. In addition, the Revolving Credit Agreement requires us to maintain a consolidated leverage ratio of total consolidated funded debt to consolidated earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) for a trailing twelve-month period of not greater than 3.5 to 1.0, assuming we do not undertake any significant acquisitions, mergers, and other fundamental changes. Should such a change occur, we may be authorized to increase the covenant to 4.0 to 1.0. As of October 31, 2020, we were compliant with these covenants. See Note 13, Revolving Credit Facility, of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements contained in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further information on our revolving credit facility.36DebtAs of October 31, 2020, we had $5.1 billion of carrying value outstanding on our debt. The difference in the carrying value of the debt and the principal is due to the unamortized discount and issuance fees on these instruments that will accrete to the face value over the term of the debt. The indentures governing certain of our debt instruments contain covenants that may limit our ability to: incur, create, assume or guarantee any debt or borrowed money secured by a lien upon a principal property; enter into sale and lease-back transactions with respect to a principal property; and consolidate with or merge into, or transfer or lease all or substantially all of our assets to, any other party. As of October 31, 2020, we were compliant with these covenants. See Note 14, Debt, of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements contained in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further information on our outstanding debt.Stock Repurchase ProgramOur common stock repurchase program has been in place since August 2004. In the aggregate, our Board of Directors has authorized us to repurchase $8.2 billion of our common stock under the program. Under the program, we may repurchase outstanding shares of our common stock from time to time in the open market and through privately negotiated transactions. Unless terminated earlier by resolution of our Board of Directors, the repurchase program will expire when we have repurchased all shares authorized under the program. As of October 31, 2020, an additional $1.9 billion remained available for repurchase under the current authorized program. The repurchased shares are held as authorized but unissued shares of common stock. We also repurchase shares in settlement of employee tax withholding obligations due upon the vesting of restricted stock units/awards or the exercise of stock options. In March 2020, we temporarily suspended our share repurchase program as a result of the global macroeconomic environment. That suspension continued through the fourth quarter of fiscal 2020 given the planned acquisition of Maxim. We reinstated the share repurchase program in November 2020 (which is part of the fiscal year ending October 30, 2021). Future repurchases of common stock will be dependent upon our financial position, results of operations, outlook, liquidity, and other factors we deem relevant. Capital ExpendituresNet additions to property, plant and equipment were $165.7 million in fiscal 2020 and were funded with a combination of cash on hand and cash generated from operations. We expect capital expenditures for fiscal 2021 to be approximately 4% of fiscal 2021 revenue. These capital expenditures will be funded with a combination of cash on hand and cash generated from operations.Analog Devices FoundationDuring the first quarter of fiscal 2020, we contributed 335,654 shares of our common stock to the Analog Devices Foundation. As of the date of the contribution, the shares had a fair value of approximately $40.0 million. This expense was recorded in SMG&A in the Consolidated Statement of Income. DividendsOn November 23, 2020, our Board of Directors declared a cash dividend of $0.62 per outstanding share of common stock. The dividend will be paid on December 15, 2020 to all shareholders of record at the close of business on December 4, 2020 and is expected to total approximately $229.1 million. We currently expect quarterly dividends to continue in future periods, although they remain subject to determination and declaration by our Board of Directors. The payment of future dividends, if any, will be based on several factors, including our financial performance, outlook and liquidity.37Contractual ObligationsThe table below summarizes our contractual obligations in specified periods as of October 31, 2020: Payment due by period Less than More than(thousands)Total1 Year1-3 Years3-5 Years5 YearsContractual obligations: Transition tax (1)$626,742 $59,690 $119,380 $261,143 $186,529 Operating leases (2)380,843 49,526 83,038 74,570 173,709 Other long-term liabilities (3)69,921 37,131 31,333 87 1,370 Debt obligations (4)5,175,000 — 1,825,000 950,000 2,400,000 Interest payments associated with debt obligations1,299,346 161,321 289,731 220,494 627,800 Deferred compensation plan (5)52,956 801 — — 52,155 Pension funding (6)6,985 6,985 — — — Total$7,611,793 $315,454 $2,348,482 $1,506,294 $3,441,563 _______________________________________(1)Tax obligation relates to the one-time tax on deemed repatriated earnings under the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 enacted in fiscal 2018. See Note 12, Income Taxes, of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements contained in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further discussion. (2)Certain of our operating lease obligations include escalation clauses. These escalating payment requirements are reflected in the table.(3)Amounts primarily represent future fixed and non-cancellable cash payments associated with software technology and licenses, including the payments due within the next twelve months.(4)Debt obligations are assumed to be held to maturity. (5)These payments relate to obligations under our deferred compensation plan. The deferred compensation plan allows certain members of management and other highly-compensated employees and non-employee directors to defer receipt of all or any portion of their compensation. The amount in the “More than 5 Years” column of the table represents the remaining total balance under the deferred compensation plan to be paid to participants who have not terminated employment. Since we cannot reasonably estimate the timing of withdrawals for participants who have not yet terminated employment, we have included the future obligation to these participants in the “More than 5 Years” column of the table.(6)Our funding policy for our foreign defined benefit plans is consistent with the local requirements of each country. The payment obligations in the table are estimates of our expected contributions to these plans for the current fiscal year. The actual future payments may differ from the amounts presented in the table and reasonable estimates of payments beyond one year are not practical because of potential future changes in variables, such as plan asset performance, interest rates and the rate of increase in compensation levels. As of October 31, 2020, our net liability related to our defined benefit plans was $79.2 million. See Note 11, Retirement Plans, of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements contained in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further discussion. As of October 31, 2020, our total liabilities associated with uncertain tax positions was $24.7 million, which are included in non-current income taxes payable in our Consolidated Balance Sheets contained in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Due to the complexity associated with our tax uncertainties, we cannot make a reasonably reliable estimate of the period in which we expect to settle the non-current liabilities associated with these uncertain tax positions. Therefore, we have not included these uncertain tax positions in the above contractual obligations table.The expected timing of payments and the amounts of the obligations discussed above are estimated based on current information available as of October 31, 2020.Off-balance Sheet ArrangementsAs of October 31, 2020, we had no off-balance sheet financing arrangements.New Accounting PronouncementsFrom time to time, new accounting pronouncements are issued by the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) and are adopted by us as of the specified effective date. Unless otherwise discussed, management believes that the impact of recently issued standards will not have a material impact on our future financial condition and results of operations. See Note 2s, New Accounting Pronouncements, of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements contained in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for a description of recently issued and adopted accounting pronouncements, including the dates of adoption and impact on our historical financial condition and results of operations.38LeasesIn February 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-02, Leases (Topic 842) (ASU 2016-02). ASU 2016-02 requires a lessee to recognize most leases on the balance sheet but recognize expenses on the income statement in a manner similar to historical practice. The update states that a lessee will recognize a lease liability for the obligation to make lease payments and a right-to-use asset for the right to use the underlying assets for the lease term. Leases will continue to be classified as either financing or operating, with classification affecting the recognition, measurement and presentation of expenses and cash flows arising from a lease. The FASB has issued amendments and updates to the new standard, including practical expedients to be used during adoption. The Company adopted the standard in the first quarter of fiscal 2020 under the modified retrospective approach. As a result of the adoption of ASU 2016-02, we changed our accounting policy for leases. See Note 9, Leases, of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements contained in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for details of the impact of this ASU on our financial statements.Critical Accounting Policies and EstimatesManagement’s discussion and analysis of the financial condition and results of operations is based upon the Consolidated Financial Statements, which have been prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue and expenses, and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. We base our estimates and judgments on historical experience, knowledge of current conditions and beliefs of what could occur in the future based on available information. We consider the following accounting policies to be both those most important to the portrayal of our financial condition and those that require the most subjective judgment. If actual results differ significantly from management’s estimates and projections, there could be a material effect on our financial statements. We also have other policies that we consider key accounting policies; however, the application of these policies does not require us to make significant estimates or judgments that are difficult or subjective.Revenue RecognitionRecognition of revenue occurs when a customer obtains control of promised goods or services in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the providing entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. As a result of the adoption of new revenue accounting rules in the first quarter of fiscal 2019, we revised our revenue recognition policy. We now recognize revenue upon transfer of control of promised products or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration that we expect to receive in exchange for those products or services. Under this rule, we recognize revenue when all of the following criteria are met: (1) we have entered into a binding agreement, (2) the performance obligations have been identified, (3) the transaction price to the customer has been determined, (4) the transaction price has been allocated to the performance obligations in the contract, and (5) the performance obligations have been satisfied. The majority of our shipping terms permit us to recognize revenue at point of shipment or delivery. Certain shipping terms require the goods to be through customs or be received by the customer before title passes. In those instances, we defer the revenue recognized until title has passed. Shipping costs are charged to selling, marketing, general and administrative expense as incurred. Sales taxes are excluded from revenue.Revenue from contracts with the United States government, government prime contractors and certain commercial customers is recorded over time using either units delivered or costs incurred as the measurement basis for progress toward completion. These measures are used to measure results directly and is generally the best measure of progress toward completion in circumstances in which a reliable measure of output can be established. Estimated revenue in excess of amounts billed is reported as unbilled receivables. Contract accounting requires judgment in estimating costs and assumptions related to technical issues and delivery schedule. Contract costs include material, subcontract costs, labor and an allocation of indirect costs. The estimation of costs at completion of a contract is subject to numerous variables involving contract costs and estimates as to the length of time to complete the contract. Changes in contract performance, estimated gross margin, including the impact of final contract settlements, and estimated losses are recognized in the period in which the changes or losses are determined.Performance Obligations: Substantially all of our contracts with customers contain a single performance obligation, the sale of mixed-signal integrated circuit (IC) products. Such sales represent a single performance obligation because the sale is one type of good or includes multiple goods that are neither capable of being distinct nor separable from the other promises in the contract. This performance obligation is satisfied when control of the product is transferred to the customer, which occurs upon shipment or delivery. Unsatisfied performance obligations primarily represent contracts for products with future delivery dates and with an original expected duration of one year or less. As allowed under ASU 2014-09, we have opted to not disclose the amount of unsatisfied performance obligations as these contracts have original expected durations of less than one year. We generally warrant that our products will meet their published specifications, and that we will repair or replace defective products, for one year from the date title passes from us to the customer. Specific accruals are recorded for known product warranty issues. 39Transaction Price: The transaction price reflects our expectations about the consideration we will be entitled to receive from the customer and may include fixed or variable amounts. Fixed consideration primarily includes sales to direct customers and sales to distributors in which both the sale to the distributor and the sale to the end customer occur within the same reporting period. Variable consideration includes sales in which the amount of consideration that we will receive is unknown as of the end of a reporting period. Such consideration primarily includes credits issued to the distributor due to price protection and sales made to distributors under agreements that allow certain rights of return, referred to as stock rotation. Price protection represents price discounts granted to certain distributors to allow the distributor to earn an appropriate margin on sales negotiated with certain customers and in the event of a price decrease subsequent to the date the product was shipped and billed to the distributor. Stock rotation allows distributors limited levels of returns in order to reduce the amounts of slow-moving, discontinued or obsolete product from their inventory. A liability for distributor credits covering variable consideration is made based on management's estimate of historical experience rates as well as considering economic conditions and contractual terms. To date, actual distributor claims activity has been materially consistent with the provisions we have made based on our historical estimates.Contract Balances: Accounts receivable represents our unconditional right to receive consideration from our customers. Payments are typically due within 30 to 45 days of invoicing and do not include a significant financing component. To date, there have been no material impairment losses on accounts receivable. There were no material contract assets or contract liabilities recorded on the Consolidated Balance Sheets in any of the periods presented.Inventory ValuationWe value inventories at the lower of cost (first-in, first-out method) or market. Because of the cyclical nature of the semiconductor industry, changes in inventory levels, obsolescence of technology, and product life cycles, we write down inventories to net realizable value. We employ a variety of methodologies to determine the net realizable value of inventory. While a portion of the calculation is determined via reference to the age of inventory and lower of cost or market calculations, an element of the calculation is subject to significant judgments made by us about future demand for our inventory. If actual demand for our products is less than our estimates, additional adjustments to existing inventories may need to be recorded in future periods. To date, our actual results have not been materially different than our estimates, and we do not expect them to be materially different in the future.Long-Lived AssetsWe review property, plant, and equipment and intangible assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of assets may not be recoverable. Recoverability of these assets is determined by comparison of their carrying value to the estimated future undiscounted cash flows that the assets are expected to generate over their remaining estimated lives. If such assets are considered to be impaired, the impairment to be recognized in earnings equals the amount by which the carrying value of the assets exceeds their fair value determined by either a quoted market price, if any, or a value determined by utilizing a discounted cash flow technique. Although we have recognized no material impairment adjustments related to our property, plant, and equipment and identified intangible assets during the past three fiscal years, except those made in conjunction with restructuring actions, deterioration in our business in the future could lead to such impairment adjustments in future periods. Evaluation of impairment of long-lived assets requires estimates of future operating results that are used in the preparation of the expected future undiscounted cash flows. Actual future operating results and the remaining economic lives of our long-lived assets could differ from the estimates used in assessing the recoverability of these assets. These differences could result in impairment charges, which could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations. In addition, in certain instances, assets may not be impaired but their estimated useful lives may have decreased. In these situations, we amortize the remaining net book values over the revised useful lives. GoodwillGoodwill is subject to impairment tests annually or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances suggest that the carrying value of goodwill may not be recoverable, utilizing either the qualitative or quantitative method. We test goodwill for impairment at the reporting unit level, which we determined is consistent with our eight identified operating segments, on an annual basis on the first day of the fourth quarter (on or about August 2) or more frequently if we believe indicators of impairment exist or we reorganize our operating segments or reporting units. We have the option to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its net book value. When using the qualitative method, we consider several factors, including the following:–the amount by which the fair values of each reporting unit exceeded their carrying values as of the date of the most recent quantitative impairment analysis, which indicated there would need to be substantial negative developments in the markets in which these reporting units operate in order for there to be potential impairment;40–the carrying values of these reporting units as of the assessment date compared to their previously calculated fair values as of the date of the most recent quantitative impairment analysis;–the current forecasts as compared to the forecasts included in the most recent quantitative impairment analysis;–public information from competitors and other industry information to determine if there were any significant adverse trends in our competitors' businesses;–changes in the value of major U.S. stock indices that could suggest declines in overall market stability that could impact the valuation of our reporting units;–changes in our market capitalization and overall enterprise valuation to determine if there were any significant decreases that could be an indication that the valuation of our reporting units had significantly decreased; and–whether there had been any significant increases to the weighted-average cost of capital rates for each reporting unit, which could materially lower our prior valuation conclusions under a discounted cash flow approach.If we elect not to use this option, or we determine that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its net book value, then we perform the quantitative goodwill impairment test. The quantitative goodwill impairment test requires an entity to compare the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying amount. If fair value is determined to be less than carrying value, an impairment loss is recognized for the amount of the carrying value that exceeds the amount of the reporting unit's fair value, not to exceed the total amount of goodwill allocated to the reporting unit. Additionally, we consider income tax effects from any tax deductible goodwill on the carrying amount of the reporting unit when measuring the goodwill impairment loss, if applicable. We determine the fair value of our reporting units using a weighting of the income and market approaches. Under the income approach, we use a discounted cash flow methodology which requires management to make significant estimates and assumptions related to forecasted revenues, gross profit margins, operating income margins, working capital cash flow, perpetual growth rates, and long-term discount rates, among others. For the market approach, we use the guideline public company method. Under this method we utilize information from comparable publicly traded companies with similar operating and investment characteristics as the reporting units, to create valuation multiples that are applied to the operating performance of the reporting unit being tested, in order to obtain their respective fair values. In order to assess the reasonableness of the calculated reporting unit fair values, we reconcile the aggregate fair values of our reporting units determined, as described above, to our total company market capitalization, allowing for a reasonable control premium. In fiscal 2019, we used the qualitative method of assessing goodwill for seven of our eight reporting units and the quantitative method for one reporting unit. During the second quarter of fiscal 2020, we performed a quantitative assessment of one of our reporting units due to the macroeconomic climate at that time. In our latest annual impairment evaluation that occurred as of August 2, 2020, we elected to use the quantitative method of assessing goodwill for all eight of our reporting units. In all periods presented, we concluded the reporting units' fair values exceeded their carrying amounts as of the assessment dates and no risk of impairment existed. Business CombinationsUnder the acquisition method of accounting, we recognize tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their estimated fair values. We record the excess of the fair value of the purchase consideration over the value of the net assets acquired as goodwill. The accounting for business combinations requires us to make significant estimates and assumptions, especially with respect to intangible assets and the fair value of contingent payment obligations. Critical estimates in valuing purchased technology, customer lists and other identifiable intangible assets include future cash flows that we expect to generate from the acquired assets. If the subsequent actual results and updated projections of the underlying business activity change compared with the assumptions and projections used to develop these values, we could experience impairment charges which could be material. In addition, we have estimated the economic lives of certain acquired assets and these lives are used to calculate depreciation and amortization expense. If our estimates of the economic lives change, depreciation or amortization expenses could be accelerated or slowed.We record contingent consideration resulting from a business combination at its fair value on the acquisition date. We generally determine the fair value of the contingent consideration using the income approach methodology of valuation. Each reporting period thereafter, we revalue these obligations and record increases or decreases in their fair value as an adjustment to operating expenses within the Consolidated Statements of Income. Changes in the fair value of the contingent consideration can result from changes in assumed discount periods and rates, and from changes pertaining to the achievement of the defined milestones. Significant judgment is employed in determining the appropriateness of these assumptions as of the acquisition date and for each subsequent period. Accordingly, future business and economic conditions, as well as changes in any of the assumptions described above, can materially impact the amount of contingent consideration expense we record in any given period.41Accounting for Income TaxesWe make certain estimates and judgments in determining income tax expense for financial statement purposes. These estimates and judgments occur in the calculation of income tax credits, benefits, and deductions, and in the calculation of certain tax assets and liabilities, which arise from differences in the timing of the recognition of certain expenses for tax and financial statement purposes. We assess the likelihood of the realization of deferred tax assets and record a corresponding valuation allowance as necessary if we determine those deferred tax assets may not be realized due to the uncertainty of the timing and amount to be realized of certain state and international tax credit carryovers. In reaching our conclusion, we evaluate certain relevant criteria including the existence of deferred tax liabilities that can be used to realize deferred tax assets, the taxable income in prior carryback years in the impacted state and international jurisdictions that can be used to absorb net operating losses and taxable income in future years. Our judgments regarding future profitability may change due to future market conditions, changes in U.S. or international tax laws and other factors. These changes, if any, may require material adjustments to these deferred tax assets, which may result in an increase or decrease to our income tax provision in future periods.We account for uncertain tax positions by first determining if it is “more likely than not” that a tax position will be sustained by the appropriate taxing authorities prior to recording any benefit in the financial statements. An uncertain income tax position is not recognized if it has less than a 50% likelihood of being sustained. For those tax positions where it is more likely than not that a tax position will be sustained, we have recorded the largest amount of tax benefit with a greater than 50% likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement with a taxing authority that has full knowledge of all relevant information. For those income tax positions where it is not more likely than not that a tax benefit will be sustained, no tax benefit has been recognized in the financial statements. We classify interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions within the provision for income taxes line of the Consolidated Statements of Income. We reevaluate these uncertain tax positions on a quarterly basis. This evaluation is based on factors including, but not limited to, changes in known facts or circumstances, changes in tax law, effectively settled issues under audit, and new guidance on legislative interpretations. A change in these factors could result in the recognition of an increase or decrease to our income tax provision, which could materially impact our consolidated financial position and results of operations.In the ordinary course of global business, there are many transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax outcome is uncertain. Some of these uncertainties arise as a consequence of cost reimbursement and royalty arrangements among related entities. Although we believe our estimates are reasonable, no assurance can be given that the final tax outcome of these matters will not be different than that which is reflected in our historical income tax provisions and income tax liabilities. In the event our assumptions are incorrect, the differences could have a material impact on our income tax provision and operating results in the period in which such determination is made. In addition to the factors described above, our current and expected effective tax rate is based on then-current tax law. Significant changes during the year in enacted tax law could affect these estimates.See Note 12, Income Taxes, of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements contained in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further discussion.Stock-Based CompensationStock-based compensation expense associated with stock options and related awards is recognized in the Consolidated Statements of Income. Determining the amount of stock-based compensation to be recorded requires us to develop estimates to be used in calculating the grant-date fair value of stock options and market-based restricted stock units. We calculate the grant-date fair values of stock options using the Black-Scholes valuation model. The use of valuation models requires us to make estimates of key assumptions such as expected option term and stock price volatility to determine the fair value of a stock option. The estimate of these key assumptions is based on historical information and judgment regarding market factors and trends. We recognize the expense related to equity awards on a straight-line basis over the vesting period. See Note 2r, Stock-based Compensation, and Note 3, Stock-Based Compensation and Shareholders' Equity, of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements contained in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for more information related to stock-based compensation.42ContingenciesFrom time to time, in the ordinary course of business, various claims, charges and litigation are asserted or commenced against us arising from, or related to, among other things, contractual matters, patents, trademarks, personal injury, environmental matters, product liability, insurance coverage, employment or employment benefits. We periodically assess each matter to determine if a contingent liability should be recorded. In making this determination, we may, depending on the nature of the matter, consult with internal and external legal counsel and technical experts. Based on the information we obtain, combined with our judgment regarding all the facts and circumstances of each matter, we determine whether it is probable that a contingent loss may be incurred and whether the amount of such loss can be reasonably estimated. If a loss is probable and reasonably estimable, we record a contingent loss. In determining the amount of a contingent loss, we consider advice received from experts in the specific matter, current status of legal proceedings, settlement negotiations that may be ongoing, prior case history and other factors. If the judgments and estimates made by us are incorrect, we may need to record additional contingent losses that could materially adversely impact our results of operations.43 ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISKInterest Rate ExposureOur interest income and expense are sensitive to changes in the general level of interest rates. In this regard, changes in interest rates affect the interest earned or paid on our marketable securities and debt, as well as the fair value of our investments and debt.Based on the $925.0 million of our floating rate debt outstanding as of October 31, 2020, our annual interest expense would change by approximately $9.3 million for each 100 basis point increase in interest rates. In certain instances we utilize interest rate derivatives to manage interest rate exposure on both outstanding debt as well as future issuances. As of October 31, 2020 and November 2, 2019, for each 100 basis point decrease in the ten-year U.S. Treasury rate, the fair value of our outstanding derivative instruments would change by approximately $102.0 million and $100.0 million, respectively.Based on our marketable securities outstanding as of October 31, 2020 and November 2, 2019, our annual interest income would change by approximately $10.6 million and $6.5 million, respectively, for each 100 basis point increase in interest rates.To provide a meaningful assessment of the interest rate risk associated with our investment portfolio, we performed a sensitivity analysis to determine the impact a change in interest rates would have on the value of our investment portfolio assuming a 100 basis point parallel shift in the yield curve. Based on investment positions as of October 31, 2020 and November 2, 2019, a hypothetical 100 basis point increase in interest rates across all maturities would not materially impact the fair market value of the portfolio in either period. If significant, such losses would only be realized if we sold the investments prior to maturity.As of October 31, 2020, we had $4.3 billion in principal amount of senior unsecured notes outstanding, with a fair value of $4.8 billion. The fair value of our notes is subject to interest rate risk, market risk, and other factors. Generally, the fair value of our notes will increase as interest rates fall and decrease as interest rates rise. The fair values of our notes as of October 31, 2020 and November 2, 2019, assuming a hypothetical 100 basis point increase in market interest rates, are as follows:October 31, 2020November 2, 2019(thousands)Principal Amount OutstandingFair Value Fair Value given an increase in interest rates of 100 basis pointsPrincipal Amount OutstandingFair Value Fair Value given an increase in interest rates of 100 basis points2020 Notes, due March 2020$— $— $— $300,000 $300,872 $299,793 2021 Notes, due January 2021— — — 450,000 454,634 449,354 2021 Notes, due December 2021400,000 408,565404,170 400,000 402,591 394,524 2023 Notes, due June 2023500,000 526,855 513,874 500,000 511,190 494,186 2023 Notes, due December 2023550,000 590,177 572,965 550,000 567,159 545,897 2025 Notes, due April 2025400,000 434,919 417,225 — — — 2025 Notes, due December 2025850,000 969,033 924,695 850,000 914,567 866,162 2026 Notes, due December 2026900,000 1,017,505 962,821 900,000 940,192 883,276 2036 Notes, due December 2036250,000 298,153 265,210 250,000 270,891 240,492 2045 Notes, due December 2045400,000 538,788 463,425 400,000 491,439 423,591 Foreign Currency ExposureAs more fully described in Note 2i, Derivative and Hedging Agreements, of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements contained in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, we regularly hedge our non-U.S. dollar-based exposures by entering into forward foreign currency exchange contracts. The terms of these contracts are for periods matching the duration of the underlying exposure and generally range from one to twelve months. Currently, our largest foreign currency exposure is the Euro, primarily because our European operations have the highest proportion of our local currency denominated expenses. Relative to foreign currency exposures existing at October 31, 2020 and November 2, 2019, a 10% unfavorable movement in foreign currency exchange rates over the course of the year would result in approximately $18.5 million of losses and $12.1 million of losses, respectively, in changes in earnings or cash flows.44The market risk associated with our derivative instruments results from currency exchange rates that are expected to offset the market risk of the underlying transactions, assets and liabilities being hedged. The counterparties to the agreements relating to our foreign exchange instruments consist of a number of major international financial institutions with high credit ratings. Based on the credit ratings of our counterparties as of October 31, 2020, we do not believe that there is significant risk of nonperformance by them. While the contract or notional amounts of derivative financial instruments provide one measure of the volume of these transactions, they do not represent the amount of our exposure to credit risk. The amounts potentially subject to credit risk (arising from the possible inability of counterparties to meet the terms of their contracts) are generally limited to the amounts, if any, by which the counterparties’ obligations under the contracts exceed our obligations to the counterparties.The following table illustrates the effect that a 10% unfavorable or favorable movement in foreign currency exchange rates, relative to the U.S. dollar, would have on the fair value of our forward exchange contracts as of October 31, 2020 and November 2, 2019:October 31, 2020November 2, 2019Fair value of forward exchange contracts assets$5,427 $— Fair value of forward exchange contracts after a 10% unfavorable movement in foreign currency exchange rates asset$21,859 $20,810 Fair value of forward exchange contracts after a 10% favorable movement in foreign currency exchange rates liability$(20,276)$(19,269)The calculation assumes that each exchange rate would change in the same direction relative to the U.S. dollar. In addition to the direct effects of changes in exchange rates, such changes typically affect the volume of sales or the foreign currency sales price as competitors’ products become more or less attractive. Our sensitivity analysis of the effects of changes in foreign currency exchange rates does not factor in a potential change in sales levels or local currency selling prices.45REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRMThe Board of Directors and Shareholders Analog Devices, Inc.Opinion on the Financial StatementsWe have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Analog Devices, Inc. (the Company) as of October 31, 2020 and November 2, 2019, the related consolidated statements of income, comprehensive income, shareholders' equity and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended October 31, 2020, and the related notes and financial statement schedule listed in the Index at Item 15(a)(2) (collectively referred to as the “consolidated financial statements”). In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company at October 31, 2020 and November 2, 2019, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended October 31, 2020, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of October 31, 2020, based on criteria established in Internal Control-Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework), and our report dated November 24, 2020 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.Adoption of ASU No. 2016-02As discussed in Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company changed its method of accounting for leases in the year ended October 31, 2020 due to the adoption of Accounting Standards Update (ASU) No. 2016-02, Leases (Topic 842), and the related amendments.Adoption of ASU No. 2016-16As discussed in Note 12 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company changed its method of accounting for the income tax consequences of intra-entity transfers, other than inventory, in the year ended November 2, 2019 due to the adoption of ASU No. 2016-16, Income Taxes (Topic 740): Intra-Entity Transfers of Assets Other Than Inventory.Basis for Opinion These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.Critical Audit Matters The critical audit matters communicated below are matters arising from the current period audit of the financial statements that were communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relate to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matters below, providing separate opinions on the critical audit matters or on the accounts or disclosures to which they relate.46Revenue Recognition – Measuring Variable ConsiderationDescription of the MatterAs described in Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company's sales contracts provide certain distributors with credits for price protection and rights of return, which results in variable consideration. During 2020, sales to distributors were $3.2 billion net of expected price protection discounts and rights of return for which the liability balance as of October 31, 2020 was $229.8 million.Auditing the Company's measurement of variable consideration under distributor contracts involved especially challenging judgment because the calculation involves subjective management assumptions about estimates of expected price protection discounts and returns. For example, estimated variable consideration included in the transaction price reflects management's evaluation of contractual terms, historical experience and assumptions about future economic conditions. Changes in those assumptions can have a material effect on the amount of variable consideration recognized.How We Addressed the Matter in Our AuditWe obtained an understanding, evaluated the design and tested the operating effectiveness of controls over the Company's process to calculate the variable consideration. For example, we tested controls over the appropriateness of assumptions management used as well as controls over the completeness and accuracy of the data underlying estimates of expected price protection discounts and returns.Our audit procedures included, among others, inspecting contractual terms in distributor agreements and testing the underlying data used in management’s calculation for completeness and accuracy as well as evaluating the significant assumptions used in the estimation of variable consideration. We evaluated the Company’s methods and assumptions used in the estimates, which included comparing the assumptions to historical trends. We inspected and tested the results of the Company's retrospective review analysis of actual returns and price protection discounts claimed by distributors, evaluated the estimates made based on historical experience and performed sensitivity analyses of the Company’s significant assumptions to assess the impact on the variable consideration. We also evaluated whether the Company appropriately considered new information that could significantly change the estimated future price protection discounts or returns.Goodwill – Quantitative Impairment AssessmentDescription of the MatterThe Company’s consolidated goodwill balance was $12.3 billion as of October 31, 2020. As described in Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company evaluates goodwill for impairment at the reporting unit level annually and performed a quantitative goodwill impairment assessment for each of its eight reporting units. The quantitative impairment assessment involves the comparison of the fair value of each reporting unit to its respective carrying amount. The Company used a weighting of the income and market approaches to determine the fair value of each reporting unit. Auditing management's quantitative goodwill impairment test involved a high degree of auditor judgment due to the significant estimation required to determine the fair value of each reporting unit. In particular, the fair value estimate for one of the eight reporting units was sensitive to significant assumptions, such as forecasted revenues, gross profit margins, operating income margins, long-term discount rate, perpetual growth rate, identification of comparable publicly traded companies and estimated valuation multiples, which led to a high degree of auditor judgment, subjectivity and effort in performing procedures and evaluating management’s significant assumptions as outlined above, used in determining the fair value of this reporting unit.How We Addressed the Matter in Our AuditWe obtained an understanding, evaluated the design and tested the operating effectiveness of controls over the Company's quantitative goodwill impairment assessment process. For example, we tested controls over management's review of the valuation model and the significant assumptions used.To test the estimated fair value of the reporting unit, our audit procedures included, among others, assessing methodologies and testing the significant assumptions discussed above and the underlying data used by the Company in its analysis. We tested significant assumptions by comparing them to current and forecasted industry and economic trends, analyst reports, and forecasted peer company information. We evaluated management’s ability to accurately forecast by comparing actual results to historical forecasts. We also performed sensitivity analyses of certain assumptions to evaluate changes in the fair value that would result from changes in the assumptions. With the assistance of our valuation specialists, we evaluated the selection of the long-term discount rate and perpetual growth rate, including testing the underlying source information and the mathematical accuracy of the calculations by developing a range of independent estimates and comparing those to the rates selected by management. We also involved our valuation specialists to evaluate the market approach, including evaluating the reasonableness of the selected comparable publicly traded companies and the resulting market multiples calculation. 47/s/ Ernst & Young LLPWe have served as the Company’s auditor since 1967.

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (all tabular amounts in thousands except per share amounts)The following discussion includes a comparison of our Results of Operations and Liquidity and Capital Resources for the fiscal years ended October 30, 2021 (fiscal 2021), the fiscal year ended October 31, 2020 (fiscal 2020) and the fiscal year ended November 2, 2019 (fiscal 2019). Our fiscal year is the 52-week or 53-week period ending on the Saturday closest to the last day in October. Fiscal 2021, fiscal 2020 and fiscal 2019 were 52-week fiscal periods. Impact of COVID-19 on our BusinessThe pandemic caused by the novel strain of the coronavirus (COVID-19) and the numerous measures implemented by government authorities in response, have impacted and likely will continue to impact our workforce and operations, the operations of our customers and those of our respective vendors and suppliers. We have significant operations worldwide, including in the United States, the Philippines, Ireland, Malaysia, Thailand, China and India. Each of these countries has been affected by the pandemic and taken measures to try to contain it, resulting in disruptions at some of our manufacturing operations and facilities.The spread of COVID-19 has caused us to modify our business practices (including restricting employee travel, modifying employee work locations and cancelling physical participation in meetings, events and conferences) and we may take further actions as may be required by government authorities or that we determine are in the best interests of our employees, customers, partners, suppliers and shareholders.While we are confident that our strategy and long-term contingency planning have positioned us well to weather the current uncertainty, we cannot at this time fully quantify or forecast the impact of COVID-19 on our business. The full extent of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our business, financial condition and results of operations will depend on future developments, which are highly uncertain such as the continued duration and severity of the pandemic, the spread of more contagious variants of the virus, the adoption rate of vaccines, the actions to contain the virus or treat its impact, or how quickly and to what extent normal economic and operating conditions can resume.Acquisition of Maxim Integrated Products, Inc.On August 26, 2021 (Acquisition Date), we completed the acquisition of Maxim Integrated Products, Inc. (Maxim), an independent manufacturer of innovative analog and mixed-signal products and technologies. Pursuant to the Agreement and Plan of Merger, dated as of July 12, 2020 (the Merger Agreement), Maxim stockholders received, for each outstanding share of Maxim common stock, 0.6300 of a share of the Company’s common stock as of the Acquisition Date, for total consideration of approximately $28.0 billion of our common stock. The acquisition of Maxim is referred to as the Acquisition. The consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K include the financial results of Maxim prospectively from the Acquisition Date. See Note 6, Acquisitions, of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements contained in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further information. Results of OperationsA discussion of changes in our results of operations from fiscal 2019 to fiscal 2020 has been omitted from this Form 10-K, but may be found in “Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” of our Form 10-K for fiscal 2020 filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on November 24, 2020.28Overview Fiscal Year2021 over 20202020 over 2019 202120202019 $ Change% Change $ Change% ChangeRevenue$7,318,286 $5,603,056 $5,991,065 $1,715,230 31 %$(388,009)(6)%Gross margin %61.8 %65.9 %67.0 %Net income$1,390,422 $1,220,761 $1,363,011 $169,661 14 %$(142,250)(10)%Net income as a % of revenue19.0 %21.8 %22.8 %Diluted EPS$3.46 $3.28 $3.65 $0.18 5 %$(0.37)(10)%Revenue Trends by End MarketThe following table summarizes revenue by end market. The categorization of revenue by end market is determined using a variety of data points including the technical characteristics of the product, the “sold to” customer information, the ""ship to"" customer information and the end customer product or application into which our product will be incorporated. As data systems for capturing and tracking this data and our methodology evolves and improves, the categorization of products by end market can vary over time. When this occurs, we reclassify revenue by end market for prior periods. Such reclassifications typically do not materially change the sizing of, or the underlying trends of results within each end market.

Revenue in the Communications end market was also slightly higher in fiscal 2021 compared to fiscal 2020 as the timing of infrastructure deployment cycles in certain regions offset higher demand. Incremental revenue as a result of the Acquisition also contributed to higher revenue in each end market in fiscal 2021, as compared to fiscal 2020.Revenue by Sales ChannelThe following table summarizes revenue by sales channel. We sell our products globally through a direct sales force, third party distributors, independent sales representatives and via our website. Distributors are customers that buy products with the intention of reselling them. Direct customers are non-distributor customers and consist primarily of original equipment manufacturers (OEMs). Other customers include the U.S. government, government prime contractors and certain commercial customers for which revenue is recorded over time. 29Fiscal 2021Fiscal 2020Fiscal 2019Revenue% ofTotalProductRevenue (1)Revenue% ofTotalProductRevenue (1)Revenue% ofTotalProductRevenue (1)Distributors$4,589,944 63 %$3,216,302 57 %$3,409,161 57 %Direct customers2,600,353 36 %2,300,493 41 %2,506,065 42 %Other127,989 2 %86,261 2 %75,839 1 %Total Revenue$7,318,286 100 %$5,603,056 100 %$5,991,065 100 %_______________________________________(1)The sum of the individual percentages may not equal the total due to rounding.The percentage of total revenue sold via each channel can fluctuate from time to time based on end customer demand.

Revenue Trends by Geographic RegionRevenue by geographic region, based upon the geographic location of the distributors or OEMs who purchased the Company's products, for fiscal 2021, fiscal 2020 and fiscal 2019 was as follows:ChangeFiscal Year2021 over 20202020 over 2019202120202019 $ Change% Change (1) $ Change% Change (1)United States$2,389,439 $1,887,443 $2,020,886 $501,996 27 %$(133,443)(7)%Rest of North and South America42,830 41,250 55,059 1,580 4 %(13,809)(25)%Europe1,592,989 1,245,695 1,374,673 347,294 28 %(128,978)(9)%Japan787,966 521,720 657,632 266,246 51 %(135,912)(21)%China1,614,396 1,348,011 1,316,275 266,385 20 %31,736 2 %Rest of Asia890,666 558,937 566,540 331,729 59 %(7,603)(1)%Total Revenue$7,318,286 $5,603,056 $5,991,065 $1,715,230 31 %$(388,009)(6)%_______________________________________(1)The sum of the individual percentages may not equal the total due to rounding.In all periods presented, the predominant countries comprising “Rest of North and South America” are Canada and Mexico; the predominant countries comprising “Europe” are Germany, Sweden, and the Netherlands; and the predominant countries comprising “Rest of Asia” are Taiwan, Malaysia, South Korea and Singapore.Total revenue increased in fiscal 2021 as compared to fiscal 2020 due to broad-based, global demand in the semiconductor industry as well as the incremental impact of revenue from the Acquisition. We saw increases across all end markets in territories, with the exception of sales into the Communication end market in China, which was impacted by infrastructure deployment cycles as noted above. 30Gross MarginChange Fiscal Year2021 over 20202020 over 2019 202120202019$ Change% Change$ Change% ChangeGross margin$4,525,012 $3,690,478 $4,013,750 $834,534 23 %$(323,272)(8)%Gross margin %61.8 %65.9 %67.0 %Gross margin percentage in fiscal 2021 decreased by 410 basis points compared to fiscal 2020, primarily as a result of recording additional costs related to the Acquisition, including $331.1 million and $155.4 million of cost of goods sold related to the fair value adjustments recorded to inventory and amortization expense of intangible assets, respectively. These increases in cost of sales as a result of the Acquisition were partially offset by the favorable impact of higher utilization of our factories due to increased customer demand.Research and Development (R&D)Change Fiscal Year2021 over 20202020 over 2019 202120202019$ Change% Change$ Change% ChangeR&D expenses$1,296,126 $1,050,519 $1,130,348 $245,607 23 %$(79,829)(7)%R&D expenses as a % of revenue18 %19 %19 %R&D expenses increased in fiscal 2021 as compared to fiscal 2020 primarily as a result of higher R&D employee-related variable compensation expense, incremental R&D expenses incurred as a result of the Acquisition and higher salary and benefit expenses. R&D expenses as a percentage of revenue will fluctuate from year-to-year depending on the amount of revenue and the success of new product development efforts, which we view as critical to our future growth. We expect to continue the development of innovative technologies and processes for new products. We believe that a continued commitment to R&D is essential to maintain product leadership with our existing products as well as to provide innovative new product offerings. Therefore, we expect to continue to make significant R&D investments in the future.Selling, Marketing, General and Administrative (SMG&A)Change Fiscal Year2021 over 20202020 over 2019 202120202019$ Change% Change$ Change% ChangeSMG&A expenses$915,418 $659,923 $648,094 $255,495 39 %$11,829 2 %SMG&A expenses as a % of revenue13 %12 %11 %SMG&A expenses increased in fiscal 2021 as compared to fiscal 2020, primarily as a result of higher costs due to acquisition-related transaction costs, incremental SMG&A expenses incurred as a result of the Acquisition and higher variable compensation expense and salary and benefit expenses.

As a result of these assessments, we have undertaken various restructuring actions over the past several years.Closure of Manufacturing Facilities: We recorded special charges as a result of our decision to consolidate certain wafer and test facility operations acquired as part of the acquisition of Linear. The special charges include severance and fringe benefit costs, in accordance with the Company's ongoing benefit plan or statutory requirements at foreign locations and one-time termination benefits for the impacted employees and other exit costs. These one-time termination benefits are being recognized over the future service period required for employees to earn these benefits. In addition, as a result of management's plan to close certain wafer and test facility operations acquired as part of the acquisition of Linear Technology Corporation (Linear), the Company sold its facility in Singapore and ceased production at its Hillview manufacturing facility in Milpitas, California during fiscal 2021. Repositioning Actions: In fiscal 2020, we recorded special charges of $49.4 million as a result of organizational initiatives to better align its global workforce with its long-term strategic plan. The special charges include severance and fringe benefit costs, in accordance with the Company's ongoing benefit plan or statutory requirements at foreign locations and the write-off of acquired intellectual property due to the Company's decision to discontinue certain product development strategies. Other: The other special charges of $83.4 million recognized during fiscal 2021 include severance and benefit costs as well as charges recorded from acceleration of equity awards in connection with the termination of a limited number of employees as part of the integration of the Acquisition.

Our provision for income taxes was 32impacted by incremental profit related to the Acquisition. Additionally, in fiscal 2021, we recorded a net deferred tax benefit of $188.8 million from deferred tax assets related to an intra-entity transfer of intangible assets. For fiscal 2021 and fiscal 2020, our pretax income was primarily generated in Ireland at a tax rate of 12.5%. Our tax rate for fiscal 2020 was also impacted by discrete items, primarily related to $25.9 million of income tax benefits resulting from the resolution of the Internal Revenue Service audit of Linear’s pre-acquisition federal income tax returns for fiscal 2015 through fiscal 2017, as well as other income tax benefits recorded upon the filing of our fiscal 2019 federal income tax return and excess tax benefits from stock-based compensation payments of $16.2 million.

We manage our worldwide cash requirements by, among other things, reviewing available funds held by our foreign subsidiaries and the cost effectiveness by which those funds can be accessed in the United States. We do not expect current regulatory restrictions or taxes on repatriation to have a material adverse effect on our overall liquidity, financial condition or results of operations. Our cash and cash equivalents consist of highly liquid investments with maturities of three months or less, including money market funds. We maintain these balances with high credit quality counterparties, continually monitor the amount of credit exposure to any one issuer and diversify our investments in order to minimize our credit risk.We believe that our existing sources of liquidity and cash expected to be generated from future operations, together with existing and anticipated available short- and long-term financing, will be sufficient to fund operations, capital expenditures, research and development efforts and dividend payments (if any) in the immediate future and for at least the next twelve months.

Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” of our Form 10-K for fiscal 2020 filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on November 24, 2020. The following changes contributed to the net change in cash and cash equivalents from fiscal 2020 to fiscal 2021. Operating ActivitiesCash provided by operating activities is net income adjusted for certain non-cash items and changes in assets and liabilities. The increase in cash provided by operating activities during fiscal 2021 as compared to fiscal 2020 was primarily a result of higher net income and an increase from changes in working capital. Net income in fiscal 2021 also included larger non-cash expenses from the Acquisition that were not included in fiscal 2020.33Investing ActivitiesInvesting cash flows generally consist of capital expenditures, cash used for acquisitions and proceeds from or purchases of investments. The increase in cash provided by (used for) investing activities during fiscal 2021 as compared to fiscal 2020 was primarily the result of cash received from the Acquisition, partially offset by an increase in cash used for capital expenditures.Financing ActivitiesFinancing cash flows consist primarily of payments of dividends to stockholders, repurchases of common stock, issuance and repayment of debt, and proceeds from the sale of shares of common stock pursuant to employee equity incentive plans. The increase in cash used for financing activities during fiscal 2021 as compared to fiscal 2020 was primarily the result of an increase in common stock repurchases in connection with our accelerated share repurchase program and higher dividend payments, partially offset by a net increase in debt in fiscal 2021 as we terminated some debt and raised additional proceeds from debt compared to the net decrease in debt in 2020.

Cost of sales amounts used in the calculation of days cost of sales in inventory for fiscal 2021 include Acquisition accounting adjustments related to the sale of acquired inventory written up to fair value, amortization of developed technology intangible assets acquired and depreciation related to the write-up of fixed assets to fair value. The calculations above include the financial results of Maxim prospectively from the Acquisition Date. The increase in accounts receivable for fiscal 2021 compared to fiscal 2020 was primarily the result of the Acquisition as well as normal variations in the timing of collections and billings.Inventory in dollars increased in fiscal 2021 as compared to fiscal 2020, primarily as a result of the Acquisition as well as our efforts to balance manufacturing production, demand and inventory levels. Our inventory levels are impacted by our need to support forecasted sales demand and variations between those forecasts and actual demand. During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2021, the inventory values on the Consolidated Balance Sheet were also impacted by additional costs related to the Acquisition and the requirement to account for acquired inventory at fair-value. Current liabilities increased to $2,770.3 million at October 30, 2021 from $1,365.0 million recorded at the end of fiscal 2020. The increase was primarily due to the Acquisition, including $516.7 million of Maxim debt obligations classified as current and $584.9 million of accrued liabilities.Revolving Credit Facility Our Third Amended and Restated Revolving Credit Agreement, dated as of June 23, 2021, with Bank of America N.A. as administrative agent and the other banks identified therein as lenders (Revolving Credit Agreement) amended and restated our Second Amended and Restated Credit Agreement dated as of June 28, 2019 and provides for a five year unsecured revolving credit facility in an aggregate principal amount not to exceed $2.5 billion (subject to certain terms and conditions). In March 2020, we borrowed $350.0 million under this revolving credit facility and utilized the proceeds for the repayment of existing indebtedness and working capital requirements. We repaid the $350.0 million plus interest in April 2020. In September 2021, we borrowed $400.0 million under this revolving credit facility and utilized the proceeds for the repayment of existing indebtedness and working capital requirements. We repaid the $400.0 million plus interest in October 2021. We may borrow under this revolving credit facility in the future and use the proceeds for repayment of existing indebtedness, stock repurchases, acquisitions, capital expenditures, working capital and other lawful corporate purposes. The terms of the Revolving Credit Agreement impose restrictions on our ability to undertake certain transactions, to create certain liens on assets and to incur certain subsidiary indebtedness. In addition, the Revolving Credit Agreement contains a consolidated leverage ratio covenant of total consolidated funded debt to consolidated earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA) of not greater than 3.5 to 1.0. As of October 30, 2021, we were in compliance with these covenants. See Note 13, Revolving Credit Facility, of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements contained in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further information on our revolving credit facility.34DebtAs of October 30, 2021, we had $6.8 billion of carrying value outstanding on our debt. On November 4, 2021, we redeemed Maxim's 3.375% Senior Notes due 2023 in the aggregate principal amount of $500.0 million. The difference in the carrying value of the debt and the principal is due to the unamortized discount and issuance fees and other adjustments on these instruments. The indentures governing certain of our debt instruments contain covenants that may limit our ability to: incur, create, assume or guarantee any debt or borrowed money secured by a lien upon a principal property; enter into sale and lease-back transactions with respect to a principal property; and consolidate with or merge into, or transfer or lease all or substantially all of our assets to, any other party. As of October 30, 2021, we were compliant with these covenants. See Note 14, Debt, and Note 15, Subsequent Events, of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements contained in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further information on our outstanding debt.Stock Repurchase ProgramIn September 2021, we entered into accelerated share repurchase agreements (ASR) with third party financial institutions to repurchase $2.5 billion of our common stock. We paid $2.5 billion and received an initial delivery of 12.3 million shares of common stock, which represented approximately 80% of the notional amount of the ASR. The final settlement of the transaction under the ASR is expected to occur in the first half of fiscal 2022.Our common stock repurchase program has been in place since August 2004. Since inception, our Board of Directors has authorized us to repurchase $16.7 billion of our common stock under the program, which includes the $8.5 billion authorization approved by the Board of Directors on August 25, 2021. Under the program, we may repurchase outstanding shares of our common stock from time to time in the open market and through privately negotiated transactions. Unless terminated earlier by resolution of our Board of Directors, the repurchase program will expire when we have repurchased all shares authorized under the program. As of October 30, 2021, $7.4 billion remained available for repurchase under the current authorized program. The repurchased shares are held as authorized but unissued shares of common stock. We also repurchase shares in settlement of employee tax withholding obligations due upon the vesting of restricted stock units/awards or the exercise of stock options. Future repurchases of common stock will be dependent upon our financial position, results of operations, outlook, liquidity, and other factors we deem relevant. Capital ExpendituresNet additions to property, plant and equipment were $343.7 million in fiscal 2021 and were funded with a combination of cash on hand and cash generated from operations. We expect capital expenditures for fiscal 2022 to be between 6% and 8% of revenue, which is above our historical levels primarily due to our plans to expand internal manufacturing capacity. These capital expenditures will be funded with a combination of cash on hand and cash expected to be generated from future operations, together with existing and anticipated available short- and long-term financing. Analog Devices FoundationDuring the first quarter of fiscal 2020, we contributed 335,654 shares of our common stock to the Analog Devices Foundation. As of the date of the contribution, the shares had a fair value of approximately $40.0 million. This expense was recorded in SMG&A in the Consolidated Statement of Income. DividendsOn November 22, 2021, our Board of Directors declared a cash dividend of $0.69 per outstanding share of common stock. The dividend will be paid on December 14, 2021 to all shareholders of record at the close of business on December 3, 2021 and is expected to total approximately $362.5 million. We currently expect quarterly dividends to continue in future periods, although they remain subject to determination and declaration by our Board of Directors. The payment of future dividends, if any, will be based on several factors, including our financial performance, outlook and liquidity.35Contractual ObligationsThe table below summarizes our material contractual obligations in specified periods as of October 30, 2021: Payment due by period Less than More than(thousands)Total1 Year1-3 Years3-5 Years5 YearsContractual obligations: Debt obligations (1)$6,776,865 $500,000 $500,000 $400,000 $5,376,865 Interest payments associated with debt obligations2,460,541 171,718 340,784 320,139 1,627,900 Transition tax (2)793,176 137,106 320,315 335,755 — Operating leases (3)393,002 61,855 103,418 84,059 143,670 Inventory-related purchase commitments (4)291,200 52,800 91,733 63,333 83,334 Total$10,714,784 $923,479 $1,356,250 $1,203,286 $7,231,769 _______________________________________(1)Debt obligations are assumed to be held to maturity. (2)Tax obligation relates to the one-time tax on deemed repatriated earnings under the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 enacted in fiscal 2018. See Note 12, Income Taxes, of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements contained in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further discussion. This amount includes transition tax payable attributable to the Acquisition of $266.1 million.(3)Certain of our operating lease obligations include escalation clauses. These escalating payment requirements are reflected in the table.(4)In connection with the Acquisition, we acquired a supplier commitment for the purchase of materials and supplies in advance or with minimum purchase quantities. As of October 30, 2021, our total liabilities associated with uncertain tax positions was $170.5 million, which are included in non-current income taxes payable in our Consolidated Balance Sheets contained in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Due to the complexity associated with our tax uncertainties, we cannot make a reasonably reliable estimate of the period in which we expect to settle the non-current liabilities associated with these uncertain tax positions. Therefore, we have not included these uncertain tax positions in the above contractual obligations table.The expected timing of payments and the amounts of the obligations discussed above are estimated based on current information available as of October 30, 2021.New Accounting PronouncementsFrom time to time, new accounting pronouncements are issued by the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) and are adopted by us as of the specified effective date. Unless otherwise discussed, management believes that the impact of recently issued standards will not have a material impact on our future financial condition and results of operations. See Note 2s, New Accounting Pronouncements, of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements contained in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for a description of recently issued and adopted accounting pronouncements, including the dates of adoption and impact on our historical financial condition and results of operations.Critical Accounting Policies and EstimatesManagement’s discussion and analysis of the financial condition and results of operations is based upon the Consolidated Financial Statements, which have been prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue and expenses, and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. We base our estimates and judgments on historical experience, knowledge of current conditions and beliefs of what could occur in the future based on available information. We consider the following accounting policies to be both those most important to the portrayal of our financial condition and those that require the most subjective judgment. If actual results differ significantly from management’s estimates and projections, there could be a material effect on our financial statements. We also have other policies that we consider key accounting policies; however, the application of these policies does not require us to make significant estimates or judgments that are difficult or subjective.Revenue RecognitionRecognition of revenue occurs when a customer obtains control of promised goods or services in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the providing entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. We recognize revenue upon transfer of control of promised products or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration that we expect to receive in exchange for those products or services. We recognize revenue when all of the following criteria are met: (1) we have entered into a binding agreement, (2) the performance obligations have been identified, (3) the transaction price to the customer has been determined, (4) the transaction price has been allocated to the performance obligations in the 36contract, and (5) the performance obligations have been satisfied. The majority of our shipping terms permit us to recognize revenue at point of shipment or delivery. Certain shipping terms require the goods to be through customs or be received by the customer before title passes. In those instances, we defer the revenue recognized until title has passed. Shipping costs are charged to selling, marketing, general and administrative expense as incurred. Sales taxes are excluded from revenue.Revenue from contracts with the United States government, government prime contractors and certain commercial customers is recorded over time using either units delivered or costs incurred as the measurement basis for progress toward completion. These measures are used to measure results directly and is generally the best measure of progress toward completion in circumstances in which a reliable measure of output can be established. Estimated revenue in excess of amounts billed is reported as unbilled receivables. Contract accounting requires judgment in estimating costs and assumptions related to technical issues and delivery schedule. Contract costs include material, subcontract costs, labor and an allocation of indirect costs. The estimation of costs at completion of a contract is subject to numerous variables involving contract costs and estimates as to the length of time to complete the contract. Changes in contract performance, estimated gross margin, including the impact of final contract settlements, and estimated losses are recognized in the period in which the changes or losses are determined.Performance Obligations: Substantially all of our contracts with customers contain a single performance obligation, the sale of mixed-signal integrated circuit (IC) products. Such sales represent a single performance obligation because the sale is one type of good or includes multiple goods that are neither capable of being distinct nor separable from the other promises in the contract. This performance obligation is satisfied when control of the product is transferred to the customer, which occurs upon shipment or delivery. Unsatisfied performance obligations primarily represent contracts for products with future delivery dates and with an original expected duration of one year or less. We generally warrant that our products will meet their published specifications, and that we will repair or replace defective products, for one year from the date title passes from us to the customer. Specific accruals are recorded for known product warranty issues. Transaction Price: The transaction price reflects our expectations about the consideration we will be entitled to receive from the customer and may include fixed or variable amounts. Fixed consideration primarily includes sales to direct customers and sales to distributors in which both the sale to the distributor and the sale to the end customer occur within the same reporting period. Variable consideration includes sales in which the amount of consideration that we will receive is unknown as of the end of a reporting period. Such consideration primarily includes credits issued to the distributor due to price protection and sales made to distributors under agreements that allow certain rights of return, referred to as stock rotation. Price protection represents price discounts granted to certain distributors to allow the distributor to earn an appropriate margin on sales negotiated with certain customers and in the event of a price decrease subsequent to the date the product was shipped and billed to the distributor. Stock rotation allows distributors limited levels of returns in order to reduce the amounts of slow-moving, discontinued or obsolete product from their inventory. A liability for distributor credits covering variable consideration is made based on management's estimate of historical experience rates as well as considering economic conditions and contractual terms. To date, actual distributor claims activity has been materially consistent with the provisions we have made based on our historical estimates.Contract Balances: Accounts receivable represents our unconditional right to receive consideration from our customers. Payments are typically due within 30 to 45 days of invoicing and do not include a significant financing component. To date, there have been no material impairment losses on accounts receivable. There were no material contract assets or contract liabilities recorded on the Consolidated Balance Sheets in any of the periods presented.Inventory ValuationWe value inventories at the lower of cost (first-in, first-out method) or market. Because of the cyclical nature of the semiconductor industry, changes in inventory levels, obsolescence of technology, and product life cycles, we write down inventories to net realizable value. We employ a variety of methodologies to determine the net realizable value of inventory. While a portion of the calculation is determined via reference to the age of inventory and lower of cost or market calculations, an element of the calculation is subject to significant judgments made by us about future demand for our inventory. If actual demand for our products is less than our estimates, additional adjustments to existing inventories may need to be recorded in future periods. To date, our actual results have not been materially different than our estimates, and we do not expect them to be materially different in the future.Long-Lived AssetsWe review property, plant, and equipment and intangible assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of assets may not be recoverable. Recoverability of these assets is determined by comparison of their carrying value to the estimated future undiscounted cash flows that the assets are expected to generate over their remaining estimated lives. If such assets are considered to be impaired, the impairment to be recognized in earnings equals the amount by which the carrying value of the assets exceeds their fair value determined by either a quoted market price, if any, or a value determined by utilizing a discounted cash flow technique. Although we have recognized no material impairment 37adjustments related to our property, plant, and equipment and identified intangible assets during the past three fiscal years, except those made in conjunction with restructuring actions, deterioration in our business in the future could lead to such impairment adjustments in future periods. Evaluation of impairment of long-lived assets requires estimates of future operating results that are used in the preparation of the expected future undiscounted cash flows. Actual future operating results and the remaining economic lives of our long-lived assets could differ from the estimates used in assessing the recoverability of these assets. These differences could result in impairment charges, which could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations. In addition, in certain instances, assets may not be impaired but their estimated useful lives may have decreased. In these situations, we amortize the remaining net book values over the revised useful lives. GoodwillGoodwill is subject to impairment tests annually or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances suggest that the carrying value of goodwill may not be recoverable, utilizing either the qualitative or quantitative method. We test goodwill for impairment at the reporting unit level, which we determined is consistent with our identified operating segments, on an annual basis on the first day of the fourth quarter (on or about August 1) or more frequently if we believe indicators of impairment exist or we reorganize our operating segments or reporting units. We have the option to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its net book value. When using the qualitative method, we consider several factors, including the following:–the amount by which the fair values of each reporting unit exceeded their carrying values as of the date of the most recent quantitative impairment analysis, which indicated there would need to be substantial negative developments in the markets in which these reporting units operate in order for there to be potential impairment;–the carrying values of these reporting units as of the assessment date compared to their previously calculated fair values as of the date of the most recent quantitative impairment analysis;–the current forecasts as compared to the forecasts included in the most recent quantitative impairment analysis;–public information from competitors and other industry information to determine if there were any significant adverse trends in our competitors' businesses;–changes in the value of major U.S. stock indices that could suggest declines in overall market stability that could impact the valuation of our reporting units;–changes in our market capitalization and overall enterprise valuation to determine if there were any significant decreases that could be an indication that the valuation of our reporting units had significantly decreased; and–whether there had been any significant increases to the weighted-average cost of capital rates for each reporting unit, which could materially lower our prior valuation conclusions under a discounted cash flow approach.If we elect not to use this option, or we determine that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its net book value, then we perform the quantitative goodwill impairment test. The quantitative goodwill impairment test requires an entity to compare the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying amount. If fair value is determined to be less than carrying value, an impairment loss is recognized for the amount of the carrying value that exceeds the amount of the reporting unit's fair value, not to exceed the total amount of goodwill allocated to the reporting unit. Additionally, we consider income tax effects from any tax deductible goodwill on the carrying amount of the reporting unit when measuring the goodwill impairment loss, if applicable. We determine the fair value of our reporting units using a weighting of the income and market approaches. Under the income approach, we use a discounted cash flow methodology which requires management to make significant estimates and assumptions related to forecasted revenues, gross profit margins, operating income margins, working capital cash flow, perpetual growth rates, and long-term discount rates, among others. For the market approach, we use the guideline public company method. Under this method we utilize information from comparable publicly traded companies with similar operating and investment characteristics as the reporting units, to create valuation multiples that are applied to the operating performance of the reporting unit being tested, in order to obtain their respective fair values. In order to assess the reasonableness of the calculated reporting unit fair values, we reconcile the aggregate fair values of our reporting units determined, as described above, to our total company market capitalization, allowing for a reasonable control premium. During fiscal 2021 and fiscal 2020, we elected to use the quantitative method of assessing goodwill for all of our reporting units. In all periods presented, we concluded the reporting units' fair values exceeded their carrying amounts as of the assessment dates and no risk of impairment existed. 38Business CombinationsUnder the acquisition method of accounting, we recognize tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their estimated fair values. We record the excess of the fair value of the purchase consideration over the value of the net assets acquired as goodwill. The accounting for business combinations requires us to make significant estimates and assumptions, especially with respect to intangible assets and the fair value of contingent payment obligations. Critical estimates in valuing purchased technology, customer lists and other identifiable intangible assets include future cash flows that we expect to generate from the acquired assets. If the subsequent actual results and updated projections of the underlying business activity change compared with the assumptions and projections used to develop these values, we could experience impairment charges which could be material. In addition, we have estimated the economic lives of certain acquired assets and these lives are used to calculate depreciation and amortization expense. If our estimates of the economic lives change, depreciation or amortization expenses could be accelerated or slowed.We record contingent consideration resulting from a business combination at its fair value on the acquisition date. We generally determine the fair value of the contingent consideration using the income approach methodology of valuation. Each reporting period thereafter, we revalue these obligations and record increases or decreases in their fair value as an adjustment to operating expenses within the Consolidated Statements of Income. Changes in the fair value of the contingent consideration can result from changes in assumed discount periods and rates, and from changes pertaining to the achievement of the defined milestones. Significant judgment is employed in determining the appropriateness of these assumptions as of the acquisition date and for each subsequent period. Accordingly, future business and economic conditions, as well as changes in any of the assumptions described above, can materially impact the amount of contingent consideration expense we record in any given period.Accounting for Income TaxesWe make certain estimates and judgments in determining income tax expense for financial statement purposes. These estimates and judgments occur in the calculation of income tax credits, benefits, and deductions, and in the calculation of certain tax assets and liabilities, which arise from differences in the timing of the recognition of certain expenses for tax and financial statement purposes. We assess the likelihood of the realization of deferred tax assets and record a corresponding valuation allowance as necessary if we determine those deferred tax assets may not be realized due to the uncertainty of the timing and amount to be realized of certain state and international tax credit carryovers. In reaching our conclusion, we evaluate certain relevant criteria including the existence of deferred tax liabilities that can be used to realize deferred tax assets, the taxable income in prior carryback years in the impacted state and international jurisdictions that can be used to absorb net operating losses and taxable income in future years. Our judgments regarding future profitability may change due to future market conditions, changes in U.S. or international tax laws and other factors. These changes, if any, may require material adjustments to these deferred tax assets, which may result in an increase or decrease to our income tax provision in future periods.We account for uncertain tax positions by first determining if it is “more likely than not” that a tax position will be sustained by the appropriate taxing authorities prior to recording any benefit in the financial statements. An uncertain income tax position is not recognized if it has less than a 50% likelihood of being sustained. For those tax positions where it is more likely than not that a tax position will be sustained, we have recorded the largest amount of tax benefit with a greater than 50% likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement with a taxing authority that has full knowledge of all relevant information. For those income tax positions where it is not more likely than not that a tax benefit will be sustained, no tax benefit has been recognized in the financial statements. We classify interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions within the (benefit from) provision for income taxes line of the Consolidated Statements of Income. We reevaluate these uncertain tax positions on a quarterly basis. This evaluation is based on factors including, but not limited to, changes in known facts or circumstances, changes in tax law, effectively settled issues under audit, and new guidance on legislative interpretations. A change in these factors could result in the recognition of an increase or decrease to our income tax provision, which could materially impact our consolidated financial position and results of operations.In the ordinary course of global business, there are many transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax outcome is uncertain. Some of these uncertainties arise as a consequence of cost reimbursement and royalty arrangements among related entities. Although we believe our estimates are reasonable, no assurance can be given that the final tax outcome of these matters will not be different than that which is reflected in our historical income tax provisions and income tax liabilities. In the event our assumptions are incorrect, the differences could have a material impact on our income tax provision and operating results in the period in which such determination is made. In addition to the factors described above, our current and expected effective tax rate is based on then-current tax law. Significant changes during the year in enacted tax law could affect these estimates.See Note 12, Income Taxes, of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements contained in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further discussion.39Stock-Based CompensationStock-based compensation expense associated with stock options and related awards is recognized in the Consolidated Statements of Income. Determining the amount of stock-based compensation to be recorded requires us to develop estimates to be used in calculating the grant-date fair value of stock options and market-based restricted stock units. We calculate the grant-date fair values of stock options using the Black-Scholes valuation model. The grant-date fair value of restricted stock units with a service condition and restricted stock units with both service and performance conditions are calculated using the value of our common stock on the date of grant, reduced by the present value of dividends expected to be paid on our common stock prior to vesting. For restricted stock units with both service and performance conditions, this grant-date fair value is also impacted by the number of units that are expected to vest during the performance period and is adjusted through the related stock-based compensation expense at each reporting period based on the probability of achievement of that performance condition. If we determine that an award is unlikely to vest, any previously recorded stock-based compensation expense is reversed in the period of that determination. The grant date fair value of restricted stock units or performance-based stock options with both service and market conditions are calculated using the Monte Carlo simulation model to estimate the probability of satisfying the performance condition stipulated in the award grant, including the possibility that the market condition may not be satisfied.The use of valuation models requires us to make estimates of key assumptions such as expected option term and stock price volatility to determine the fair value of a stock option. The estimate of these key assumptions is based on historical information and judgment regarding market factors and trends. We recognize the expense related to equity awards on a straight-line basis over the vesting period. See Note 2r, Stock-based Compensation, and Note 3, Stock-Based Compensation and Shareholders' Equity, of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements contained in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for more information related to stock-based compensation.ContingenciesFrom time to time, in the ordinary course of business, various claims, charges and litigation are asserted or commenced against us arising from, or related to, among other things, contractual matters, patents, trademarks, personal injury, environmental matters, product liability, insurance coverage, employment or employment benefits. We periodically assess each matter to determine if a contingent liability should be recorded. In making this determination, we may, depending on the nature of the matter, consult with internal and external legal counsel and technical experts. Based on the information we obtain, combined with our judgment regarding all the facts and circumstances of each matter, we determine whether it is probable that a contingent loss may be incurred and whether the amount of such loss can be reasonably estimated. If a loss is probable and reasonably estimable, we record a contingent loss. In determining the amount of a contingent loss, we consider advice received from experts in the specific matter, current status of legal proceedings, settlement negotiations that may be ongoing, prior case history and other factors. If the judgments and estimates made by us are incorrect, we may need to record additional contingent losses that could materially adversely impact our results of operations.40 ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISKInterest Rate ExposureOur interest income and expense are sensitive to changes in the general level of interest rates. In this regard, changes in interest rates affect the interest earned or paid on our marketable securities and debt, as well as the fair value of our investments and debt.Based on the $500.0 million of our floating rate debt outstanding as of October 30, 2021, our annual interest expense would change by approximately $5.0 million for each 100 basis point increase in interest rates. In certain instances, we utilize interest rate derivatives to manage interest rate exposure on both outstanding debt as well as future issuances. As of October 30, 2021, we had no outstanding interest rate derivative instruments. As of October 31, 2020, for each 100 basis point decrease in the ten-year U.S. Treasury rate, the fair value of our outstanding derivative instruments would have changed by approximately $102.0 million.Based on our marketable securities outstanding as of October 30, 2021 and October 31, 2020, our annual interest income would change by approximately $19.7 million and $10.6 million, respectively, for each 100 basis point increase in interest rates.To provide a meaningful assessment of the interest rate risk associated with our investment portfolio, we performed a sensitivity analysis to determine the impact a change in interest rates would have on the value of our investment portfolio assuming a 100 basis point parallel shift in the yield curve. Based on investment positions as of October 30, 2021 and October 31, 2020, a hypothetical 100 basis point increase in interest rates across all maturities would not materially impact the fair market value of the portfolio in either period. If significant, such losses would only be realized if we sold the investments prior to maturity.As of October 30, 2021, we had $6.8 billion in principal amount of senior unsecured notes outstanding, with a fair value of $7.1 billion. The fair value of our notes is subject to interest rate risk, market risk, and other factors. Generally, the fair value of our notes will increase as interest rates fall and decrease as interest rates rise. The fair values of our notes as of October 30, 2021 and October 31, 2020, assuming a hypothetical 100 basis point increase in market interest rates, are as follows:October 30, 2021October 31, 2020(thousands)Principal Amount OutstandingFair Value Fair Value given an increase in interest rates of 100 basis pointsPrincipal Amount OutstandingFair Value Fair Value given an increase in interest rates of 100 basis points2021 Notes, due December 2021$— $— $— $400,000 $408,565$404,170 2023 Notes, due March 2023500,000 520,236 513,273 — — — Maxim 2023 Notes, due June 2023— — — 500,000 526,855 513,874 2023 Notes, due December 2023— — — 550,000 590,177 572,965 2024 Notes, due October 2024500,000 500,482 486,201 — — — 2025 Notes, due April 2025400,000 423,265 409,725 400,000 434,919 417,225 2025 Notes, due December 2025— — — 850,000 969,033 924,695 2026 Notes, due December 2026900,000 986,243 941,160 900,000 1,017,505 962,821 Maxim 2027 Notes, due June 2027500,000 542,942 515,866 — — — 2028 Notes, due October 2028750,000 743,109 696,554 — — — 2031 Notes, due October 20311,000,000 996,702 912,196 — — — 2036 Notes, due December 2036144,278 176,960 158,110 250,000 298,153 265,210 2041 Notes, due October 2041750,000 758,246 652,754 — — — 2045 Notes, due December 2045332,587 469,592 404,287 400,000 538,788 463,425 2051 Notes, due October 20511,000,000 1,029,830 848,513 — — — 41Foreign Currency ExposureAs more fully described in Note 2i, Derivative and Hedging Agreements, of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements contained in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, we regularly hedge our non-U.S. dollar-based exposures by entering into forward foreign currency exchange contracts. The terms of these contracts are for periods matching the duration of the underlying exposure and generally range from one to twelve months. Currently, our largest foreign currency exposure is the Euro, primarily because our European operations have the highest proportion of our local currency denominated expenses. Relative to foreign currency exposures existing at October 30, 2021 and October 31, 2020, a 10% unfavorable movement in foreign currency exchange rates over the course of the year would result in approximately $39.5 million of losses and $18.5 million of losses, respectively, in changes in earnings or cash flows.The market risk associated with our derivative instruments results from currency exchange rates that are expected to offset the market risk of the underlying transactions, assets and liabilities being hedged. The counterparties to the agreements relating to our foreign exchange instruments consist of a number of major international financial institutions with high credit ratings. Based on the credit ratings of our counterparties as of October 30, 2021, we do not believe that there is significant risk of nonperformance by them. While the contract or notional amounts of derivative financial instruments provide one measure of the volume of these transactions, they do not represent the amount of our exposure to credit risk. The amounts potentially subject to credit risk (arising from the possible inability of counterparties to meet the terms of their contracts) are generally limited to the amounts, if any, by which the counterparties’ obligations under the contracts exceed our obligations to the counterparties.The following table illustrates the effect that a 10% unfavorable or favorable movement in foreign currency exchange rates, relative to the U.S. dollar, would have on the fair value of our forward exchange contracts as of October 30, 2021 and October 31, 2020:October 30, 2021October 31, 2020Fair value of forward exchange contracts$(8,085)$5,427 Fair value of forward exchange contracts after a 10% unfavorable movement in foreign currency exchange rates asset$26,673 $21,859 Fair value of forward exchange contracts after a 10% favorable movement in foreign currency exchange rates liability$(41,034)$(20,276)The calculation assumes that each exchange rate would change in the same direction relative to the U.S. dollar. In addition to the direct effects of changes in exchange rates, such changes typically affect the volume of sales or the foreign currency sales price as competitors’ products become more or less attractive. Our sensitivity analysis of the effects of changes in foreign currency exchange rates does not factor in a potential change in sales levels or local currency selling prices.42REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRMThe Board of Directors and Shareholders Analog Devices, Inc.Opinion on the Financial StatementsWe have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Analog Devices, Inc. (the Company) as of October 30, 2021 and October 31, 2020, the related consolidated statements of income, comprehensive income, shareholders' equity and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended October 30, 2021, and the related notes and financial statement schedule listed in the Index at Item 15(a)(2) (collectively referred to as the “consolidated financial statements”). In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company at October 30, 2021 and October 31, 2020, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended October 30, 2021, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of October 30, 2021, based on criteria established in Internal Control-Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework), and our report dated December 3, 2021 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.Basis for Opinion These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.Critical Audit Matters The critical audit matters communicated below are matters arising from the current period audit of the financial statements that were communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relate to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matters below, providing separate opinions on the critical audit matters or on the accounts or disclosures to which they relate.Revenue Recognition – Measuring Variable ConsiderationDescription of the MatterAs described in Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company's sales contracts provide certain distributors with credits for price protection and rights of return, which results in variable consideration. During 2021, sales to distributors were $4.6 billion net of expected price protection discounts and rights of return for which the liability balance as of October 30, 2021 was $664.2 million.Auditing the Company's measurement of variable consideration under distributor contracts involved especially challenging judgment because the calculation involves subjective management assumptions about estimates of expected price protection discounts and returns. For example, estimated variable consideration included in the transaction price reflects management's evaluation of contractual terms, historical experience and assumptions about future economic conditions. Changes in those assumptions can have a material effect on the amount of variable consideration recognized.43How We Addressed the Matter in Our AuditWe obtained an understanding over the Company's process to calculate the variable consideration. With the exception of the portion of the balance that related to Maxim Integrated Products, Inc., we also evaluated the design and tested the operating effectiveness of the relevant controls. For example, we tested controls over the appropriateness of assumptions management used as well as controls over the completeness and accuracy of the data underlying estimates of expected price protection discounts and returns.Our audit procedures included, among others, inspecting contractual terms in distributor agreements and testing the underlying data used in management’s calculation for completeness and accuracy as well as evaluating the significant assumptions used in the estimation of variable consideration. We evaluated the Company’s methods and assumptions used in the estimates, which included comparing the assumptions to historical trends. We inspected and tested the results of the Company's retrospective review analysis of actual returns and price protection discounts claimed by distributors, evaluated the estimates made based on historical experience and performed sensitivity analyses of the Company’s significant assumptions to assess the impact on the variable consideration. We also evaluated whether the Company appropriately considered new information that could significantly change the estimated future price protection discounts or returns.Accounting for Acquisitions – Valuation of Identified Intangibles Description of the MatterDuring 2021, the Company completed its acquisition of Maxim Integrated Products, Inc. (Maxim) for total consideration of $27.9 billion, as disclosed in Note 6 to the consolidated financial statements. The transaction was accounted for as a business combination.Auditing the Company's accounting for its acquisition of Maxim was complex due to the significant estimation uncertainty in the Company’s determination of the fair value of identifiable intangible assets of $12.4 billion, which principally consisted of developed technology and customer relationships. The significant estimation uncertainty was primarily due to the sensitivity of the respective fair values to underlying assumptions about the future performance of the acquired business. The Company used discounted cash flow models to measure the developed technology and customer relationship intangible assets. The significant assumptions used to estimate the fair value of the intangible assets included discount rates and certain assumptions that form the basis of the forecasted results (e.g., annual revenue growth rates, developed technology obsolescence rates and customer attrition rates). These significant assumptions are forward looking and could be affected by future economic and market conditions. How We Addressed the Matter in Our AuditWe obtained an understanding, evaluated the design and tested the operating effectiveness of controls over the Company's accounting for acquisitions process. For example, we tested controls over the appropriateness of the valuation model, assumptions management used as well as controls over the completeness and accuracy of the data underlying the valuation of the developed technology and customer relationship intangible assets.To test the estimated fair value of the developed technology and customer relationship intangible assets, our audit procedures included, among others, assessing methodologies and testing the significant assumptions discussed above and the underlying data supporting the significant assumptions and estimates used by the Company in the valuation. We tested significant assumptions through a combination of procedures, as applicable for each assumption, including comparing them to current and forecasted industry and economic trends, as well as to the historical results of the acquired business and other guideline companies within the same industry. With the assistance of our valuation specialists, we evaluated the methodology used by the Company and significant assumptions included in the fair value estimates. /s/ Ernst & Young LLPWe have served as the Company’s auditor since 1967.

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (all tabular amounts in thousands except per share amounts)The following discussion includes results of operations and financial condition for the fiscal year ended October 29, 2022 (fiscal 2022) and the fiscal year ended October 30, 2021 (fiscal 2021) and year-over-year comparisons between fiscal 2022 and fiscal 2021. For discussion on results of operations and financial condition for fiscal 2021 and the fiscal year ended October 31, 2020 (fiscal 2020) and year-over-year comparisons between fiscal 2021 and fiscal 2020, please refer to Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations in Part II, Item 7 of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for fiscal 2021 filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on December 3, 2021. Our fiscal year is the 52-week or 53-week period ending on the Saturday closest to the last day in October. Fiscal 2022 and fiscal 2021 were 52-week fiscal periods. Impact of COVID-19 on our BusinessThe pandemic caused by the novel strain of the coronavirus (COVID-19) and the numerous measures implemented by government authorities in response, have impacted and may continue to impact our workforce and operations, the operations of our customers and those of our respective vendors and suppliers. We have significant operations worldwide, including in the United States, the Philippines, Ireland, Malaysia, Thailand and India. Each of these countries has been affected by the pandemic and taken measures to try to contain it, resulting in disruptions at some of our manufacturing operations and facilities, including restrictions on our access to facilities.The spread of COVID-19 has caused us to modify our business practices (including restricting employee travel, modifying employee work locations and cancelling physical participation in meetings, events and conferences) and we may take further actions as may be required by government authorities or that we determine are in the best interests of our employees, customers, partners, suppliers and shareholders.While we are confident that our strategy and long-term contingency planning have positioned us well to weather the current uncertainty, we cannot at this time fully quantify or forecast the impact of COVID-19 on our business. The ultimate impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows continues to largely depend on future developments, including the duration, scope and severity of the pandemic, any additional resurgences, variants and severity of variants and the ability to effectively and widely manufacture and distribute vaccines, which are not within our control and cannot be accurately predicted and are uncertain.Acquisition of Maxim Integrated Products, Inc.On August 26, 2021 (Acquisition Date), we completed the acquisition of Maxim Integrated Products, Inc. (Maxim), an independent manufacturer of innovative analog and mixed-signal products and technologies. Pursuant to the Agreement and Plan of Merger, dated as of July 12, 2020 (the Merger Agreement), Maxim stockholders received, for each outstanding share of Maxim common stock, 0.6300 of a share of the Company’s common stock as of the Acquisition Date, for total consideration of approximately $28.0 billion of our common stock. The acquisition of Maxim is referred to as the Acquisition. The consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K include the financial results of Maxim prospectively from the Acquisition Date. See Note 6, Acquisitions, of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements contained in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further information.

The categorization of revenue by end market is determined using a variety of data points including the technical characteristics of the product, the “sold to” customer information, the ""ship to"" customer information and the end customer product or application into which our product will be incorporated. As data systems for capturing and tracking this data and our methodology evolves and improves, the categorization of products by end market can vary over time. When this occurs, we reclassify revenue by end market for prior periods. Such reclassifications typically do not materially change the sizing of, or the underlying trends of results within, each end market.

We sell our products globally through a direct sales force, third party distributors, independent sales representatives and via our website. Distributors are customers that buy products with the intention of reselling them. Direct customers are non-distributor customers and consist primarily of original equipment manufacturers (OEMs). Other customers include the U.S. government, government prime contractors and certain commercial customers for which revenue is recorded over time.

Gross Margin Fiscal Year2022 over 2021 20222021$ Change% ChangeGross margin$7,532,474 $4,525,012 $3,007,462 66 %Gross margin %62.7 %61.8 %Gross margin percentage in fiscal 2022 increased by 90 basis points compared to fiscal 2021 primarily as a result of favorable product mix, synergies related to the Acquisition and higher utilization of our factories due to increased customer demand, partially offset by additional cost of goods sold related to the Acquisition. This additional cost of goods sold related to the Acquisition consisted of amortization expense of intangible assets of $857.1 million in fiscal 2022 compared to $155.4 million in fiscal 2021, and nonrecurring fair value adjustments recorded to inventory of $271.4 million in fiscal 2022 compared to $331.1 million in fiscal 2021. In addition, gross margin percentage in fiscal 2022 included price increases in revenue to offset inflationary cost increases.Research and Development (R&D) Fiscal Year2022 over 2021 20222021$ Change% ChangeR&D expenses$1,700,518 $1,296,126 $404,392 31 %R&D expenses as a % of revenue14 %18 %R&D expenses increased in fiscal 2022 as compared to fiscal 2021 primarily as a result of the Acquisition.R&D expenses as a percentage of revenue will fluctuate from year-to-year depending on the amount of revenue and the success of new product development efforts, which we view as critical to our future growth. We expect to continue the development of innovative technologies and processes for new products. We believe that a continued commitment to R&D is essential to maintain product leadership with our existing products as well as to provide innovative new product offerings.

During the third quarter of fiscal 2022, we transitioned our engineering, sales, marketing and administrative activities from a leased property in Santa Clara, California to an owned property in San Jose, California. As a result, we entered into a sublease agreement for a portion of the leased property and recorded an impairment charge of $91.9 million in the third quarter of fiscal 2022 related to the associated asset group. The remaining charges were for severance and benefit costs as well as charges recorded from the acceleration of equity awards in connection with the termination of certain employees in manufacturing, engineering and SMG&A roles at sites assumed in connection with the Acquisition and various other locations throughout the world.

In fiscal 2021, we recorded a net deferred tax benefit of $188.8 million from deferred tax assets related to an intra-entity transfer of intangible assets. Also, our provision for income taxes increased in fiscal 2022 as a result of higher income before taxes primarily related to the Acquisition. For fiscal 2022 and fiscal 2021 our pretax income was primarily generated in Ireland at a tax rate of 12.5%. See Note 12, Income Taxes, of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements contained in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further discussion. Net Income Fiscal Year2022 over 2021 20222021$ Change% ChangeNet income$2,748,561 $1,390,422 $1,358,139 98 %Net income, as a % of revenue22.9 %19.0 %Diluted EPS$5.25 $3.46 $1.79 52 %The increase in net income in fiscal 2022 as compared to fiscal 2021 was a result of a $1,586.5 million increase in operating income and a $183.5 million decrease in nonoperating expense, partially offset by a $411.9 million increase in provision for income taxes, as more fully described above under the headings Operating Income, Nonoperating (Income) Expense, and Provision for (Benefit From) Income Taxes.Liquidity and Capital ResourcesAt October 29, 2022, our principal source of liquidity was $1,470.6 million of cash and cash equivalents, of which approximately $307.4 million was held in the United States and the balance of our cash and cash equivalents was held outside the United States in various foreign subsidiaries. We manage our worldwide cash requirements by, among other things, reviewing available funds held by our foreign subsidiaries and the cost effectiveness by which those funds can be accessed in the United States. We do not expect current regulatory restrictions or taxes on repatriation to have a material adverse effect on our overall liquidity, financial condition or results of operations. Our cash and cash equivalents consist of highly liquid investments with maturities of three months or less, including money market funds. We maintain these balances with high credit quality counterparties, continually monitor the amount of credit exposure to any one issuer and diversify our investments in order to minimize our credit risk.We believe that our existing sources of liquidity and cash expected to be generated from future operations, together with existing and anticipated available short- and long-term financing, will be sufficient to fund operations, capital expenditures, research and development efforts and dividend payments (if any) in the immediate future and for at least the next twelve months. Fiscal Year 20222021Net cash provided by operating activities$4,475,402 $2,735,069 Net cash provided by operating activities as a % of revenue37 %37 %Net cash (used for) provided by investing activities$(657,368)$2,143,525 Net cash used for financing activities$(4,290,720)$(3,959,664)The following changes contributed to the net change in cash and cash equivalents from fiscal 2021 to fiscal 2022. Operating ActivitiesCash provided by operating activities is net income adjusted for certain non-cash items and changes in assets and liabilities. The increase in cash provided by operating activities during fiscal 2022 as compared to fiscal 2021 was primarily a result of higher net income adjusted for noncash items offset by changes in working capital. 33Investing ActivitiesInvesting cash flows generally consist of capital expenditures, cash used for acquisitions and proceeds from or purchases of investments. The change in cash (used for) provided by investing activities during fiscal 2022 as compared to fiscal 2021 was primarily the result of cash received from the Acquisition during fiscal 2021, partially offset by an increase in cash used for capital expenditures during fiscal 2022.Financing ActivitiesFinancing cash flows consist primarily of payments of dividends to stockholders, repurchases of common stock, issuance and repayment of debt, and proceeds from the sale of shares of common stock pursuant to employee equity incentive plans. The change in cash used for financing activities during fiscal 2022 as compared to fiscal 2021 was primarily the result of a net decrease in debt in fiscal 2022 as compared to a net increase in debt in fiscal 2021, as well as higher dividend payments, partially offset by lower common stock repurchases. Working Capital Fiscal Year 20222021$ Change% ChangeAccounts receivable, net$1,800,462 $1,459,056 $341,406 23 %Days sales outstanding (1)50 52 Inventory$1,399,914 $1,200,610 $199,304 17 %Days cost of sales in inventory (1)106 118 _______________________________________(1)We use the average of the current year and prior year ending net accounts receivable and ending inventory balance in our calculation of days sales outstanding and days cost of sales in inventory, respectively. Cost of sales amounts used in the calculation of days cost of sales in inventory include Acquisition accounting adjustments related to the sale of acquired inventory written up to fair value, amortization of developed technology intangible assets acquired and depreciation related to the write-up of fixed assets to fair value. The calculations above include the financial results of Maxim prospectively from the Acquisition Date. The increase in accounts receivable for fiscal 2022 compared to fiscal 2021 was primarily the result of variations in the timing of collections and billings and increased revenue levels.Inventory increased in fiscal 2022 as compared to fiscal 2021, primarily as a result of our efforts to balance manufacturing production, demand and inventory levels. Our inventory levels are impacted by our need to support forecasted sales demand and variations between those forecasts and actual demand. As of October 30, 2021, our inventory balance also included additional costs related to the Acquisition as a result of accounting for acquired inventory at fair-value. Current liabilities decreased to $2,442.7 million at October 29, 2022 from $2,770.3 million recorded at the end of fiscal 2021, primarily due to early termination of debt, partially offset by higher accounts payable and accruals.Revolving Credit Facility Our Third Amended and Restated Revolving Credit Agreement, dated as of June 23, 2021, with Bank of America N.A. as administrative agent and the other banks identified therein as lenders (Revolving Credit Agreement) amended and restated our Second Amended and Restated Credit Agreement dated as of June 28, 2019 and provides for a five year unsecured revolving credit facility in an aggregate principal amount not to exceed $2.5 billion (subject to certain terms and conditions). We may borrow under this revolving credit facility in the future and use the proceeds for repayment of existing indebtedness, stock repurchases, acquisitions, capital expenditures, working capital and other lawful corporate purposes. The terms of the Revolving Credit Agreement impose restrictions on our ability to undertake certain transactions, to create certain liens on assets and to incur certain subsidiary indebtedness. In addition, the Revolving Credit Agreement contains a consolidated leverage ratio covenant of total consolidated funded debt to consolidated earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA) of not greater than 3.5 to 1.0. As of October 29, 2022, we were in compliance with these covenants. See Note 13, Revolving Credit Facility, of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements contained in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further information on our revolving credit facility.34DebtAs of October 29, 2022, we had approximately $6.5 billion of carrying value outstanding on our debt. The difference in the carrying value of the debt and the principal is due to the unamortized discount and issuance fees and other adjustments on these instruments. The indentures governing certain of our debt instruments contain covenants that may limit our ability to: incur, create, assume or guarantee any debt or borrowed money secured by a lien upon a principal property; enter into sale and lease-back transactions with respect to a principal property; and consolidate with or merge into, or transfer or lease all or substantially all of our assets to, any other party. As of October 29, 2022, we were compliant with these covenants. See Note 14, Debt of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements contained in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further information on our outstanding debt.Stock Repurchase ProgramOur common stock repurchase program has been in place since August 2004. Since inception, our Board of Directors has authorized us to repurchase $16.7 billion of our common stock under the program, which includes the $8.5 billion authorization approved by the Board of Directors on August 25, 2021. Under the program, we may repurchase outstanding shares of our common stock from time to time in the open market and through privately negotiated transactions. Unless terminated earlier by resolution of our Board of Directors, the repurchase program will expire when we have repurchased all shares authorized under the program. As of October 29, 2022, $4.9 billion remained available for repurchase under the current authorized program. The repurchased shares are held as authorized but unissued shares of common stock. We also repurchase shares in settlement of employee tax withholding obligations due upon the vesting of restricted stock units/awards or the exercise of stock options. Future repurchases of common stock will be dependent upon our financial position, results of operations, outlook, liquidity, and other factors we deem relevant. Capital ExpendituresNet additions to property, plant and equipment were $699.3 million in fiscal 2022 and were funded with a combination of cash on hand and cash generated from operations. We expect capital expenditures for fiscal 2023 to be between 6% and 8% of revenue, which is above our historical levels primarily due to our plans to continue to expand internal manufacturing capacity. These capital expenditures will be funded with a combination of cash on hand and cash expected to be generated from future operations, together with existing and anticipated available short- and long-term financing. DividendsOn November 21, 2022, our Board of Directors declared a cash dividend of $0.76 per outstanding share of common stock. The dividend will be paid on December 15, 2022 to all shareholders of record at the close of business on December 5, 2022 and is expected to total approximately $387.1 million. We currently expect quarterly dividends to continue in future periods, although they remain subject to determination and declaration by our Board of Directors. The payment of future dividends, if any, will be based on several factors, including our financial performance, outlook and liquidity.Contractual ObligationsThe table below summarizes our material contractual obligations in specified periods as of October 29, 2022: Payment due by period Less than More than(thousands)Total1 Year1-3 Years3-5 Years5 YearsDebt obligations (1)$6,576,865 $— $900,000 $1,400,000 $4,276,865 Interest payments associated with debt obligations2,446,434 198,459 373,706 323,989 1,550,280 Transition tax (2)656,070 127,008 529,062 — — Operating leases (3)454,543 31,199 131,498 113,183 178,663 Inventory-related purchase commitments (4)428,352 130,069 168,817 64,364 65,102 Total$10,562,264 $486,735 $2,103,083 $1,901,536 $6,070,910 _______________________________________(1)Debt obligations are assumed to be held to maturity. (2)Tax obligation relates to the one-time tax on deemed repatriated earnings under the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 enacted in fiscal 2018.(3)Certain of our operating lease obligations include escalation clauses. These escalating payment requirements are reflected in the table.(4)We have supplier commitments for the purchase of materials and supplies in advance or with minimum purchase quantities. As of October 29, 2022, our total liabilities associated with uncertain tax positions was $194.4 million, which are 35included in non-current income taxes payable in our Consolidated Balance Sheets contained in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Due to the complexity associated with our tax uncertainties, we cannot make a reasonably reliable estimate of the period in which we expect to settle the non-current liabilities associated with these uncertain tax positions. Therefore, we have not included these uncertain tax positions in the above contractual obligations table.New Accounting PronouncementsFrom time to time, new accounting pronouncements are issued by the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) and are adopted by us as of the specified effective date. Unless otherwise discussed, management believes that the impact of recently issued standards will not have a material impact on our future financial condition and results of operations. See Note 2s, New Accounting Pronouncements, of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements contained in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for a description of recently issued and adopted accounting pronouncements, including the dates of adoption and impact on our historical financial condition and results of operations.Critical Accounting Policies and EstimatesManagement’s discussion and analysis of the financial condition and results of operations is based upon the Consolidated Financial Statements, which have been prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue and expenses, and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. We base our estimates and judgments on historical experience, knowledge of current conditions and beliefs of what could occur in the future based on available information. We consider the following accounting policies to be both those most important to the portrayal of our financial condition and those that require the most subjective judgment. If actual results differ significantly from management’s estimates and projections, there could be a material effect on our financial statements. We also have other policies that we consider key accounting policies; however, the application of these policies does not require us to make significant estimates or judgments that are difficult or subjective.Revenue RecognitionRecognition of revenue occurs when a customer obtains control of promised goods or services in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the providing entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. We recognize revenue upon transfer of control of promised products or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration that we expect to receive in exchange for those products or services. We recognize revenue when all of the following criteria are met: (1) we have entered into a binding agreement, (2) the performance obligations have been identified, (3) the transaction price to the customer has been determined, (4) the transaction price has been allocated to the performance obligations in the contract, and (5) the performance obligations have been satisfied. The majority of our shipping terms permit us to recognize revenue at point of shipment or delivery. Certain shipping terms require the goods to be through customs or be received by the customer before title passes. In those instances, we defer the revenue recognized until title has passed. Shipping costs are charged to selling, marketing, general and administrative expense as incurred. Sales taxes are excluded from revenue.Revenue from contracts with the United States government, government prime contractors and certain commercial customers is recorded over time using either units delivered or costs incurred as the measurement basis for progress toward completion. These measures are used to measure results directly and is generally the best measure of progress toward completion in circumstances in which a reliable measure of output can be established. Estimated revenue in excess of amounts billed is reported as unbilled receivables. Contract accounting requires judgment in estimating costs and assumptions related to technical issues and delivery schedule. Contract costs include material, subcontract costs, labor and an allocation of indirect costs. The estimation of costs at completion of a contract is subject to numerous variables involving contract costs and estimates as to the length of time to complete the contract. Changes in contract performance, estimated gross margin, including the impact of final contract settlements, and estimated losses are recognized in the period in which the changes or losses are determined.Performance Obligations: Substantially all of our contracts with customers contain a single performance obligation, the sale of mixed-signal integrated circuit (IC) products. Such sales represent a single performance obligation because the sale is one type of good or includes multiple goods that are neither capable of being distinct nor separable from the other promises in the contract. This performance obligation is satisfied when control of the product is transferred to the customer, which occurs upon shipment or delivery. Unsatisfied performance obligations primarily represent contracts for products with future delivery dates and with an original expected duration of one year or less. We generally warrant that our products will meet their published specifications, and that we will repair or replace defective products, for one year from the date title passes from us to the customer. Specific accruals are recorded for known product warranty issues. Transaction Price: The transaction price reflects our expectations about the consideration we will be entitled to receive from the customer and may include fixed or variable amounts. Fixed consideration primarily includes sales to direct customers and sales to distributors in which both the sale to the distributor and the sale to the end customer occur within the same reporting period. Variable consideration includes sales in which the amount of consideration that we will receive is unknown as 36of the end of a reporting period. The vast majority of such consideration are credits issued to the distributor due to price protection, but also include sales made to distributors under agreements that allow certain rights of return, referred to as stock rotation. Price protection represents price discounts granted to certain distributors to allow the distributor to earn an appropriate margin on sales negotiated with certain customers and in the event of a price decrease subsequent to the date the product was shipped and billed to the distributor. Stock rotation allows distributors limited levels of returns in order to reduce the amounts of slow-moving, discontinued or obsolete product from their inventory. A liability for distributor credits covering variable consideration is made based on management's estimate of historical experience rates as well as considering economic conditions and contractual terms. To date, actual distributor claims activity has been materially consistent with the provisions we have made based on our historical estimates.Contract Balances: Accounts receivable represents our unconditional right to receive consideration from our customers. Payments are typically due within 30 to 45 days of invoicing and do not include a significant financing component. To date, there have been no material impairment losses on accounts receivable. There were no material contract assets or contract liabilities recorded on the Consolidated Balance Sheets in any of the periods presented.Inventory ValuationWe value inventories at the lower of cost (first-in, first-out method) or net realizable value. Because of the cyclical nature of the semiconductor industry, changes in inventory levels, obsolescence of technology, and product life cycles, we write down inventories to net realizable value. We employ a variety of methodologies to determine the net realizable value of inventory. While a portion of the calculation is determined via reference to the age of inventory and lower of cost or net realizable value calculations, an element of the calculation is subject to significant judgments made by us about future demand for our inventory. If actual demand for our products is less than our estimates, additional adjustments to existing inventories may need to be recorded in future periods. To date, our actual results have not been materially different than our estimates.Long-Lived AssetsWe review property, plant, and equipment and intangible assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of assets may not be recoverable. Recoverability of these assets is determined by comparison of their carrying value to the estimated future undiscounted cash flows that the assets are expected to generate over their remaining estimated lives. If such assets are considered to be impaired, the impairment to be recognized in earnings equals the amount by which the carrying value of the assets exceeds their fair value determined by either a quoted market price, if any, or a value determined by utilizing a discounted cash flow technique. Material impairment adjustments related to our property, plant, and equipment are reflected in our financial statements for the periods presented. Any deterioration in our business in the future could lead to such impairment adjustments in future periods. Evaluation of impairment of long-lived assets requires estimates of future operating results that are used in the preparation of the expected future undiscounted cash flows. Actual future operating results and the remaining economic lives of our long-lived assets could differ from the estimates used in assessing the recoverability of these assets. These differences could result in impairment charges, which could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations. In addition, in certain instances, assets may not be impaired but their estimated useful lives may have decreased. In these situations, we amortize the remaining net book values over the revised useful lives. GoodwillGoodwill is subject to impairment tests annually or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances suggest that the carrying value of goodwill may not be recoverable, utilizing either the qualitative or quantitative method. We test goodwill for impairment at the reporting unit level, which we determined is consistent with our identified operating segments, on an annual basis on the first day of the fourth quarter (on or about July 31) or more frequently if we believe indicators of impairment exist or we reorganize our operating segments or reporting units. We have the option to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its net book value. When using the qualitative method, we consider several factors, including the following:–the amount by which the fair values of each reporting unit exceeded their carrying values as of the date of the most recent quantitative impairment analysis, which indicated there would need to be substantial negative developments in the markets in which these reporting units operate in order for there to be potential impairment;–the carrying values of these reporting units as of the assessment date compared to their previously calculated fair values as of the date of the most recent quantitative impairment analysis;–the current forecasts as compared to the forecasts included in the most recent quantitative impairment analysis;–public information from competitors and other industry information to determine if there were any significant adverse trends in our competitors' businesses;37–changes in the value of major U.S. stock indices that could suggest declines in overall market stability that could impact the valuation of our reporting units;–changes in our market capitalization and overall enterprise valuation to determine if there were any significant decreases that could be an indication that the valuation of our reporting units had significantly decreased; and–whether there had been any significant increases to the weighted-average cost of capital rates for each reporting unit, which could materially lower our prior valuation conclusions under a discounted cash flow approach.If we elect not to use this option, or we determine that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its net book value, then we perform the quantitative goodwill impairment test. The quantitative goodwill impairment test requires an entity to compare the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying amount. If fair value is determined to be less than carrying value, an impairment loss is recognized for the amount of the carrying value that exceeds the amount of the reporting unit's fair value, not to exceed the total amount of goodwill allocated to the reporting unit. Additionally, we consider income tax effects from any tax deductible goodwill on the carrying amount of the reporting unit when measuring the goodwill impairment loss, if applicable. We determine the fair value of our reporting units using a weighting of the income and market approaches. Under the income approach, we use a discounted cash flow methodology which requires management to make significant estimates and assumptions related to forecasted revenues, gross profit margins, operating income margins, working capital cash flow, perpetual growth rates, and long-term discount rates, among others. For the market approach, we use the guideline public company method. Under this method we utilize information from comparable publicly traded companies with similar operating and investment characteristics as the reporting units, to create valuation multiples that are applied to the operating performance of the reporting unit being tested, in order to obtain their respective fair values. In order to assess the reasonableness of the calculated reporting unit fair values, we reconcile the aggregate fair values of our reporting units determined, as described above, to our total company market capitalization, allowing for a reasonable control premium. In fiscal 2022, we used a combination of the qualitative and quantitative methods of assessing goodwill for our reporting units. In fiscal 2021, we used the quantitative method of assessing goodwill for all reporting units. In all periods presented, we concluded the reporting units' fair values exceeded their carrying amounts as of the assessment dates and no risk of impairment existed.Business CombinationsUnder the acquisition method of accounting, we recognize tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their estimated fair values. We record the excess of the fair value of the purchase consideration over the value of the net assets acquired as goodwill. The accounting for business combinations requires us to make significant estimates and assumptions, especially with respect to intangible assets and the fair value of contingent payment obligations. Critical estimates in valuing purchased technology, customer lists and other identifiable intangible assets include future cash flows that we expect to generate from the acquired assets. If the subsequent actual results and updated projections of the underlying business activity change compared with the assumptions and projections used to develop these values, we could experience impairment charges which could be material. In addition, we have estimated the economic lives of certain acquired assets and these lives are used to calculate depreciation and amortization expense. If our estimates of the economic lives change, depreciation or amortization expenses could be accelerated or slowed.We record contingent consideration resulting from a business combination at its fair value on the acquisition date. We generally determine the fair value of the contingent consideration using the income approach methodology of valuation. Each reporting period thereafter, we revalue these obligations and record increases or decreases in their fair value as an adjustment to operating expenses within the Consolidated Statements of Income. Changes in the fair value of the contingent consideration can result from changes in assumed discount periods and rates, and from changes pertaining to the achievement of the defined milestones. Significant judgment is employed in determining the appropriateness of these assumptions as of the acquisition date and for each subsequent period. Accordingly, future business and economic conditions, as well as changes in any of the assumptions described above, can materially impact the amount of contingent consideration expense we record in any given period.38Accounting for Income TaxesWe make certain estimates and judgments in determining income tax expense for financial statement purposes. These estimates and judgments occur in the calculation of income tax credits, benefits, and deductions, and in the calculation of certain tax assets and liabilities, which arise from differences in the timing of the recognition of certain expenses for tax and financial statement purposes. We assess the likelihood of the realization of deferred tax assets and record a corresponding valuation allowance as necessary if we determine those deferred tax assets may not be realized due to the uncertainty of the timing and amount to be realized of certain state and international tax credit carryovers. In reaching our conclusion, we evaluate certain relevant criteria including the existence of deferred tax liabilities that can be used to realize deferred tax assets, the taxable income in prior carryback years in the impacted state and international jurisdictions that can be used to absorb net operating losses and taxable income in future years. Our judgments regarding future profitability may change due to future market conditions, changes in U.S. or international tax laws and other factors. These changes, if any, may require material adjustments to these deferred tax assets, which may result in an increase or decrease to our income tax provision in future periods.We account for uncertain tax positions by first determining if it is “more likely than not” that a tax position will be sustained by the appropriate taxing authorities prior to recording any benefit in the financial statements. An uncertain income tax position is not recognized if it has less than a 50% likelihood of being sustained. For those tax positions where it is more likely than not that a tax position will be sustained, we have recorded the largest amount of tax benefit with a greater than 50% likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement with a taxing authority that has full knowledge of all relevant information. For those income tax positions where it is not more likely than not that a tax benefit will be sustained, no tax benefit has been recognized in the financial statements. We classify interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions within the provision for (benefit from) income taxes line of the Consolidated Statements of Income. We reevaluate these uncertain tax positions on a quarterly basis. This evaluation is based on factors including, but not limited to, changes in known facts or circumstances, changes in tax law, effectively settled issues under audit, and new guidance on legislative interpretations. A change in these factors could result in the recognition of an increase or decrease to our income tax provision, which could materially impact our consolidated financial position and results of operations.In the ordinary course of global business, there are many transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax outcome is uncertain. Some of these uncertainties arise as a consequence of cost reimbursement and royalty arrangements among related entities. Although we believe our estimates are reasonable, no assurance can be given that the final tax outcome of these matters will not be different than that which is reflected in our historical income tax provisions and income tax liabilities. In the event our assumptions are incorrect, the differences could have a material impact on our income tax provision and operating results in the period in which such determination is made. In addition to the factors described above, our current and expected effective tax rate is based on then-current tax law. Significant changes during the year in enacted tax law could affect these estimates.See Note 12, Income Taxes, of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements contained in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further discussion.Stock-Based CompensationStock-based compensation expense associated with stock options and related awards is recognized in the Consolidated Statements of Income. Determining the amount of stock-based compensation to be recorded requires us to develop estimates to be used in calculating the grant-date fair value of stock options, restricted stock units and market-based and/or performance-based restricted stock units. We calculate the grant-date fair values of stock options using the Black-Scholes valuation model. The grant-date fair value of restricted stock units with a service condition and restricted stock units with both service and performance conditions is calculated using the value of our common stock on the date of grant, reduced by the present value of dividends expected to be paid on our common stock prior to vesting. For restricted stock units with both service and performance conditions, this grant-date fair value is also impacted by the number of units that are expected to vest during the performance period and is adjusted through the related stock-based compensation expense at each reporting period based on the probability of achievement of that performance condition. If we determine that an award is unlikely to vest, any previously recorded stock-based compensation expense is reversed in the period of that determination. The grant date fair value of restricted stock units and performance-based stock options with both service and market conditions are calculated using the Monte Carlo simulation model to estimate the probability of satisfying the performance condition stipulated in the award grant, including the possibility that the market condition may not be satisfied.The use of valuation models requires us to make estimates of key assumptions such as expected volatility, expected term, risk-free interest rate, expected dividend yield, forfeiture rate and others. The estimate of these key assumptions is based on historical information and judgment regarding market factors and trends. We recognize the expense related to equity awards on a straight-line basis over the vesting period. See Note 2r, Stock-based Compensation, and Note 3, Stock-Based Compensation and Shareholders' Equity, of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements contained in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for more information related to stock-based compensation.39ContingenciesFrom time to time, in the ordinary course of business, various claims, charges and litigation are asserted or commenced against us arising from, or related to, among other things, contractual matters, patents, trademarks, personal injury, environmental matters, product liability, insurance coverage, employment or employment benefits. We periodically assess each matter to determine if a contingent liability should be recorded. In making this determination, we may, depending on the nature of the matter, consult with internal and external legal counsel and technical experts. Based on the information we obtain, combined with our judgment regarding all the facts and circumstances of each matter, we determine whether it is probable that a contingent loss may be incurred and whether the amount of such loss can be reasonably estimated. If a loss is probable and reasonably estimable, we record a contingent loss. In determining the amount of a contingent loss, we consider advice received from experts in the specific matter, current status of legal proceedings, settlement negotiations that may be ongoing, prior case history and other factors. If the judgments and estimates made by us are incorrect, we may need to record additional contingent losses that could materially adversely impact our results of operations.40 ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISKInterest Rate ExposureOur interest income and expense are sensitive to changes in the general level of interest rates. In this regard, changes in interest rates affect the interest earned or paid on our marketable securities and debt, as well as the fair value of our investments and debt.Based on the $500.0 million of our floating rate debt outstanding as of October 29, 2022, our annual interest expense would change by approximately $5.0 million for each 100 basis point increase in interest rates. Based on our cash and marketable securities outstanding as of October 29, 2022 and October 30, 2021, our annual interest income would change by approximately $14.7 million and $19.7 million, respectively, for each 100 basis point increase in interest rates.To provide a meaningful assessment of the interest rate risk associated with our investment portfolio, we performed a sensitivity analysis to determine the impact a change in interest rates would have on the value of our investment portfolio assuming an immediate 100 basis point parallel shift in the yield curve. Based on investment positions as of October 29, 2022 and October 30, 2021, a hypothetical 100 basis point increase in interest rates across all maturities would not materially impact the fair market value of the portfolio in either period. If significant, such losses would only be realized if we sold the investments prior to maturity.As of October 29, 2022, we had $6.6 billion in principal amount of senior unsecured notes outstanding, with a fair value of $5.5 billion. The fair value of our notes is subject to interest rate risk, market risk, and other factors. Generally, the fair value of our notes will increase as interest rates fall and decrease as interest rates rise. The fair values of our notes as of October 29, 2022 and October 30, 2021, assuming a hypothetical 100 basis point increase in market interest rates, are as follows:October 29, 2022October 30, 2021(thousands)Principal Amount OutstandingFair Value Fair Value given an increase in interest rates of 100 basis pointsPrincipal Amount OutstandingFair Value Fair Value given an increase in interest rates of 100 basis pointsMaxim 2023 Notes, due March 2023$— $— $— $500,000 $520,236 $513,273 2024 Notes, due October 2024500,000 491,982 483,035 500,000 500,482 486,201 2025 Notes, due April 2025400,000 383,378 374,686 400,000 423,265 409,725 2026 Notes, due December 2026900,000 851,479 820,203 900,000 986,243 941,160 Maxim 2027 Notes, due June 202759,788 54,771 52,534 500,000 542,942 515,866 2027 Notes, due June 2027440,212 410,091 393,294 — — — 2028 Notes, due October 2028750,000 621,093 588,044 750,000 743,109 696,554 2031 Notes, due October 20311,000,000 786,772 727,579 1,000,000 996,702 912,196 2032 Notes, due October 2032300,000 278,359 257,337 — — — 2036 Notes, due December 2036144,278 126,274 114,389 144,278 176,960 158,110 2041 Notes, due October 2041750,000 513,709 450,337 750,000 758,246 652,754 2045 Notes, due December 2045332,587 313,931 276,820 332,587 469,592 404,287 2051 Notes, due October 20511,000,000 640,766 545,958 1,000,000 1,029,830 848,513 Foreign Currency ExposureAs more fully described in Note 2i, Derivative and Hedging Agreements, of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements contained in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, we regularly hedge our non-U.S. dollar-based exposures by entering into forward foreign currency exchange contracts. The terms of these contracts are for periods matching the duration of the underlying exposure and generally range from one to twelve months. Currently, our largest foreign currency exposure is the Euro, primarily because our European operations have the highest proportion of our local currency denominated expenses. Relative to the net unhedged foreign currency exposures existing at October 29, 2022 and October 30, 2021, an immediate 10% unfavorable movement in foreign currency exchange rates would result in approximately $69.5 million of losses and $39.5 million of losses, respectively, in changes in earnings or cash flows over the course of the year.41The market risk associated with our derivative instruments results from currency exchange rates that are expected to offset the market risk of the underlying transactions, assets and liabilities being hedged. The counterparties to the agreements relating to our foreign exchange instruments consist of a number of major international financial institutions with high credit ratings. Based on the credit ratings of our counterparties as of October 29, 2022, we do not believe that there is significant risk of nonperformance by them. While the contract or notional amounts of derivative financial instruments provide one measure of the volume of these transactions, they do not represent the amount of our exposure to credit risk. The amounts potentially subject to credit risk (arising from the possible inability of counterparties to meet the terms of their contracts) are generally limited to the amounts, if any, by which the counterparties’ obligations under the contracts exceed our obligations to the counterparties.The following table illustrates the effect that an immediate 10% unfavorable or favorable movement in foreign currency exchange rates, relative to the U.S. dollar, would have on the fair value of our forward exchange contracts as of October 29, 2022 and October 30, 2021:October 29, 2022October 30, 2021Fair value of forward exchange contracts$(16,984)$(8,085)Fair value of forward exchange contracts after a 10% unfavorable movement in foreign currency exchange rates asset$21,193 $26,673 Fair value of forward exchange contracts after a 10% favorable movement in foreign currency exchange rates liability$(51,604)$(41,034)The calculation assumes that each exchange rate would change in the same direction relative to the U.S. dollar. In addition to the direct effects of changes in exchange rates, such changes typically affect the volume of sales or the foreign currency sales price as competitors’ products become more or less attractive. Our sensitivity analysis of the effects of changes in foreign currency exchange rates does not factor in a potential change in sales levels or local currency selling prices.42REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRMTo the Shareholders and the Board of Directors of Analog Devices, Inc.Opinion on the Financial StatementsWe have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Analog Devices, Inc. (the Company) as of October 29, 2022 and October 30, 2021, the related consolidated statements of income, comprehensive income, shareholders' equity and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended October 29, 2022, and the related notes and financial statement schedule listed in the Index at Item 15(a)(2) (collectively referred to as the “consolidated financial statements”). In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company at October 29, 2022 and October 30, 2021, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended October 29, 2022, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of October 29, 2022, based on criteria established in Internal Control-Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework), and our report dated November 22, 2022 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.Basis for Opinion These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.Critical Audit Matter The critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current period audit of the financial statements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective or complex judgments. The communication of the critical audit matter does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the account or disclosure to which it relates.Revenue Recognition – Measuring Price Protection CreditsDescription of the MatterAs described in Note 2n to the consolidated financial statements, the Company's sales contracts provide certain distributors with credits for price protection and rights of return, which results in variable consideration. During 2022, sales to distributors were $7.5 billion net of expected price protection credits and rights of return for which the liability balance as of October 29, 2022 was $749.4 million, of which the vast majority relates to the price protection credits.Auditing the Company's measurement for price protection credits under distributor contracts involved especially challenging judgment because the calculation involves subjective management assumptions about estimates of expected price protection credits. For example, estimated price protection credits included in the transaction price reflects management's evaluation of contractual terms, historical experience and assumptions about future economic conditions. Changes in those assumptions can have a material effect on the amount recognized for price protection credits.43How We Addressed the Matter in Our AuditWe obtained an understanding, evaluated the design and tested the operating effectiveness of controls over the Company's process to calculate the price protection credits. For example, we tested controls over the appropriateness of assumptions management used as well as controls over the completeness and accuracy of the data underlying estimates of expected price protection credits.Our audit procedures included, among others, inspecting contractual terms in distributor agreements and testing the underlying data used in management’s calculation for completeness and accuracy as well as evaluating the significant assumptions used in the estimation of the price protection credits. We evaluated the Company’s methods and assumptions used in the estimates, which included comparing the assumptions to historical trends. We inspected and tested the results of the Company's retrospective review analysis of actual price protection credits claimed by distributors, evaluated the estimates made based on historical experience and performed sensitivity analyses of the Company’s significant assumptions to assess the impact on the price protection credits. We also evaluated whether the Company appropriately considered new information that could significantly change the estimated future price protection credits./s/ Ernst & Young LLPWe have served as the Company’s auditor since 1967.

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (all tabular amounts in thousands except per share amounts)The following discussion includes results of operations and financial condition for the fiscal year ended October 28, 2023 (fiscal 2023) and the fiscal year ended October 29, 2022 (fiscal 2022) and year-over-year comparisons between fiscal 2023 and fiscal 2022. For discussion on results of operations and financial condition for fiscal 2022 and the fiscal year ended October 30, 2021 (fiscal 2021) and year-over-year comparisons between fiscal 2022 and fiscal 2021, please refer to Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations in Part II, Item 7 of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for fiscal 2022 filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on November 22, 2022. Our fiscal year is the 52-week or 53-week period ending on the Saturday closest to the last day in October. Fiscal 2023 and fiscal 2022 were 52-week fiscal periods. Results of OperationsOverview Fiscal Year2023 over 2022 20232022 $ Change% ChangeRevenue$12,305,539 $12,013,953 $291,586 2 %Gross margin %64.0 %62.7 %Net income$3,314,579 $2,748,561 $566,018 21 %Net income as a % of revenue26.9 %22.9 %Diluted EPS$6.55 $5.25 $1.30 25 %Revenue Trends by End MarketThe following table summarizes revenue by end market. The categorization of revenue by end market is determined using a variety of data points including the technical characteristics of the product, the “sold to” customer information, the ""ship to"" customer information and the end customer product or application into which our product will be incorporated. As data systems for capturing and tracking this data and our methodology evolves and improves, the categorization of products by end market can vary over time. When this occurs, we reclassify revenue by end market for prior periods. Such reclassifications typically do not materially change the sizing of, or the underlying trends of results within, each end market. Fiscal 2023Fiscal 2022Revenue% ofTotalRevenue (1)Y/Y%Revenue% ofTotalRevenue (1)Industrial$6,555,222 53 %6 %$6,186,114 51 %Automotive2,915,199 24 %19 %2,442,705 20 %Communications1,619,517 13 %(13)%1,863,156 16 %Consumer1,215,601 10 %(20)%1,521,978 13 %Total Revenue$12,305,539 100 %2 %$12,013,953 100 %_______________________________________(1)The sum of the individual percentages may not equal the total due to rounding.Revenue increased 2% in fiscal 2023 as compared to fiscal 2022 primarily as a result of broad-based demand for our products sold into the Industrial end market, namely aerospace and defense and instrumentation, as well as the Automotive end market, namely cabin electronics and battery management systems. These increases were partially offset by a decrease in revenue in the Consumer end market primarily due to weakening market trends and a decrease in revenue in the Communications end market due to the timing of infrastructure deployment cycles.Revenue by Sales ChannelThe following table summarizes revenue by sales channel. We sell our products globally through a direct sales force, third party distributors, independent sales representatives and via our website. Distributors are customers that buy products with the intention of reselling them. Direct customers are non-distributor customers and consist primarily of original equipment manufacturers (OEMs). Other customers include the U.S. government, government prime contractors and certain commercial customers for which revenue is recorded over time. 28Fiscal 2023Fiscal 2022Revenue% ofTotalRevenue (1)Revenue% ofTotalRevenue (1)Distributors$7,534,894 61 %$7,458,478 62 %Direct customers4,603,166 37 %4,423,883 37 %Other167,479 1 %131,592 1 %Total Revenue$12,305,539 100 %$12,013,953 100 %_______________________________________(1)The sum of the individual percentages may not equal the total due to rounding.As indicated in the table above, the percentage of total revenue sold via each channel has remained relatively consistent in the periods presented, but can fluctuate from time to time based on end customer demand.Revenue Trends by Geographic RegionRevenue by geographic region, based upon the geographic location of the distributors or OEMs who purchased the Company's products, for fiscal 2023 and fiscal 2022 was as follows:Fiscal Year2023 over 202220232022 $ Change% Change (1)United States$4,165,296 $4,025,398 $139,898 3 %Rest of North and South America88,579 72,497 16,082 22 %Europe3,001,871 2,534,423 467,448 18 %Japan1,397,119 1,221,549 175,570 14 %China2,229,631 2,563,536 (333,905)(13)%Rest of Asia1,423,043 1,596,550 (173,507)(11)%Total Revenue$12,305,539 $12,013,953 $291,586 2 %_______________________________________(1)The sum of the individual percentages may not equal the total due to rounding.In all periods presented, the predominant regions comprising “Rest of North and South America” are Canada and Mexico; the predominant regions comprising “Europe” are Germany, Sweden and the Netherlands; and the predominant regions comprising “Rest of Asia” are Taiwan, Malaysia, South Korea and Singapore.Total revenue increased in fiscal 2023 as compared to fiscal 2022 due to the revenue trends discussed above, partially offset by weaker customer demand in China and Rest of Asia primarily due to deteriorating macroeconomic conditions in those regions.

Fiscal 2022 included $271.4 million of additional cost of goods sold that did not repeat in fiscal 2023 related to a nonrecurring fair value adjustment recorded to inventory. This increase in gross margin percentage was partially offset by lower utilization of our factories due to decreasing customer demand during fiscal 2023.Research and Development (R&D) Fiscal Year2023 over 2022 20232022$ Change% ChangeR&D expenses$1,660,194 $1,700,518 $(40,324)(2)%R&D expenses as a % of revenue13 %14 %R&D expenses decreased in fiscal 2023 as compared to fiscal 2022 primarily as a result of lower employee related variable compensation expenses, partially offset by higher salary and benefit expenses.29R&D expenses as a percentage of revenue will fluctuate from year-to-year depending on the amount of revenue and the success of new product development efforts, which we view as critical to our future growth. We expect to continue the development of innovative technologies and processes for new products. We believe that a continued commitment to R&D is essential to maintain product leadership with our existing products as well as to provide innovative new product offerings.

The Q4 2023 Plan, consisting of voluntary and involuntary reductions-in-force, and other cost-savings initiatives, was commenced to adjust our cost structure and business activities to better align with weaker market demand and continued economic uncertainty in our end markets, as well as make certain strategic shifts in our workforce necessary to achieve our long-term vision.

For fiscal 2023 and fiscal 2022 our pretax income was primarily generated in Ireland at a tax rate of 12.5%. Our effective tax rate for fiscal 2023 also included the effects of the mandatory capitalization and amortization of research and development expenses which began in fiscal 2023 under the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017. The mandatory capitalization requirement decreased our effective tax rate primarily by increasing the foreign-derived intangible income deduction. Our effective tax rate for fiscal 2023 was also impacted by a discrete income tax benefit recorded of $81.7 million resulting from the approval granted by the Joint Committee on Taxation of our federal corporate income tax relief claim which reduced the amount of transition tax owed under the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017.See Note 12, Income Taxes, of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements contained in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further discussion. Net Income Fiscal Year2023 over 2022 20232022$ Change% ChangeNet income$3,314,579 $2,748,561 $566,018 21 %Net income, as a % of revenue26.9 %22.9 %Diluted EPS$6.55 $5.25 $1.30 25 %The increase in net income in fiscal 2023 as compared to fiscal 2022 was a result of a $544.4 million increase in operating income and a $56.8 million decrease in provision for income taxes, partially offset by a $35.2 million increase in nonoperating expense, as more fully described above under the headings Operating Income, Provision for (Benefit From) Income Taxes and Nonoperating (Income) Expense.Liquidity and Capital ResourcesAt October 28, 2023, our principal source of liquidity was $958.1 million of cash and cash equivalents, of which approximately $201.1 million was held in the United States and the balance of our cash and cash equivalents was held outside the United States in various foreign subsidiaries. We manage our worldwide cash requirements by, among other things, reviewing available funds held by our foreign subsidiaries and the cost effectiveness by which those funds can be accessed in the United States. We do not expect current regulatory restrictions or taxes on repatriation to have a material adverse effect on our overall liquidity, financial condition or results of operations. Our cash and cash equivalents consist of highly liquid investments with maturities of three months or less, including money market funds. We maintain these balances with counterparties with high credit ratings, and continually monitor the amount of credit exposure to any one issuer and diversify our investments in order to minimize our credit risk.We believe that our existing sources of liquidity and cash expected to be generated from future operations, together with existing and anticipated available short- and long-term financing, will be sufficient to fund operations, capital expenditures, research and development efforts and dividend payments (if any) in the immediate future and for at least the next twelve months. Fiscal Year 20232022Net cash provided by operating activities$4,817,634 $4,475,402 Net cash provided by operating activities as a % of revenue39 %37 %Net cash used for investing activities$(1,266,385)$(657,368)Net cash used for financing activities$(4,063,760)$(4,290,720)The following changes contributed to the net change in cash and cash equivalents from fiscal 2022 to fiscal 2023. 31Operating ActivitiesCash provided by operating activities is net income adjusted for certain non-cash items and changes in assets and liabilities. The increase in cash provided by operating activities during fiscal 2023 as compared to fiscal 2022 was primarily a result of higher net income adjusted for noncash items offset by changes in working capital. Investing ActivitiesInvesting cash flows generally consist of capital expenditures and cash used for acquisitions. The increase in cash used for investing activities during fiscal 2023 as compared to fiscal 2022 was primarily the result of an increase in cash used for capital expenditures.Financing ActivitiesFinancing cash flows generally consist of payments of dividends to shareholders, repurchases of common stock, issuance and repayment of debt and proceeds from the sale of shares of common stock pursuant to employee equity incentive plans. The decrease in cash used for financing activities during fiscal 2023 as compared to fiscal 2022 was primarily the result of the net proceeds from the issuance of commercial paper notes during fiscal 2023 and lower debt repayments, partially offset by higher common stock repurchases.Working Capital Fiscal Year 20232022$ Change% ChangeAccounts receivable, net$1,469,734 $1,800,462 $(330,728)(18)%Days sales outstanding (1)48 50 Inventory$1,642,214 $1,399,914 $242,300 17 %Days cost of sales in inventory (1)125 106 _______________________________________(1)We use the average of the current year and prior year ending net accounts receivable and ending inventory balance in our calculation of days sales outstanding and days cost of sales in inventory, respectively. Cost of sales amounts used in the calculation of days cost of sales in inventory include accounting adjustments related to amortization of developed technology intangible assets acquired and depreciation related to the write-up of fixed assets to fair value as a result of the acquisition of Maxim. The decrease in accounts receivable for fiscal 2023 compared to fiscal 2022 was primarily the result of variations in the timing of collections and billings and decreased revenue levels in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2023 as compared to the fourth quarter of fiscal 2022.Inventory increased in fiscal 2023 as compared to fiscal 2022, primarily as a result of our efforts to balance manufacturing production, demand and inventory levels. Our inventory levels are impacted by our need to support forecasted sales demand and variations between those forecasts and actual demand. Current liabilities increased to $3.2 billion at October 28, 2023 from $2.4 billion recorded at the end of fiscal 2022, primarily due to increases in commercial paper notes and current debt, partially offset by lower accrued liabilities.Revolving Credit Facility Our Third Amended and Restated Revolving Credit Agreement, dated as of June 23, 2021, with Bank of America N.A. as administrative agent and the other banks identified therein as lenders, which was subsequently amended on December 20, 2022 and July 24, 2023 (as amended, the Revolving Credit Agreement) provides for a five year unsecured revolving credit facility in an aggregate principal amount not to exceed $2.5 billion (subject to certain terms and conditions). We may borrow under this revolving credit facility in the future and use the proceeds for repayment of existing indebtedness, stock repurchases, acquisitions, capital expenditures, working capital and other lawful corporate purposes. The terms of the Revolving Credit Agreement impose restrictions on our ability to undertake certain transactions, to create certain liens on assets and to incur certain subsidiary indebtedness. In addition, the Revolving Credit Agreement contains a consolidated leverage ratio covenant of total consolidated funded debt to consolidated earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA) of not greater than 3.5 to 1.0. As of October 28, 2023, we were in compliance with these covenants. See Note 13, Revolving Credit Facility, of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements contained in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further information on our revolving credit facility.32DebtAs of October 28, 2023, we had approximately $6.4 billion of carrying value outstanding on our senior notes. The difference in the carrying value of the debt and the principal is due to the unamortized discount and issuance fees and other adjustments on these instruments. The indentures governing certain of our debt instruments contain covenants that may limit our ability to: incur, create, assume or guarantee any debt or borrowed money secured by a lien upon a principal property; enter into sale and lease-back transactions with respect to a principal property; and consolidate with or merge into, or transfer or lease all or substantially all of our assets to, any other party. As of October 28, 2023, we were compliant with these covenants. See Note 14, Debt of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements contained in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further information on our outstanding debt.Commercial Paper ProgramDuring fiscal 2023, we established a commercial paper program under which we may issue short-term, unsecured commercial paper notes in amounts up to a maximum aggregate face amount of $2.5 billion outstanding at any time, with maturities of up to 397 days from the date of issuance. As of October 28, 2023, we had $547.2 million of outstanding borrowings under the commercial paper program recorded in the Consolidated Balance Sheet. We intend to use the net proceeds of the commercial paper program for general corporate purposes, including without limitation, repayment of indebtedness, stock repurchases, acquisitions, capital expenditures and working capital.Stock Repurchase ProgramOur common stock repurchase program has been in place since August 2004. Since inception, our Board of Directors has authorized us to repurchase $16.7 billion of our common stock under the program, which includes the $8.5 billion authorization approved by the Board of Directors on August 25, 2021. Under the program, we may repurchase outstanding shares of our common stock from time to time in the open market and through privately negotiated transactions. Unless terminated earlier by resolution of our Board of Directors, the repurchase program will expire when we have repurchased all shares authorized under the program. As of October 28, 2023, $2.1 billion remained available for repurchase under the current authorized program. The repurchased shares are held as authorized but unissued shares of common stock. We also repurchase shares in settlement of employee tax withholding obligations due upon the vesting of restricted stock units/awards or the exercise of stock options. Future repurchases of common stock will be dependent upon our financial position, results of operations, outlook, liquidity and other factors we deem relevant.Capital ExpendituresNet additions to property, plant and equipment were $1.3 billion in fiscal 2023 as we invested to enhance our global resiliency. We expect capital expenditures for fiscal 2024 to be between approximately $600.0 million and $800.0 million. These capital expenditures will be funded with a combination of cash on hand and cash expected to be generated from future operations, together with existing and anticipated available short- and long-term financing. DividendsOn November 20, 2023, our Board of Directors declared a cash dividend of $0.86 per outstanding share of common stock. The dividend will be paid on December 14, 2023 to all shareholders of record at the close of business on December 4, 2023 and is expected to total approximately $426.8 million. We currently expect quarterly dividends to continue in future periods, although they remain subject to determination and declaration by our Board of Directors. The payment of future dividends, if any, will be based on several factors, including our financial performance, outlook and liquidity.33Contractual ObligationsThe table below summarizes our material contractual obligations in specified periods as of October 28, 2023: Payment due by period Less than More than(thousands)Total1 Year1-3 Years3-5 Years5 YearsDebt obligations (1)$7,064,301 $1,047,224 $400,000 $2,090,212 $3,526,865 Interest payments associated with debt obligations2,253,446 209,595 341,514 273,176 1,429,161 Transition tax (2)484,244 196,066 288,178 — — Operating leases (3)494,662 80,998 148,565 118,203 146,896 Inventory-related purchase commitments (4)705,607 170,042 361,255 130,977 43,333 Total$11,002,260 $1,703,925 $1,539,512 $2,612,568 $5,146,255 _______________________________________(1)Debt obligations are assumed to be held to maturity. (2)Tax obligation relates to the one-time tax on deemed repatriated earnings under the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act and includes a reduction resulting from the approval granted by the Joint Committee on Taxation of our federal corporate income tax relief claim which reduced the amount of transition tax owed.(3)Certain of our operating lease obligations include escalation clauses. These escalating payment requirements are reflected in the table.(4)We have supplier commitments for the purchase of materials and supplies in advance or with minimum purchase quantities. As of October 28, 2023, our total liabilities associated with uncertain tax positions was $186.2 million, which are included in non-current income taxes payable in our Consolidated Balance Sheets contained in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Due to the complexity associated with our tax uncertainties, we cannot make a reasonably reliable estimate of the period in which we expect to settle the non-current liabilities associated with these uncertain tax positions. Therefore, we have not included these uncertain tax positions in the above contractual obligations table.New Accounting PronouncementsFrom time to time, new accounting pronouncements are issued by the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) and are adopted by us as of the specified effective date. Unless otherwise discussed, management believes that the impact of recently issued standards will not have a material impact on our future financial condition and results of operations. See Note 2s, New Accounting Pronouncements, of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements contained in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for a description of recently issued and adopted accounting pronouncements, including the dates of adoption and impact on our historical financial condition and results of operations.Critical Accounting Policies and EstimatesManagement’s discussion and analysis of the financial condition and results of operations is based upon the Consolidated Financial Statements, which have been prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue and expenses, and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. We base our estimates and judgments on historical experience, knowledge of current conditions and beliefs of what could occur in the future based on available information. We consider the following accounting policies to be both those most important to the portrayal of our financial condition and those that require the most subjective judgment. If actual results differ significantly from management’s estimates and projections, there could be a material effect on our financial statements. We also have other policies that we consider key accounting policies; however, the application of these policies does not require us to make significant estimates or judgments that are difficult or subjective.Revenue RecognitionRecognition of revenue occurs when a customer obtains control of promised goods or services in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the providing entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. We recognize revenue upon transfer of control of promised products or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration that we expect to receive in exchange for those products or services. We recognize revenue when all of the following criteria are met: (1) we have entered into a binding agreement, (2) the performance obligations have been identified, (3) the transaction price to the customer has been determined, (4) the transaction price has been allocated to the performance obligations in the contract, and (5) the performance obligations have been satisfied. The majority of our shipping terms permit us to recognize revenue at point of shipment or delivery. Certain shipping terms require the goods to be through customs or be received by the customer before title passes. In those instances, we defer the revenue recognized until title and control of the promised goods have passed to the customer. Shipping costs are charged to selling, marketing, general and administrative expense as incurred. Sales taxes are excluded from revenue.34Revenue from contracts with the United States government, government prime contractors and certain commercial customers is recorded over time using either units delivered or costs incurred as the measurement basis for progress toward completion. These measures are used to measure results directly and is generally the best measure of progress toward completion in circumstances in which a reliable measure of output can be established. Estimated revenue in excess of amounts billed is reported as unbilled receivables. Contract accounting requires judgment in estimating costs and assumptions related to technical issues and delivery schedule. Contract costs include material, subcontract costs, labor and an allocation of indirect costs. The estimation of costs at completion of a contract is subject to numerous variables involving contract costs and estimates as to the length of time to complete the contract. Changes in contract performance, estimated gross margin, including the impact of final contract settlements, and estimated losses are recognized in the period in which the changes or losses are determined.Performance Obligations: Substantially all of our contracts with customers contain a single performance obligation, the sale of mixed-signal integrated circuit (IC) products. Such sales represent a single performance obligation because the sale is one type of good or includes multiple goods that are neither capable of being distinct nor separable from the other promises in the contract. This performance obligation is satisfied when control of the product is transferred to the customer, which occurs upon shipment or delivery. Unsatisfied performance obligations primarily represent contracts for products with future delivery dates and with an original expected duration of one year or less. We generally warrant that our products will meet their published specifications, and that we will repair or replace defective products, for one year from the date title passes from us to the customer. Specific accruals are recorded for known product warranty issues. Transaction Price: The transaction price reflects our expectations about the consideration we will be entitled to receive from the customer and may include fixed or variable amounts. Fixed consideration primarily includes sales to direct customers and sales to distributors in which both the sale to the distributor and the sale to the end customer occur within the same reporting period. Variable consideration includes sales in which the amount of consideration that we will receive is unknown as of the end of a reporting period. The vast majority of such consideration are credits issued to the distributor due to price protection, but also include sales made to distributors under agreements that allow certain rights of return, referred to as stock rotation. Price protection represents price discounts granted to certain distributors to allow the distributor to earn an appropriate margin on sales negotiated with certain customers and in the event of a price decrease subsequent to the date the product was shipped and billed to the distributor. Stock rotation allows distributors limited levels of returns in order to reduce the amounts of slow-moving, discontinued or obsolete product from their inventory. A liability for distributor credits covering variable consideration is made based on management's estimate of historical experience rates as well as considering economic conditions and contractual terms. To date, actual distributor claims activity has been materially consistent with the provisions we have made based on our historical estimates.Contract Balances: Accounts receivable represents our unconditional right to receive consideration from our customers. Payments are typically due within 30 to 45 days of invoicing and do not include a significant financing component. To date, there have been no material impairment losses on accounts receivable. There were no material contract assets or contract liabilities recorded on the Consolidated Balance Sheets in any of the periods presented.Inventory ValuationWe value inventories at the lower of cost (first-in, first-out method) or net realizable value. Because of the cyclical nature of the semiconductor industry, changes in inventory levels, obsolescence of technology, and product life cycles, we write down inventories to net realizable value. We employ a variety of methodologies to determine the net realizable value of inventory. While a portion of the calculation is determined via reference to the age of inventory and lower of cost or net realizable value calculations, an element of the calculation is subject to significant judgments made by us about future demand for our inventory. If actual demand for our products is less than our estimates, additional adjustments to existing inventories may need to be recorded in future periods. To date, our actual results have not been materially different than our estimates.Long-Lived AssetsWe review property, plant, and equipment and intangible assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of assets may not be recoverable. Recoverability of these assets is determined by comparison of their carrying value to the estimated future undiscounted cash flows that the assets are expected to generate over their remaining estimated lives. If such assets are considered to be impaired, the impairment to be recognized in earnings equals the amount by which the carrying value of the assets exceeds their fair value determined by either a quoted market price, if any, or a value determined by utilizing a discounted cash flow technique. Material impairment adjustments related to our property, plant, and equipment are reflected in our financial statements for the periods presented. Any deterioration in our business in the future could lead to such impairment adjustments in future periods. Evaluation of impairment of long-lived assets requires estimates of future operating results that are used in the preparation of the expected future undiscounted cash flows. Actual future operating results and the remaining economic lives of our long-lived assets could differ from the estimates used in assessing the recoverability of these assets. These differences could 35result in impairment charges, which could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations. In addition, in certain instances, assets may not be impaired but their estimated useful lives may have decreased. In these situations, we amortize the remaining net book values over the revised useful lives. GoodwillGoodwill is subject to impairment tests annually or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances suggest that the carrying value of goodwill may not be recoverable, utilizing either the qualitative or quantitative method. We test goodwill for impairment at the reporting unit level, which we determined is consistent with our identified operating segments, on an annual basis on the first day of the fourth quarter (on or about July 30) or more frequently if we believe indicators of impairment exist or we reorganize our operating segments or reporting units. We have the option to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its net book value. When using the qualitative method, we consider several factors, including the following:–the amount by which the fair values of each reporting unit exceeded their carrying values as of the date of the most recent quantitative impairment analysis, which indicated there would need to be substantial negative developments in the markets in which these reporting units operate in order for there to be potential impairment;–the carrying values of these reporting units as of the assessment date compared to their previously calculated fair values as of the date of the most recent quantitative impairment analysis;–the current forecasts as compared to the forecasts included in the most recent quantitative impairment analysis;–public information from competitors and other industry information to determine if there were any significant adverse trends in our competitors' businesses;–changes in the value of major U.S. stock indices that could suggest declines in overall market stability that could impact the valuation of our reporting units;–changes in our market capitalization and overall enterprise valuation to determine if there were any significant decreases that could be an indication that the valuation of our reporting units had significantly decreased; and–whether there had been any significant increases to the weighted-average cost of capital rates for each reporting unit, which could materially lower our prior valuation conclusions under a discounted cash flow approach.If we elect not to use this option, or we determine that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its net book value, then we perform the quantitative goodwill impairment test. The quantitative goodwill impairment test requires an entity to compare the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying amount. If fair value is determined to be less than carrying value, an impairment loss is recognized for the amount of the carrying value that exceeds the amount of the reporting unit's fair value, not to exceed the total amount of goodwill allocated to the reporting unit. Additionally, we consider income tax effects from any tax deductible goodwill on the carrying amount of the reporting unit when measuring the goodwill impairment loss, if applicable. We determine the fair value of our reporting units using a weighting of the income and market approaches. Under the income approach, we use a discounted cash flow methodology which requires management to make significant estimates and assumptions related to forecasted revenues, gross profit margins, operating income margins, working capital cash flow, perpetual growth rates, and long-term discount rates, among others. For the market approach, we use the guideline public company method. Under this method we utilize information from comparable publicly traded companies with similar operating and investment characteristics as the reporting units, to create valuation multiples that are applied to the operating performance of the reporting unit being tested, in order to obtain their respective fair values. In order to assess the reasonableness of the calculated reporting unit fair values, we reconcile the aggregate fair values of our reporting units determined, as described above, to our total company market capitalization, allowing for a reasonable control premium. In fiscal 2023, we used the qualitative method of assessing goodwill for our reporting units. In fiscal 2022, we used a combination of the qualitative and quantitative methods of assessing goodwill for all reporting units. In all periods presented, we concluded the reporting units' fair values exceeded their carrying amounts as of the assessment dates and no risk of impairment existed.Business CombinationsUnder the acquisition method of accounting, we recognize tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their estimated fair values. We record the excess of the fair value of the purchase consideration over the value of the net assets acquired as goodwill. The accounting for business combinations requires us to make significant estimates and assumptions, especially with respect to intangible assets and the fair value of contingent payment obligations. Critical estimates in valuing purchased technology, customer lists and other identifiable intangible assets include future cash flows that we expect to generate from the acquired assets. If the subsequent actual results and updated projections of the underlying business activity change compared with the assumptions and projections used to develop these values, we could experience impairment charges which could be material. In addition, we have estimated the economic lives of certain acquired 36assets and these lives are used to calculate depreciation and amortization expense. If our estimates of the economic lives change, depreciation or amortization expenses could be accelerated or slowed.We record contingent consideration resulting from a business combination at its fair value on the acquisition date. We generally determine the fair value of the contingent consideration using the income approach methodology of valuation. Each reporting period thereafter, we revalue these obligations and record increases or decreases in their fair value as an adjustment to operating expenses within the Consolidated Statements of Income. Changes in the fair value of the contingent consideration can result from changes in assumed discount periods and rates, and from changes pertaining to the achievement of the defined milestones. Significant judgment is employed in determining the appropriateness of these assumptions as of the acquisition date and for each subsequent period. Accordingly, future business and economic conditions, as well as changes in any of the assumptions described above, can materially impact the amount of contingent consideration expense we record in any given period.Accounting for Income TaxesWe make certain estimates and judgments in determining income tax expense for financial statement purposes. These estimates and judgments occur in the calculation of income tax credits, benefits, and deductions, and in the calculation of certain tax assets and liabilities, which arise from differences in the timing of the recognition of certain expenses for tax and financial statement purposes. We assess the likelihood of the realization of deferred tax assets and record a corresponding valuation allowance as necessary if we determine those deferred tax assets may not be realized due to the uncertainty of the timing and amount to be realized of certain state and international tax credit carryovers. In reaching our conclusion, we evaluate certain relevant criteria including the existence of deferred tax liabilities that can be used to realize deferred tax assets, the taxable income in prior carryback years in the impacted state and international jurisdictions that can be used to absorb net operating losses and taxable income in future years. Our judgments regarding future profitability may change due to future market conditions, changes in U.S. or international tax laws and other factors. These changes, if any, may require material adjustments to these deferred tax assets, which may result in an increase or decrease to our income tax provision in future periods.We account for uncertain tax positions by first determining if it is “more likely than not” that a tax position will be sustained by the appropriate taxing authorities prior to recording any benefit in the financial statements. An uncertain income tax position is not recognized if it has less than a 50% likelihood of being sustained. For those tax positions where it is more likely than not that a tax position will be sustained, we have recorded the largest amount of tax benefit with a greater than 50% likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement with a taxing authority that has full knowledge of all relevant information. For those income tax positions where it is not more likely than not that a tax benefit will be sustained, no tax benefit has been recognized in the financial statements. We classify interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions within the provision for (benefit from) income taxes line of the Consolidated Statements of Income. We reevaluate these uncertain tax positions on a quarterly basis. This evaluation is based on factors including, but not limited to, changes in known facts or circumstances, changes in tax law, effectively settled issues under audit, and new guidance on legislative interpretations. A change in these factors could result in the recognition of an increase or decrease to our income tax provision, which could materially impact our consolidated financial position and results of operations.In the ordinary course of global business, there are many transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax outcome is uncertain. Some of these uncertainties arise as a consequence of cost reimbursement and royalty arrangements among related entities. Although we believe our estimates are reasonable, no assurance can be given that the final tax outcome of these matters will not be different than that which is reflected in our historical income tax provisions and income tax liabilities. In the event our assumptions are incorrect, the differences could have a material impact on our income tax provision and operating results in the period in which such determination is made. In addition to the factors described above, our current and expected effective tax rate is based on then-current tax law. Significant changes during the year in enacted tax law could affect these estimates.See Note 12, Income Taxes, of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements contained in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further discussion.Stock-Based CompensationStock-based compensation expense associated with stock related awards is recognized in the Consolidated Statements of Income. Determining the amount of stock-based compensation to be recorded requires us to develop estimates to be used in calculating the grant-date fair value of restricted stock units and market-based and performance-based awards. The grant-date fair value of restricted stock units with a service condition and restricted stock units with both service and performance conditions is calculated using the value of our common stock on the date of grant, reduced by the present value of dividends expected to be paid on our common stock prior to vesting. For restricted stock units with both service and performance conditions, this grant-date fair value is also impacted by the number of units that are expected to vest during the performance period and is adjusted through the related stock-based compensation expense at each reporting period based on the probability 37of achievement of that performance condition. If we determine that an award is unlikely to vest, any previously recorded stock-based compensation expense is reversed in the period of that determination. The grant date fair value of restricted stock units and performance-based stock options with both service and market conditions are calculated using the Monte Carlo simulation model to estimate the probability of satisfying the performance condition stipulated in the award grant, including the possibility that the market condition may not be satisfied.The use of valuation models requires us to make estimates of key assumptions which are based on historical information and judgment regarding market factors and trends. We recognize the expense related to equity awards on a straight-line basis over the vesting period. See Note 2r, Stock-Based Compensation, and Note 3, Stock-Based Compensation and Shareholders' Equity, of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements contained in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for more information related to stock-based compensation.ContingenciesFrom time to time, in the ordinary course of business, various claims, charges and litigation are asserted or commenced against us arising from, or related to, among other things, contractual matters, patents, trademarks, personal injury, environmental matters, product liability, insurance coverage, employment or employment benefits. We periodically assess each matter to determine if a contingent liability should be recorded. In making this determination, we may, depending on the nature of the matter, consult with internal and external legal counsel and technical experts. Based on the information we obtain, combined with our judgment regarding all the facts and circumstances of each matter, we determine whether it is probable that a contingent loss may be incurred and whether the amount of such loss can be reasonably estimated. If a loss is probable and reasonably estimable, we record a contingent loss. In determining the amount of a contingent loss, we consider advice received from experts in the specific matter, current status of legal proceedings, settlement negotiations that may be ongoing, prior case history and other factors. If the judgments and estimates made by us are incorrect, we may need to record additional contingent losses that could materially adversely impact our results of operations.38 ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISKInterest Rate ExposureOur interest income and expense are sensitive to changes in the general level of interest rates. In this regard, changes in interest rates affect the interest earned or paid on our marketable securities and debt, as well as the fair value of our investments and debt.Based on our floating rate debt outstanding as of October 28, 2023 and October 29, 2022, inclusive of our commercial paper notes and interest rate swap outstanding, as applicable, our annual interest expense would change by approximately $20.5 million and $5.0 million, respectively, for each 100 basis point increase in interest rates. Based on our cash and marketable securities outstanding as of October 28, 2023 and October 29, 2022, our annual interest income would change by approximately $9.6 million and $14.7 million, respectively, for each 100 basis point increase in interest rates.To provide a meaningful assessment of the interest rate risk associated with our investment portfolio, we performed a sensitivity analysis to determine the impact a change in interest rates would have on the value of our investment portfolio assuming an immediate 100 basis point parallel shift in the yield curve. Based on investment positions as of October 28, 2023 and October 29, 2022, a hypothetical 100 basis point increase in interest rates across all maturities would not materially impact the fair market value of the portfolio in either period. If significant, such losses would only be realized if we sold the investments prior to maturity.As of October 28, 2023 we had $1.0 billion notional of fixed for floating interest rate swaps outstanding, with the swap payable having a fair value of $81.6 million. A hypothetical 100 basis point increase in interest rates would increase the swap payable by approximately $57.0 million with a corresponding adjustment to the carrying value of the related debt.As of October 28, 2023, we had $6.5 billion in principal amount of senior unsecured notes outstanding, with a fair value of $5.3 billion. We also had $547.2 million of commercial paper notes outstanding. As commercial paper notes issuances are at then-current rates and with very short maturities, the carrying value will approximate the fair value. The fair value of our notes is subject to interest rate risk, market risk and other factors. Generally, the fair value of our notes will increase as interest rates fall and decrease as interest rates rise. The fair values of our notes as of October 28, 2023 and October 29, 2022, assuming a hypothetical 100 basis point increase in market interest rates, are as follows:October 28, 2023October 29, 2022(thousands)Principal Amount OutstandingFair Value Fair Value given an increase in interest rates of 100 basis pointsPrincipal Amount OutstandingFair Value Fair Value given an increase in interest rates of 100 basis pointsCommercial paper notes$547,225 $547,185 $546,875 $— $— $— 2024 Notes, due October 2024500,000 499,473 495,058 500,000 491,982 483,035 2025 Notes, due April 2025400,000 385,231 380,013 400,000 383,378 374,686 2026 Notes, due December 2026900,000 851,023 826,888 900,000 851,479 820,203 Maxim Notes, due June 2027— — — 59,788 54,771 52,534 2027 Notes, due June 2027440,212 408,595 395,208 440,212 410,091 393,294 2028 Notes, due October 2028750,000 628,999 600,812 750,000 621,093 588,044 2031 Notes, due October 20311,000,000 773,404 721,064 1,000,000 786,772 727,579 2032 Notes, due October 2032300,000 269,828 251,153 300,000 278,359 257,337 2036 Notes, due December 2036144,278 118,554 108,085 144,278 126,274 114,389 2041 Notes, due October 2041750,000 479,078 422,949 750,000 513,709 450,337 2045 Notes, due December 2045332,587 292,248 259,323 332,587 313,931 276,820 2051 Notes, due October 20511,000,000 590,666 507,297 1,000,000 640,766 545,958 39Foreign Currency ExposureAs more fully described in Note 2i, Derivative and Hedging Agreements, of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements contained in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, we regularly hedge our non-U.S. dollar-based exposures by entering into forward foreign currency exchange contracts. The terms of these contracts are for periods matching the duration of the underlying exposure and generally range from one to twelve months. Currently, our largest foreign currency exposure is the Euro, primarily because our European operations have the highest proportion of our local currency denominated expenses. Relative to the net unhedged foreign currency exposures existing at October 28, 2023 and October 29, 2022, an immediate 10% unfavorable movement in foreign currency exchange rates would result in approximately $66.5 million of losses and $69.5 million of losses, respectively, in changes in earnings or cash flows over the course of the year.The market risk associated with our derivative instruments results from currency exchange rates that are expected to offset the market risk of the underlying transactions, assets and liabilities being hedged. The counterparties to the agreements relating to our foreign exchange instruments consist of a number of major international financial institutions with high credit ratings. Based on the credit ratings of our counterparties as of October 28, 2023, we do not believe that there is significant risk of nonperformance by them. While the contract or notional amounts of derivative financial instruments provide one measure of the volume of these transactions, they do not represent the amount of our exposure to credit risk. The amounts potentially subject to credit risk (arising from the possible inability of counterparties to meet the terms of their contracts) are generally limited to the amounts, if any, by which the counterparties’ obligations under the contracts exceed our obligations to the counterparties.The following table illustrates the effect that an immediate 10% unfavorable or favorable movement in foreign currency exchange rates, relative to the U.S. dollar, would have on the fair value of our forward exchange contracts as of October 28, 2023 and October 29, 2022:October 28, 2023October 29, 2022Fair value of forward exchange contracts$(11,575)$(16,984)Fair value of forward exchange contracts after a 10% unfavorable movement in foreign currency exchange rates asset$49,284 $21,193 Fair value of forward exchange contracts after a 10% favorable movement in foreign currency exchange rates liability$(70,461)$(51,604)The calculation assumes that each exchange rate would change in the same direction relative to the U.S. dollar. In addition to the direct effects of changes in exchange rates, such changes typically affect the volume of sales or the foreign currency sales price as competitors’ products become more or less attractive. Our sensitivity analysis of the effects of changes in foreign currency exchange rates does not factor in a potential change in sales levels or local currency selling prices.40REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRMTo the Shareholders and the Board of Directors of Analog Devices, Inc.Opinion on the Financial StatementsWe have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Analog Devices, Inc. (the Company) as of October 28, 2023 and October 29, 2022, the related consolidated statements of income, comprehensive income, shareholders' equity and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended October 28, 2023, and the related notes and financial statement schedule listed in the Index at Item 15(a)(2) (collectively referred to as the “consolidated financial statements”). In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company at October 28, 2023 and October 29, 2022, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended October 28, 2023, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of October 28, 2023, based on criteria established in Internal Control-Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework) and our report dated November 21, 2023 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.Basis for Opinion These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.Critical Audit Matter The critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current period audit of the financial statements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective or complex judgments. The communication of the critical audit matter does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the account or disclosure to which it relates.Revenue Recognition – Measuring Price Protection CreditsDescription of the MatterAs described in Note 2n to the consolidated financial statements, the Company's sales contracts provide certain distributors with credits for price protection and rights of return, which results in variable consideration. During 2023, sales to distributors were $7.5 billion net of expected price protection credits and rights of return for which the liability balance as of October 28, 2023 was $525.4 million, of which the vast majority relates to the price protection credits.Auditing the Company's measurement for price protection credits under distributor contracts involved especially challenging judgment because the calculation involves subjective management assumptions about estimates of expected price protection credits. For example, estimated price protection credits included in the transaction price reflects management's evaluation of contractual terms, historical experience and assumptions about future economic conditions. Changes in those assumptions can have a material effect on the amount recognized for price protection credits.41How We Addressed the Matter in Our AuditWe obtained an understanding, evaluated the design and tested the operating effectiveness of controls over the Company's process to calculate the price protection credits. For example, we tested controls over the appropriateness of assumptions management used as well as controls over the completeness and accuracy of the data underlying estimates of expected price protection credits.Our audit procedures included, among others, inspecting contractual terms in distributor agreements and testing the underlying data used in management’s calculation for completeness and accuracy as well as evaluating the significant assumptions used in the estimation of the price protection credits. We evaluated the Company’s methods and assumptions used in the estimates, which included comparing the assumptions to historical trends. We inspected and tested the results of the Company's retrospective review analysis of actual price protection credits claimed by distributors, evaluated the estimates made based on historical experience and performed sensitivity analyses of the Company’s significant assumptions to assess the impact on the price protection credits. We also evaluated whether the Company appropriately considered new information that could significantly change the estimated future price protection credits./s/ Ernst & Young LLPWe have served as the Company’s auditor since 1967.

6281,ADI,ANALOG DEVICES INC,2009,"ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (all tabular amounts in thousands except per share amounts) This Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, including in particular the section entitled “Outlook,” contains forward-looking statements regarding future events and our future results that are subject to the safe harbors created under the Securities Act of 1933 (the “Securities Act”) and the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the “Exchange Act”). These statements are based on current expectations, estimates, forecasts, and projections about the industries in which we operate and the beliefs and assumptions of our management. Words such as “expects,” “anticipates,” “targets,” “goals,” “projects,” “intends,” “plans,” “believes,” “seeks,” “estimates,” “continues,” “may,” variations of such words and similar expressions are intended to identify such forward-looking statements. In addition, any statements that refer to projections regarding our future financial performance, particularly in light of the ongoing global credit and financial market crisis; our anticipated growth and trends in our businesses, our capital needs and capital expenditures; our market position and competitive changes in the marketplace for our products; our ability to innovate new products and technologies; the timing or the effectiveness of our efforts to refocus our operations and reduce our cost structure and the expected amounts of any cost savings related to those efforts; our ability to access credit or capital markets; our ability to pay dividends or repurchase stock; our ability to service our outstanding debt; our expected tax rate; our third-party suppliers; intellectual property and litigation matters; potential acquisitions or divestitures; key personnel; the effect of new accounting pronouncements and other characterizations of future events or circumstances are forward-looking statements. Readers are cautioned that these forward-looking statements are only predictions and are subject to risks, uncertainties, and assumptions that are difficult to predict, including those identified in Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors and elsewhere in our Annual Report on Form 10-K. Therefore, actual results may differ materially and adversely from those expressed in any forward-looking statements. We undertake no obligation to revise or update any forward-looking statements except to the extent required by law. During the first quarter of fiscal 2008, we sold our baseband chipset business and related support operations, or Baseband Chipset Business, to MediaTek Inc. and sold our CPU voltage regulation and PC thermal monitoring business to certain subsidiaries of ON Semiconductor Corporation. The financial results of these businesses are presented as discontinued operations in the consolidated statements of income for all periods presented. The assets and liabilities related to these businesses are reflected as assets and liabilities of discontinued operations in the consolidated balance sheets as of October 31, 2009 and November 1, 2008. Unless otherwise noted, this Management’s Discussion and Analysis relates only to financial results from continuing operations. Results of Operations Overview Fiscal Year 2009 2008 2007 Total Revenue $ 2,014,908 $ 2,582,931 $ 2,464,721 Gross Margin % 55.5 % 61.1 % 61.2 % Net income from Continuing Operations $ 247,408 $ 525,177 $ 502,123 Net income from Continuing Operations as a % of Total Revenue 12.3 % 20.3 % 20.4 % Diluted EPS from Continuing Operations $ 0.85 $ 1.77 $ 1.51 Diluted EPS $ 0.85 $ 2.65 $ 1.50 The year-to-year revenue changes by end market and product category are more fully outlined below under Revenue Trends by End Market and Revenue Trends by Product. In fiscal year 2009, our revenue decreased 22% from fiscal 2008 and our diluted earnings per share from continuing operations decreased by 52%. Our fiscal 2009 cash flow from operations was $432.1 million, or 21% of revenue. We received net proceeds of $370.4 million during fiscal 2009 from the issuance of long-term debt and had $1,816 million of cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments as of October 31, 2009. The global credit crisis and current economic conditions could continue to result in cautious customer spending behavior. We cannot predict the severity, duration or precise impact of the economic downturn on our 25 future financial results. Consequently, our reported results for the fiscal 2009 may not be indicative of our future results. Revenue Trends by End Market The following table summarizes revenue by end market. The categorization of revenue by end market is determined using a variety of data points including the technical characteristics of the product, the “sold to” customer information, the “ship to” customer information and the end customer product or application into which our product will be incorporated. As data systems for capturing and tracking this data evolve and improve, the categorization of products by end market can vary over time. When this occurs, we reclassify revenue by end market for prior periods. Such reclassifications typically do not materially change the sizing of, or the underlying trends of results within, each end market. 2009 2008 2007* % of % of % of Total Total Total Product Product Product Revenue Revenue Y/Y% Revenue Revenue ** Revenue Revenue Industrial $ 1,049,158 52 % (24 )% $ 1,386,874 54 % $ 1,323,252 54 % Communications 512,941 25 % (13 )% 590,267 23 % 477,645 20 % Consumer 400,290 20 % (22 )% 512,339 20 % 523,793 22 % Computer 52,519 3 % (44 )% 93,451 4 % 105,031 4 % Total Product Revenue $ 2,014,908 100 % (22 )% $ 2,582,931 100 % $ 2,429,721 100 % Revenue from one-time IP license — — 35,000 Total Revenue $ 2,014,908 $ 2,582,931 $ 2,464,721 * The year ended November 3, 2007 was a 53-week year. We follow a 52-week, or 364-day fiscal calendar that results in a 53-week year approximately every seventh year, as occurred in fiscal 2007. ** The sum of the individual percentages do not equal the total due to rounding. Industrial — The year-to-year decrease from fiscal 2008 to fiscal 2009 in industrial end market revenue was primarily the result of a broad-based decline in demand in this end market, which was most significant for products sold into the instrumentation, automotive and process controls sectors of this end market. The year-to-year increase from fiscal 2007 to fiscal 2008 in industrial end market revenue was primarily the result of revenue growth in products sold into the instrumentation and automotive sectors and, to a lesser extent, the defense sector. The revenue growth in these sectors was partially offset by a decline in revenue from products used in automatic test equipment. Communications — The year-to-year decrease from fiscal 2008 to fiscal 2009 in communications end market revenue was primarily the result of a decrease in sales of analog products used in basestations, wireless handsets and networking applications. The year-to-year increase from fiscal 2007 to fiscal 2008 in communications end market revenue was primarily the result of revenue growth in sales of analog products used in basestations and wireless handsets. Consumer — The year-to-year decrease from fiscal 2008 to fiscal 2009 in consumer end market revenue was primarily the result of a decrease in demand for products used in home entertainment, digital cameras and video game applications, consistent with the global slowdown in consumer spending. The year-to-year decrease from fiscal 2007 to fiscal 2008 in consumer end market revenue was primarily the result of an increase in revenue from advanced television and digital camera applications that was offset by a decline in revenue from other consumer applications, consistent with the global slowdown in consumer spending. Computer — The year-to-year decrease from fiscal 2008 to fiscal 2009 in computer end market revenue was primarily the result of a general slowdown in the PC market. The year-to-year decrease from fiscal 2007 to fiscal 2008 was primarily the result of broad-based declines in sales of our products into this end market. 26 Revenue from One-Time IP License — During the first quarter of fiscal 2007, we recorded revenue of $35 million received in exchange for licensing of certain intellectual property rights to a third party. Revenue Trends by Product The following table summarizes revenue by product categories. The categorization of our products into broad categories is based on the characteristics of the individual products, the specification of the products and in some cases the specific uses that certain products have within applications. The categorization of products into categories is therefore subject to judgment in some cases and can vary over time. In instances where products move between product categories we reclassify the amounts in the product categories for all prior periods. Such reclassifications typically do not materially change the sizing of, or the underlying trends of results within, each product category. 2009 2008 2007* % of % of % of Total Total Total Product Product Product Revenue Revenue** Y/Y% Revenue Revenue Revenue Revenue** Converters $ 960,502 48 % (19 )% $ 1,190,866 46 % $ 1,104,932 45 % Amplifiers 501,759 25 % (25 )% 665,585 26 % 618,267 25 % Other analog 261,059 13 % (18 )% 318,648 12 % 334,652 14 % Subtotal analog signal processing 1,723,320 86 % (21 )% 2,175,099 84 % 2,057,851 85 % Power management & reference 118,247 6 % (18 )% 143,698 6 % 124,101 5 % Total analog products $ 1,841,567 91 % (21 )% $ 2,318,797 90 % $ 2,181,952 90 % General purpose DSP 167,133 8 % (29 )% 234,946 9 % 214,339 9 % Other DSP 6,208 0 % (79 )% 29,188 1 % 33,430 1 % Total DSP products $ 173,341 9 % (34 )% $ 264,134 10 % $ 247,769 10 % Total Product Revenue $ 2,014,908 100 % (22 )% $ 2,582,931 100 % $ 2,429,721 100 % Revenue from one-time IP license — — 35,000 Total Revenue $ 2,014,908 $ 2,582,931 $ 2,464,721 * The year ended November 3, 2007 was a 53-week year. We follow a 52-week, or 364-day fiscal calendar that results in a 53-week year approximately every seventh year, as occurred in fiscal 2007. ** The sum of the individual percentages may not equal the total due to rounding. The decrease in revenue from fiscal 2008 to fiscal 2009 was due to declining demand across our product categories in every market that we serve, particularly the industrial and consumer end markets, as a result of an overall decline in the worldwide economy. The increase in revenue from fiscal 2007 to fiscal 2008 was the result of a broad-based increase in sales across many of our product categories. The increase in sales of converters and amplifiers was primarily attributable to an increase in demand for our products used in the industrial and communications end markets. 27 Revenue Trends by Geographic Region The percentage of product sales from continuing operations by geographic region, based upon point of sale, for the last three fiscal years is as follows: Fiscal Year Region 2009 2008 2007 United States 20 % 20 % 23 % Rest of North and South America 5 % 4 % 3 % Europe 25 % 26 % 24 % Japan 17 % 19 % 21 % China 19 % 16 % 13 % Rest of Asia 14 % 15 % 16 % In fiscal year 2009 the predominant countries comprising “Rest of North and South America” are Canada and Mexico; the predominant countries comprising “Europe” are Germany, Sweden and France; and the predominant countries comprising “Rest of Asia” are Korea, Taiwan and Singapore. In fiscal year 2008 and fiscal year 2007 the predominant countries comprising “Rest of North and South America” are Canada and Mexico; the predominant countries comprising “Europe” are Germany, France and the United Kingdom; and the predominant countries comprising “Rest of Asia” are Taiwan and Korea. Sales declined in all geographic regions in the fiscal 2009, as compared to fiscal 2008, with sales in Europe and Japan experiencing the largest decline. This decline in sales in Europe was partially attributable to a decline in the automotive end market. The decline in sales in Japan was principally attributable to the general decline in consumer spending as a result of the global economic crisis. The decline in China was smaller than the decline in the other regions primarily due to the strong demand for our products used in China’s recent infrastructure build-out of the country’s next generation of communication technology. Gross Margin Fiscal Year 2009 2008 2007 Gross Margin $ 1,118,637 $ 1,577,275 $ 1,508,276 Gross Margin % 55.5 % 61.1 % 61.2 % Gross margin percentage was lower in fiscal 2009 by 560 basis points as compared to fiscal 2008, primarily as a result of a decrease in sales of $568.0 million and reduced operating levels in our manufacturing facilities that created adverse utilization variances. Gross margin percentage in fiscal 2008 was lower by 10 basis points from the gross margin recorded in fiscal 2007 primarily as a result of recording revenue in fiscal 2007 of $35 million we received in exchange for the licensing of certain intellectual property rights to a third party with no associated cost of sales. Stock-based Compensation Expense As of October 31, 2009, the total compensation cost related to unvested equity awards not yet recognized in our statement of income was approximately $103.4 million (before tax consideration), which we will recognize over a weighted average period of 1.6 years. During fiscal 2009, our shareholders approved and we completed an employee stock option exchange program (Option Exchange). The Option Exchange provided our eligible employees, except our named executive officers and directors, the opportunity to exchange eligible stock option grants for a smaller number of new stock options, with a lower exercise price, or in some instances, cash, that had approximately the same fair value as the options surrendered. 28 See Note 3 in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements contained in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further information. Research and Development (R&D) Fiscal Year 2009 2008 2007 R&D Expenses $ 446,980 $ 533,480 $ 509,553 R&D Expenses as a % of Product Revenue 22.2 % 20.7 % 21.0 % Research and development, or R&D, expenses in fiscal 2009 decreased $86.5 million, or 16%, from fiscal 2008. This decrease was primarily the result of the actions we took to constrain or permanently reduce operating expenses as well as a decrease in variable compensation expenses. R&D expenses in fiscal 2008 increased by $23.9 million, or 5%, from the amount recorded in fiscal 2007. This increase was primarily the result of higher employee salary, benefit and variable compensation expenses, which were partially offset by one fewer week of operations in fiscal 2008 than in fiscal 2007 and lower employee stock option expenses. R&D expenses as a percentage of revenue will fluctuate from year-to-year depending on the amount of revenue and the success of new product development efforts, which we view as critical to our future growth. At any point in time we have hundreds of R&D projects underway, and we believe that none of these projects is material on an individual basis. We expect to continue the development of innovative technologies and processes for new products, and we believe that a continued commitment to R&D is essential in order to maintain product leadership with our existing products and to provide innovative new product offerings, and therefore, we expect to continue to make significant R&D investments in the future. Selling, Marketing, General and Administrative (SMG&A) Fiscal Year 2009 2008 2007 SMG&A Expenses $ 333,184 $ 415,682 $ 389,505 SMG&A Expenses as a % of Product Revenue 16.5 % 16.1 % 16.0 % Selling, marketing, general and administrative, or SMG&A, expenses in fiscal 2009 decreased $82.5 million, or 20%, from fiscal 2008. This decrease was primarily the result of our actions taken to constrain or permanently reduce operating expenses as well as a decrease in variable compensation expenses. SMG&A expenses increased by $26.2 million, or 7%, in fiscal 2008 as compared to the amount recorded in fiscal 2007. This increase was primarily the result of higher employee salary, benefit and variable compensation expenses, which were partially offset by lower employee stock option expenses and one less week of operations in fiscal 2008 than in fiscal 2007. Fiscal 2007 also included $8.5 million related to the reimbursement of legal expenses we received as a result of the settlement of litigation in fiscal 2007. Special Charges Closure of Wafer Fabrication Facility in Sunnyvale We ceased production at our California wafer fabrication facility in November 2006. We are paying the lease obligation costs on a monthly basis over the remaining lease term, which expires in 2010. We completed the clean-up activity during fiscal 2007, and we do not expect to incur any additional charges related to this action. Reorganization of Product Development and Support Programs We recorded special charges in fiscal years 2005, 2006 and 2007 as a result of our decision to reorganize our product development and support programs with the goal of providing greater focus on our analog and digital signal processing product programs. We terminated the employment of all employees associated with these programs and 29 have paid all amounts owed to employees for severance. We do not expect to incur any further charges related to this reorganization action. Consolidation of a Wafer Fabrication Facility in Limerick In fiscal 2007, we recorded a special charge of $13.7 million as a result of our decision to only use eight-inch technology at our wafer fabrication facility in Limerick. Certain manufacturing processes and products produced on the Limerick facility’s six-inch production line have transitioned to our existing eight-inch production line in Limerick while others have transitioned to external foundries. The charge was for severance and fringe benefit costs recorded under our ongoing benefit plan for 150 manufacturing employees associated with this action. As of October 31, 2009, we still employed 2 of the 150 employees included in this action. These employees must continue to be employed by us until their employment is involuntarily terminated in order to receive the severance benefit. During fiscal 2008, we recorded an additional charge of $1.5 million related to this action, of which $1.2 million was an adjustment to the original estimate of the severance costs and $0.3 million was for clean-up and closure costs that were expensed as incurred. During fiscal 2009, we recorded additional charges of $1.2 million for clean-up and closure costs that were expensed as incurred. The production in the six-inch wafer fabrication facility ceased during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2009. We do not expect to incur any further charges related to this action. We estimate that the closure of this facility will result in annual cost savings of approximately $25 million per year, which we expect to realize starting in the first quarter of fiscal 2010. We expect these annual savings will be in cost of sales, of which approximately $1 million relates to non-cash depreciation savings. Reduction of Overhead Infrastructure Costs During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2007, we recorded a special charge as a result of our decision to either deemphasize or exit certain businesses or products and focus investments in products and end markets where we have better opportunities for profitable growth. In September 2007, we entered into a definitive agreement to sell our Baseband Chipset Business. As a result, we decided to reduce the support infrastructure in manufacturing, engineering and SMG&A to more appropriately reflect our required overhead structure. We terminated the employment of all employees associated with this action and have paid all amounts owed to employees for severance. We do not expect to incur any further charges related to this action. These cost reduction actions, which were substantially completed in the second quarter of fiscal 2008, resulted in annual savings of approximately $15 million. We realized these savings as follows: approximately $7 million in R&D expenses, approximately $6 million in SMG&A expenses and approximately $2 million in cost of sales. Reduction of Operating Costs During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2008, in order to further reduce our operating cost structure, we recorded a special charge of $1.6 million for severance and fringe benefit costs recorded under our ongoing benefit plan or statutory requirements at foreign locations for 19 engineering and SMG&A employees. We terminated the employment of all employees associated with this charge and are paying amounts owed to employees for severance as income continuance. During fiscal 2009, we recorded an additional charge of $30.3 million related to this cost reduction action. Approximately $2.1 million of this charge was for lease obligation costs for facilities that we ceased using during the first quarter of fiscal 2009; approximately $0.9 million was for the write-off of property, plant and equipment; and approximately $0.8 million was for contract termination costs and for clean-up and closure costs that were expensed as incurred. The remaining $26.5 million related to the severance and fringe benefit costs recorded under our ongoing benefit plan or statutory requirements at foreign locations, for 245 manufacturing employees and 302 engineering and SMG&A employees. As of October 31, 2009, we still employed 16 of the 547 employees included in this cost reduction action. These employees must continue to be employed by us until their employment is involuntarily terminated in order to receive the severance benefit. We believe this cost reduction action, which was substantially completed during the second quarter of fiscal 2009, will result in annual savings of approximately $36.4 million once fully implemented. We expect these annual savings will be realized as follows: approximately $31.6 million in SMG&A expenses and approximately 30 $4.8 million in cost of sales. A portion of these savings is reflected in our results for fiscal year 2009 and the remainder of the savings will be fully reflected in our results by the second quarter of fiscal 2010. Closure of Wafer Fabrication Facility in Cambridge During the first quarter of fiscal 2009, we recorded a special charge of $22.1 million as a result of our decision to consolidate our Cambridge, Massachusetts wafer fabrication facility into our existing Wilmington, Massachusetts facility. In connection with the anticipated closure of this facility, we evaluated the recoverability of the facilities’ manufacturing assets and concluded that there was an impairment of approximately $12.9 million based on the revised period of intended use. The remaining $9.2 million was for severance and fringe benefit costs recorded under our ongoing benefit plan for 175 manufacturing employees and 9 SMG&A employees associated with this action. We finished production in the Cambridge fabrication facility and began clean-up activity during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2009. During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2009, we reversed approximately $1.8 million of the severance accrual. The accrual reversal was required because 51 employees either voluntarily left the Company or found alternative employment within the Company. In addition, we recorded a special charge of approximately $1.7 million for the impairment of manufacturing assets that were originally going to be moved to our other wafer fabrication facilities, but are no longer needed at those facilities and therefore have no future use. We also recorded a special charge of $0.1 million for clean-up costs as we began our cleanup of the Cambridge fabrication facility at the end of the fourth quarter of fiscal 2009. As of October 31, 2009, we still employed 33 employees included in this action. The remaining employees will continue working during the first quarter of fiscal 2010 on the cleanup and closure of the wafer fabrication facility. These employees must continue to be employed by us until their employment is involuntarily terminated in order to receive the severance benefit. We expect to incur additional expenses, that cannot be precisely determined at this time, related to this action in the first quarter of fiscal 2010 for lease termination, cleanup and closure costs. The lease charge will be taken when we cease using the building and the cleanup and closure costs will be expensed as incurred. We estimate that the closure of this facility will result in annual cost savings of approximately $41 million per year, expected to be fully realized starting in the third quarter of fiscal 2010. We expect these annual savings to be realized as follows: approximately $40.2 million in cost of sales, of which approximately $4.0 million relates to non-cash depreciation savings, and approximately $0.8 million in SMG&A expenses. Operating Income from Continuing Operations Fiscal Year 2009 2008 2007 Operating income from Continuing Operations $ 284,817 $ 625,025 $ 568,723 Operating income from Continuing Operations as a % of Total Revenue 14.1 % 24.2 % 23.1 % The $340.2 million, or 54%, decrease in operating income from continuing operations in fiscal 2009 as compared to fiscal 2008 was primarily the result of a decrease in revenue of $568.0 million, a 560 basis point decrease in gross margin percentage and an increase of $50.6 million in special charges. This decrease in operating income from continuing operations was partially offset by a decrease in R&D and SMG&A expenses as more fully described above under the headings Research and Development and Selling, Marketing, General and Administrative. The $56.3 million, or 10%, increase in operating income in fiscal 2008 as compared to fiscal 2007 was primarily the result of an increase in total revenue of $118.2 million and, to a lesser extent, a decrease in special charges of $37.4 million. This increase in operating income from continuing operations was partially offset by a 10 basis point decrease in gross margin percentage, an increase in operating expenses as more fully described above under the headings Research and Development and Selling, Marketing, General and Administrative, and the fact that fiscal 2007 included $35 million in non-product revenue that we received in exchange for the licensing of certain intellectual property rights to a third party with no associated cost of sales. 31 Nonoperating (Income) Expense Fiscal Year 2009 2008 2007 Interest expense 4,094 — — Interest income (15,621 ) (41,041 ) (77,007 ) Other, net (1,100 ) (36 ) (15,727 ) Total nonoperating income $ (12,627 ) $ (41,077 ) $ (92,734 ) Nonoperating income was lower by $28.5 million in fiscal 2009 as compared to fiscal 2008 primarily due to lower interest income earned on investments as a result of lower interest rates in fiscal 2009 as compared to fiscal 2008. In addition, we incurred interest expense during fiscal 2009 as a result of the issuance of $375 million aggregate principal 5.0% senior unsecured notes on June 30, 2009. We entered into an interest rate swap in June 2009 that swaps the fixed rate of the notes to a variable rate based on the three-month LIBOR plus 2.05% (2.34% as of October 31, 2009). Nonoperating income in fiscal 2008 was lower by $51.7 million as compared to fiscal 2007 primarily as a result of lower average invested cash balances and, to a lesser extent, lower interest rates in fiscal 2008 as compared to fiscal 2007. In addition, other income in fiscal 2007 included $10.5 million we received as part of a litigation settlement and a $7.9 million gain from the sale of an investment. Provision for Income Taxes Fiscal Year 2009 2008 2007 Provision for Income Taxes $ 50,036 $ 140,925 $ 159,553 Effective Income Tax Rate 16.8 % 21.2 % 24.1 % Our effective tax rate reflects the applicable tax rate in effect in the various tax jurisdictions around the world where our income is earned. Our effective tax rate for fiscal 2009 was lower compared to our effective tax rate for fiscal 2008 primarily as a result of our recording special charges of $53.7 million in fiscal 2009, a majority of which provided a tax benefit at the higher U.S. tax rate, and as a result of a change in the mix of our income to jurisdictions where income is taxed at a lower rate. Our effective tax rate for fiscal 2008 was lower by 290 basis points compared to our effective tax rate for fiscal 2007. The 2007 tax rate included the following transactions, which were taxed at the higher U.S. tax rate: the one-time receipt of $35 million associated with the licensing of intellectual property to a third party, $19 million we received from a settlement of litigation and a $7.9 million gain on the sale of an investment. In addition, the 2007 tax rate included tax expense related to the finalization of the accounting for a 2006 acquisition. These items, which had the effect of increasing the 2007 tax rate, were partially offset by a higher R&D credit in fiscal 2007 than in fiscal 2008. In addition to these isolated transactions that impacted our tax rate, a larger percentage of our profits were earned in lower tax jurisdictions during fiscal 2008, as compared to fiscal 2007, causing a decrease in our tax rate. Income from Continuing Operations, Net of Tax Fiscal Year 2009 2008 2007 Income from Continuing Operations, net of tax $ 247,408 $ 525,177 $ 502,123 Income from Continuing Operations, net of tax as a % of Total Revenue 12.3 % 20.3 % 20.4 % Diluted EPS from Continuing Operations $ 0.85 $ 1.77 $ 1.51 32 Income from continuing operations, net of tax, in fiscal 2009 was lower than in fiscal 2008 by approximately $277.8 million primarily as a result of the $340.2 million decrease in operating income that was partially offset by a lower provision for income taxes in fiscal 2009. Income from continuing operations, net of tax, in fiscal 2008 was higher than in fiscal 2007 by approximately $23.1 million primarily as a result of the $56.3 million increase in operating income from continuing operations that was partially offset by a $51.7 million decrease in nonoperating income and a lower provision for income taxes in fiscal 2008. The impact of inflation and foreign currency exchange rate movement on our results of operations during the past three fiscal years has not been significant. Discontinued Operations Fiscal Year 2009 2008 2007 Income (loss) from Discontinued Operations, net of tax $ 364 $ 12,779 $ (5,216 ) Gain on sale of Discontinued Operations, net of tax — 248,328 — Total income (loss) from Discontinued Operations, net of tax $ 364 $ 261,107 $ (5,216 ) Diluted earnings (loss) per share from Discontinued Operations $ 0.00 $ 0.88 $ (0.02 ) We sold our baseband chipset business to MediaTek Inc. and our CPU voltage regulation and PC thermal monitoring business to certain subsidiaries of ON Semiconductor Corporation during the first quarter of fiscal 2008. Accordingly, the results of the operations of these businesses have been presented as discontinued operations within the consolidated financial statements. Acquisitions In fiscal 2006, we completed a transaction with TTPCom Limited (TTPCom), whereby TTPCom transferred to us intellectual property, engineering resources, and related assets associated with the support and customization of TTPCom’s GSM/GPRS/EDGE modem software for use on our existing and future generations of SoftFone® baseband processors. We also acquired development rights for AJAR, TTPCom’s advanced applications platform. As a result of this transaction, we became the single point of contact for both hardware and software support for our new and existing wireless handset customers, thus improving our ability to service the needs of individual customers. During fiscal 2007, we paid $6.1 million of contingent consideration related to this acquisition. In fiscal 2006, we acquired substantially all the outstanding stock of privately-held Integrant Technologies, Inc. (Integrant) of Seoul, Korea. The acquisition enabled us to enter the mobile TV market and strengthened our presence in the Asia region. We paid $8.4 million related to the purchase of shares from the founder of Integrant during the period from July 2007 through July 2009. We recorded these payments as additional goodwill. In fiscal 2006, we acquired all the outstanding stock of privately-held AudioAsics A/S (AudioAsics) of Roskilde, Denmark. The acquisition of AudioAsics allows us to continue developing low-power audio solutions, while expanding our presence in the Nordic and Eastern European regions. We paid additional cash payments of $3.1 million during fiscal 2009 for the achievement of revenue-based milestones during the period from October 2006 through January 2009, which were recorded as additional goodwill. In addition, in accordance with the terms of the acquisition documents, we paid $3.2 million during fiscal 2009 based on the achievement of technological milestones during the period from October 2006 through January 2009, which were recorded as compensation expense in fiscal 2008. All revenue and technological milestones related to this acquisitions have been met and no additional payments will be made. We have not provided pro forma results of operations for TTPCom, Integrant and AudioAsics in this report as they were not material to us on either an individual or an aggregate basis. We included the results of operations of each acquisition in our consolidated statement of income from the date of such acquisition. 33 Liquidity and Capital Resources Fiscal Year 2009 2008 2007 Net Cash Provided by Operations $ 432,148 $ 669,368 $ 820,365 Net Cash Provided by Operations as a % of Total Revenue 21.4 % 25.9 % 33.3 % At October 31, 2009, cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments totaled $1,816 million, an increase of $506.3 million from the fourth quarter of fiscal 2008. The primary sources of funds for fiscal 2009 were net cash generated from operating activities of $432.1 million and net proceeds of $370.4 million from the issuance of our senior unsecured notes in June 2009. The principal uses of funds for fiscal 2009 were dividend payments of $233.0 million and capital expenditures of $56.1 million. We sold our baseband chipset business to MediaTek Inc. and our CPU voltage regulation and PC thermal monitoring business to certain subsidiaries of ON Semiconductor Corporation during the first quarter of fiscal 2008. The cash flows from these discontinued operations have been combined with the operating, investing and financing cash flows from continuing operations (i.e. no separate classification of cash flows from discontinued operations) for all periods presented. We believe the absence of the cash flows from these discontinued operations has not and will not have a material impact on our future liquidity and financial position. Additionally, as a result of these dispositions, we reclassified certain assets and liabilities related to these businesses to assets or liabilities of discontinued operations. See Note 2u. in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements contained in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further information regarding these discontinued operations. Fiscal Year 2009 2008 Accounts Receivable $ 301,036 $ 315,290 Days Sales Outstanding* 48 44 Inventory $ 253,161 $ 314,629 Days Cost of Sales in Inventory* 92 112 * We use the annualized fourth quarter revenue in our calculation of days sales outstanding and we use the annualized fourth quarter cost of sales in our calculation of days cost of sales in inventory. Accounts receivable at October 31, 2009 decreased $14.3 million, or 5%, from the end of the fourth quarter of fiscal 2008. The decrease in receivables was the result of lower product shipments in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2009 as compared to the fourth quarter of fiscal 2008. Inventory at October 31, 2009 decreased by $61.5 million, or 20%, from the end of the fourth quarter of fiscal 2008. The decrease in inventory, despite a lower level of sales, is primarily a result of significant reductions in external manufacturing spending and additional factory shutdowns in fiscal 2009. Current liabilities decreased to $386.6 million at October 31, 2009, a decrease of $182.4 million, or 32%, from $569.1 million at the end of fiscal 2008. This decrease was primarily the result of a decrease in accrued liabilities as a result of decreases in compensation and benefit accruals and to a lesser extent a decrease in income taxes payable as a result of lower profits in fiscal 2009 as compared to fiscal 2008. Net additions to property, plant and equipment including discontinued operations, were $56.1 million in fiscal 2009, $157.4 million in fiscal 2008 and $141.8 million in fiscal 2007. We expect fiscal 2010 capital expenditures to be in the range of $60 million to $70 million. During fiscal 2009, our Board of Directors declared cash dividends totaling $0.80 per outstanding share of common stock resulting in aggregate dividend payments of $233.0 million. After the end of the fiscal year, on November 19, 2009, our Board of Directors declared a cash dividend of $0.20 per outstanding share of our common stock. The dividend is payable on December 23, 2009 to shareholders of record on December 4, 2009 and is expected to total approximately $58.4 million. The payment of future dividends, if any, will be based on several factors, including our financial performance, outlook and liquidity. 34 Our common stock repurchase program has been in place since August 2004. In the aggregate, the Board of Directors has authorized us to repurchase $4 billion of our common stock under the program. Under the program, we may repurchase outstanding shares of our common stock from time to time in the open market and through privately negotiated transactions. Unless terminated earlier by resolution of our Board of Directors, the repurchase program will expire when we have repurchased all shares authorized under the program. As of October 31, 2009, we had repurchased a total of approximately 114.7 million shares of our common stock for approximately $3,908.4 million under this program and an additional $91.6 million remains under the current authorized program. The repurchased shares are held as authorized but unissued shares of common stock. We also from time to time repurchase shares in settlement of employee tax withholding obligations due upon the vesting of restricted stock or restricted stock units or the exercise of stock options. Any future common stock repurchases will be based on several factors including our financial performance, outlook, liquidity and the amount of cash we have available to us in the United States. On June 30, 2009, we issued $375 million aggregate principal amount of 5.0% senior unsecured notes due July 1, 2014 (the Notes) with annual interest payments of 5.0% paid in two installments on January 1 and July 1 of each year, commencing January 1, 2010. The net proceeds of the offering were $370.4 million, after issuing at a discount and deducting expenses, underwriting discounts and commissions, which will be amortized over the term of the Notes. We swapped the fixed interest portion of these Notes for a variable interest rate based on the three-month LIBOR plus 2.05% (2.34% as of October 31, 2009). The variable interest payments based on the variable annual rate are payable quarterly. The LIBOR based rate is set quarterly three months prior to the date of the interest payment. The indenture governing the Notes contains covenants that may limit our ability to: incur, create, assume or guarantee any debt for borrowed money secured by a lien upon a principal property; enter into sale and lease-back transactions with respect to a principal property; and consolidate with or merge into, or transfer or lease all or substantially all of our assets to, any other party. In addition, we have a five-year $165 million unsecured revolving credit facility that expires in May 2013. To date, we have not borrowed under this credit facility but we may borrow in the future and use the proceeds for support of commercial paper issuance, stock repurchases, dividend payments, acquisitions, capital expenditures, working capital and other lawful corporate purposes. At October 31, 2009, our principal source of liquidity was $1,816 million of cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments. As of October 31, 2009, approximately $412.7 million of our cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments were held in the United States. The balance of our cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments was held outside the United States in various foreign subsidiaries. As we intend to reinvest certain of our foreign earnings indefinitely, this cash held outside the United States is not available to meet certain of our cash requirements in the United States, including for cash dividends and common stock repurchases. If we are unable to address our U.S. cash requirements through operations, by efficient and timely repatriations of overseas cash, through borrowings under our current credit facility or from other sources of cash obtained at an acceptable cost, our business strategies and operating results could be adversely affected. The volatility in the credit markets has generally diminished liquidity and capital availability in worldwide markets. We are unable to predict the likely duration and severity of the current disruptions in the credit and financial markets and adverse global economic conditions. However, we believe that our existing sources of liquidity and cash expected to be generated from future operations, together with existing and anticipated available long-term financing, will be sufficient to fund operations, capital expenditures, research and development efforts, dividend payments (if any) and purchases of stock (if any) under our stock repurchase program in the immediate future and for at least the next twelve months. 35 The table below summarizes our contractual obligations and the amounts we owe under these contracts in specified periods as of October 31, 2009: Payment due by period Less than More than (thousands) Total 1 Year 1-3 Years 4-5 Years 5 Years Contractual obligations: Operating leasesa $ 80,782 $ 24,735 $ 27,905 $ 9,887 $ 18,255 Long-term debt obligations 375,000 — — 375,000 — Interest payments associated with long-term debt obligationsb 93,802 18,802 37,500 37,500 — Payments due under interest rate swap agreementsc 42,447 8,935 17,894 15,618 — Deferred compensation pland 7,940 1,363 — — 6,577 Pension fundinge 30,050 30,050 — — — Total $ 630,021 $ 83,885 $ 83,299 $ 438,005 $ 24,832 (a) Certain of our operating lease obligations include escalation clauses. These escalating payment requirements are reflected in the table. (b) These interest payments are expected to be offset by the proceeds from our interest rate swap agreements. (c) These interest payments are based on a variable interest rate based on the three month LIBOR plus 2.05%. The actual payments will be based on the LIBOR based rate which is set quarterly three months prior to the date of the interest payments plus 2.05%. (d) These payments relate to obligations under our deferred compensation plan. The deferred compensation plan allows certain members of management and other highly-compensated employees and non-employee directors to defer receipt of all or any portion of their compensation. The amount in the “More than 5 Years” column of the table represents the remaining total balance under the deferred compensation plan to be paid to participants who have not terminated employment. Since we cannot reasonably estimate the timing of withdrawals for participants who have not yet terminated employment we have included the future obligation to these participants in the “More than 5 Years” column of the table. All other columns represent installment payments to be made to those employees who have retired or are on long-term disability, or as a result of elections made by plan participants under the provisions of our Deferred Compensation Plan. (e) Our funding policy for our foreign defined benefit plans is consistent with the local requirements of each country. The payment obligations in the table are estimates of our expected contributions to these plans for fiscal year 2010. The actual future payments may differ from the amounts presented in the table and reasonable estimates of payments beyond one year are not practical because of potential future changes in variables such as plan asset performance, interest rates and the rate of increase in compensation levels. Purchase orders for the purchase of raw materials and other goods and services are not included in the table above. We are not able to determine the total amount of these purchase orders that represent contractual obligations, as purchase orders may represent authorizations to purchase rather than binding agreements. In addition, our purchase orders generally allow for cancellation without significant penalties. We do not have significant agreements for the purchase of raw materials or other goods specifying minimum quantities or set prices that exceed our expected short-term requirements. As of October 31, 2009, our total liabilities associated with uncertain tax positions was $26.2 million, which are included in “Other non-current liabilities” in our Consolidated Balance Sheet contained in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Due to the complexity associated with our tax uncertainties, we cannot make a reasonably reliable estimate of the period in which we expect to settle the non-current liabilities associated with these uncertain tax positions. Therefore, we have not included these uncertain tax positions in the above contractual obligations table. 36 The expected timing of payments and the amounts of the obligations discussed above are estimated based on current information. Off-balance Sheet Financing As of October 31, 2009, we had no off-balance sheet financing arrangements. Outlook The following statements are based on current expectations. These statements are forward-looking, and actual results may differ materially. Unless specifically mentioned, these statements do not give effect to the potential impact of any mergers, acquisitions, divestitures, or business combinations that may be announced or closed after the date of filing this report. These statements supersede all prior statements regarding our business outlook made by us. We are planning for revenue in the first quarter of fiscal 2010 to be approximately flat to the fourth quarter of fiscal 2009. Our plan is for gross margin for the first quarter of fiscal 2010 to increase to approximately 58.0% to 58.5% as a result of lower infrastructure costs and a richer mix of industrial sales. We are planning for operating expenses, excluding one-time restructuring items associated with the closure of our Cambridge wafer fabrication facility, in the first quarter of fiscal 2010 to remain approximately flat to the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2009, in line with our plan to achieve higher operating leverage going forward. As a result, our plan is for diluted EPS from continuing operations to be approximately $0.36 to $0.37 in the first quarter of fiscal 2010, excluding one-time restructuring items associated with the closure of our Cambridge wafer fabrication facility, which cannot be precisely determined at this time. New Accounting Pronouncements Revenue Arrangements That Include Software Elements In October 2009, the FASB issued ASU No. 2009-14 — Software (Topic 985): Certain Revenue Arrangements That Include Software Elements (formerly EITF Issue No. 09-3). This standard removes tangible products from the scope of software revenue recognition guidance and also provides guidance on determining whether software deliverables in an arrangement that includes a tangible product are within the scope of the software revenue guidance. More specifically, if the software sold with or embedded within the tangible product is essential to the functionality of the tangible product, then this software, as well as undelivered software elements that relate to this software, are excluded from the scope of existing software revenue guidance. ASU No. 2009-14 is effective for fiscal years that begin on or after June 15, 2010, which is our fiscal year 2011. We are currently evaluating the impact, if any, that ASU No. 2009-14 may have on our financial condition and results of operations. Multiple-Deliverable Revenue Arrangements In October 2009, the FASB issued ASU No. 2009-13 — Revenue Recognition (Topic 605): Multiple-Deliverable Revenue Arrangements (formerly EITF Issue No. 08-1). This standard modifies the revenue recognition guidance for arrangements that involve the delivery of multiple elements, such as product, software, services or support, to a customer at different times as part of a single revenue generating transaction. This standard provides principles and application guidance to determine whether multiple deliverables exist, how the individual deliverables should be separated and how to allocate the revenue in the arrangement among those separate deliverables. The standard also expands the disclosure requirements for multiple deliverable revenue arrangements. ASU No. 2009-13 is effective for fiscal years that begin on or after June 15, 2010, which is our fiscal year 2011. We are currently evaluating the impact, if any, that ASU No. 2009-13 may have on our financial condition and results of operations. 37 Variable Interest Entities In June 2009, the FASB issued SFAS 167, Amendments to FASB Interpretation No. 46(R) (SFAS 167). SFAS 167 requires an enterprise to perform an analysis to determine whether the enterprise’s variable interest or interests give it a controlling financial interest in a variable interest entity. Additionally, an enterprise is required to assess whether it has an implicit financial responsibility to ensure that a variable interest entity operates as designed when determining whether it has the power to direct the activities of the variable interest entity that most significantly impact the entity’s economic performance. SFAS 167 is effective for fiscal years that begin after November 15, 2009, which is our fiscal year 2011. We are currently evaluating the impact, if any, that SFAS 167 may have on our financial condition and results of operations. Transfers of Financial Assets In June 2009, the FASB issued SFAS 166, Accounting for Transfers of Financial Assets, an amendment of FASB Statement No. 140 (SFAS 166). SFAS 166 changes the way entities account for securitizations and other transfers of financial instruments. SFAS 166 is effective for fiscal years that begin after November 15, 2009, which is our fiscal year 2011. We are currently evaluating the impact, if any, that SFAS 166 may have on our financial condition and results of operations. Business Combinations In December 2007, the FASB issued ASC 805-10 (formerly SFAS 141R, “Business Combinations”). ASC 805-10 requires an acquiring entity in a business combination to recognize the assets acquired, liabilities assumed and any noncontrolling interest in the acquiree at their fair value on the acquisition date. It further requires that acquisition-related costs and restructuring costs be recognized separately from the acquisition. In April 2009, the FASB updated ASC 805-10 to amend the provisions for the initial recognition and measurement, subsequent measurement and accounting, and disclosures for assets and liabilities arising from contingencies in business combinations. This update also eliminates the distinction between contractual and non-contractual contingencies. ASC 805-10 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2008, which is our fiscal year 2010. We are currently evaluating the impact, if any, that this rule may have on our financial condition and results of operations. The adoption of ASC 805-10 will change our accounting treatment for business combinations on a prospective basis beginning in the first quarter of fiscal year 2010. Noncontrolling Interests In December 2007, the FASB issued ASC810-10 (formerly SFAS 160, Noncontrolling Interests in Consolidated Financial Statements). ASC 810-10 clarifies that a noncontrolling or minority interest in a subsidiary is considered an ownership interest and, accordingly, requires all entities to report such interests in subsidiaries as equity in the consolidated financial statements. This topic is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2008, which is our fiscal year 2010. We are currently evaluating the impact, if any, that this rule may have on our financial condition and results of operations. Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates Management’s discussion and analysis of the financial condition and results of operations is based upon the consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue and expenses, and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. We base our estimates and judgments on historical experience, knowledge of current conditions and beliefs of what could occur in the future based on available information. We consider the following accounting policies to be both those most important to the portrayal of our financial condition and those that require the most subjective judgment. If actual results differ significantly from management’s estimates and projections, there could be a material effect on our financial statements. We also have other policies that we consider key accounting policies, such as our policy for revenue recognition, including the deferral of revenue on sales to distributors until 38 the products are sold to the end user; however, the application of these policies does not require us to make significant estimates or judgments that are difficult or subjective. Inventory Valuation We value inventories at the lower of cost (first-in, first-out method) or market. Because of the cyclical nature of the semiconductor industry, changes in inventory levels, obsolescence of technology, and product life cycles, we write down inventories to net realizable value. We employ a variety of methodologies to determine the net realizable value of inventory. While a portion of the calculation is determined via reference to the age of inventory and lower of cost or market calculations, an element of the calculation is subject to significant judgments made by us about future demand for our inventory. If actual demand for our products is less than our estimates, additional adjustments to existing inventories may need to be recorded in future periods. To date, our actual results have not been materially different than our estimates, and we do not expect them to be materially different in the future. Allowance for Doubtful Accounts We maintain allowances for doubtful accounts, when appropriate, for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments. If the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate, our actual losses may exceed our estimates, and additional allowances would be required. To date, our actual results have not been materially different than our estimates, and we do not expect them to be materially different in the future. Long-Lived Assets We review property, plant, and equipment and intangible assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of assets may not be recoverable. Recoverability of these assets is measured by comparison of their carrying value to future undiscounted cash flows that the assets are expected to generate over their remaining economic lives. If such assets are considered to be impaired, the impairment to be recognized in earnings equals the amount by which the carrying value of the assets exceeds their fair value determined by either a quoted market price, if any, or a value determined by utilizing a discounted cash flow technique. Although we have recognized no material impairment adjustments related to our property, plant, and equipment and identified intangible assets during the past three fiscal years, except those made in conjunction with restructuring actions, deterioration in our business in the future could lead to such impairment adjustments in future periods. Evaluation of impairment of long-lived assets requires estimates of future operating results that are used in the preparation of the expected future undiscounted cash flows. Actual future operating results and the remaining economic lives of our long-lived assets could differ from the estimates used in assessing the recoverability of these assets. These differences could result in impairment charges, which could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations. In addition, in certain instances, assets may not be impaired but their estimated useful lives may have decreased. In these situations, we amortize the remaining net book values over the revised useful lives. Goodwill Goodwill is subject to annual impairment tests, or earlier if indicators of potential impairment exist and suggest that the carrying value of goodwill may not be recoverable from estimated discounted future cash flows. We test goodwill for impairment at the reporting unit level (operating segment or one level below an operating segment) on an annual basis in the fourth quarter or more frequently if we believe indicators of impairment exist. The performance of the test involves a two-step process. The first step of the impairment test involves comparing the fair values of the applicable reporting units with their aggregate carrying values, including goodwill. We generally determine the fair value of our reporting units using the income approach methodology of valuation that includes the discounted cash flow method as well as other generally accepted valuation methodologies, which requires significant judgment by management. If the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds the reporting unit’s fair value, we perform the second step of the goodwill impairment test to determine the amount of impairment loss. The second step of the goodwill impairment test involves comparing the implied fair value of the affected reporting unit’s goodwill with the carrying value of that goodwill. These impairment tests may result in impairment losses that could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations. 39 Accounting for Income Taxes We must make certain estimates and judgments in determining income tax expense for financial statement purposes. These estimates and judgments occur in the calculation of tax credits, benefits, and deductions, and in the calculation of certain tax assets and liabilities, which arise from differences in the timing of the recognition of revenue and expense for tax and financial statement purposes, as well as the interest and penalties relating to these uncertain tax positions. We assessed the likelihood of the realization of deferred tax assets and concluded that a valuation allowance is needed to reserve the amount of the deferred tax assets that may not be realized due to the expiration of certain state credit carryovers. In reaching our conclusion, we evaluated certain relevant criteria including the existence of deferred tax liabilities that can be used to absorb deferred tax assets, the taxable income in prior carryback years in the impacted state jurisdictions that can be used to absorb net operating losses and taxable income in future years. Our judgments regarding future profitability may change due to future market conditions, changes in U.S. or international tax laws and other factors. These changes, if any, may require material adjustments to these deferred tax assets, resulting in a reduction in net income or an increase in net loss in the period when such determinations are made, which in turn, may result in an increase or decrease to our tax provision in a subsequent period. On November 4, 2007 (the first day of our 2008 fiscal year), we adopted new accounting principles on accounting for uncertain tax positions. These principles requires companies to determine that it is “more likely than not” that a tax position will be sustained by the appropriate taxing authorities before any benefit can be recorded in the financial statements. An uncertain income tax position is not recognized if it has less than a 50% likelihood of being sustained. For those tax positions where it is more likely than not that a tax benefit will be sustained, we have recorded the largest amount of tax benefit with a greater than 50 percent likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement with a taxing authority that has full knowledge of all relevant information. For those income tax positions where it is not more likely than not that a tax benefit will be sustained, no tax benefit has been recognized in the financial statements. We reevaluate these uncertain tax positions on a quarterly basis. This evaluation is based on factors including, but not limited to, changes in known facts or circumstances, changes in tax law, effectively settled issues under audit, and new audit activity. A change in these factors would result in the recognition of a tax benefit or an additional charge to the tax provision. In the ordinary course of global business, there are many transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax outcome is uncertain. Some of these uncertainties arise as a consequence of cost reimbursement and royalty arrangements among related entities. Although we believe our estimates are reasonable, no assurance can be given that the final tax outcome of these matters will not be different than that which is reflected in our historical income tax provisions and accruals. In the event our assumptions are incorrect, the differences could have a material impact on our income tax provision and operating results in the period in which such determination is made. Stock-Based Compensation Stock-based compensation expense associated with stock options and related awards is recognized in the statement of income. Determining the amount of stock-based compensation to be recorded requires us to develop estimates to be used in calculating the grant-date fair value of stock options. We calculate the grant-date fair values using the Black-Scholes valuation model. The use of valuation models requires us to make estimates of the following assumptions: Expected volatility — We are responsible for estimating volatility and have considered a number of factors, including third-party estimates, when estimating volatility. We currently believe that the exclusive use of implied volatility results in the best estimate of the grant-date fair value of employee stock options because it reflects the market’s current expectations of future volatility. In evaluating the appropriateness of exclusively relying on implied volatility, we concluded that: (1) options in our common stock are actively traded with sufficient volume on several exchanges; (2) the market prices of both the traded options and the underlying shares are measured at a similar point in time to each other and on a date close to the grant date of the employee share options; (3) the traded options have exercise prices that are both near-the-money and close to the exercise price of the employee share options; and (4) the maturities of the traded options used to estimate volatility are at least one year. 40 Expected term — We use historical employee exercise and option expiration data to estimate the expected term assumption for the Black-Scholes grant-date valuation. We believe that this historical data is currently the best estimate of the expected term of a new option, and that generally, all of our employees exhibit similar exercise behavior. In general, the longer the expected term used in the Black-Scholes valuation model, the higher the grant-date fair value of the option. Risk-free interest rate — The yield on zero-coupon U.S. Treasury securities for a period that is commensurate with the expected term assumption is used as the risk-free interest rate. Expected dividend yield — Expected dividend yield is calculated by annualizing the cash dividend declared by our Board of Directors for the current quarter and dividing that result by the closing stock price on the date of grant of the option. Until such time as our Board of Directors declares a cash dividend for an amount that is different from the current quarter’s cash dividend, the current dividend will be used in deriving this assumption. Cash dividends are not paid on options, restricted stock or restricted stock units. The amount of stock-based compensation expense recognized during a period is based on the value of the portion of the awards that are ultimately expected to vest. Forfeitures are estimated at the time of grant and revised, if necessary, in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates. The term “forfeitures” is distinct from “cancellations” or “expirations” and represents only the unvested portion of the surrendered option. Based on an analysis of our historical forfeitures, we have applied an annual forfeiture rate of 4.3% to all unvested stock-based awards as of October 31, 2009. The rate of 4.3% represents the portion that is expected to be forfeited each year over the vesting period. This analysis is re-evaluated quarterly and the forfeiture rate is adjusted as necessary. Ultimately, the actual expense recognized over the vesting period will only be for those awards that vest. Contingencies From time to time, we receive notices that our products or manufacturing processes allegedly infringe the patent or intellectual property rights of others. We periodically assess each matter to determine if a contingent liability should be recorded. In making this determination, we may, depending on the nature of the matter, consult with internal and external legal counsel and technical experts. Based on the information we obtain, combined with our judgment regarding all the facts and circumstances of each matter, we determine whether it is probable that a contingent loss may be incurred and whether the amount of such loss can be reasonably estimated. If a loss is probable and reasonably estimable, we record a contingent loss. In determining the amount of a contingent loss, we consider advice received from experts in the specific matter, current status of legal proceedings, settlement negotiations that may be ongoing, prior case history and other factors. If the judgments and estimates made by us are incorrect, we may need to record additional contingent losses that could materially adversely impact our results of operations. ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK Interest Rate Exposure Based on our marketable securities and short term investments outstanding as of October 31, 2009 and November 1, 2008, our annual interest income would change by approximately $20 million and $14 million, respectively, for each 100 basis point increase in interest rates. To provide a meaningful assessment of the interest rate risk associated with our investment portfolio, we performed a sensitivity analysis to determine the impact a change in interest rates would have on the value of our investment portfolio assuming a 100 basis point parallel shift in the yield curve. Based on investment positions as of October 31, 2009, a hypothetical 100 basis point increase in interest rates across all maturities would result in a $3 million incremental decline in the fair market value of the portfolio. As of November 1, 2008, a similar 100 basis point shift in the yield curve would have resulted in a $2 million incremental decline in the fair market value of the portfolio. Such losses would only be realized if we sold the investments prior to maturity. In June 2009, we entered into an interest rate swap agreement to hedge the benchmark interest rate of our $375 million 5.0% senior unsecured notes due July 1, 2014. The effect of the swap was to convert our 5.0% fixed 41 interest rate to a variable interest rate based on the three-month LIBOR plus 2.05% (2.34% as of October 31, 2009). If LIBOR changes by 100 basis points, our annual interest expense would change by $3.8 million. Foreign Currency Exposure As more fully described in Note 2i. in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements contained in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, we regularly hedge our non-U.S. dollar-based exposures by entering into forward foreign currency exchange contracts. The terms of these contracts are for periods matching the duration of the underlying exposure and generally range from one month to twelve months. Currently, our largest foreign currency exposure is the Euro, primarily because our European operations have the highest proportion of our local currency denominated expenses. Relative to foreign currency exposures existing at October 31, 2009 and November 1, 2008, a 10% unfavorable movement in foreign currency exchange rates over the course of the year would not expose us to significant losses in earnings or cash flows because we hedge a high proportion of our year-end exposures against fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. The market risk associated with our derivative instruments results from currency exchange rate or interest rate movements that are expected to offset the market risk of the underlying transactions, assets and liabilities being hedged. The counterparties to the agreements relating to our foreign exchange instruments consist of a number of major international financial institutions with high credit ratings. We do not believe that there is significant risk of nonperformance by these counterparties because we continually monitor the credit ratings of such counterparties. While the contract or notional amounts of derivative financial instruments provide one measure of the volume of these transactions, they do not represent the amount of our exposure to credit risk. The amounts potentially subject to credit risk (arising from the possible inability of counterparties to meet the terms of their contracts) are generally limited to the amounts, if any, by which the counterparties’ obligations under the contracts exceed our obligations to the counterparties. The following table illustrates the effect that a 10% unfavorable or favorable movement in foreign currency exchange rates, relative to the U.S. dollar, would have on the fair value of our forward exchange contracts as of October 31, 2009 and November 1, 2008: October 31, 2009 November 1, 2008 Fair value of forward exchange contracts asset (liability) $ 6,427 $ (23,158 ) Fair value of forward exchange contracts after a 10% unfavorable movement in foreign currency exchange rates asset (liability) $ 20,132 $ (9,457 ) Fair value of forward exchange contracts after a 10% favorable movement in foreign currency exchange rates liability $ (6,781 ) $ (38,294 ) The calculation assumes that each exchange rate would change in the same direction relative to the U.S. dollar. In addition to the direct effects of changes in exchange rates, such changes typically affect the volume of sales or the foreign currency sales price as competitors’ products become more or less attractive. Our sensitivity analysis of the effects of changes in foreign currency exchange rates does not factor in a potential change in sales levels or local currency selling prices. 42",2023-12-30 19:09:04.739643

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (all tabular amounts in thousands except per share amounts) This Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, including in particular the section entitled “Outlook,” contains forward-looking statements regarding future events and our future results that are subject to the safe harbors created under the Securities Act of 1933 (the “Securities Act”) and the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the “Exchange Act”). These statements are based on current expectations, estimates, forecasts, and projections about the industries in which we operate and the beliefs and assumptions of our management. Words such as “expects,” “anticipates,” “targets,” “goals,” “projects,” “intends,” “plans,” “believes,” “seeks,” “estimates,” “continues,” “may,” variations of such words and similar expressions are intended to identify such forward-looking statements. In addition, any statements that refer to projections regarding our future financial performance, particularly in light of the uncertainty remaining after the global credit and financial market crisis over the past two years; our anticipated growth and trends in our businesses, our future capital needs and capital expenditures; our future market position and competitive changes in the marketplace for our products; our ability to innovate new products and technologies; the timing or the effectiveness of our continuing efforts to refocus our operations and reduce our cost structure and the expected amounts of any cost savings related to those efforts; our ability to access credit or capital markets; our ability to pay dividends or repurchase stock; our ability to service our outstanding debt; our expected tax rate; the future actions of our third-party suppliers; our reliance on assembly and test subcontractors, third party wafer fabricators and independent distributors; the expected outcomes of intellectual property and litigation matters; the ability to safeguard our patents and intellectual property; potential acquisitions or divestitures; the continued availability of key personnel; the global nature of our operations; the effect of new accounting pronouncements; and other characterizations of future events or circumstances are forward-looking statements. Readers are cautioned that these forward-looking statements are only predictions and are subject to risks, uncertainties, and assumptions that are difficult to predict, including those identified in Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors and elsewhere in our Annual Report on Form 10-K. Therefore, actual results may differ materially and adversely from those expressed in any forward-looking statements. We undertake no obligation to revise or update any forward-looking statements except to the extent required by law. During the first quarter of fiscal 2008, we sold our baseband chipset business and related support operations, or Baseband Chipset Business, to MediaTek Inc. and sold our CPU voltage regulation and PC thermal monitoring business to certain subsidiaries of ON Semiconductor Corporation. The financial results of these businesses are presented as discontinued operations in the consolidated statements of income for all periods presented. The assets related to these businesses are reflected as non-current assets of discontinued operations in the consolidated balance sheet as of October 31, 2009. Unless otherwise noted, this Management’s Discussion and Analysis relates only to financial results from continuing operations. Results of Operations Overview Fiscal Year 2010 2009 2008 Revenue $ 2,761,503 $ 2,014,908 $ 2,582,931 Gross Margin % 65.2 % 55.5 % 61.1 % Net income from Continuing Operations $ 711,225 $ 247,408 $ 525,177 Net income from Continuing Operations as a % of Revenue 25.8 % 12.3 % 20.3 % Diluted EPS from Continuing Operations $ 2.33 $ 0.85 $ 1.77 Diluted EPS $ 2.33 $ 0.85 $ 2.65 The year-to-year revenue changes by end market and product category are more fully outlined below under Revenue Trends by End Market and Revenue Trends by Product. In fiscal 2010, our revenue increased 37% from fiscal 2009 and our diluted earnings per share from continuing operations increased from $0.85 to $2.33. Cash flow from operations in fiscal 2010 was $991.2 million, or 36% of revenue. In addition, we received $216.1 million in net proceeds related to employee stock option exercises, 26 Table of Contents distributed $250 million to our shareholders in dividend payments and paid $111.6 million for capital expenditures. These factors contributed to the net increase in cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments of $871.8 million in fiscal 2010. The year-to-year increase in revenue from fiscal 2009 to fiscal 2010 was the result of a resurgence in economic activity from the low levels achieved during 2009 as a result of the general economic downturn following the global credit and financial crisis. The strategy we employed during the start of the economic downturn to be more focused on products and markets that value innovation and to make fundamental improvements to our cost structure aided in our growth. Improving macro trends in the industrial, communications, automotive and healthcare markets helped, and we believe will continue to help, to generate strong growth opportunities for us in the future. However, these trends remain uncertain and we cannot predict the sustainability of the current economic conditions. Consequently, our reported results for fiscal 2010 may not be indicative of our future results. Revenue Trends by End Market The following table summarizes revenue by end market. The categorization of revenue by end market is determined using a variety of data points including the technical characteristics of the product, the “sold to” customer information, the “ship to” customer information and the end customer product or application into which our product will be incorporated. As data systems for capturing and tracking this data evolve and improve, the categorization of products by end market can vary over time. When this occurs, we reclassify revenue by end market for prior periods. Such reclassifications typically do not materially change the sizing of, or the underlying trends of results within, each end market. 2010 2009 2008 % of % of % of Total Total Total Product Product Product Revenue Revenue* Y/Y% Revenue Revenue Revenue Revenue Industrial $ 1,266,423 46 % 48 % $ 857,950 43 % $ 1,143,333 44 % Automotive 333,045 12 % 66 % 200,989 10 % 255,172 10 % Consumer 513,348 19 % 23 % 417,652 21 % 538,202 21 % Communications 595,709 22 % 21 % 493,409 24 % 559,006 22 % Computer 52,978 2 % 18 % 44,908 2 % 87,218 3 % Total Revenue $ 2,761,503 100 % 37 % $ 2,014,908 100 % $ 2,582,931 100 % * The sum of the individual percentages do not equal the total due to rounding. Industrial — The year-to-year increase in revenue from fiscal 2009 to fiscal 2010 in industrial end market revenue was primarily the result of a broad-based increase in demand in this end market, which was most significant for products sold into the instrumentation and automation sectors. The year-to-year decrease in revenue from fiscal 2008 to fiscal 2009 in industrial end market revenue was primarily the result of a broad-based decline in demand in this end market, which was most significant for products sold into the instrumentation and process controls sectors. Automotive — The year-to-year increase in revenue from fiscal 2009 to fiscal 2010 in automotive end market revenue was primarily the result of increased demand due to various government-initiated incentive programs, inventory replenishment and a general increase in the electronic content found in vehicles. The year-to-year decrease in revenue from fiscal 2008 to fiscal 2009 in automotive end market revenue was primarily due to economic conditions relating to the global credit crisis resulting in cautious customer spending behavior. Consumer — The year-to-year increase in revenue from fiscal 2009 to fiscal 2010 in consumer end market revenue was primarily the result of a broad-based increase in demand for products used in digital cameras and other consumer applications. The year-to-year decrease in revenue from fiscal 2008 to fiscal 2009 in consumer end market revenue was primarily the result of a decrease in demand for products used in home entertainment, digital cameras and video game applications, consistent with the global slowdown in consumer spending. 27 Table of Contents Communications — The year-to-year increase in revenue from fiscal 2009 to fiscal 2010 in communications end market revenue was primarily the result of a broad-based increase in demand in this end market, which was most significant for the infrastructure sector. The year-to-year decrease from fiscal 2008 to fiscal 2009 in communications end market revenue was primarily the result of a decrease in sales of analog products used in basestations, wireless handsets and networking applications. Revenue Trends by Product The following table summarizes revenue by product categories. The categorization of our products into broad categories is based on the characteristics of the individual products, the specification of the products and in some cases the specific uses that certain products have within applications. The categorization of products into categories is therefore subject to judgment in some cases and can vary over time. In instances where products move between product categories we reclassify the amounts in the product categories for all prior periods. Such reclassifications typically do not materially change the sizing of, or the underlying trends of results within, each product category. 2010 2009 2008 % of % of % of Total Total Total Product Product Product Revenue Revenue Y/Y% Revenue Revenue* Revenue Revenue* Converters $ 1,286,344 47 % 29 % $ 999,227 50 % $ 1,235,378 48 % Amplifiers/Radio frequency 703,082 25 % 40 % 502,972 25 % 666,893 26 % Other analog 342,473 12 % 55 % 221,110 11 % 272,950 11 % Subtotal analog signal processing 2,331,899 84 % 35 % 1,723,309 86 % 2,175,221 84 % Power management & reference 194,761 7 % 65 % 118,258 6 % 143,572 6 % Total analog products $ 2,526,660 91 % 37 % $ 1,841,567 91 % $ 2,318,793 90 % Digital signal processing 234,843 9 % 35 % 173,341 9 % 264,138 10 % Total Revenue $ 2,761,503 100 % 37 % $ 2,014,908 100 % $ 2,582,931 100 % * The sum of the individual percentages do not equal the total due to rounding. The increase in total revenue from fiscal 2009 to fiscal 2010 was the result of a broad-based increase in sales across all of our product categories. The decrease in revenue from fiscal 2008 to fiscal 2009 was due to declining demand across our product categories in every market that we serve, particularly the industrial and consumer end markets, as a result of an overall decline in the worldwide economy. Revenue Trends by Geographic Region The percentage of product sales from continuing operations by geographic region, based upon point of sale, for the last three fiscal years is as follows: Fiscal Year Region 2010 2009 2008 United States 19 % 20 % 20 % Rest of North and South America 6 % 5 % 4 % Europe 25 % 25 % 26 % Japan 16 % 17 % 19 % China 18 % 19 % 16 % Rest of Asia 16 % 14 % 15 % 28 Table of Contents In fiscal year 2010 and 2009, the predominant countries comprising “Rest of North and South America” are Canada and Mexico; the predominant countries comprising “Europe” are Germany, Sweden, France and the United Kingdom; and the predominant countries comprising “Rest of Asia” are Taiwan, South Korea and Singapore. In fiscal year 2008, the predominant countries comprising “Rest of North and South America” are Canada and Mexico; the predominant countries comprising “Europe” are Germany, France and the United Kingdom; and the predominant countries comprising “Rest of Asia” are Taiwan and South Korea. Sales increased in all geographic regions in fiscal 2010 as compared to fiscal 2009, with sales in Europe and the Rest of Asia experiencing the largest increases. The increase in sales was the result of an increase in demand for our products primarily as a result of improving economic conditions worldwide. Sales declined in all geographic regions in fiscal 2009, as compared to fiscal 2008, with sales in Europe and Japan experiencing the largest decline. This decline in sales in Europe was partially attributable to a decline in the automotive end market. The decline in sales in Japan was principally attributable to the general decline in consumer spending as a result of the global economic crisis. The decline in China was smaller than the decline in the other regions primarily due to the strong demand for our products used in China’s recent infrastructure build-out of the country’s next generation of communication technology. Gross Margin Fiscal Year 2010 2009 2008 Gross Margin $ 1,799,422 $ 1,118,637 $ 1,577,275 Gross Margin % 65.2 % 55.5 % 61.1 % Gross margin percentage was higher in fiscal 2010 by 970 basis points as compared to fiscal 2009 primarily as a result of an increase in sales of $746.6 million, increased operating levels in our manufacturing facilities and the impact of ongoing efforts to reduce overall manufacturing costs, including the savings realized as a result of wafer fabrication facility consolidations. Additionally, a higher proportion of our revenues was from products sold into the instrumentation and automation sectors of the industrial end market, which earn higher margins as compared to products sold into our other end markets. Gross margin percentage was lower in fiscal 2009 by 560 basis points as compared to fiscal 2008, primarily as a result of a decrease in sales of $568.0 million and reduced operating levels in our manufacturing facilities that created adverse utilization variances. Research and Development (R&D) Fiscal Year 2010 2009 2008 R&D Expenses $ 492,305 $ 446,980 $ 533,480 R&D Expenses as a % of Revenue 17.8 % 22.2 % 20.7 % Research and development, or R&D, expenses in fiscal 2010 increased $45.3 million, or 10%, from fiscal 2009. The increase was primarily the result of an increase in variable compensation expense, which is a variable expense linked to our overall profitability, partially offset by the impact of actions we took over the past two years to control discretionary spending and permanently reduce operating expenses. R&D expenses in fiscal 2009 decreased $86.5 million, or 16%, from fiscal 2008. This decrease was primarily the result of the actions we took to constrain or permanently reduce operating expenses as well as a decrease in variable compensation expenses. R&D expenses as a percentage of revenue will fluctuate from year-to-year depending on the amount of revenue and the success of new product development efforts, which we view as critical to our future growth. At any point in time we have hundreds of R&D projects underway, and we believe that none of these projects is material on an individual basis. We expect to continue the development of innovative technologies and processes for new products, and we believe that a continued commitment to R&D is essential in order to maintain product leadership with our 29 Table of Contents existing products and to provide innovative new product offerings, and therefore we expect to continue to make significant R&D investments in the future. Selling, Marketing, General and Administrative (SMG&A) Fiscal Year 2010 2009 2008 SMG&A Expenses $ 390,560 $ 333,184 $ 415,682 SMG&A Expenses as a % of Revenue 14.1 % 16.5 % 16.1 % Selling, marketing, general and administrative, or SMG&A, expenses in fiscal 2010 increased $57.4 million, or 17%, from fiscal 2009. The increase was primarily the result of an increase in variable compensation expense, which is a variable expense linked to our overall profitability, and higher sales commission expenses, which are variable expenses linked to our sales. These increases were offset by the impact of actions we took over the past two years to control discretionary spending and permanently reduce operating expenses. SMG&A expenses in fiscal 2009 decreased $82.5 million, or 20%, from fiscal 2008. This decrease was primarily the result of our actions taken to constrain or permanently reduce operating expenses as well as a decrease in variable compensation expenses. Stock-based Compensation Expense As of October 30, 2010, the total compensation cost related to unvested equity awards not yet recognized in our statement of income was approximately $95 million (before tax consideration), which we will recognize over a weighted average period of 1.4 years. During fiscal 2009, our shareholders approved and we completed an employee stock option exchange program (Option Exchange). The Option Exchange provided our eligible employees, excluding our named executive officers and directors, the opportunity to exchange eligible stock option grants for a smaller number of new stock options with a lower exercise price, or in some instances cash, that had approximately the same fair value as the options surrendered. See Note 3 in the Notes to our Consolidated Financial Statements contained in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further information on our stock based compensation. Special Charges The following is a summary of ongoing restructuring actions we have taken over the last several years. Closure of Wafer Fabrication Facility in Sunnyvale We ceased production at our California wafer fabrication facility in November 2006. We paid the related lease obligation costs on a monthly basis over the remaining lease term, which expired in March 2010. We recorded a one-time settlement charge of $0.4 million in the first quarter of fiscal 2010 related to the termination of the lease. This action was completed in fiscal 2010. Consolidation of a Wafer Fabrication Facility in Limerick In fiscal 2007, we recorded a special charge of $13.7 million as a result of our decision to only use eight-inch technology at our wafer fabrication facility in Limerick. Certain manufacturing processes and products produced on the Limerick facility’s six-inch production line have transitioned to our existing eight-inch production line in Limerick while others have transitioned to external foundries. The charge was for severance and fringe benefit costs recorded in accordance with our ongoing benefit plan for 150 manufacturing employees associated with this action. We terminated the employment of all employees associated with these programs and have paid out all amounts owed to employees as severance. During fiscal 2008, we recorded an additional charge of $1.5 million related to this action, of which $1.2 million was an adjustment to the original estimate of the severance costs and $0.3 million was for clean-up and closure costs that we expensed as incurred. During fiscal 2009, we recorded additional charges of 30 Table of Contents $1.2 million for clean-up and closure costs that we expensed as incurred. The production in the six-inch wafer fabrication facility ceased during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2009. This action was completed in fiscal 2010. The closure of this facility resulted in annual cost savings of approximately $25 million per year, which we began realizing in the first quarter of fiscal 2010. These savings are recorded in cost of sales, of which approximately $1 million relates to non-cash depreciation savings. Reduction of Operating Costs During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2008, in order to further reduce our operating cost structure, we recorded a special charge of $1.6 million for severance and fringe benefit costs recorded in accordance with our ongoing benefit plan or the statutory requirements at foreign locations for 19 engineering, selling, marketing, general and administrative employees. During fiscal 2009, we recorded an additional charge of $30.3 million related to this cost reduction action. Approximately $2.1 million of this charge was for lease obligation costs for facilities that we ceased using during the first quarter of fiscal 2009; approximately $0.8 million was for the write-off of property, plant and equipment no longer used as a result of this action; and approximately $0.5 million was for contract termination costs and approximately $0.3 million was for clean-up and closure costs that we expensed as incurred. The remaining $26.6 million related to the severance and fringe benefit costs recorded in accordance with our ongoing benefit plan or statutory requirements at foreign locations for 245 manufacturing employees and 302 engineering and SMG&A employees. This cost reduction action, which was substantially completed during the second quarter of fiscal 2009, resulted in annual savings of approximately $36.4 million. These annual savings are being realized as follows: approximately $31.6 million in SMG&A expenses and approximately $4.8 million in cost of sales. During the first quarter of fiscal 2010, we recorded an additional charge of $11.4 million related to the further reduction of our operating cost structure. Approximately $10.9 million of this charge was for severance and fringe benefit costs recorded in accordance with our ongoing benefit plan or statutory requirements at foreign locations for 149 engineering and SMG&A employees. Approximately $0.5 million of the charge relates to our decision to abandon efforts to develop a particular expertise in power management, resulting in the impairment of related intellectual property. When fully implemented in the first quarter of fiscal 2011, we estimate that these cost reduction actions will result in annual savings of approximately $16 million. We terminated the employment of all employees associated with this action and are paying amounts owed to employees for severance as income continuance. Closure of a Wafer Fabrication Facility in Cambridge During the first quarter of fiscal 2009, we recorded a special charge of $22.1 million as a result of our decision to consolidate our Cambridge, Massachusetts wafer fabrication facility into our existing Wilmington, Massachusetts facility. In connection with the anticipated closure of this facility, we evaluated the recoverability of the facility’s manufacturing assets and concluded that there was an impairment of approximately $12.9 million based on the revised period of intended use. The remaining $9.2 million was for severance and fringe benefit costs recorded in accordance with our ongoing benefit plan for 175 manufacturing employees and 9 SMG&A employees associated with this action. We finished production in the Cambridge wafer fabrication facility and began clean-up activities during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2009. During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2009 we reversed approximately $1.8 million of our severance accrual. The accrual reversal was required because 51 employees either voluntarily left the Company or found alternative employment within the Company. In addition, we recorded a special charge of approximately $1.7 million for the impairment of manufacturing assets that were originally going to be moved to our other wafer fabrication facilities but are no longer needed at those facilities and therefore have no future use. We also recorded a special charge of $0.1 million for clean-up costs as we began our clean-up of the Cambridge wafer fabrication facility at the end of the fourth quarter of fiscal 2009. We terminated the employment of all employees associated with this charge and are paying amounts owed to employees for severance as income continuance. We estimate that this action will result in annual cost savings of approximately $41 million per year, which we began realizing in the third quarter of fiscal 2010. We expect these annual savings to be realized as follows: approximately $40.2 million 31 Table of Contents in cost of sales, of which approximately $4.0 million relates to non-cash depreciation savings, and approximately $0.8 million relates to SMG&A expenses. During the first quarter of fiscal 2010, we recorded an additional charge of $4.7 million related to this cost reduction action. Approximately $3.4 million of the charge related to lease obligation costs for the Cambridge wafer fabrication facility, which we ceased using in the first quarter of fiscal 2010, and the remaining $1.3 million of the charge related to clean-up and closure costs. These cost reductions resulted in annual savings of approximately $2.4 million, which we began realizing in the first quarter of fiscal 2010. Operating Income from Continuing Operations Fiscal Year 2010 2009 2008 Operating income from Continuing Operations $ 900,074 $ 284,817 $ 625,025 Operating income from Continuing Operations as a % of Revenue 32.6 % 14.1 % 24.2 % The $615.3 million, or 216%, increase in operating income from continuing operations in fiscal 2010 as compared to fiscal 2009 was primarily the result of an increase in revenue of $746.6 million, a 970 basis point increase in gross margin percentage, and lower special charges recorded in fiscal 2010 as compared to fiscal 2009. The $340.2 million, or 54%, decrease in operating income from continuing operations in fiscal 2009 as compared to fiscal 2008 was primarily the result of a decrease in revenue of $568.0 million, a 560 basis point decrease in gross margin percentage and an increase of $50.6 million in special charges. This decrease in operating income from continuing operations was partially offset by a decrease in R&D and SMG&A expenses as more fully described above under the headings Research and Development and Selling, Marketing, General and Administrative. Nonoperating (Income) Expense Fiscal Year 2010 2009 2008 Interest expense $ 10,429 $ 4,094 $ — Interest income (9,837 ) (15,621 ) (41,041 ) Other, net (2,183 ) (1,100 ) (36 ) Total nonoperating income $ (1,591 ) $ (12,627 ) $ (41,077 ) Nonoperating income was lower by $11 million in fiscal 2010 as compared to fiscal 2009 primarily due to higher interest expense incurred during fiscal 2010 as a result of the issuance of $375 million aggregate principal 5.0% senior unsecured notes on June 30, 2009 resulting in a partial year of interest expense in 2009 compared to a full year in 2010. In addition, we earned lower interest income on investments as a result of lower interest rates in fiscal 2010 as compared to fiscal 2009. Nonoperating income was lower by $28.5 million in fiscal 2009 as compared to fiscal 2008 primarily due to lower interest income earned on investments as a result of lower interest rates in fiscal 2009 as compared to fiscal 2008. In addition, we incurred interest expense during fiscal 2009 as a result of the issuance of $375 million aggregate principal 5.0% senior unsecured notes on June 30, 2009. We entered into an interest rate swap in June 2009 that swaps the fixed rate of the notes to a variable rate based on the three-month LIBOR plus 2.05%. Provision for Income Taxes Fiscal Year 2010 2009 2008 Provision for Income Taxes $ 190,440 $ 50,036 $ 140,925 Effective Income Tax Rate 21.1 % 16.8 % 21.2 % 32 Table of Contents Our effective tax rate reflects the applicable tax rate in effect in the various tax jurisdictions around the world where our income is earned. Our effective tax rate for fiscal 2010 was higher compared to our effective tax rate for fiscal 2009 primarily as a result of a change in the mix of our income to jurisdictions where income is taxed at a higher rate. In addition, higher special charges recorded in fiscal 2009, a majority of which provided a tax benefit at the higher U.S. tax rate contributed to a higher effective tax rate for fiscal 2010 as compared to fiscal 2009. Our effective tax rate for fiscal 2009 was lower compared to our effective tax rate for fiscal 2008 primarily as a result of our recording special charges of $53.7 million in fiscal 2009, a majority of which provided a tax benefit at the higher U.S. tax rate, and as a result of a change in the mix of our income to jurisdictions where income is taxed at a lower rate. Income from Continuing Operations, Net of Tax Fiscal Year 2010 2009 2008 Income from Continuing Operations, net of tax $ 711,225 $ 247,408 $ 525,177 Income from Continuing Operations, net of tax as a % of Revenue 25.8 % 12.3 % 20.3 % Diluted EPS from Continuing Operations $ 2.33 $ 0.85 $ 1.77 Income from continuing operations, net of tax, in fiscal 2010 was higher than in fiscal 2009 by approximately $463.8 million primarily as a result of the $615.3 million increase in operating income that was partially offset by a higher provision for income taxes in fiscal 2010. Income from continuing operations, net of tax, in fiscal 2009 was lower than in fiscal 2008 by approximately $277.8 million primarily as a result of the $340.2 million decrease in operating income that was partially offset by a lower provision for income taxes in fiscal 2009. The impact of inflation and foreign currency exchange rate movement on our results of operations during the past three fiscal years has not been significant. Discontinued Operations Fiscal Year 2010 2009 2008 Income from Discontinued Operations, net of tax $ — $ 364 $ 12,779 Gain on sale of Discontinued Operations, net of tax 859 — 248,328 Total income from Discontinued Operations, net of tax $ 859 $ 364 $ 261,107 Diluted earnings per share from Discontinued Operations $ 0.00 $ 0.00 $ 0.88 We sold our Baseband Chipset Business to MediaTek Inc. and our CPU voltage regulation and PC thermal monitoring business to certain subsidiaries of ON Semiconductor Corporation during the first quarter of fiscal 2008. Accordingly, the results of the operations of these businesses have been presented as discontinued operations within the consolidated financial statements. Acquisitions In fiscal 2006, we acquired substantially all the outstanding stock of privately-held Integrant Technologies, Inc. (Integrant) of Seoul, Korea. The acquisition enabled us to enter the mobile TV market and strengthened our presence in the Asia region. We paid $8.4 million related to the purchase of shares from the founder of Integrant during the period from July 2007 through July 2009. We recorded these payments as additional goodwill. In fiscal 2006, we acquired all the outstanding stock of privately-held AudioAsics A/S (AudioAsics) of Roskilde, Denmark. The acquisition of AudioAsics allows us to continue developing low-power audio solutions, while expanding our presence in the Nordic and Eastern European regions. We paid additional cash payments of 33 Table of Contents $3.1 million during fiscal 2009 for the achievement of revenue-based milestones during the period from October 2006 through January 2009, which we recorded as additional goodwill. In addition, in accordance with the terms of the acquisition documents, we paid $3.2 million during fiscal 2009 based on the achievement of technological milestones during the period from October 2006 through January 2009, which we recorded as compensation expense in fiscal 2008. All revenue and technological milestones related to this acquisition have been met and no additional payments will be made. We have not provided pro forma results of operations for Integrant and AudioAsics in this report as they were not material to us on either an individual or an aggregate basis. We included the results of operations of each acquisition in our consolidated statement of income from the date of such acquisition. Liquidity and Capital Resources Fiscal Year 2010 2009 2008 Net Cash Provided by Operations $ 991,175 $ 432,148 $ 669,368 Net Cash Provided by Operations as a % of Revenue 35.9 % 21.4 % 25.9 % At October 30, 2010, cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments totaled $2,687.8 million, an increase of $871.8 million from the fourth quarter of fiscal 2009. The primary sources of funds for fiscal 2010 were net cash generated from operating activities of $991.2 million and $216.1 million in net proceeds from employee stock option exercises. The principal uses of funds for fiscal 2010 were dividend payments of $250.0 million and capital expenditures of $111.6 million. We sold our Baseband Chipset Business to MediaTek Inc. and our CPU voltage regulation and PC thermal monitoring business to certain subsidiaries of ON Semiconductor Corporation during the first quarter of fiscal 2008. The cash flows from these discontinued operations have been combined with the operating, investing and financing cash flows from continuing operations (i.e. no separate classification of cash flows from discontinued operations) for all periods presented. We believe the absence of the cash flows from these discontinued operations has not and will not have a material impact on our future liquidity and financial position. Additionally, as a result of these dispositions, we reclassified certain assets and liabilities related to these businesses to assets or liabilities of discontinued operations. See Note 2u. in the Notes to our Consolidated Financial Statements contained in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further information regarding these discontinued operations. Fiscal Year 2010 2009 Accounts Receivable $ 387,169 $ 301,036 Days Sales Outstanding* 46 48 Inventory $ 277,478 $ 253,161 Days Cost of Sales in Inventory* 100 92 * We use the annualized fourth quarter revenue in our calculation of days sales outstanding and we use the annualized fourth quarter cost of sales in our calculation of days cost of sales in inventory. Accounts receivable at October 30, 2010 increased $86.1 million, or 29%, from the end of the fourth quarter of fiscal 2009. The increase in receivables was the result of higher revenue in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2010 as compared to the fourth quarter of fiscal 2009. Inventory at October 30, 2010 increased by $24.3 million, or 10%, from the end of the fourth quarter of fiscal 2009. The increase in inventory relates primarily to an increase in manufacturing production to support higher sales demand. Current liabilities increased to $643.5 million at October 30, 2010, an increase of $256.9 million, or 66%, from $386.6 million at the end of fiscal 2009. This increase was primarily due to higher deferred income on shipments to distributors in fiscal 2010 as compared to fiscal 2009, and an increase in accrued liabilities relating to variable 34 Table of Contents compensation expense. In addition, income taxes payable increased in fiscal 2010 as compared to fiscal 2009 as a result of higher profits and a change in the mix of our income to jurisdictions where income is taxed at a higher rate. Net additions to property, plant and equipment including discontinued operations were $111.6 million in fiscal 2010, $56.1 million in fiscal 2009 and $157.4 million in fiscal 2008. We expect fiscal 2011 capital expenditures to be in the range of $120 million to $130 million. During fiscal 2010, our Board of Directors declared cash dividends totaling $0.84 per outstanding share of common stock resulting in aggregate dividend payments of $250.0 million. After the end of fiscal 2010, on November 19, 2010, our Board of Directors declared a cash dividend of $0.22 per outstanding share of our common stock. The dividend is payable on December 22, 2010 to shareholders of record on December 3, 2010 and is expected to total approximately $66 million. We currently expect quarterly dividends to continue at $0.22 per share, although they remain subject to declaration by our Board of Directors. The payment of future dividends, if any, will be based on several factors, including our financial performance, outlook and liquidity. Our common stock repurchase program has been in place since August 2004. In the aggregate, the Board of Directors has authorized us to repurchase $4 billion of our common stock under the program. Under the program, we may repurchase outstanding shares of our common stock from time to time in the open market and through privately negotiated transactions. Unless terminated earlier by resolution of our Board of Directors, the repurchase program will expire when we have repurchased all shares authorized under the program. As of October 30, 2010, we had repurchased a total of approximately 116.0 million shares of our common stock for approximately $3,948.2 million under this program. As of October 30, 2010, an additional $51.8 million remained available for repurchase of shares under the current authorized program. On November 19, 2010, our Board of Directors authorized the repurchase by us of an additional $1 billion of our common stock under our existing share repurchase program. The repurchased shares are held as authorized but unissued shares of common stock. We also from time to time repurchase shares in settlement of employee tax withholding obligations due upon the vesting of restricted stock or restricted stock units or the exercise of stock options, or in certain limited circumstances to satisfy the exercise price of options granted to our employees under our equity compensation plans. Any future common stock repurchases will be based on several factors including our financial performance, outlook, liquidity and the amount of cash we have available in the United States. On June 30, 2009, we issued $375 million aggregate principal amount of 5.0% senior unsecured notes due July 1, 2014 (the Notes) with annual interest payments of 5.0% paid in two installments on January 1 and July 1 of each year, commencing January 1, 2010. The net proceeds of the offering were $370.4 million, after issuing at a discount and deducting expenses, underwriting discounts and commissions, which will be amortized over the term of the Notes. We swapped the fixed interest portion of these Notes for a variable interest rate based on the three-month LIBOR plus 2.05% (2.34% as of October 30, 2010). The variable interest payments based on the variable annual rate are payable quarterly. The LIBOR based rate is set quarterly three months prior to the date of the interest payment. The indenture governing the Notes contains covenants that may limit our ability to: incur, create, assume or guarantee any debt for borrowed money secured by a lien upon a principal property; enter into sale and lease-back transactions with respect to a principal property; and consolidate with or merge into, or transfer or lease all or substantially all of our assets to any other party. In addition, we have a five-year $165 million unsecured revolving credit facility that expires in May 2013. To date, we have not borrowed under this credit facility but we may borrow in the future and use the proceeds for support of commercial paper issuance, stock repurchases, dividend payments, acquisitions, capital expenditures, working capital and other lawful corporate purposes. At October 30, 2010, our principal source of liquidity was $2,687.8 million of cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments. As of October 30, 2010, approximately $725.4 million of our cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments was held in the United States. The balance of our cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments was held outside the United States in various foreign subsidiaries. As we intend to reinvest certain of our foreign earnings indefinitely, this cash held outside the United States is not available to meet certain of our cash requirements in the United States, including for cash dividends and common stock repurchases. The volatility in the credit markets has generally diminished liquidity and capital availability in worldwide markets. While there are signs that conditions may be improving, there is no certainty that the current tentative recovery in credit and financial markets will continue. We are unable to predict the likely duration of the tentative 35 Table of Contents recovery in the credit and financial markets. However, we believe that our existing sources of liquidity and cash expected to be generated from future operations, together with existing and anticipated available long-term financing, will be sufficient to fund operations, capital expenditures, research and development efforts, dividend payments (if any) and purchases of stock (if any) under our stock repurchase program in the immediate future and for at least the next twelve months. The table below summarizes our contractual obligations and the amounts we owe under these contracts in specified periods as of October 30, 2010: Payment due by period Less than More than (thousands) Total 1 Year 1-3 Years 4-5 Years 5 Years Contractual obligations: Operating leasesa $ 85,729 $ 21,871 $ 21,400 $ 11,803 $ 30,655 Long-term debt obligations 375,000 — — 375,000 — Interest payments associated with long-term debt obligationsb 75,000 18,750 37,500 18,750 — Payments due under interest rate swap agreementsc 33,369 8,897 17,818 6,654 — Deferred compensation pland 8,690 — — — 8,690 Pension fundinge 8,965 8,965 — — — Total $ 586,753 $ 58,483 $ 76,718 $ 412,207 $ 39,345 (a) Certain of our operating lease obligations include escalation clauses. These escalating payment requirements are reflected in the table. (b) These interest payments are expected to be offset by the proceeds from our interest rate swap agreements. (c) These interest payments are based on a variable interest rate based on the three month LIBOR plus 2.05%. The actual payments will be based on the LIBOR based rate which is set quarterly three months prior to the date of the interest payments plus 2.05%. (d) These payments relate to obligations under our Deferred Compensation Plan. The deferred compensation plan allows certain members of management and other highly-compensated employees and non-employee directors to defer receipt of all or any portion of their compensation. The amount in the “More than 5 Years” column of the table represents the remaining total balance under the deferred compensation plan to be paid to participants who have not terminated employment. Since we cannot reasonably estimate the timing of withdrawals for participants who have not yet terminated employment we have included the future obligation to these participants in the “More than 5 Years” column of the table. (e) Our funding policy for our foreign defined benefit plans is consistent with the local requirements of each country. The payment obligations in the table are estimates of our expected contributions to these plans for fiscal year 2010. The actual future payments may differ from the amounts presented in the table and reasonable estimates of payments beyond one year are not practical because of potential future changes in variables such as plan asset performance, interest rates and the rate of increase in compensation levels. Purchase orders for the purchase of raw materials and other goods and services are not included in the table above. We are not able to determine the total amount of these purchase orders that represent contractual obligations, as purchase orders may represent authorizations to purchase rather than binding agreements. In addition, our purchase orders generally allow for cancellation without significant penalties. We do not have significant agreements for the purchase of raw materials or other goods specifying minimum quantities or set prices that exceed our expected short-term requirements. As of October 30, 2010, our total liabilities associated with uncertain tax positions was $28.3 million, which are included in “Other non-current liabilities” in our Consolidated Balance Sheet contained in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Due to the complexity associated with our tax uncertainties, we cannot make a reasonably reliable estimate of the period in which we expect to settle the non-current liabilities associated with these uncertain 36 Table of Contents tax positions. Therefore, we have not included these uncertain tax positions in the above contractual obligations table. The expected timing of payments and the amounts of the obligations discussed above are estimated based on current information available as of October 30, 2010. Off-balance Sheet Financing As of October 30, 2010, we had no off-balance sheet financing arrangements. Outlook The following statements are based on current expectations. These statements are forward-looking, and actual results may differ materially. Unless specifically mentioned, these statements do not give effect to the potential impact of any mergers, acquisitions, divestitures, or business combinations that may be announced or closed after the date of filing this report. These statements supersede all prior statements regarding our business outlook made by us. We are planning for revenue in the first quarter of fiscal 2011 to be in the range of $715 million to $740 million. Our plan is for gross margin for the first quarter of fiscal 2011 to be approximately 66%. We are planning for operating margins in the first quarter of fiscal 2011 to be in the range of 34.5% to 35.5%. As a result, our plan is for diluted EPS from continuing operations to be approximately $0.63 to $0.67 in the first quarter of fiscal 2011. New Accounting Pronouncements Revenue Arrangements That Include Software Elements In October 2009, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued Accounting Standards Update (ASU) No. 2009-14 — Software (Topic 985): Certain Revenue Arrangements That Include Software Elements (formerly EITF Issue No. 09-3). This standard removes tangible products from the scope of software revenue recognition guidance and also provides guidance on determining whether software deliverables in an arrangement that includes a tangible product are within the scope of the software revenue guidance. More specifically, if the software sold with or embedded within the tangible product is essential to the functionality of the tangible product, then this software, as well as undelivered software elements that relate to this software, are excluded from the scope of existing software revenue guidance. ASU No. 2009-14 is effective for fiscal years that begin on or after June 15, 2010, which is our fiscal year 2011. We are currently evaluating the impact, if any, that ASU No. 2009-14 may have on our financial condition and results of operations. Multiple-Deliverable Revenue Arrangements In October 2009, the FASB issued ASU No. 2009-13 — Revenue Recognition (Topic 605): Multiple-Deliverable Revenue Arrangements (formerly EITF Issue No. 08-1). This standard modifies the revenue recognition guidance for arrangements that involve the delivery of multiple elements, such as product, software, services or support, to a customer at different times as part of a single revenue generating transaction. This standard provides principles and application guidance to determine whether multiple deliverables exist, how the individual deliverables should be separated and how to allocate the revenue in the arrangement among those separate deliverables. The standard also expands the disclosure requirements for multiple deliverable revenue arrangements. ASU No. 2009-13 is effective for fiscal years that begin on or after June 15, 2010, which is our fiscal year 2011. We are currently evaluating the impact, if any, that ASU No. 2009-13 may have on our financial condition and results of operations. Variable Interest Entities In December 2009, the FASB issued ASU No. 2009-17 — Consolidations (Topic 810): Improvements to Financial Reporting by Enterprises Involved with Variable Interest Entities, which amends ASC 810, Consolidation. This standard requires an enterprise to perform an analysis to determine whether the enterprise’s variable 37 Table of Contents interest or interests give it a controlling financial interest in a variable interest entity. Additionally, an enterprise is required to assess whether it has an implicit financial responsibility to ensure that a variable interest entity operates as designed when determining whether it has the power to direct the activities of the variable interest entity that most significantly impact the entity’s economic performance. ASU No. 2009-17 is effective for fiscal years that begin after November 15, 2009, which is our fiscal year 2011. We are currently evaluating the impact, if any, that ASU No. 2009-17 may have on our financial condition and results of operations. Transfers of Financial Assets In June 2009, the FASB issued ASU No. 2009-16, Accounting for Transfers of Financial Assets, (Topic 820). This standard changes the way entities account for securitizations and other transfers of financial instruments. ASU No. 2009-16 is effective for fiscal years that begin after November 15, 2009, which is our fiscal year 2011. We are currently evaluating the impact, if any, that ASU No. 2009-16 may have on our financial condition and results of operations. Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates Management’s discussion and analysis of the financial condition and results of operations is based upon the consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue and expenses, and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. We base our estimates and judgments on historical experience, knowledge of current conditions and beliefs of what could occur in the future based on available information. We consider the following accounting policies to be both those most important to the portrayal of our financial condition and those that require the most subjective judgment. If actual results differ significantly from management’s estimates and projections, there could be a material effect on our financial statements. We also have other policies that we consider key accounting policies, such as our policy for revenue recognition, including the deferral of revenue on sales to distributors until the products are sold to the end user; however, the application of these policies does not require us to make significant estimates or judgments that are difficult or subjective. Inventory Valuation We value inventories at the lower of cost (first-in, first-out method) or market. Because of the cyclical nature of the semiconductor industry, changes in inventory levels, obsolescence of technology, and product life cycles, we write down inventories to net realizable value. We employ a variety of methodologies to determine the net realizable value of inventory. While a portion of the calculation is determined via reference to the age of inventory and lower of cost or market calculations, an element of the calculation is subject to significant judgments made by us about future demand for our inventory. If actual demand for our products is less than our estimates, additional adjustments to existing inventories may need to be recorded in future periods. To date, our actual results have not been materially different than our estimates, and we do not expect them to be materially different in the future. Allowance for Doubtful Accounts We maintain allowances for doubtful accounts, when appropriate, for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments. If the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate, our actual losses may exceed our estimates, and additional allowances would be required. To date, our actual results have not been materially different than our estimates, and we do not expect them to be materially different in the future. Long-Lived Assets We review property, plant, and equipment and intangible assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of assets may not be recoverable. Recoverability of these assets is measured by comparison of their carrying value to future undiscounted cash flows that the assets are expected to generate over their remaining economic lives. If such assets are considered to be impaired, the impairment to be 38 Table of Contents recognized in earnings equals the amount by which the carrying value of the assets exceeds their fair value determined by either a quoted market price, if any, or a value determined by utilizing a discounted cash flow technique. Although we have recognized no material impairment adjustments related to our property, plant, and equipment and identified intangible assets during the past three fiscal years, except those made in conjunction with restructuring actions, deterioration in our business in the future could lead to such impairment adjustments in future periods. Evaluation of impairment of long-lived assets requires estimates of future operating results that are used in the preparation of the expected future undiscounted cash flows. Actual future operating results and the remaining economic lives of our long-lived assets could differ from the estimates used in assessing the recoverability of these assets. These differences could result in impairment charges, which could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations. In addition, in certain instances, assets may not be impaired but their estimated useful lives may have decreased. In these situations, we amortize the remaining net book values over the revised useful lives. Goodwill Goodwill is subject to annual impairment tests or more frequently if indicators of potential impairment exist and suggest that the carrying value of goodwill may not be recoverable from estimated discounted future cash flows. We test goodwill for impairment at the reporting unit level (operating segment or one level below an operating segment) on an annual basis in the fourth quarter or more frequently if we believe indicators of impairment exist. The performance of the test involves a two-step process. The first step of the impairment test involves comparing the fair values of the applicable reporting units with their aggregate carrying values, including goodwill. We generally determine the fair value of our reporting units using the income approach methodology of valuation that includes the discounted cash flow method as well as other generally accepted valuation methodologies, which requires significant judgment by management. If the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds the reporting unit’s fair value, we perform the second step of the goodwill impairment test to determine the amount of impairment loss. The second step of the goodwill impairment test involves comparing the implied fair value of the affected reporting unit’s goodwill with the carrying value of that goodwill. These impairment tests may result in impairment losses that could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations. Accounting for Income Taxes We must make certain estimates and judgments in determining income tax expense for financial statement purposes. These estimates and judgments occur in the calculation of tax credits, benefits, and deductions, and in the calculation of certain tax assets and liabilities, which arise from differences in the timing of the recognition of revenue and expense for tax and financial statement purposes, as well as the interest and penalties relating to these uncertain tax positions. We assessed the likelihood of the realization of deferred tax assets and concluded that a valuation allowance is needed to reserve the amount of the deferred tax assets that may not be realized due to the uncertainty of the timing and amount of the realization of certain state credit carryovers. In reaching our conclusion, we evaluated certain relevant criteria including the existence of deferred tax liabilities that can be used to absorb deferred tax assets, the taxable income in prior carryback years in the impacted state jurisdictions that can be used to absorb net operating losses and taxable income in future years. Our judgments regarding future profitability may change due to future market conditions, changes in U.S. or international tax laws and other factors. These changes, if any, may require material adjustments to these deferred tax assets, resulting in a reduction in net income or an increase in net loss in the period when such determinations are made, which in turn, may result in an increase or decrease to our tax provision in a subsequent period. On November 4, 2007 (the first day of our 2008 fiscal year), we adopted new accounting principles on accounting for uncertain tax positions. These principles requires companies to determine that it is “more likely than not” that a tax position will be sustained by the appropriate taxing authorities before any benefit can be recorded in the financial statements. An uncertain income tax position is not recognized if it has less than a 50% likelihood of being sustained. For those tax positions where it is more likely than not that a tax benefit will be sustained, we have recorded the largest amount of tax benefit with a greater than 50 percent likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement with a taxing authority that has full knowledge of all relevant information. For those income tax positions where it is not more likely than not that a tax benefit will be sustained, no tax benefit has been recognized in the financial statements. We reevaluate these uncertain tax positions on a quarterly basis. This evaluation is based on 39 Table of Contents factors including, but not limited to, changes in known facts or circumstances, changes in tax law, effectively settled issues under audit, and new audit activity. A change in these factors would result in the recognition of a tax benefit or an additional charge to the tax provision. In the ordinary course of global business, there are many transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax outcome is uncertain. Some of these uncertainties arise as a consequence of cost reimbursement and royalty arrangements among related entities. Although we believe our estimates are reasonable, no assurance can be given that the final tax outcome of these matters will not be different than that which is reflected in our historical income tax provisions and accruals. In the event our assumptions are incorrect, the differences could have a material impact on our income tax provision and operating results in the period in which such determination is made. In addition to the factors described above, our current and expected effective tax rate is based on then-current tax law. Significant changes during the year in enacted tax law could affect these estimates. Stock-Based Compensation Stock-based compensation expense associated with stock options and related awards is recognized in the statement of income. Determining the amount of stock-based compensation to be recorded requires us to develop estimates to be used in calculating the grant-date fair value of stock options. We calculate the grant-date fair values using the Black-Scholes valuation model. The use of valuation models requires us to make estimates of the following assumptions: Expected volatility — We are responsible for estimating volatility and have considered a number of factors, including third-party estimates, when estimating volatility. We currently believe that the exclusive use of implied volatility results in the best estimate of the grant-date fair value of employee stock options because it reflects the market’s current expectations of future volatility. In evaluating the appropriateness of exclusively relying on implied volatility, we concluded that: (1) options in our common stock are actively traded with sufficient volume on several exchanges; (2) the market prices of both the traded options and the underlying shares are measured at a similar point in time to each other and on a date close to the grant date of the employee share options; (3) the traded options have exercise prices that are both near-the-money and close to the exercise price of the employee share options; and (4) the maturities of the traded options used to estimate volatility are at least one year. Expected term — We use historical employee exercise and option expiration data to estimate the expected term assumption for the Black-Scholes grant-date valuation. We believe that this historical data is currently the best estimate of the expected term of a new option, and that generally, all of our employees exhibit similar exercise behavior. In general, the longer the expected term used in the Black-Scholes valuation model, the higher the grant-date fair value of the option. Risk-free interest rate — The yield on zero-coupon U.S. Treasury securities for a period that is commensurate with the expected term assumption is used as the risk-free interest rate. Expected dividend yield — Expected dividend yield is calculated by annualizing the cash dividend declared by our Board of Directors for the current quarter and dividing that result by the closing stock price on the date of grant of the option. Until such time as our Board of Directors declares a cash dividend for an amount that is different from the current quarter’s cash dividend, the current dividend will be used in deriving this assumption. Cash dividends are not paid on options, restricted stock or restricted stock units. The amount of stock-based compensation expense recognized during a period is based on the value of the portion of the awards that are ultimately expected to vest. Forfeitures are estimated at the time of grant and revised, if necessary, in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates. The term “forfeitures” is distinct from “cancellations” or “expirations” and represents only the unvested portion of the surrendered option. Based on an analysis of our historical forfeitures, we have applied an annual forfeiture rate of 4.3% to all unvested stock-based awards as of October 30, 2010. The rate of 4.3% represents the portion that is expected to be forfeited each year over the vesting period. This analysis is re-evaluated quarterly and the forfeiture rate is adjusted as necessary. Ultimately, the actual expense recognized over the vesting period will only be for those awards that vest. 40 Table of Contents Contingencies From time to time, we receive demands from third parties alleging that our products or manufacturing processes infringe the patent or intellectual property rights of these parties. We periodically assess each matter to determine if a contingent liability should be recorded. In making this determination, we may, depending on the nature of the matter, consult with internal and external legal counsel and technical experts. Based on the information we obtain, combined with our judgment regarding all the facts and circumstances of each matter, we determine whether it is probable that a contingent loss may be incurred and whether the amount of such loss can be reasonably estimated. If a loss is probable and reasonably estimable, we record a contingent loss. In determining the amount of a contingent loss, we consider advice received from experts in the specific matter, current status of legal proceedings, settlement negotiations that may be ongoing, prior case history and other factors. If the judgments and estimates made by us are incorrect, we may need to record additional contingent losses that could materially adversely impact our results of operations. ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK Interest Rate Exposure Based on our marketable securities and short term investments outstanding as of October 30, 2010 and October 31, 2009, our annual interest income would change by approximately $27 million and $18 million, respectively, for each 100 basis point increase in interest rates. To provide a meaningful assessment of the interest rate risk associated with our investment portfolio, we performed a sensitivity analysis to determine the impact a change in interest rates would have on the value of our investment portfolio assuming a 100 basis point parallel shift in the yield curve. Based on investment positions as of October 30, 2010, a hypothetical 100 basis point increase in interest rates across all maturities would result in a $4 million incremental decline in the fair market value of the portfolio. As of October 31, 2009, a similar 100 basis point shift in the yield curve would have resulted in approximately $3 million of incremental decline in the fair market value of the portfolio. Such losses would only be realized if we sold the investments prior to maturity. In June 2009, we entered into an interest rate swap agreement to hedge the benchmark interest rate of our $375 million 5.0% senior unsecured notes due July 1, 2014. The effect of the swap was to convert our 5.0% fixed interest rate to a variable interest rate based on the three-month LIBOR plus 2.05% (2.34% as of October 30, 2010). If LIBOR changes by 100 basis points, our annual interest expense would change by approximately $4 million. Foreign Currency Exposure As more fully described in Note 2i. in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements contained in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, we regularly hedge our non-U.S. dollar-based exposures by entering into forward foreign currency exchange contracts. The terms of these contracts are for periods matching the duration of the underlying exposure and generally range from one month to twelve months. Currently, our largest foreign currency exposure is the Euro, primarily because our European operations have the highest proportion of our local currency denominated expenses. Relative to foreign currency exposures existing at October 30, 2010 and October 31, 2009, a 10% unfavorable movement in foreign currency exchange rates over the course of the year would expose us to approximately $6 million in losses in earnings or cash flows. The market risk associated with our derivative instruments results from currency exchange rate or interest rate movements that are expected to offset the market risk of the underlying transactions, assets and liabilities being hedged. The counterparties to the agreements relating to our foreign exchange instruments consist of a number of major international financial institutions with high credit ratings. We do not believe that there is significant risk of nonperformance by these counterparties because we continually monitor the credit ratings of such counterparties. While the contract or notional amounts of derivative financial instruments provide one measure of the volume of these transactions, they do not represent the amount of our exposure to credit risk. The amounts potentially subject to credit risk (arising from the possible inability of counterparties to meet the terms of their contracts) are generally limited to the amounts, if any, by which the counterparties’ obligations under the contracts exceed our obligations to the counterparties. 41 Table of Contents The following table illustrates the effect that a 10% unfavorable or favorable movement in foreign currency exchange rates, relative to the U.S. dollar, would have on the fair value of our forward exchange contracts as of October 30, 2010 and October 31, 2009: October 30, 2010 October 31, 2009 Fair value of forward exchange contracts asset $ 7,256 $ 8,367 Fair value of forward exchange contracts after a 10% unfavorable movement in foreign currency exchange rates asset $ 22,062 $ 20,132 Fair value of forward exchange contracts after a 10% favorable movement in foreign currency exchange rates liability $ (7,396 ) $ (6,781 ) The calculation assumes that each exchange rate would change in the same direction relative to the U.S. dollar. In addition to the direct effects of changes in exchange rates, such changes typically affect the volume of sales or the foreign currency sales price as competitors’ products become more or less attractive. Our sensitivity analysis of the effects of changes in foreign currency exchange rates does not factor in a potential change in sales levels or local currency selling prices. 42 Table of Contents",2023-12-30 19:09:05.707411
6281,ADI,ANALOG DEVICES INC,2011,"ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (all tabular amounts in thousands except per share amounts) During the first quarter of fiscal 2008, we sold our baseband chipset business and related support operations, or Baseband Chipset Business, to MediaTek Inc. and sold our CPU voltage regulation and PC thermal monitoring business to certain subsidiaries of ON Semiconductor Corporation. The financial results of these businesses are presented as discontinued operations in the consolidated statements of income for all periods presented. Unless otherwise noted, this Management’s Discussion and Analysis relates only to financial results from continuing operations. Results of Operations Overview Fiscal Year 2011 2010 2009 Revenue $ 2,993,320 $ 2,761,503 $ 2,014,908 Gross Margin % 66.4 % 65.2 % 55.5 % Net income from Continuing Operations $ 860,894 $ 711,225 $ 247,408 Net income from Continuing Operations as a % of Revenue 28.8 % 25.8 % 12.3 % Diluted EPS from Continuing Operations $ 2.79 $ 2.33 $ 0.85 Diluted EPS $ 2.81 $ 2.33 $ 0.85 The year-to-year revenue changes by end market and product category are more fully outlined below under Revenue Trends by End Market and Revenue Trends by Product. During fiscal 2011, our revenue increased 8%, as compared to fiscal 2010. Our diluted earnings per share from continuing operations increased to $2.79 in fiscal 2011 from $2.33 in fiscal 2010. Cash flow from operations in fiscal 2011 was $900.5 million or 30% of revenue. We received proceeds of $515.5 million during fiscal 2011 from the issuance of $375 million aggregate principal amount of 3.0% senior unsecured notes and from a $145 million term loan facility entered into by a wholly owned subsidiary of ours. In addition, we received $217.2 million in net proceeds from employee stock option exercises. During fiscal 2011, we repurchased a total of approximately 9.0 million shares of our common stock for an aggregate of $330.3 million, distributed $281.6 million to our shareholders in dividend payments and paid $123.0 million for property, plant and equipment additions. These factors contributed to the net increase in cash and cash equivalents of $335.1 million in fiscal 2011. The year-to-year increase in revenue and profitability for fiscal 2011 was primarily the result of improved global macro-economic conditions during the first half of the fiscal year. The strong growth we experienced in the first six months of fiscal 2011, including a 9% sequential revenue increase in our second fiscal quarter, was followed by sequential revenue declines in both the third and fourth fiscal quarters. The 9% sequential revenue increase in the second fiscal quarter included increased inventory stocking by our customers as a result of the Japanese earthquake and tsunami in March 2011. During the third and fourth quarters, of fiscal 2011, we began to see revenue declines attributable to inventory corrections following the inventory buildup in the prior quarters and declining demand as the deficit and credit related crisis in Europe and the U.S. caused customers to become more cautious in the second half of fiscal 2011. Revenue Trends by End Market The following table summarizes revenue by end market. The categorization of revenue by end market is determined using a variety of data points including the technical characteristics of the product, the “sold to” customer information, the “ship to” customer information and the end customer product or application into which our product will be incorporated. As data systems for capturing and tracking this data evolve and improve, the categorization of products by end market can vary over time. When this occurs, we reclassify revenue by end market for prior periods. Such reclassifications typically do not materially change the sizing of, or the underlying trends of results within, each end market. During fiscal year 2011, we consolidated the computer end market, which represented approximately 1% of fiscal 2011 revenue, into the consumer end market, and reclassified handset 27 revenue, which represented approximately 3% of fiscal 2011 revenue, from the communications end market to the consumer end market for all periods presented. 2011 2010 2009 % of % of % of Total Total Total Product Product Product Revenue Revenue* Y/Y% Revenue Revenue Revenue Revenue Industrial $ 1,397,634 47 % 10 % $ 1,267,736 46 % $ 860,696 43 % Automotive 415,444 14 % 25 % 333,644 12 % 200,329 10 % Consumer 586,945 20 % (6 )% 626,565 23 % 508,848 25 % Communications 593,297 20 % 11 % 533,558 19 % 445,035 22 % Total Revenue $ 2,993,320 100 % 8 % $ 2,761,503 100 % $ 2,014,908 100 % * The sum of the individual percentages do not equal the total due to rounding. Industrial — The year-to-year increase in revenue from fiscal 2010 to fiscal 2011 in industrial end market revenue was primarily the result of a broad-based increase in demand in this end market, which was most significant for products sold into the automation and instrumentation sectors and, to a lesser extent, products sold into the energy and healthcare sectors. The year-to-year increase in revenue from fiscal 2009 to fiscal 2010 in industrial end market revenue was primarily the result of a broad-based increase in demand in this end market, which was most significant for products sold into the instrumentation and automation sectors. Automotive — The year-to-year increase in revenue from fiscal 2010 to fiscal 2011 in automotive end market revenue was primarily the result of a general increase in the electronic content found in vehicles and, to a lesser extent, a general increase in demand by our customers. The year-to-year increase in revenue from fiscal 2009 to fiscal 2010 in automotive end market revenue was primarily the result of increased demand due to various government-initiated incentive programs, inventory replenishment and a general increase in the electronic content found in vehicles. Consumer — The year-to-year decrease in revenue from fiscal 2010 to fiscal 2011 in consumer end market revenue was primarily the result of a decrease in demand for products in the digital camera and home entertainment sector primarily as a result of the impact of the earthquake and tsunami that occurred in Japan in March 2011, partially offset by an increase in demand for products used in portable devices in this end market. The year-to-year increase in revenue from fiscal 2009 to fiscal 2010 in consumer end market revenue was primarily the result of a broad-based increase in demand for products used in digital cameras and other consumer applications. Communications — The year-to-year increase in revenue from fiscal 2010 to fiscal 2011 in communications end market revenue was primarily the result of a broad-based increase in demand in this end market, which was most significant for the basestation end market sector. The year-to-year increase in revenue from fiscal 2009 to fiscal 2010 in communications end market revenue was primarily the result of a broad-based increase in demand in this end market, which was most significant for the infrastructure sector. 28 Revenue Trends by Product The following table summarizes revenue by product categories. The categorization of our products into broad categories is based on the characteristics of the individual products, the specification of the products and in some cases the specific uses that certain products have within applications. The categorization of products into categories is therefore subject to judgment in some cases and can vary over time. In instances where products move between product categories we reclassify the amounts in the product categories for all prior periods. Such reclassifications typically do not materially change the sizing of, or the underlying trends of results within, each product category. 2011 2010 2009 % of % of % of Total Total Total Product Product Product Revenue Revenue Y/Y% Revenue Revenue Revenue Revenue* Converters $ 1,343,492 45 % 4 % $ 1,295,678 47 % $ 1,005,004 50 % Amplifiers/Radio frequency 788,498 26 % 12 % 701,634 25 % 501,942 25 % Other analog 410,233 14 % 23 % 334,649 12 % 216,473 11 % Subtotal analog signal processing 2,542,223 85 % 9 % 2,331,961 84 % 1,723,419 86 % Power management & reference 217,501 7 % 12 % 194,699 7 % 118,148 6 % Total analog products $ 2,759,724 92 % 9 % $ 2,526,660 91 % $ 1,841,567 91 % Digital signal processing 233,596 8 % (1 )% 234,843 9 % 173,341 9 % Total Revenue $ 2,993,320 100 % 8 % $ 2,761,503 100 % $ 2,014,908 100 % * The sum of the individual percentages do not equal the total due to rounding. The increase in total revenue from fiscal 2010 to fiscal 2011 and from fiscal 2009 to fiscal 2010 was the result of a broad-based increase in sales across all of our product categories. Revenue Trends by Geographic Region Revenue by geographic region, based upon customer location, for the last three fiscal years is as follows: 2011 2010 2009 United States $ 532,011 $ 508,187 $ 401,608 Rest of North and South America 164,079 153,962 92,954 Europe 838,719 703,717 502,602 Japan 400,456 441,826 349,907 China 596,433 508,489 376,080 Rest of Asia 461,622 445,322 291,757 Total revenue $ 2,993,320 $ 2,761,503 $ 2,014,908 In fiscal years 2011, 2010 and 2009, the predominant countries comprising “Rest of North and South America” are Canada and Mexico; the predominant countries comprising “Europe” are Germany, Sweden, France and the United Kingdom; and the predominant countries comprising “Rest of Asia” are Taiwan and South Korea. Sales increased in all geographic regions, except Japan, in fiscal 2011 as compared to fiscal 2010, primarily as a result of increases in sales activity in the industrial, automotive and communications end market sectors. The year-to-year decrease in sales in Japan was primarily the result of lower sales activity in the consumer end market sector in this region due to the earthquake and tsunami that occurred in Japan in March 2011. 29 Sales increased in all geographic regions in fiscal 2010 as compared to fiscal 2009, with sales in Europe and the Rest of Asia experiencing the largest increases. The increase in sales was the result of an increase in demand for our products primarily as a result of improving economic conditions worldwide. Gross Margin Fiscal Year 2011 2010 2009 Gross Margin $ 1,986,541 $ 1,799,422 $ 1,118,637 Gross Margin % 66.4 % 65.2 % 55.5 % Gross margin percentage was higher in fiscal 2011 by 120 basis points, as compared to fiscal 2010 primarily as a result of an increase in sales of $231.8 million, increased operating levels in our manufacturing facilities and the impact of efforts to reduce overall manufacturing costs, including the savings realized as a result of our wafer fabrication consolidation actions. Additionally, a higher proportion of our revenues were from products sold into the instrumentation and automation sectors of the industrial end market, which earn higher margins as compared to products sold into our other end markets. Gross margin percentage was higher in fiscal 2010 by 970 basis points as compared to fiscal 2009 primarily as a result of an increase in sales of $746.6 million, increased operating levels in our manufacturing facilities and the impact of ongoing efforts to reduce overall manufacturing costs, including the savings realized as a result of our wafer fabrication facility consolidations. Additionally, a higher proportion of our revenues were from products sold into the instrumentation and automation sectors of the industrial end market, which earn higher margins as compared to products sold into our other end markets. Research and Development (R&D) Fiscal Year 2011 2010 2009 R&D Expenses $ 505,570 $ 492,305 $ 446,980 R&D Expenses as a % of Revenue 16.9 % 17.8 % 22.2 % R&D expenses increased $13.3 million, or 3%, in fiscal 2011 as compared to fiscal 2010. The increase was primarily the result of higher employee salary and benefit expense due to salary increases that were effective at the beginning of the second quarter of fiscal 2011, increased headcount, and a general increase in spending. These increases were partially offset by lower variable compensation expense, which is a variable expense linked to our overall profitability and revenue growth. Research and development, or R&D, expenses in fiscal 2010 increased $45.3 million, or 10%, from fiscal 2009. The increase was primarily the result of an increase in variable compensation expense, which was a variable expense linked to our overall profitability, partially offset by the impact of actions we took over the prior two years to control discretionary spending and permanently reduce operating expenses. R&D expenses as a percentage of revenue will fluctuate from year-to-year depending on the amount of revenue and the success of new product development efforts, which we view as critical to our future growth. At any point in time we have hundreds of R&D projects underway, and we believe that none of these projects is material on an individual basis. We expect to continue the development of innovative technologies and processes for new products, and we believe that a continued commitment to R&D is essential in order to maintain product leadership with our existing products and to provide innovative new product offerings, and therefore, we expect to continue to make significant R&D investments in the future. 30 Selling, Marketing, General and Administrative (SMG&A) Fiscal Year 2011 2010 2009 SMG&A Expenses $ 406,707 $ 390,560 $ 333,184 SMG&A Expenses as a % of Revenue 13.6 % 14.1 % 16.5 % Selling, marketing, general and administrative, or SMG&A, expenses increased $16.1 million, or 4%, in fiscal 2011 as compared to fiscal 2010. The increase was primarily the result of higher employee salary and benefit expense due to salary increases that were effective at the beginning of the second quarter of fiscal 2011, increased headcount and a general increase in spending. These increases were partially offset by lower variable compensation expense, which is a variable expense linked to our overall profitability and revenue growth. SMG&A expenses in fiscal 2010 increased $57.4 million, or 17%, from fiscal 2009. The increase was primarily the result of an increase in variable compensation expense, which was a variable expense linked to our overall profitability, and higher sales commission expenses, which are variable expenses linked to our sales. These increases were offset by the impact of actions we took over the prior two years to control discretionary spending and permanently reduce operating expenses. Special Charges Closure of Wafer Fabrication Facility in Sunnyvale We ceased production at our California wafer fabrication facility in November 2006. We paid the related lease obligation costs on a monthly basis over the remaining lease term, which expired in March 2010. We recorded a one-time settlement charge of $0.4 million in fiscal 2010 related to the termination of the lease. This action was completed during fiscal 2010. Consolidation of a Wafer Fabrication Facility in Limerick During fiscal 2007 through fiscal 2010, we recorded special charges of $16.4 million as a result of our decision to only use eight-inch technology at our wafer fabrication facility in Limerick. These special charges included $14.9 million for severance and fringe benefit costs in accordance with our ongoing benefit plan for 150 manufacturing employees and $1.5 million for clean-up and closure costs that we expensed as incurred. The production in the six-inch wafer fabrication facility ceased during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2009. This action was completed during fiscal 2010. This action resulted in annual cost savings of approximately $25 million per year. Reduction of Operating Costs During fiscal 2008 through fiscal 2010, in order to further reduce our operating cost structure, we recorded special charges of approximately $43.3 million. These special charges included: $39.1 million for severance and fringe benefit costs in accordance with our ongoing benefit plan or statutory requirements at foreign locations for 245 manufacturing employees and 470 engineering and SMG&A employees; $2.1 million for lease obligation costs for facilities that we ceased using during the first quarter of fiscal 2009; $0.8 million for the write-off of property, plant and equipment; $0.5 million for contract termination costs; $0.3 million for clean-up and closure costs that we expensed as incurred; and $0.5 million related to the impairment of intellectual property. This action resulted in annual cost savings of approximately $52 million per year. We terminated the employment of all employees associated with this action and we are paying amounts owed to them as income continuance. During fiscal 2011, in order to further reduce our operating cost structure, we recorded a special charge of approximately $2.2 million. This special charge was for severance and fringe benefit costs in accordance with our ongoing benefit plan or statutory requirements at foreign locations for 25 engineering and SMG&A employees. As of October 29, 2011, we still employed 13 of the 25 employees included in this cost reduction action. These employees must continue to be employed by us until their employment is involuntarily terminated in order to receive the severance benefit. We estimate this action will result in annual savings in SMG&A expenses of approximately $4 million once fully implemented. 31 Closure of a Wafer Fabrication Facility in Cambridge During fiscal 2009 and fiscal 2010, we recorded special charges of $26.8 million as a result of our decision to consolidate our Cambridge, Massachusetts wafer fabrication facility into our existing Wilmington, Massachusetts facility. These special charges included: $7.4 million for severance and fringe benefit costs recorded in accordance with our ongoing benefit plan for 124 manufacturing employees and 9 SMG&A employees; $14.6 million for the impairment of manufacturing assets; $3.4 million for lease obligation costs for the Cambridge wafer fabrication facility, which we ceased using in the first quarter of fiscal 2010; and $1.4 million for clean-up and closure costs that we expensed as incurred. This action was completed during the third quarter of fiscal 2011. This action resulted in annual cost savings of approximately $43 million per year. Operating Income from Continuing Operations Fiscal Year 2011 2010 2009 Operating income from Continuing Operations $ 1,072,025 $ 900,074 $ 284,817 Operating income from Continuing Operations as a % of Revenue 35.8 % 32.6 % 14.1 % The $172.0 million, or 19%, increase in operating income from continuing operations in fiscal 2011 as compared to fiscal 2010 was primarily the result of an increase in revenue of $231.8 million and a 120 basis point increase in gross margin percentage. The $615.3 million, or 216%, increase in operating income from continuing operations in fiscal 2010 as compared to fiscal 2009 was primarily the result of an increase in revenue of $746.6 million, a 970 basis point increase in gross margin percentage, and lower special charges recorded in fiscal 2010 as compared to fiscal 2009. Nonoperating (Income) Expense Fiscal Year 2011 2010 2009 Interest expense $ 19,146 $ 10,429 $ 4,094 Interest income (9,060 ) (9,837 ) (15,621 ) Other, net 492 (2,183 ) (1,100 ) Total nonoperating expense (income) $ 10,578 $ (1,591 ) $ (12,627 ) Nonoperating (income) expense was higher by $12.2 million in fiscal 2011 as compared to fiscal 2010. The increase was primarily due to an increase in interest expense incurred as a result of the issuance of $375 million aggregate principal amount of 3.0% senior unsecured notes on April 4, 2011, and the $145 million term loan facility entered into by a wholly owned subsidiary of ours in December 2010. In addition, we earned lower interest income as a result of lower interest rates in fiscal 2011 as compared to fiscal 2010, which was partially offset by interest earned on higher cash balances in fiscal 2011. Nonoperating income was lower by $11 million in fiscal 2010 as compared to fiscal 2009. The increase was primarily due to higher interest expense incurred during fiscal 2010 as a result of the issuance of $375 million aggregate principal 5.0% senior unsecured notes on June 30, 2009, resulting in a partial year of interest expense in 2009 compared to a full year in 2010. In addition, we earned lower interest income on investments as a result of lower interest rates in fiscal 2010 as compared to fiscal 2009. Provision for Income Taxes Fiscal Year 2011 2010 2009 Provision for Income Taxes $ 200,553 $ 190,440 $ 50,036 Effective Income Tax Rate 18.9 % 21.1 % 16.8 % 32 Our effective tax rate reflects the applicable tax rate in effect in the various tax jurisdictions around the world where our income is earned. Our effective tax rate for fiscal 2011 was lower by 220 basis points compared to our effective tax rate for fiscal 2010. The tax rate for fiscal 2011 included the following items which caused a decrease in our tax rate: the reinstatement of the federal R&D tax credit in December 2010 retroactive to January 1, 2010, resulting in a $6.0 million income tax savings; a $6.7 million reduction in the state tax credit valuation reserve that we believe we can now recover; a $0.5 million tax benefit from the increase in Irish deferred taxes as a result of the increase in the Irish manufacturing tax rate from 10% to 12.5%; and a net $10.8 million tax benefit related to the settlement with the Appeals Office of the Internal Revenue Service of certain tax matters for the fiscal 2004 through fiscal 2007 tax years. Fiscal 2010 also included a higher special charge, a majority of which provided a tax benefit at the higher U.S. tax rate as compared to the special charge recorded in fiscal 2011. Our effective tax rate for fiscal 2010 was higher compared to our effective tax rate for fiscal 2009 primarily as a result of a change in the mix of our income to jurisdictions where income is taxed at a higher rate. In addition, higher special charges recorded in fiscal 2009, a majority of which provided a tax benefit at the higher U.S. tax rate, contributed to a higher effective tax rate for fiscal 2010 as compared to fiscal 2009. Income from Continuing Operations, Net of Tax Fiscal Year 2011 2010 2009 Income from Continuing Operations, net of tax $ 860,894 $ 711,225 $ 247,408 Income from Continuing Operations, net of tax as a % of Revenue 28.8 % 25.8 % 12.3 % Diluted EPS from Continuing Operations $ 2.79 $ 2.33 $ 0.85 Net income from continuing operations in fiscal 2011 was higher than in fiscal 2010 by approximately $149.7 million primarily as a result of the $172.0 million increase in operating income from continuing operations, offset by lower nonoperating income and a higher provision for income taxes in fiscal 2011 than in fiscal 2010. Income from continuing operations, net of tax, in fiscal 2010 was higher than in fiscal 2009 by approximately $463.8 million primarily as a result of the $615.3 million increase in operating income that was partially offset by a higher provision for income taxes in fiscal 2010. The impact of inflation and foreign currency exchange rate movement on our results of operations during the past three fiscal years has not been significant. Discontinued Operations Fiscal Year 2011 2010 2009 Income from Discontinued Operations, net of tax $ — $ — $ 364 Gain on sale of Discontinued Operations, net of tax 6,500 859 — Total income from Discontinued Operations, net of tax $ 6,500 $ 859 $ 364 Diluted earnings per share from Discontinued Operations $ 0.02 $ 0.00 $ 0.00 We sold our Baseband Chipset Business to MediaTek Inc. and our CPU voltage regulation and PC thermal monitoring business to certain subsidiaries of ON Semiconductor Corporation during the first quarter of fiscal 2008. Accordingly, the results of the operations of these businesses have been presented as discontinued operations within the consolidated financial statements. Acquisitions In fiscal 2006, we acquired substantially all the outstanding stock of privately-held Integrant Technologies, Inc. (Integrant) of Seoul, Korea. The acquisition enabled us to enter the mobile TV market and strengthened our 33 presence in the Asia region. We paid $8.4 million related to the purchase of shares from the founder of Integrant during the period from July 2007 through July 2009. We recorded these payments as additional goodwill. In fiscal 2006, we acquired all the outstanding stock of privately-held AudioAsics A/S (AudioAsics) of Roskilde, Denmark. The acquisition of AudioAsics allowed us to continue developing low-power audio solutions, while expanding our presence in the Nordic and Eastern European regions. We paid additional cash payments of $3.1 million during fiscal 2009 for the achievement of revenue-based milestones during the period from October 2006 through January 2009, which we recorded as additional goodwill. In addition, in accordance with the terms of the acquisition documents, we paid $3.2 million during fiscal 2009 based on the achievement of technological milestones during the period from October 2006 through January 2009, which we recorded as compensation expense in fiscal 2008. All revenue and technological milestones related to this acquisition have been met and no additional payments will be made. In fiscal 2011, we acquired privately-held Lyric Semiconductor, Inc. (Lyric) of Cambridge, Massachusetts. The acquisition of Lyric gives us the potential to achieve an order of magnitude improvement in power efficiency in mixed signal processing. The acquisition-date fair value of the consideration transferred totaled $27.8 million, which consisted of $14.0 million in initial cash payments at closing and contingent consideration of up to $13.8 million. The contingent consideration arrangement requires additional cash payments to the former equity holders of Lyric upon the achievement of certain technological and product development milestones payable during the period from June 2011 through June 2016. As of October 29, 2011, no contingent payments have been made and the fair value of the contingent consideration was approximately $14.0 million. We allocated the purchase price to the tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their estimated fair values at the date of acquisition, resulting in the recognition of $12.2 million of in-process research and development, $18.9 million of goodwill and $3.3 million of net deferred tax liabilities. In addition, we will be obligated to pay royalties to the former equity holders of Lyric on revenue recognized from the sale of Lyric products and licenses through the earlier of 20 years or the accrual of a maximum of $25 million. Royalty payments to Lyric employees require post-acquisition services to be rendered and, as such, we will record these amounts as compensation expense in the related periods. As of October 29, 2011, no royalty payments have been made. We recognized $0.2 million of acquisition related costs that we expensed in the third quarter of fiscal 2011. These costs are included in operating expenses in the consolidated statement of income. We have not provided pro forma results of operations for Integrant, AudioAsics and Lyric in this report as they were not material to us on either an individual or an aggregate basis. We included the results of operations of each acquisition in our consolidated statement of income from the date of such acquisition. Liquidity and Capital Resources Fiscal Year 2011 2010 2009 Net Cash Provided by Operations $ 900,529 $ 991,175 $ 432,148 Net Cash Provided by Operations as a % of Revenue 30.1 % 35.9 % 21.4 % At October 29, 2011, cash and cash equivalents totaled $1,405.1 million. The primary sources of funds for fiscal 2011 were net cash generated from operating activities of $900.5 million, proceeds of $515.5 million relating to the issuance of $375 million aggregate principal amount of 3.0% senior unsecured notes due April 15, 2016 and the $145 million term loan facility we entered into through a wholly owned subsidiary. In addition, we received $217.2 million in net proceeds from employee stock option exercises. The principal uses of funds for fiscal 2011 were the repurchase of approximately 9 million shares of our common stock for an aggregate of $330.3 million, 34 dividend payments of $281.6 million and additions to property, plant and equipment of $123.0 million. These factors contributed to the net increase in cash and cash equivalents of $335.1 million in fiscal 2011. Fiscal Year 2011 2010 Accounts Receivable $ 348,416 $ 387,169 Days Sales Outstanding* 44 46 Inventory $ 295,081 $ 277,478 Days Cost of Sales in Inventory* 105 100 * We use the annualized fourth quarter revenue in our calculation of days sales outstanding and we use the annualized fourth quarter cost of sales in our calculation of days cost of sales in inventory. Accounts receivable at October 29, 2011 decreased $38.8 million, or 10%, from the end of the fourth quarter of fiscal 2010. The decrease in receivables was primarily the result of lower revenue in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2011 as compared to the fourth quarter of fiscal 2010. Days sales outstanding decreased by two days as a result of lower product shipments in the final month of the fourth quarter of fiscal 2011 as compared to the final month of the fourth quarter of fiscal 2010. Inventory at October 29, 2011 increased by $17.6 million, or 6%, from the end of the fourth quarter of fiscal 2010. The increase in inventory relates primarily to an increase in manufacturing production to support the higher revenue levels recorded in fiscal 2011. Days cost of sales in inventory increased five days primarily due to lower manufacturing costs, which resulted in cost of sales increasing only 1% from the fourth quarter of fiscal 2010 as compared to the fourth quarter of fiscal 2011, compared to a 6% increase in inventory during this same time period. Current liabilities decreased to $525.0 million at October 29, 2011, a decrease of $118.5 million, or 18%, from $643.5 million at the end of fiscal 2010. This decrease was primarily due to a decrease in income tax payable as a result of the settlement with the Appeals Office of the Internal Revenue Service of certain tax matters for the fiscal 2004 through fiscal 2007 tax years. In addition, accrued liabilities declined as a result of a decrease in accruals related to variable compensation expense. As of October 29, 2011 and October 30, 2010, we had gross deferred revenue of $311.3 million and $327.2 million, respectively, and gross deferred cost of sales of $78.1 million and $84.4 million, respectively. Deferred income on shipments to distributors decreased by approximately $9.6 million in fiscal 2011 primarily as a result of the distributors’ sales to their customers in fiscal 2011 exceeding our shipments to our distributors during this same time period. Sales to distributors are made under agreements that allow distributors to receive price-adjustment credits and to return qualifying products for credit, as determined by us, in order to reduce the amounts of slow-moving, discontinued or obsolete product from their inventory. Given the uncertainties associated with the levels of price-adjustment credits to be granted to distributors, the sales price to the distributors is not fixed or determinable until the distributors resell the products to their customers. Therefore, we defer revenue recognition from sales to distributors until the distributors have sold the products to their customers. The amount of price-adjustments is dependent on future overall market conditions, and therefore the levels of these adjustments could fluctuate significantly from period to period. To the extent that we experience a significant increase in the amount of credits we issue to our distributors, there could be a material impact on the ultimate revenue and gross margin recognized relating to these transactions. Net additions to property, plant and equipment were $123.0 million in fiscal 2011 and were funded with a combination of cash on hand and cash generated from operations. We expect capital expenditures to be in the range of approximately $100 million to $125 million in fiscal 2012 to be used primarily in our manufacturing facilities. During fiscal 2011, our Board of Directors declared cash dividends totaling $0.94 per outstanding share of common stock resulting in aggregate dividend payments of $281.6 million. After the end of fiscal 2011, on November 18, 2011, our Board of Directors declared a cash dividend of $0.25 per outstanding share of our common stock. The dividend is payable on December 21, 2011 to shareholders of record on December 2, 2011 and is expected to total approximately $75 million. We currently expect quarterly dividends to continue at $0.25 per share, 35 although they remain subject to declaration by our Board of Directors. The payment of future dividends, if any, will be based on several factors, including our financial performance, outlook and liquidity. Our common stock repurchase program has been in place since August 2004. In the aggregate, the Board of Directors has authorized us to repurchase $5 billion of our common stock under the program. Under the program, we may repurchase outstanding shares of our common stock from time to time in the open market and through privately negotiated transactions. Unless terminated earlier by resolution of our Board of Directors, the repurchase program will expire when we have repurchased all shares authorized under the program. As of October 29, 2011, we had repurchased a total of approximately 125.0 million shares of our common stock for approximately $4,278.5 million under this program. As of October 29, 2011, an additional $721.5 million remained available for repurchase of shares under the current authorized program. The repurchased shares are held as authorized but unissued shares of common stock. We also from time to time repurchase shares in settlement of employee tax withholding obligations due upon the vesting of restricted stock or restricted stock units or the exercise of stock options, or in certain limited circumstances to satisfy the exercise price of options granted to our employees under our equity compensation plans. Any future common stock repurchases will be based on several factors including our financial performance, outlook, liquidity and the amount of cash we have available in the United States. On June 30, 2009, we issued $375 million aggregate principal amount of 5.0% senior unsecured notes due July 1, 2014 (the 5.0% Notes) with annual interest payments of 5.0% paid in two installments on January 1 and July 1 of each year, commencing January 1, 2010. The net proceeds of the offering were $370.4 million, after issuing at a discount and deducting expenses, underwriting discounts and commissions, which will be amortized over the term of the 5.0% Notes. We swapped the fixed interest portion of these Notes for a variable interest rate based on the three-month LIBOR plus 2.05% (2.42% as of October 29, 2011). The variable interest payments based on the variable annual rate are payable quarterly. The LIBOR based rate is set quarterly three months prior to the date of the interest payment. The indenture governing the 5.0% Notes contains covenants that may limit our ability to: incur, create, assume or guarantee any debt for borrowed money secured by a lien upon a principal property; enter into sale and lease-back transactions with respect to a principal property; and consolidate with or merge into, or transfer or lease all or substantially all of our assets to any other party. As of October 29, 2011, we were compliant with these covenants. On December 22, 2010, Analog Devices Holdings B.V., a wholly owned subsidiary of ours, entered into a credit agreement with Bank of America, N.A., London Branch as administrative agent. The borrower’s obligations are guaranteed by us. The credit agreement provides for a term loan facility of $145 million, which matures on December 22, 2013. The terms of the agreement provide for a three-year principal amortization schedule with $3.6 million payable quarterly every March, June, September and December with the balance payable upon the maturity date. During the third quarter of fiscal 2011 we made an additional principal payment of $17.5 million. The loan will bear interest at a fluctuating rate for each period equal to the LIBOR rate corresponding with the tenor of the interest period plus a spread of 1.25% (1.61% as of October 29, 2011). The terms of this facility include limitations on subsidiary indebtedness and on liens against our assets and the assets of our subsidiaries, and also include financial covenants that require us to maintain a minimum interest coverage ratio and not exceed a maximum leverage ratio. As of October 29, 2011, we were compliant with these covenants. The proceeds of this loan are being used to restructure our captive finance subsidiaries. On April 4, 2011, we issued $375 million aggregate principal amount of 3.0% senior unsecured notes due April 15, 2016 (the 3.0% Notes) with semi-annual fixed interest payments due on April 15 and October 15 of each year, commencing October 15, 2011. The net proceeds of the offering were $370.5 million, after issuing at a discount and deducting expenses, underwriting discounts and commissions, which will be amortized over the term of the 3.0% Notes. The indenture governing the 3.0% Notes contains covenants that may limit our ability to: incur, create, assume or guarantee any debt for borrowed money secured by a lien upon a principal property; enter into sale and lease-back transactions with respect to a principal property; and consolidate with or merge into, or transfer or lease all or substantially all of our assets to, any other party. As of October 29, 2011, we were compliant with these covenants. In addition, we have a five-year $165 million unsecured revolving credit facility that expires in May 2013. To date, we have not borrowed under this credit facility but we may borrow in the future and use the proceeds for support of commercial paper issuance, stock repurchases, dividend payments, acquisitions, capital expenditures, 36 working capital and other lawful corporate purposes. The terms of this facility also include financial covenants that require us to maintain a minimum interest coverage ratio and not exceed a maximum leverage ratio. As of October 29, 2011, we were compliant with these covenants. At October 29, 2011, our principal source of liquidity was $3,592.5 million of cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments, of which approximately $1,170.5 million was held in the United States. The balance of our cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments was held outside the United States in various foreign subsidiaries. As we intend to reinvest certain of our foreign earnings indefinitely, this cash held outside the United States is not available to meet certain of our cash requirements in the United States, including for cash dividends and common stock repurchases. Our cash and cash equivalents consist of highly liquid investments with maturities of three months or less at the time of acquisition and our short-term investments consist primarily of liquid money market funds and corporate obligations, such as commercial paper, bonds and bank time deposits. We maintain these balances with high credit quality counterparties, continually monitor the amount of credit exposure to any one issuer and diversify our investments in order to minimize our credit risk. We believe that our existing sources of liquidity and cash expected to be generated from future operations, together with existing and anticipated available long-term financing, will be sufficient to fund operations, capital expenditures, research and development efforts, dividend payments (if any) and repurchases of our stock (if any) under our stock repurchase program in the immediate future and for at least the next twelve months. The table below summarizes our contractual obligations and the amounts we owe under these contracts in specified periods as of October 29, 2011: Payment due by period Less than More than (thousands) Total 1 Year 1-3 Years 3-5 Years 5 Years Contractual obligations: Operating leasesa $ 66,055 $ 17,590 $ 19,675 $ 9,318 $ 19,472 Long-term debt obligations 866,608 14,500 477,108 375,000 — Interest payments associated with long-term debt obligationsb 110,599 31,808 61,916 16,875 — Payments due under interest rate swap agreementsc 25,281 9,184 16,097 — — Deferred compensation pland 26,410 — — — 26,410 Pension fundinge 3,673 3,673 — — — Total $ 1,098,626 $ 76,755 $ 574,796 $ 401,193 $ 45,882 (a) Certain of our operating lease obligations include escalation clauses. These escalating payment requirements are reflected in the table. (b) The interest payments related to our 5% senior unsecured notes are expected to be fully offset by the proceeds from our interest rate swap agreements. The interest payments related to our term loan facility are based on LIBOR plus a spread of 1.25% (1.61% as of October 29, 2011). The actual payments will be based on the LIBOR rate corresponding to the tenor of the interest period chosen, plus a spread of 1.25% which is set two business days prior to the start of the new interest period. (c) These interest payments are based on a variable interest rate based on the three month LIBOR plus 2.05% (2.42% as of October 29, 2011). The actual payments will be based on the LIBOR based rate which is set quarterly three months prior to the due date of the interest payments plus 2.05%. (d) These payments relate to obligations under our deferred compensation plan. The deferred compensation plan allows certain members of management and other highly-compensated employees and non-employee directors to defer receipt of all or any portion of their compensation. The amount in the “More than 5 Years” column of the table represents the remaining total balance under the deferred compensation plan to be paid to participants who have not terminated employment. Since we cannot reasonably estimate the timing of withdrawals for 37 participants who have not yet terminated employment, we have included the future obligation to these participants in the “More than 5 Years” column of the table. (e) Our funding policy for our foreign defined benefit plans is consistent with the local requirements of each country. The payment obligations in the table are estimates of our expected contributions to these plans for fiscal year 2012. The actual future payments may differ from the amounts presented in the table and reasonable estimates of payments beyond one year are not practical because of potential future changes in variables, such as plan asset performance, interest rates and the rate of increase in compensation levels. Purchase orders for the purchase of raw materials and other goods and services are not included in the table above. We are not able to determine the total amount of these purchase orders that represent contractual obligations, as purchase orders may represent authorizations to purchase rather than binding agreements. In addition, our purchase orders generally allow for cancellation without significant penalties. We do not have significant agreements for the purchase of raw materials or other goods specifying minimum quantities or set prices that exceed our expected short-term requirements. Our 2011 acquisition of Lyric Semiconductor involves the potential payment of contingent consideration. The table above does not reflect any such obligations, as the timing and amounts are uncertain. See Note 6 in the Notes to our Consolidated Financial Statements contained in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for more information regarding our acquisitions. As of October 29, 2011, our total liabilities associated with uncertain tax positions was $20.8 million, which are included in “Other non-current liabilities” in our consolidated balance sheet contained in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Due to the complexity associated with our tax uncertainties, we cannot make a reasonably reliable estimate of the period in which we expect to settle the non-current liabilities associated with these uncertain tax positions. Therefore, we have not included these uncertain tax positions in the above contractual obligations table. The expected timing of payments and the amounts of the obligations discussed above are estimated based on current information available as of October 29, 2011. Off-balance Sheet Financing As of October 29, 2011, we had no off-balance sheet financing arrangements. Outlook The following statements are based on current expectations. These statements are forward-looking, and actual results may differ materially. Unless specifically mentioned, these statements do not give effect to the potential impact of any mergers, acquisitions, divestitures, or business combinations that may be announced or closed after the date of filing this report. These statements supersede all prior statements regarding our business outlook made by us. We are planning for revenue in the first quarter of fiscal 2012 to be down approximately 5% to 10% from the fourth quarter of fiscal 2011. Our plan is for gross margin percentage for the first quarter of fiscal 2012 to be approximately 63.0% plus or minus 50 basis points. We are planning for operating expenses in the first quarter of fiscal 2012 to be in the range of $226 million to $229 million. As a result, our plan is for diluted EPS to be approximately $0.44 to $0.51 in the first quarter of fiscal 2012. New Accounting Pronouncements Standards Implemented Multiple-Deliverable Revenue Arrangements In October 2009, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2009-13 — Revenue Recognition (Topic 605): Multiple-Deliverable Revenue Arrangements (formerly EITF Issue No. 08-1) (ASU No. 2009-13). This standard modifies the revenue recognition guidance for arrangements that involve the delivery of multiple elements, such as product, software, services or support, to a customer at different 38 times as part of a single revenue generating transaction. This standard provides principles and application guidance to determine whether multiple deliverables exist, how the individual deliverables should be separated and how to allocate the revenue in the arrangement among those separate deliverables. The standard also expands the disclosure requirements for multiple-deliverable revenue arrangements. ASU No. 2009-13 is effective for fiscal years that begin on or after June 15, 2010, which is our fiscal year 2011. The adoption of ASU 2009-13 in the first quarter of fiscal 2011 did not have a material impact on our financial condition and results of operations. Standards to be Implemented Business Combinations In December 2010, the FASB issued ASU No. 2010-29, Business Combinations (ASC Topic 805) — Disclosure of Supplementary Pro Forma Information for Business Combinations (ASU No. 2010-29). ASU No. 2010-29 requires a public entity to disclose revenue and earnings of the combined entity as though the business combination that occurred during the current year had occurred as of the beginning of the prior year. It also requires a description of the nature and amount of material, nonrecurring adjustments directly attributable to the business combination included in the reported revenue and earnings. The new disclosure will be effective for our first quarter of fiscal year 2012. The adoption of ASU No. 2010-29 will require additional disclosure in the event of a business combination but will not have a material impact on our financial condition and results of operations. Intangibles — Goodwill and Other In December 2010, the FASB issued ASU No. 2010-28, Intangibles-Goodwill and Other (ASC Topic 350) (ASU No. 2010-28). ASU No. 2010-28 modifies Step 1 of the goodwill impairment test for reporting units with zero or negative carrying amounts. For those reporting units, an entity is required to perform Step 2 of the goodwill impairment test if it is more likely than not that a goodwill impairment exists. In determining whether it is more likely than not that a goodwill impairment exists, an entity should consider whether there are any adverse qualitative factors indicating that an impairment may exist. ASU 2010-28 is effective for fiscal years that begin after December 15, 2010, which is our fiscal year 2012. We do not expect the adoption of ASU No. 2010-28 to impact our financial condition and results of operations. Fair Value Measurement In May 2011, the FASB issued ASU No. 2011-04, Amendments to Achieve Common Fair Value Measurements and Disclosure Requirements in U.S. GAAP and IFRSs (ASU No. 2011-04). ASU No. 2011-04 amended ASC 820, Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures, to converge the fair value measurement guidance in U.S. GAAP and International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRSs). Some of the amendments clarify the application of existing fair value measurement requirements, while other amendments change a particular principle in ASC 820. In addition, ASU No. 2011-04 requires additional fair value disclosures. The amendments are to be applied prospectively and are effective for interim and annual periods beginning after December 15, 2011, which is our second quarter of fiscal year 2012. We are currently evaluating the impact, if any, that ASU No. 2011-04 may have on our financial condition and results of operations. Comprehensive Income In June 2011, the FASB issued ASU No. 2011-05, Presentation of Comprehensive Income (ASU No. 2011-05). ASU No. 2011-05 amended ASC 320, Comprehensive Income, to converge the presentation of comprehensive income between U.S GAAP and IFRS. ASU No. 2011-05 requires that all nonowner changes in stockholders’ equity be presented in either a single continuous statement of comprehensive income or in two separate but consecutive statements and also requires reclassification adjustments for items that are reclassified from other comprehensive income to net income in the statement(s) where the components of net income and the components of other comprehensive income are presented. ASU No. 2011-05 eliminates the option to present the components of other comprehensive income as part of the statement of changes in stockholders’ equity. ASU 2011-05 is effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those years, beginning after December 15, 2011, which is our fiscal year 39 2013. The adoption of ASU No. 2011-05 will affect the presentation of comprehensive income but will not impact our financial condition or results of operations. Intangibles — Goodwill and Other: Testing Goodwill for Impairment In September 2011, the FASB issued ASU No. 2011-08, Intangibles — Goodwill and Other (ASC Topic 350): Testing for Goodwill Impairment (ASU No. 2011-08). ASU No. 2011-08 provides a company the option to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether the existence of certain conditions leads to a determination that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount. If, after assessing the totality of events or circumstances, a company determines it is not more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, then performing the two-step goodwill impairment test is unnecessary. However, if a company concludes otherwise, then it is required to perform the two-step goodwill impairment test. ASU No. 2011-08 is effective for fiscal years that begin after December 15, 2011, which is our fiscal year 2013. We are currently evaluating the impact, if any, that ASU No. 2011-08 may have on our financial condition and results of operations. Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates Management’s discussion and analysis of the financial condition and results of operations is based upon the consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue and expenses, and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. We base our estimates and judgments on historical experience, knowledge of current conditions and beliefs of what could occur in the future based on available information. We consider the following accounting policies to be both those most important to the portrayal of our financial condition and those that require the most subjective judgment. If actual results differ significantly from management’s estimates and projections, there could be a material effect on our financial statements. We also have other policies that we consider key accounting policies, such as our policy for revenue recognition, including the deferral of revenue on sales to distributors until the products are sold to the end user; however, the application of these policies does not require us to make significant estimates or judgments that are difficult or subjective. Inventory Valuation We value inventories at the lower of cost (first-in, first-out method) or market. Because of the cyclical nature of the semiconductor industry, changes in inventory levels, obsolescence of technology, and product life cycles, we write down inventories to net realizable value. We employ a variety of methodologies to determine the net realizable value of inventory. While a portion of the calculation is determined via reference to the age of inventory and lower of cost or market calculations, an element of the calculation is subject to significant judgments made by us about future demand for our inventory. If actual demand for our products is less than our estimates, additional adjustments to existing inventories may need to be recorded in future periods. To date, our actual results have not been materially different than our estimates, and we do not expect them to be materially different in the future. Allowance for Doubtful Accounts We maintain allowances for doubtful accounts, when appropriate, for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments. If the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate, our actual losses may exceed our estimates, and additional allowances would be required. To date, our actual results have not been materially different than our estimates, and we do not expect them to be materially different in the future. Long-Lived Assets We review property, plant, and equipment and finite lived intangible assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of assets may not be recoverable. Recoverability of these assets is measured by comparison of their carrying value to future undiscounted cash flows that the assets are 40 expected to generate over their remaining economic lives. If such assets are considered to be impaired, the impairment to be recognized in earnings equals the amount by which the carrying value of the assets exceeds their fair value determined by either a quoted market price, if any, or a value determined by utilizing a discounted cash flow technique. Although we have recognized no material impairment adjustments related to our property, plant, and equipment and identified intangible assets during the past three fiscal years, except those made in conjunction with restructuring actions, deterioration in our business in the future could lead to such impairment adjustments in future periods. Evaluation of impairment of long-lived assets requires estimates of future operating results that are used in the preparation of the expected future undiscounted cash flows. Actual future operating results and the remaining economic lives of our long-lived assets could differ from the estimates used in assessing the recoverability of these assets. These differences could result in impairment charges, which could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations. In addition, in certain instances, assets may not be impaired but their estimated useful lives may have decreased. In these situations, we amortize the remaining net book values over the revised useful lives. We review indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment annually, on the first day of the fourth quarter (on or about August 1) or more frequently if indicators of impairment exist. The impairment test involves the comparison of the fair value of the intangible asset with its carrying amount. Goodwill Goodwill is subject to annual impairment tests or more frequently if indicators of potential impairment exist and suggest that the carrying value of goodwill may not be recoverable from estimated discounted future cash flows. We test goodwill for impairment at the reporting unit level (operating segment or one level below an operating segment) on an annual basis in the fourth quarter (on or about August 1) or more frequently if we believe indicators of impairment exist. For our latest annual impairment assessment that occurred on July 31, 2011, we identified our reporting units to be our five operating segments, which meet the aggregation criteria for one reportable segment. The performance of the test involves a two-step process. The first step of the impairment test involves comparing the fair values of the applicable reporting units with their aggregate carrying values, including goodwill. We generally determine the fair value of our reporting units using the income approach methodology of valuation that includes the discounted cash flow method as well as other generally accepted valuation methodologies, which requires significant judgment by management. If the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds the reporting unit’s fair value, we perform the second step of the goodwill impairment test to determine the amount of impairment loss. The second step of the goodwill impairment test involves comparing the implied fair value of the affected reporting unit’s goodwill with the carrying value of that goodwill. These impairment tests may result in impairment losses that could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations. Value of Contingent Consideration related to Business Combination We record contingent consideration resulting from a business combination at its fair value on the acquisition date. We generally determine the fair value of the contingent consideration using the income approach methodology of valuation. Each reporting period thereafter, we revalue these obligations and record increases or decreases in their fair value as an adjustment to operating expenses within the consolidated statement of income. Changes in the fair value of the contingent consideration can result from changes in assumed discount periods and rates, and from changes pertaining to the achievement of the defined milestones. Significant judgment is employed in determining the appropriateness of these assumptions as of the acquisition date and for each subsequent period. Accordingly, future business and economic conditions, as well as changes in any of the assumptions described above, can materially impact the amount of contingent consideration expense we record in any given period. Accounting for Income Taxes We must make certain estimates and judgments in determining income tax expense for financial statement purposes. These estimates and judgments occur in the calculation of tax credits, benefits, and deductions, and in the calculation of certain tax assets and liabilities, which arise from differences in the timing of the recognition of revenue and expense for tax and financial statement purposes, as well as the interest and penalties relating to these uncertain tax positions. We assessed the likelihood of the realization of deferred tax assets and concluded that a valuation allowance is needed to reserve the amount of the deferred tax assets that may not be realized due to the 41 uncertainty of the timing and amount of the realization of certain state credit carryovers. In reaching our conclusion, we evaluated certain relevant criteria including the existence of deferred tax liabilities that can be used to absorb deferred tax assets, the taxable income in prior carryback years in the impacted state jurisdictions that can be used to absorb net operating losses and taxable income in future years. Our judgments regarding future profitability may change due to future market conditions, changes in U.S. or international tax laws and other factors. These changes, if any, may require material adjustments to these deferred tax assets, resulting in a reduction in net income or an increase in net loss in the period when such determinations are made, which in turn, may result in an increase or decrease to our tax provision in a subsequent period. We account for uncertain tax positions by determining if it is “more likely than not” that a tax position will be sustained by the appropriate taxing authorities prior to recording any benefit in the financial statements. An uncertain income tax position is not recognized if it has less than a 50% likelihood of being sustained. For those tax positions where it is more likely than not that a tax benefit will be sustained, we have recorded the largest amount of tax benefit with a greater than 50% likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement with a taxing authority that has full knowledge of all relevant information. For those income tax positions where it is not more likely than not that a tax benefit will be sustained, no tax benefit has been recognized in the financial statements. We reevaluate these uncertain tax positions on a quarterly basis. This evaluation is based on factors including, but not limited to, changes in known facts or circumstances, changes in tax law, effectively settled issues under audit, and new audit activity. A change in these factors would result in the recognition of a tax benefit or an additional charge to the tax provision. In the ordinary course of global business, there are many transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax outcome is uncertain. Some of these uncertainties arise as a consequence of cost reimbursement and royalty arrangements among related entities. Although we believe our estimates are reasonable, no assurance can be given that the final tax outcome of these matters will not be different than that which is reflected in our historical income tax provisions and accruals. In the event our assumptions are incorrect, the differences could have a material impact on our income tax provision and operating results in the period in which such determination is made. In addition to the factors described above, our current and expected effective tax rate is based on then-current tax law. Significant changes during the year in enacted tax law could affect these estimates. Stock-Based Compensation Stock-based compensation expense associated with stock options and related awards is recognized in the statement of income. Determining the amount of stock-based compensation to be recorded requires us to develop estimates to be used in calculating the grant-date fair value of stock options. We calculate the grant-date fair values using the Black-Scholes valuation model. The use of valuation models requires us to make estimates of the following assumptions: Expected volatility — We are responsible for estimating volatility and have considered a number of factors, including third-party estimates, when estimating volatility. We currently believe that the exclusive use of implied volatility results in the best estimate of the grant-date fair value of employee stock options because it reflects the market’s current expectations of future volatility. In evaluating the appropriateness of exclusively relying on implied volatility, we concluded that: (1) options in our common stock are actively traded with sufficient volume on several exchanges; (2) the market prices of both the traded options and the underlying shares are measured at a similar point in time to each other and on a date close to the grant date of the employee share options; (3) the traded options have exercise prices that are both near-the-money and close to the exercise price of the employee share options; and (4) the remaining maturities of the traded options used to estimate volatility are at least one year. Expected term — We use historical employee exercise and option expiration data to estimate the expected term assumption for the Black-Scholes grant-date valuation. We believe that this historical data is currently the best estimate of the expected term of a new option, and that generally, all of our employees exhibit similar exercise behavior. In general, the longer the expected term used in the Black-Scholes valuation model, the higher the grant-date fair value of the option. Risk-free interest rate — The yield on zero-coupon U.S. Treasury securities for a period that is commensurate with the expected term assumption is used as the risk-free interest rate. 42 Expected dividend yield — Expected dividend yield is calculated by annualizing the cash dividend declared by our Board of Directors for the current quarter and dividing that result by the closing stock price on the date of grant of the option. Until such time as our Board of Directors declares a cash dividend for an amount that is different from the current quarter’s cash dividend, the current dividend will be used in deriving this assumption. Cash dividends are not paid on options, restricted stock or restricted stock units. The amount of stock-based compensation expense recognized during a period is based on the value of the portion of the awards that are ultimately expected to vest. Forfeitures are estimated at the time of grant and revised, if necessary, in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates. The term “forfeitures” is distinct from “cancellations” or “expirations” and represents only the unvested portion of the surrendered option. Based on an analysis of our historical forfeitures, we have applied an annual forfeiture rate of 4.3% to all unvested stock-based awards as of October 29, 2011. The rate of 4.3% represents the portion that is expected to be forfeited each year over the vesting period. This analysis is re-evaluated quarterly and the forfeiture rate is adjusted as necessary. Ultimately, the actual expense recognized over the vesting period will only be for those awards that vest. Contingencies From time to time, we receive demands from third parties alleging that our products or manufacturing processes infringe the patent or intellectual property rights of these parties. We periodically assess each matter to determine if a contingent liability should be recorded. In making this determination, we may, depending on the nature of the matter, consult with internal and external legal counsel and technical experts. Based on the information we obtain, combined with our judgment regarding all the facts and circumstances of each matter, we determine whether it is probable that a contingent loss may be incurred and whether the amount of such loss can be reasonably estimated. If a loss is probable and reasonably estimable, we record a contingent loss. In determining the amount of a contingent loss, we consider advice received from experts in the specific matter, current status of legal proceedings, settlement negotiations that may be ongoing, prior case history and other factors. If the judgments and estimates made by us are incorrect, we may need to record additional contingent losses that could materially adversely impact our results of operations. ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK Interest Rate Exposure Our interest income and expense are sensitive to changes in the general level of interest rates. In this regard, changes in interest rates affect the interest earned on our marketable securities and short term investments, as well as the fair value of our investments, debt and interest-rate swap agreement. Based on our marketable securities and short-term investments outstanding as of October 29, 2011 and October 30, 2010, our annual interest income would change by approximately $38 million and $27 million, respectively, for each 100 basis point increase in interest rates. To provide a meaningful assessment of the interest rate risk associated with our investment portfolio, we performed a sensitivity analysis to determine the impact a change in interest rates would have on the value of our investment portfolio assuming a 100 basis point parallel shift in the yield curve. Based on investment positions as of October 29, 2011 and October 30, 2010, a hypothetical 100 basis point increase in interest rates across all maturities would result in a $4 million decline in each year in the fair market value of the portfolio. Such losses would only be realized if we sold the investments prior to maturity. As of October 29, 2011, we had $750 million in principal amount of senior unsecured notes outstanding, which consisted of $375 million 5% senior unsecured notes, due July 1, 2014 and $375 million 3% senior unsecured notes, due April 15, 2016. As of October 29, 2011, a hypothetical 100 basis point increase in market interest rates would reduce the fair value of our $375 million of 3% senior unsecured notes outstanding by approximately $16 million. As of October 29, 2011 and October 30, 2010 a similar increase in market interest rates would not change the fair value of our $375 million 5% senior unsecured notes which have been hedged by an interest rate swap agreement. Any changes to fair value of the 5% senior unsecured notes would be offset by the change in the fair value of the corresponding interest rate swap. 43 We hold an interest rate swap agreement to hedge the benchmark interest rate of our $375 million 5.0% senior unsecured notes due July 1, 2014. The effect of the swap is to convert our 5.0% fixed interest rate to a variable interest rate based on the three-month LIBOR plus 2.05% (2.42% as of October 29, 2011). In addition, we have a term loan facility of $145 million that bears interest at a fluctuating rate for each period equal to the LIBOR rate corresponding with the tenor of the interest period plus a spread of 1.25% (1.61% as of October 29, 2011). If LIBOR increases by 100 basis points, our annual interest expense would increase by approximately $5 million. However, this hypothetical change in interest rates would not impact the interest expense on our $375 million of 3% fixed-rate debt, which is not hedged. As of October 30, 2010, a similar 100 basis point increase in LIBOR would have resulted in an increase of approximately $4 million to our annual interest expense. Foreign Currency Exposure As more fully described in Note 2i in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements contained in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, we regularly hedge our non-U.S. dollar-based exposures by entering into forward foreign currency exchange contracts. The terms of these contracts are for periods matching the duration of the underlying exposure and generally range from one month to twelve months. Currently, our largest foreign currency exposure is the Euro, primarily because our European operations have the highest proportion of our local currency denominated expenses. Relative to foreign currency exposures existing at October 29, 2011 and October 30, 2010, a 10% unfavorable movement in foreign currency exchange rates over the course of the year would expose us to approximately $6 million in losses in earnings or cash flows. The market risk associated with our derivative instruments results from currency exchange rates that are expected to offset the market risk of the underlying transactions, assets and liabilities being hedged. The counterparties to the agreements relating to our foreign exchange instruments consist of a number of major international financial institutions with high credit ratings. Based on the credit ratings of our counterparties as of October 29, 2011, we do not believe that there is significant risk of nonperformance by them. While the contract or notional amounts of derivative financial instruments provide one measure of the volume of these transactions, they do not represent the amount of our exposure to credit risk. The amounts potentially subject to credit risk (arising from the possible inability of counterparties to meet the terms of their contracts) are generally limited to the amounts, if any, by which the counterparties’ obligations under the contracts exceed our obligations to the counterparties. The following table illustrates the effect that a 10% unfavorable or favorable movement in foreign currency exchange rates, relative to the U.S. dollar, would have on the fair value of our forward exchange contracts as of October 29, 2011 and October 30, 2010: October 29, 2011 October 30, 2010 Fair value of forward exchange contracts asset $ 2,472 $ 7,256 Fair value of forward exchange contracts after a 10% unfavorable movement in foreign currency exchange rates asset $ 17,859 $ 22,062 Fair value of forward exchange contracts after a 10% favorable movement in foreign currency exchange rates liability $ (13,332 ) $ (7,396 ) The calculation assumes that each exchange rate would change in the same direction relative to the U.S. dollar. In addition to the direct effects of changes in exchange rates, such changes typically affect the volume of sales or the foreign currency sales price as competitors’ products become more or less attractive. Our sensitivity analysis of the effects of changes in foreign currency exchange rates does not factor in a potential change in sales levels or local currency selling prices. 44",2023-12-30 19:09:06.612683
6281,ADI,ANALOG DEVICES INC,2002,"ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Results of Operations Net sales were $2,277 million in fiscal 2001, a decrease of 12% from net sales of $2,578 million in fiscal 2000. The decrease in net sales was attributable to declining demand in several markets that we serve, particularly the communications market, as well as an overall decline in the general economy. Fiscal 2001 analog IC product sales decreased 3% from fiscal 2000. Our analog IC product sales were strong in the first half of the year and declined in line with a major downturn in the semiconductor industry that occurred during the last half of fiscal 2001. Our fiscal 2001 DSP IC product sales decreased 32% from the prior year due to order cancellations and adjustments, particularly from telecommunications customers and contract manufacturers. Sales of new products, which we define as sales of products introduced in the prior six quarters, were 19% of net sales in fiscal 2001 as compared with 25% in fiscal 2000. The year over year decrease in new products as a percentage of sales was primarily due to the sharp downturn in sales of our communications products. Net sales were $2,578 million in fiscal 2000, an increase of 78% over net sales of $1,450 million in fiscal 1999. This increase in net sales was attributable to continued growth in the markets we serve. Sales into all end markets increased in fiscal 2000 with the communications market representing the largest growth area. The percentage of sales by geographic region for the last three years is as follows: Region Fiscal 2001 Fiscal 2000 Fiscal 1999 North America 39 % 45 % 46 % Europe 24 % 19 % 22 % Japan 15 % 14 % 14 % Southeast Asia 22 % 22 % 18 % As set forth above, the fiscal 2001 decline in North American sales as a percentage of total sales was principally attributable to an overall decline in the communications market as well as a cyclical downturn in the semiconductor industry. Sales to international regions remained strong in the first half of fiscal 2001 but weakened in the latter half of the year due to the downturn in the semiconductor industry. In absolute dollar terms, sales to Europe increased by 10% in fiscal 2001. Sales in fiscal 2001 to Japan remained relatively flat to fiscal 2000 as both a percentage of sales and in absolute dollar terms. Fiscal 2001 sales to Southeast Asia remained flat as a percentage of sales as compared to fiscal 2000 while declining approximately 13% in absolute dollars. In fiscal 2000, sales to Europe declined as a percentage of total sales largely due to a weakening Euro/ U.S. dollar exchange rate over fiscal 1999. In absolute dollars, fiscal 2000 net sales increased over fiscal 1999 by 72% in North America, 61% in Europe, 75% in Japan and 114% in Southeast Asia. These large sales increases were due to high growth in end market demand that was not sustainable. Gross margin was $1,269 million, or 55.7% of net sales, in fiscal 2001 compared to $1,461 million, or 56.7% of net sales, in fiscal 2000. Gross margin declined by 100 basis points from the prior year due to reduced revenue levels, the impact of inventory reserves and low utilization of our internal fabs. The increase in gross margin in fiscal 2000 to 56.7% from the 49.3% achieved in fiscal 1999 was due primarily to the favorable effect of fixed costs being allocated across a higher sales base and improved manufacturing efficiencies as production increased at our wafer fabrication, assembly and test facilities. Gross margin declined to 52% in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2001 as a result of a 47% sales decline in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2001 as compared to the fourth quarter of fiscal 2000. Research and development (R&D) expense amounted to $465 million in fiscal 2001, an increase of $75 million over fiscal 2000. Additional expenses associated with increased engineering headcount were the main reason for the year over year increase. As a result of the decline in the year to year revenue, R&D spending as a percentage of sales increased to 20.4% from 15.1% in fiscal 2000. At any point in time we have hundreds of R&D projects underway, and we believe that none of these projects is material on an individual basis. We expect to continue the development of innovative technologies and processes for new products and we believe that a continued commitment to research and development is essential in order to maintain product 13 Table of Contents leadership with our existing products and to provide innovative new product offerings, and therefore we expect to continue to make significant R&D investments in the future. In fiscal 2000, R&D expense increased to $390 million from $253 million in fiscal 1999. Amortization of intangibles was $53 million for fiscal 2001 compared with $11 million for fiscal 2000. The increase in amortization expense was attributable to the amortization of goodwill associated with the acquisition of BCO Technologies plc in the third quarter of fiscal 2000, and the acquisition of Thomas Neuroth AG, Signal Processing Associates Pty. Ltd., Integrated Micro Instruments, Inc., ChipLogic, Inc. and Staccato Systems, Inc. completed in the first quarter of fiscal 2001. During the first quarter of fiscal 2001, we completed the following acquisitions: Maximum Purchase Contingent Acquired Company Price Consideration Thomas Neuroth AG (Neuroth) $ 4,500,000 $ 4,000,000 Signal Processing Associates Pty. Ltd. (SPA) 3,800,000 500,000 Integrated Micro Instruments (IMI) 1,900,000 2,700,000 ChipLogic, Inc. (ChipLogic) 68,300,000 29,000,000 Staccato Systems, Inc. (Staccato) 23,800,000 7,000,000 • On October 31, 2000, we acquired Thomas Neuroth AG (Neuroth) of Vienna, Austria for approximately $4.5 million in cash, with additional contingent cash consideration of up to $4 million payable if certain operational objectives are achieved. As of November 3, 2001, $1 million of the contingent consideration has been paid and charged to operations. The remaining $3 million of contingent consideration will be accounted for as goodwill. Neuroth is a developer of highly integrated circuits for symmetric DSL broadband access. • On November 10, 2000, we acquired Signal Processing Associates Pty. Ltd., (SPA) of Victoria, Australia for approximately $3.8 million in cash, with additional contingent cash consideration of up to $0.5 million payable if certain operation objectives are achieved. The contingent consideration will be recorded as compensation expense. SPA is a developer and supplier of voice processing and fax/data relay software for telecommunications applications. • On December 18, 2000, we acquired Integrated Micro Instruments, Inc. (IMI) of Berkeley, California for approximately $1.1 million in cash and 13,750 shares of our common stock valued at approximately $0.8 million. An additional 50,000 shares of common stock valued at a fixed amount of approximately $2.7 million are issuable over the next five years upon the satisfaction of certain conditions. The contingent consideration will be recorded as compensation expense. IMI develops MEMS process designs. • On January 4, 2001, we acquired ChipLogic, Inc. (ChipLogic) of Santa Clara, California. The total purchase price of $68.3 million consisted of cash of approximately $4 million, approximately 1 million shares of our common stock valued at $60.2 million and the assumption of $4.1 million of outstanding ChipLogic stock options. Approximately $9.5 million represented the purchase price of in-process technology that had not yet reached technological feasibility, had no alternative future use and was charged to operations during fiscal 2001. An additional $8 million of cash consideration and 489,375 shares of common stock is due if certain operational objectives are achieved and will be accounted for as compensation expense. Of these shares, 249,375 contingent shares have a fixed value of approximately $13 million which is being charged to operations over a five year period. The remaining 240,000 shares are subject to performance-based criteria. During fiscal 2001, approximately $4.2 million of expense was recorded related to the issuance of 117,592 shares of common stock associated with the achievement of certain of these objectives. The remaining performance based shares had a value of approximately $3.8 million as of November 3, 2001. To the extent that the remaining criteria are met, our stock price at that time will be used to measure the amount of compensation expense to be recoded. ChipLogic is a developer of high-performance integrated circuits and software focused on the convergence of voice, broadband access and network protocol processing. 14 Table of Contents • On January 16, 2001, we acquired Staccato Systems, Inc. (Staccato) of Mountain View, California. The total purchase price of $23.8 million consisted of $23 million in cash and the assumption of $0.8 million of outstanding Staccato stock options. Additional contingent cash consideration of up to $7 million is payable if certain operational objectives are achieved and will be accounted for as additional goodwill. Approximately $1.8 million of the contingent consideration has been paid as of November 3, 2001. Staccato is in the field of audio synthesis technology. During the third quarter of fiscal 2000, we acquired BCO Technologies plc (BCO), a company with operations in Belfast, Northern Ireland, in a cash-for-stock transaction valued at approximately $163 million. BCO is a leading supplier of silicon-on-insulator wafers used for fabricating micromechanical optical devices for optical switching and communications applications. In connection with this acquisition, we recorded approximately $158 million of goodwill. There was no in-process research and development write-off related to this acquisition. During the second quarter of fiscal 1999, we acquired two DSP tools companies, White Mountain DSP, Inc. of Nashua, New Hampshire (WM) and Edinburgh Portable Compilers Limited, of Edinburgh, Scotland (EPC). The total cost of these acquisitions was approximately $23 million with additional cash consideration of up to a maximum of $10 million payable if the acquired companies achieve certain revenue and operational objectives. As of November 3, 2001 all of the additional cash consideration has been paid and accounted for as additional purchase price. In connection with the acquisitions of WM and EPC, we recorded a charge of $5.1 million for the write-off of in-process research and development. Selling, marketing, general and administrative (SMG&A) expenses were $287 million in fiscal 2001, a decrease of $6 million from the $293 million in fiscal 2000. As a percentage of sales, SMG&A increased to 12.6% for fiscal 2001 from 11.4% in fiscal 2000 as a result of reduced revenue levels. In fiscal 2000, SMG&A expenses increased $83 million from $210 million in fiscal 1999. As a percentage of sales, SMG&A decreased to 11.4% in fiscal 2000 from 14.5% in fiscal 1999 as a result of increased sales. During fiscal 2001, we recorded a special charge of approximately $47 million related to cost reduction actions taken in response to the current economic climate. The actions consisted of workforce reductions in manufacturing, which included a decision to consolidate worldwide manufacturing operations and rationalize production planning and quality activities. Workforce reductions also occurred, to a lesser extent, in selling, marketing and administrative areas. As of November 3, 2001, the cost reductions included severance and fringe benefit costs of approximately $30 million for approximately 1,200 employees in the U.S., Europe, Asia and the Philippines, of which approximately half of these employees were terminated as of November 3, 2001. The special charge also included approximately $12 million related to the abandonment of equipment resulting from the consolidation of worldwide manufacturing operations. We believe that the workforce reductions will result in annual salary savings of approximately $40 million with a $27 million reduction in cost of sales and a $13 million reduction in operating expenses. The impact in fiscal 2002 of these cost savings is expected to be approximately $30 million, with a $20 million reduction in cost of sales and a $10 million reduction in operating expenses. Our operating income was $408 million, or 17.9% of sales, for fiscal 2001, compared to $767 million, or 29.8% of sales, in fiscal 2000 and $243 million, or 16.7% of net sales, for fiscal 1999. In fiscal 1999, we sold 78% of our investment in WaferTech, LLC (WaferTech) to other WaferTech partners in exchange for $105 million in cash, which was equal to 78% of the carrying value of the equity ownership at October 31, 1998. During the first quarter of fiscal 2001, we completed the sale of our remaining investment in WaferTech to Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company for approximately $61 million in cash. We recorded a pretax realized gain on the sale of this investment of approximately $28 million. In the third quarter of fiscal 2000, we sold our investment in Chartered Semiconductor Manufacturing Pte. Ltd. We received proceeds of approximately $65 million in cash and realized a pretax gain of approximately $44 million. These realized gains are included in other nonoperating income. Interest expense was $62 million in fiscal 2001 compared to $6 million in fiscal 2000. The increase in interest expense was the result of a full year of interest expense on our $1,200 million of 4.75% convertible subordinated notes, which were issued in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2000. Interest income was $133 million in fiscal 2001 compared to $63 million in fiscal 2000. The increase in interest income was due to higher cash 15 Table of Contents balances from increased cash flow as well as the unused portion of the funds obtained from the issuance of our 4.75% convertible subordinated notes. Our effective income tax rate remained relatively flat at 29.7% for fiscal 2001 as compared to 29.9% for fiscal 2000, primarily due to a shift in the mix of worldwide profits offset by a taxable gain on the sale of our remaining WaferTech investment. Our effective income tax rate increased to 29.9% for fiscal 2000 from 23.6% in fiscal 1999 due to increased profits in higher tax jurisdictions, principally the United States. Fiscal 2001 net income was $356 million, or 15.7% of sales, and diluted earnings per share was $0.93 compared to net income in fiscal 2000 of $607 million and diluted earnings per share of $1.59. The fiscal 2001 decrease in net income from fiscal 2000 was primarily due to reduced revenue levels. Net income increased to $607 million, or 23.6% of sales, in fiscal 2000 from $197 million, or 13.6% of sales, in fiscal 1999. Effective October 29, 2000, the Company adopted Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 133, (FAS 133), “Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities,” as amended by Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 138, “Accounting for Certain Instruments and Certain Hedging Activities.” FAS 133 requires that an entity recognize all derivatives as either assets or liabilities and measure such instruments at fair market value. Under certain circumstances, a portion of the derivative’s gain or loss is initially reported as a component of other comprehensive income (OCI) until the hedged transaction affects earnings. For a derivative not designated as a hedging instrument, the gain or loss is recognized in income immediately. While the adoption of FAS 133 on October 29, 2000 did not have a material impact on operations, it resulted in a $5 million loss recognized in OCI, which was reclassified into earnings during fiscal 2001. In August 2001 the Company adopted Securities and Exchange Commission Staff Accounting Bulletin 101, (SAB 101), “Revenue Recognition in Financial Statements.” SAB 101 summarizes the application of generally accepted accounting principles to revenue recognition in financial statements. The adoption of this standard did not have a material effect on our financial position or results of operations. In June 2001, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued Statements of Financial Accounting Standards No. 141, (FAS 141), “Business Combinations” and No. 142, (FAS 142), “Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets.” FAS 141 requires that all business combinations initiated after June 30, 2001 be accounted for using the purchase method of accounting. Under FAS 142, which is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2001, goodwill and intangible assets deemed to have indefinite lives will no longer be amortized but will be subject to annual impairment tests in accordance with the Statement. Other intangible assets will continue to be amortized over their estimated useful lives. We must adopt these new pronouncements no later than November 2002, with earlier adoption permitted. Application of the non-amortization provisions of FAS 142 is expected to result in an increase in net income of approximately $54 million, beginning in fiscal 2003. We will apply the new rules on accounting for goodwill and other intangible assets beginning in the first quarter of fiscal 2003 and have not yet determined what effect, if any, the adoption of FAS 141 and 142 will have on our financial position or results of operations. In June 2001, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 143, (FAS 143), “Accounting for Asset Retirement Obligations,” which addresses financial accounting and reporting for obligations associated with the retirement of tangible long-lived assets and the associated asset retirement costs. It also applies to legal obligations associated with the retirement of long-lived assets that result from the acquisition, construction, development and (or) the normal operation of a long-lived asset, except for certain obligations of lessees. We are required to adopt FAS 143 in the first quarter of fiscal 2003 and we do not believe that the adoption of FAS 143 will have a material effect on our financial position or results of operations. In August 2001, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 144, (FAS 144), “Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets,” which addresses the financial accounting and reporting for the impairment of long-lived assets. This statement supersedes Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 121, “Accounting for the Impairment of Long-Lived Assets and for Long-Lived Assets to Be Disposed Of” and the accounting and reporting provisions for 16 Table of Contents the disposal of a segment of a business of APB Opinion No. 30, “Reporting the Results of Operations-Reporting the Effects of Disposal of a Segment of a Business, and Extraordinary, Unusual and Infrequently Occurring Events and Transactions.” We are required to adopt FAS 144 in the first quarter of fiscal 2003 and we have not yet determined what effect, if any, the adoption of FAS 144 will have on our financial position or results of operations. The impact of inflation on our business during the past three years has not been significant. Liquidity and Capital Resources At November 3, 2001, we had $2,793 million of cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments compared to $2,235 million at October 28, 2000. The $558 million increase in cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments was primarily due to operating cash inflows of $844 million (37% of fiscal 2001 sales) offset by $297 million of capital spending. In fiscal 2000, our cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments increased by $1,473 million primarily due to operating cash inflows of $705 million, or 27% of sales in fiscal 2000, and $1,172 million of proceeds from the issuance of long-term debt offset by $275 million of capital spending and $169 million of acquisition-related spending. Investing activities used $1,220 million in fiscal 2001 and $456 million in fiscal 2000, while financing activities generated $2 million in fiscal 2001 and $1,130 million in fiscal 2000. Accounts receivable of $218 million at the end of fiscal 2001 decreased $246 million or 53% from $464 million at the end of fiscal 2000. This decrease resulted principally from a $382 million decrease in sales from the fourth quarter of fiscal 2000 to the fourth quarter of fiscal 2001. Days sales outstanding improved from 52 days at the end of the fourth quarter of fiscal 2000 to 46 days at the end of the fourth quarter of fiscal 2001. As a percentage of annualized fourth quarter sales, accounts receivable was 12.9% at the end of fiscal 2001, down from 14.4% at the end of fiscal 2000. Inventories decreased $85 million, or 26%, from fiscal 2000 to $247 million at the end of fiscal 2001. Days cost of sales in inventory increased by 21 days to 111 days as of the end of the fourth quarter of fiscal 2001. The decrease in inventory in absolute dollar terms is attributable to production decreases in response to reduced demand for our products as well as an increase in inventory reserves and a sharp curtailment of spending on wafers supplied by external foundries. We employ a variety of consistent methodologies to determine the amount of inventory reserves necessary. While a portion of the reserve is determined via reference to the age of inventory and lower of cost or market calculations, an element of the reserve is subject to significant judgments by us about future demand for our inventory. Although we believe that we have used our best efforts and information to estimate future demand, due to the uncertain economic times and the difficulty inherent in predicting future results, it is possible that actual demand for our products will differ from our estimates. If actual demand for products is less than our estimates, additional reserves for existing inventories may need to be reflected in future periods. Net additions to property, plant and equipment of $297 million for fiscal 2001 were funded with a combination of cash on hand and cash generated from operations. Capital spending in fiscal 2001 increased slightly from the $275 million incurred in fiscal 2000. Significant fiscal 2001 capital additions included new facilities in Wilmington, MA; Sunnyvale, CA; and Limerick, Ireland. We currently plan to make capital expenditures of approximately $70 million in fiscal 2002. Depreciation expense is expected to increase to $171 million in fiscal 2002 from $158 million in fiscal 2001. We acquired five companies during fiscal 2001, as more fully described in “Results of Operations.” Total cash used to purchase these companies was approximately $38 million. During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2000, we issued $1,200 million of 4.75% Convertible Subordinated Notes due 2005 (2005 Notes), with semiannual interest payments on April 1 and October 1 of each year, commencing April 1, 2001. The 2005 Notes are convertible, at the option of the holder, into our common stock at any time unless previously redeemed or repurchased, at a conversion price of $129.78 per share, subject to adjustment in certain events. The net proceeds of the offering were $1,172 million after payment of 17 Table of Contents the underwriting discount and expenses of the offering, which will be amortized over the term of the 2005 Notes. After the issuance of the 2005 Notes, our debt-to-equity ratio increased to 53%. At November 3, 2001, our principal sources of liquidity were $2,793 million of cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments. We believe that our existing sources of liquidity and cash expected to be generated from future operations, together with current and anticipated available long-term financing, will be sufficient to fund operations, capital expenditures and research and development efforts for the foreseeable future. Forward-Looking Statements The “Management Analysis” and other sections of this report contain forward-looking statements that are based on current expectations, estimates, forecasts and projections about the industry and markets in which we operate, management’s beliefs and assumptions made by management. In addition, other written or oral statements that constitute forward-looking statements may be made by or on our behalf. Words such as “expect,” “anticipate,” “intend,” “plan,” “believe,” “seek,” “estimate,” variations of such words and similar expressions are intended to identify such forward-looking statements. These statements are not guarantees of future performance and involve certain risks, uncertainties and assumptions that are difficult to predict. (See “Factors That May Affect Future Results” below.) Therefore, actual outcomes and results may differ materially from what is expressed or forecast in such forward-looking statements. We undertake no obligation to update publicly any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise. Factors That May Affect Future Results Our future operating results are difficult to predict and may materially fluctuate. Our future operating results are difficult to predict and may be materially affected by a number of factors, including the timing of new product announcements or introductions by us or our competitors, competitive pricing pressures, fluctuations in manufacturing yields, adequate availability of wafers and manufacturing capacity, the risk that our backlog could decline significantly, our ability to hire, retain and motivate adequate numbers of engineers and other qualified employees to meet the demands of our largest customers, changes in product mix, and the effect of adverse changes in economic conditions in the United States and international markets. In addition, the semiconductor market has historically been cyclical and subject to significant economic downturns at various times, including the recent decline in demand experienced during fiscal 2001. Our business is subject to rapid technological changes and there can be no assurance, depending on the mix of future business, that products stocked in inventory will not be rendered obsolete before we ship them. As a result of these and other factors, there can be no assurance that we will not experience material fluctuations in future operating results on a quarterly or annual basis. Our future success depends upon our ability to develop and market new products and enter new markets. Our success significantly depends on our continued ability to develop and market new products. There can be no assurance that we will be able to develop and introduce new products in a timely manner or that new products, if developed, will achieve market acceptance. In addition, our growth is dependent on our continued ability to penetrate new markets where we have limited experience and competition is intense. There can be no assurance that the markets we serve will grow in the future, that our existing and new products will meet the requirements of these markets, that our products will achieve customer acceptance in these markets, that competitors will not force prices to an unacceptably low level or take market share from us, or that we can achieve or maintain profits in these markets. Also, some of our customers in these markets are less well established, which could subject us to increased credit risk. 18 Table of Contents We may not be able to compete successfully in the semiconductor industry in the future. The semiconductor industry is intensely competitive. Some of our competitors have greater technical, marketing, manufacturing and financial resources than we do. Our competitors also include emerging companies attempting to sell products to specialized markets that we serve. Our competitors have, in some cases, developed and marketed products having similar design and functionality as our products. There can be no assurance that we will be able to compete successfully in the future against existing or new competitors or that our operating results will not be adversely affected by increased price competition. We may not be able to satisfy increasing demand for our products, and increased production may lead to overcapacity and lower prices. The cyclical nature of the semiconductor industry has resulted in sustained or short-term periods when demand for our products has increased or decreased rapidly. We and the semiconductor industry experienced a period of rapid decreases in demand in fiscal 2001. As a result we have overcapacity due to the expansion of our production facilities and increased access to third-party foundries. However, we cannot be sure that we will not encounter unanticipated production problems at either our own facilities or at third-party foundries, or that our capacity will be sufficient to satisfy demand for our products. We believe that other semiconductor manufacturers have expanded their production capacity over the past several years. This expansion by us and our competitors and the continuation of the decline in the demand for semiconductor products that began in early fiscal 2001, has led to overcapacity in our target markets, which has resulted in a year over year decline in our revenue rate and could lead to price erosion that would adversely affect our operating results. We rely on third-party subcontractors and manufacturers for some industry-standard wafers and assembly/test services and therefore cannot control their availability or conditions of supply. We rely, and plan to continue to rely, on assembly and test subcontractors and on third-party wafer fabricators to supply most of our wafers that can be manufactured using industry-standard digital processes. This reliance involves several risks, including reduced control over delivery schedules, manufacturing yields and costs. Our revenues may not increase enough to offset the expense of additional capacity. Our capacity additions resulted in a significant increase in operating expenses. If revenue levels do not increase enough to offset these additional expense levels, our future operating results could be adversely affected. In addition, asset values could be impaired if the additional capacity is underutilized for an extended period of time. We rely on manufacturing capacity located in geologically unstable areas, which could affect the availability of supplies and services. We, and many companies in the semiconductor industry, rely on internal manufacturing capacity located in California and Taiwan as well as wafer fabrication foundries in Taiwan and other sub-contractors in geologically unstable locations around the world. This reliance involves risks associated with the impact of earthquakes on us and the semiconductor industry, including temporary loss of capacity, availability and cost of key raw materials and equipment, and availability of key services including transport. In addition, California has recently experienced intermittent interruption in the availability of electricity. To date, the impact on us has been negligible. However, electricity is a critical resource for us, without which our products could not be manufactured at factories exposed to continued lengthy power interruptions. We are exposed to economic, political and other risks through our significant worldwide operations. During fiscal 2001, 61% of our revenues were derived from customers in international markets. We have manufacturing facilities outside the United States in Ireland, the United Kingdom, the Philippines and Taiwan. In addition to being exposed to the ongoing economic cycles in the semiconductor industry, we are also subject to the economic and political risks inherent in international operations and their impact on the 19 Table of Contents U.S. economy in general, including the risks associated with ongoing uncertainties and political and economic instability in many countries around the world as well as the economic disruption from acts of terrorism, particularly in the aftermath of the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001 and the response to them of the United States and its allies. These risks include air transportation disruptions, expropriation, currency controls and changes in currency exchange rates, tax and tariff rates and freight rates, and social and political unrest. Although we engage in hedging transactions to reduce our exposure to currency exchange rate fluctuations, there can be no assurance that our competitive position will not be adversely affected by changes in the exchange rate of the U.S. dollar against other currencies. We are involved in frequent litigation regarding intellectual property rights, which could be costly to defend and could require us to redesign products or pay significant royalties. The semiconductor industry is characterized by frequent claims and litigation involving patent and other intellectual property rights. We have from time to time received, and may in the future receive, claims from third parties asserting that our products or processes infringe their patents or other intellectual property rights. In the event a third party makes a valid intellectual property claim and a license is not available on commercially reasonable terms, we could be forced either to redesign or to stop production of products incorporating that intellectual property, and our operating results could be materially and adversely affected. Litigation may be necessary to enforce patents or other of our intellectual property rights or to defend us against claims of infringement, and this litigation can be costly and divert the attention of key personnel. See Note 10 of the Notes to our Consolidated Financial Statements for the fiscal year ended November 3, 2001 for information concerning pending litigation that involves us. An adverse outcome in this litigation could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position or on our consolidated results of operations or cash flows in the period in which the litigation is resolved. Leverage and debt service obligations may adversely affect our cash flow. We have a substantial amount of outstanding indebtedness. We may be unable to generate cash sufficient to pay the principal of, interest on, and other amounts due in respect of, this indebtedness when due. Our substantial leverage could have significant negative consequences. This substantial leverage could increase our vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions. It may require the dedication of a substantial portion of our expected cash flow from operations to service the indebtedness, thereby reducing the amount of our expected cash flow available for other purposes, including capital expenditures. It may also limit our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and the industry in which we operate. ITEM 7A. QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK We have fixed rate debt obligations and interest rate swap and cap agreements. An increase in interest rates would not significantly increase interest expense due to the fixed nature of our debt obligations. Because of the size and structure of these obligations, a 100 basis point increase in interest rates would not result in a material change in our interest expense or the fair value of the debt obligations and related interest rate swap and cap agreements for fiscal 2001 and fiscal 2000. The fair value of our investment portfolio would not be significantly impacted by either a 100 basis point increase or decrease in interest rates in fiscal 2001 and fiscal 2000 due mainly to the short-term nature of the major portion of our investment portfolio. The related interest income would change by approximately $6 million for each 100 basis point increase or decrease in interest rates for fiscal 2001 on a weighted average portfolio maturity of 93 days. The impact of a 100 basis point increase or decrease in interest rates on interest income was not material for fiscal 2000 due mainly to the relative insignificance of interest income to the consolidated pretax income. As more fully described in Note 2 (i) in the Notes to our Consolidated Financial Statements, we regularly hedge our non-U.S. dollar-based exposures by entering into forward exchange contracts. The terms of these contracts are for periods matching the duration of the underlying exposure and generally range from three months up to one year. The short-term nature of these contracts has resulted in these instruments having insignificant fair values at November 3, 2001 and October 28, 2000. Currently, our largest foreign currency 20 Table of Contents exposure is against the Euro, primarily because Europe has a higher proportion of local currency denominated expenses. Relative to foreign currency exposures existing at November 3, 2001 and October 28, 2000, a 10% unfavorable movement in foreign exchange rates would not expose us to significant losses in earnings or cash flows or significantly diminish the fair value of our foreign currency financial instruments, primarily due to the short lives of the affected financial instruments that effectively hedge substantially all of our year-end exposures against fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. The calculation assumes that each exchange rate would change in the same direction relative to the U.S. dollar. In addition to the direct effects of changes in exchange rates, such changes typically affect the volume of sales or the foreign currency sales price as competitors’ products become more or less attractive. Our sensitivity analysis of the effects of changes in foreign currency exchange rates does not factor in a potential change in sales levels or local currency selling prices. 21 Table of Contents",2023-12-30 19:08:58.356856
6281,ADI,ANALOG DEVICES INC,2003,"ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Results of Operations Fiscal Year 2002 Overview Fiscal 2002 was a challenging year for us. We recorded quarterly revenues of $806 million in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2000, which represented the peak of the current cycle. Our revenues then declined significantly to $393 million in the first quarter of fiscal 2002. We then experienced a gradual sequential recovery for the last three quarters of fiscal 2002, with our fiscal 2002 fourth quarter revenue reaching $456 million. Our gross margins remained strong at 53% for fiscal 2002. Operating expenses declined by almost 9% as a result of cost containment measures throughout our company. Our cash flow continued to be strong, with cash increasing by over $100 million during fiscal 2002 to $2,900 million after purchasing approximately $100 million of our common stock. Sales Net sales were $1,708 million in fiscal 2002, a decrease of 25% from net sales of $2,277 million in fiscal 2001. Approximately 80% of our net sales in both fiscal 2002 and fiscal 2001 were from analog products, which decreased 26% from fiscal 2001 to fiscal 2002 and decreased 4% from fiscal 2000 to fiscal 2001. DSP product sales represented the remaining 20% of our net sales in both fiscal 2002 and fiscal 2001 and decreased 22% in fiscal 2002 after declining 33% in fiscal 2001. The decreases in net sales in fiscal 2002 and fiscal 2001 were attributable to declining demand in several markets that we serve, particularly the communications market, as well as an overall decline in the general economy. Sales of new products, which we define as sales of products introduced in the prior six quarters, were 21% of net sales in fiscal 2002 as compared to 19% in fiscal 2001. The year-over-year increase in new products as a percentage of sales was primarily due to the introduction of record numbers of new analog IC products throughout the economic downturn experienced over the past two years. Net sales were $2,277 million in fiscal 2001, a decrease of 12% from net sales of $2,578 million in fiscal 2000. This decrease in net sales was attributable to declining demand in the markets we serve, particularly the communications market, as well as an overall decline in the general economy. Sales of new products were 19% of net sales in fiscal 2001 as compared to 25% in fiscal 2000. The year over year decrease in new products as a percentage of sales was primarily due to the sharp downturn in sales of our communications products. The percentage of sales by geographic region, based upon point of sale, for the last three years is as follows: Region Fiscal 2002 Fiscal 2001 Fiscal 2000 North America 30 % 39 % 45 % Europe 21 % 24 % 19 % Japan 17 % 15 % 14 % Southeast Asia 32 % 22 % 22 % The fiscal 2002 decline in North American sales as a percentage of total net sales was principally attributable to an overall decline in the communications market, a cyclical downturn in the semiconductor industry as well as the ongoing transfer of customer manufacturing activity to lower cost locations, primarily Southeast Asia. Sales in fiscal 2002 to Japan increased slightly from fiscal 2001 as a percentage of net sales but declined by 15% in dollars. Fiscal 2002 sales to Southeast Asia increased as a percentage of net sales by 10% as compared to fiscal 2001 while increasing approximately 9% in dollars. In dollars, fiscal 2001 net sales decreased over fiscal 2000 by 23% in North America, 3% in Japan and 13% in Southeast Asia and increased over fiscal 2000 by 10% in Europe. 15 Table of Contents Gross Margin Fiscal 2002 gross margin was $905 million, or 53% of net sales, down 270 basis points from fiscal 2001 gross margin of $1,269 million, or 55.7% of net sales. Gross margin decreased to 55.7% in fiscal 2001 from the 56.7% achieved in fiscal 2000. The decline in year-over-year gross margin for both fiscal 2002 and fiscal 2001 was primarily due to reduced revenue levels and lower utilization of our internal wafer fabrication facilities. Gross margin increased to 53.2% in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2002 from 51.9% in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2001. The gross margin improvement through fiscal 2002 was caused by a steady quarterly sales increase from the second quarter of fiscal 2002, combined with tight spending controls and the impact of manufacturing restructuring actions. We decided that we had the opportunity to use this downturn to fundamentally and permanently reduce our manufacturing infrastructure costs worldwide. In the second quarter of fiscal 2002, we announced that we would transition products from our older four-inch wafer fabrication facilities to our six-inch and eight-inch wafer fabrication facilities that were then operating well below capacity. As a result, the remaining service lives of certain assets within our wafer fabrication facilities were shortened. Depreciation expense included in cost of sales included additional depreciation of approximately $8.7 million in fiscal 2002 associated with the shortened lives of some equipment in our older four-inch wafer fabrication facilities. Research and Development Research and development, or R&D, expenses amounted to $424 million in fiscal 2002, a decrease of $41 million from the $465 million recorded in fiscal 2001. Included in fiscal 2002 expense is approximately $13.8 million of acquisition-related expenses compared to approximately $8.2 million in fiscal 2001. The increase in acquisition-related expense in fiscal 2002 was attributable to a full year of expense related to fixed-value contingent compensation and the achievement of final performance-based criteria. R&D spending in dollars declined by 9% in fiscal 2002 as compared to fiscal 2001. The decline in R&D expenses in dollars was primarily due to the elimination of bonuses and the temporary reduction of salaries of our most highly compensated employees partially offset by selective hiring of engineers. As a result of the decline in year-over-year revenue, R&D spending as a percentage of sales for fiscal 2002 increased to 24.8% in fiscal 2002 from 20.4% in fiscal 2001. Despite the significant decline in sales in fiscal 2002, in view of our long-term business strategy, we continued to invest in R&D at levels commensurate with significantly higher revenue levels than we were achieving in the short term. At any point in time we have hundreds of R&D projects underway, and we believe that none of these projects is material on an individual basis. We expect to continue the development of innovative technologies and processes for new products and we believe that a continued commitment to R&D is essential in order to maintain product leadership with our existing products and to provide innovative new product offerings, and therefore, we expect to continue to make significant R&D investments in the future. In fiscal 2001, R&D expense increased to $465 million from $390 million in fiscal 2000 as a result of additional expenses associated with increased engineering headcount. Selling, Marketing, General and Administrative Selling, marketing, general and administrative, or SMG&A, expenses were $257 million in fiscal 2002, a decrease of $30 million, or 10.5%, from the $287 million recorded in fiscal 2001. The decrease in SMG&A expenses in dollars was the result of cost reduction programs including the elimination of bonuses and temporary salary reductions for our most highly compensated employees along with continued tight control over discretionary expenses. As a percentage of sales, SMG&A increased to 15% for fiscal 2002 from 12.6% in fiscal 2001 as a result of reduced revenue levels in fiscal 2002. The industry downturn offered us the opportunity to hire experienced, technically-savvy personnel, many of whom were already familiar with our products and, as a result, we significantly increased our field application engineers during fiscal 2002. Despite the decline in net sales, we decided to significantly increase our field applications engineers in order to help our customers design in our newest products. In fiscal 2001, SMG&A expenses decreased by $6 million to $287 million from $293 million in fiscal 2000. As a percentage of sales, SMG&A increased to 12.6% in fiscal 2001 from 11.4% in fiscal 2000 as a result of reduced revenue levels. 16 Table of Contents Amortization of Intangibles Amortization of intangibles was $57 million for fiscal 2002 compared with $53 million for fiscal 2001 and $11 million in fiscal 2000. In fiscal 2003, we anticipate amortization expense to decrease to approximately $3 million as a result of our adoption of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 142, “Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets.” The increase in amortization expense in fiscal 2002 as compared to fiscal 2001 was primarily due to amortization of goodwill associated with acquisitions completed in fiscal 2001 where amortization commenced during fiscal 2001. The increase in amortization expense in fiscal 2001 as compared to fiscal 2000 was attributable to the amortization of goodwill associated with the acquisition of BCO Technologies plc. in the third quarter of fiscal 2000, and the acquisitions of Thomas Neuroth AG, Signal Processing Associates Pty. Ltd., Integrated Micro Instruments, Inc., ChipLogic, Inc. and Staccato Systems, Inc. completed in the first quarter of fiscal 2001. Special Charges During fiscal 2002, we recorded special charges totaling $48.5 million and, during fiscal 2001, we recorded special charges of $47 million. In the second quarter of fiscal 2002, we recorded special charges of approximately $27.2 million. The second quarter charge included $25.7 million related to the planned transfer of production from our three older four-inch wafer fabrication facilities to our three six-inch and one eight-inch wafer fabrication facilities, and $3 million primarily related to the impairment of an investment, which was offset by a $1.5 million adjustment to estimated equipment cancellation fees recorded in fiscal year 2001. The investment impairment, which was related to an equity investment in a private company, was due to our decision to abandon the product strategy for which the investment was made. Included in the $25.7 million component of the special charge are severance and fringe benefit costs of $15.3 million for 509 manufacturing employees in the United States and Ireland, of which 182 of these employees had been terminated as of November 2, 2002, $2.3 million related to the write-down of equipment to be abandoned and $8.1 million of other charges primarily related to lease termination and cleanup costs. In addition, the remaining service lives of certain assets within the older four-inch wafer fabrication facilities have been shortened. Depreciation expense included in cost of sales in fiscal 2002 included additional depreciation of approximately $8.7 million associated with the shortened lives of these assets. The write-down of equipment was principally due to our decision to discontinue various product development strategies. As of November 2, 2002, there was $25 million related to these charges remaining to be paid. This program is proceeding in accordance with our original plan and we expect to substantially complete these actions by mid-fiscal 2003. Once fully complete, we anticipate annual savings from the above actions of approximately $60 million, primarily in cost of sales, and the first full year’s impact will be fiscal 2004. During the third quarter of fiscal 2002, we recorded special charges of $12.8 million. The charges included severance and fringe benefit costs of $3.7 million related to cost reduction actions taken in several product groups and, to a lesser extent, in manufacturing, $3.8 million related to the impairment of an investment, $3.4 million impairment of goodwill related to the closure of an Austrian design center we acquired in fiscal 2001 and $1.9 million primarily related to the abandonment of equipment and lease cancellation fees. The investment impairment, which was related to an equity investment in a private company, was due to our decision to abandon the product strategy for which the investment was made. The severance and fringe benefit costs were for approximately 70 engineering employees in the United States, Europe and Canada, and approximately 30 manufacturing employees in the United States. All of the manufacturing employees and approximately 32 of the engineering employees had been terminated as of November 2, 2002. As of November 2, 2002, there was $4.3 million related to these charges remaining to be paid. We expect to substantially complete these actions in the first quarter of fiscal 2003. Once fully complete, we anticipate the workforce reductions will result in annual savings of approximately $10 million, primarily in operating expenses. During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2002, we recorded special charges of $8.4 million. The charges included severance and fringe benefit costs of $2.5 million related to cost reduction actions taken in our sales 17 Table of Contents group, several product groups and in manufacturing for approximately 65 employees in the United States and Europe, of which 40 had been terminated as of November 2, 2002. The charges also included $2.1 million related to the impairment of investments, $1.8 million primarily related to the abandonment of equipment and lease cancellation fees and a change in estimate of $2 million related to previously recorded cleanup costs. The investment impairment charges were related to the decline in fair value of a publicly-traded equity investment below cost basis that was determined to be other-than-temporary and of an equity investment in a private company. The private company equity investment was part of a product strategy we decided to abandon. As of November 2, 2002, there was $3.1 million related to these charges remaining to be paid. We expect to substantially complete these actions by the third quarter of fiscal 2003. Once fully complete, we anticipate the workforce reductions will result in annual savings of approximately $4 million, primarily in operating expenses. The restructuring actions underlying the special charges accrued in fiscal 2002 are proceeding as planned. The cost savings impact in fiscal 2002 of the special charges related to severance and benefits was approximately $2 million. Most of the remaining accrued special charge is attributable to actions planned and accrued in the second quarter of fiscal 2002 that involved the transfer of production from three separate four-inch wafer fabrication facilities to our six-inch and eight-inch wafer fabrication facilities, which are located in Massachusetts, California and Ireland. Our plan is for this transfer to be completed by mid-fiscal 2003. During fiscal 2001, we recorded special charges of $47 million related to cost reduction actions taken in response to the then current economic climate. The actions consisted of workforce reductions in manufacturing and, to a lesser extent, in selling, marketing and administrative areas. In addition, we made a decision to consolidate worldwide manufacturing operations and rationalize production planning and quality activities. The cost reductions included severance and fringe benefit costs of $29.6 million for approximately 1,200 employees in the United States, Europe, Asia and the Philippines, of which approximately 1,010 of these employees had been terminated as of November 2, 2002. The remaining 190 employees are expected to be terminated during the first quarter of fiscal 2003. As of November 2, 2002, $23 million of the $29.6 million aggregate severance cost obligations underlying the fiscal 2001 worldwide cost reduction actions had been paid. The special charge also included $11.6 million related to the abandonment of equipment resulting from the consolidation of worldwide manufacturing operations and $5.8 million of other charges primarily related to equipment and lease cancellation fees. Based on the results of negotiations with vendors regarding purchase order cancellation fees, the amount paid was approximately $1.5 million less than the amount recorded for such charges and accordingly, in the second quarter of fiscal 2002 we adjusted the provision for purchase order cancellation fees by $1.5 million to reflect this change in estimate. As of November 2, 2002, there was $7.6 million related to these charges remaining to be paid. We believe that the workforce reductions will result in annual salary savings of approximately $40 million, consisting of a $27 million reduction in cost of sales and a $13 million reduction in operating expenses. The impact in fiscal 2002 of these cost savings was approximately $30 million, consisting of a $20 million reduction in cost of sales and a $10 million reduction in operating expenses. The restructuring actions included in the special charges recorded during fiscal 2001 are proceeding as planned. Of the $47 million of special charges recorded in fiscal 2001, $7.6 million remained accrued as of November 2, 2002. The amount covers termination payments being paid as income continuance to 1,010 terminated employees as a result of the fiscal 2001 actions as well as accrued termination payments for the remaining 190 employees expected to be terminated in the first quarter of fiscal 2003. Operating Income Our operating income was $118 million, or 6.9% of sales, in fiscal 2002, compared to $408 million, or 17.9% of sales, in fiscal 2001 and $767 million, or 29.8% of net sales, for fiscal 2000. Nonoperating Income and Expense Interest expense was $44 million in fiscal 2002 compared to $62 million in fiscal 2001. The decrease in interest expense was the result of an interest rate swap agreement we entered into in January 2002 that has the effect of swapping the 4.75% fixed rate of our $1,200 million convertible subordinated notes into a LIBOR- 18 Table of Contents based floating rate (1.61% as of November 6, 2002). Interest expense was $62 million in fiscal 2001 compared to $6 million in fiscal 2000. The increase in interest expense was the result of a full year of interest expense on our $1,200 million of 4.75% convertible subordinated notes, which were issued in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2000. Interest income was $65 million in fiscal 2002 compared to $133 million in fiscal 2001. The decrease in interest income was attributable to less income earned on our invested cash balances due to the decline in interest rates during fiscal 2002 as a result of actions taken by the Federal Reserve Board and our decision to increase our holdings of higher credit quality yet lower interest-bearing investments. Interest income was $133 million in fiscal 2001 compared to $63 million in fiscal 2000. The increase in interest income was due to higher cash balances from increased cash flow as well as the unused portion of the funds obtained from the issuance of our 4.75% convertible subordinated notes. Other income decreased approximately $28 million in fiscal 2002 from fiscal 2001 due to a one-time gain on the sale of our investment in WaferTech recorded in the first quarter of fiscal 2001. Other income decreased approximately $12 million in fiscal 2001 from fiscal 2000 primarily due to a one-time gain of $44 million on the sale of our investment in Chartered Semiconductor Manufacturing Pte. Ltd. recorded in the third quarter of fiscal 2000, offset by the sale of WaferTech described above. Provision for Income Taxes Our effective income tax rate decreased to 25.0% for fiscal 2002 as compared to 29.7% for fiscal 2001 due to a shift in the mix of worldwide profits. Our effective income tax rate remained relatively flat at 29.7% for fiscal 2001 as compared to 29.9% for fiscal 2000. The effective income tax rate for fiscal 2003 is expected to be approximately 22.0%. The expected decrease is the result of the discontinuance of goodwill amortization in the first quarter of fiscal 2003 as a result of our adoption of Financial Accounting Standards Board Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 142, “Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets.” Net Income Fiscal 2002 net income was $105 million, or 6.2% of sales, and diluted earnings per share was $0.28 compared to net income in fiscal 2001 of $356 million, or 15.7% of sales, and diluted earnings per share of $0.93. The fiscal 2002 decrease in net income from fiscal 2001 was primarily due to reduced revenue levels. Net income decreased to $356 million in fiscal 2001 from $607 million, or 23.6% of sales, in fiscal 2000. The impact of inflation on our business during the past three years has not been significant. Acquisitions During the first quarter of fiscal 2001, we completed the following acquisitions: • In the first quarter of fiscal 2001, we completed the acquisitions of Thomas Neuroth AG, Signal Processing Associates Pty. Ltd. and Integrated Micro Instruments, Inc. The total amount paid for these acquisitions, as of November 2, 2002, was $10.2 million. As of November 2, 2002, the remaining contingent consideration of $2.7 million will be paid if certain operational objectives are met and will be accounted for as compensation expense. • On January 4, 2001, we acquired ChipLogic, Inc. of Santa Clara, California. ChipLogic is a developer of high-performance integrated circuits and software focused on the convergence of voice, broadband access and network protocol processing. The total purchase price of $68.3 million consisted of approximately $4 million in cash, approximately 1 million shares of our common stock valued at $60.2 million and the assumption of $4.1 million of outstanding ChipLogic vested stock options. Approximately $9.5 million represented the purchase price of in-process technology that had not yet reached technological feasibility, had no alternative future use and was charged to operations during fiscal 2001. An additional $8 million of cash consideration and 489,375 shares of common stock is due if certain operational objectives are achieved and will, if paid, be accounted for as compensation expense. Of these shares, 249,375 contingent shares have a fixed value of approximately $13 million and are being charged to operations over a five-year period as 19 Table of Contents their restrictions lapse. The remaining 240,000 shares are subject to performance-based criteria and during fiscal 2001, approximately $4.2 million of expense was recorded related to the issuance of 117,592 shares of common stock associated with the achievement of certain of these objectives. During fiscal 2002, approximately $5 million was recorded related to the issuance of the remaining shares. As of November 2, 2002, there was $8 million of remaining contingent consideration. We expect to pay approximately $2.7 million of this contingent consideration in the first quarter of fiscal 2003. An additional $2.8 million of compensation expense is being recorded annually through fiscal 2005 related to our assumption of unvested stock options. • On January 16, 2001, we acquired Staccato Systems, Inc. of Mountain View, California. Staccato is in the field of audio synthesis technology. The total purchase price of $23.8 million consisted of $23 million in cash and the assumption of $0.8 million of outstanding Staccato vested stock options. We paid an additional $7 million related to the achievement of operational objectives that was accounted for as additional goodwill, of which approximately $5 million was recorded in fiscal 2002. All of the contingent consideration had been paid as of November 2, 2002. An additional $0.2 million of compensation expense is being recorded annually through fiscal 2005 related to the assumption of unvested stock options. During the third quarter of fiscal 2000, we acquired BCO Technologies plc, or BCO, a company with operations in Belfast, Northern Ireland, in a cash-for-stock transaction valued at approximately $163 million. BCO is a leading supplier of silicon-on-insulator, or SOI, wafers used for fabricating micromechanical devices. As a result of our acquisition of BCO, we are incorporating SOI technology into our next generation of inertial sensors. In connection with this acquisition, we recorded approximately $158 million of goodwill. There was no in-process research and development write-off related to this acquisition. New Accounting Pronouncements In June 2001, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued Statements of Financial Accounting Standards No. 141, or FAS 141, “Business Combinations” and No. 142, or FAS 142, “Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets.” FAS 141 requires that all business combinations initiated after June 30, 2001 be accounted for using the purchase method of accounting. Under FAS 142, which is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2001, goodwill and intangible assets deemed to have indefinite lives will no longer be amortized but will be subject to annual impairment tests in accordance with the statement. Other intangible assets will continue to be amortized over their estimated useful lives. As of November 2002, we have adopted these new pronouncements. Application of the non-amortization provisions of FAS 142 is expected to result in an increase in annual net income of approximately $54 million, beginning in fiscal 2003. During fiscal 2003, we will perform the first of the required impairment tests of goodwill as of November 3, 2002. In June 2001, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 143, or FAS 143, “Accounting for Asset Retirement Obligations,” which addresses financial accounting and reporting for legal obligations associated with the retirement of tangible long-lived assets that result from the acquisition, construction, development and (or) the normal operation of a long-lived asset, except for certain obligations of lessees. We are required to adopt FAS 143 in the first quarter of fiscal 2003 and do not believe that the adoption of FAS 143 will have a material effect on our financial position or results of operations. In August 2001, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 144, or FAS 144, “Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets,” which addresses the financial accounting and reporting for the impairment of long-lived assets. This statement supersedes Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 121, “Accounting for the Impairment of Long-Lived Assets and for Long-Lived Assets to Be Disposed Of,” and the accounting and reporting provisions for the disposal of a segment of a business set forth in APB Opinion No. 30, “Reporting the Results of Operations-Reporting the Effects of Disposal of a Segment of a Business, and Extraordinary, Unusual and Infrequently Occurring Events and Transactions.” We are required to adopt FAS 144 in the first quarter of 20 Table of Contents fiscal 2003 and do not believe that the adoption of FAS 144 will have a material effect on our financial position or results of operations. In April 2002, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 145, or FAS 145, “Rescission of FASB Statements No. 4, 44 and 64, Amendment of FASB Statement No. 13, and Technical Corrections.” Under FAS 145, gains and losses on extinguishments of debt are to be classified as income or loss from continuing operations rather than extraordinary items. We are required to adopt FAS 145 in the first quarter of fiscal 2003 and do not expect the adoption of this statement to have a material impact on our financial condition or results of operations. In July 2002, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 146, or FAS 146, “Accounting for Costs Associated with Exit or Disposal Activities.” The statement requires companies to recognize costs associated with exit or disposal activities when they are incurred rather than at the date of a commitment to an exit or disposal plan. Costs covered by the statement include lease termination costs and certain employee severance costs that are associated with a restructuring, plant closing, or other exit or disposal activity. This statement is effective for exit or disposal activities initiated after December 31, 2002. FAS 146 may affect the timing of our recognition of future exit or disposal costs, if any. Liquidity and Capital Resources At November 2, 2002, we had $2,898 million of cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments compared to $2,793 million at November 3, 2001. The $105 million increase in cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments was primarily due to operating cash inflows of $226 million, or 13% of sales in fiscal 2002, and $37 million of proceeds from employee stock plans, offset by a $98 million repurchase of shares of our common stock and $57 million of capital spending. In fiscal 2001, our cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments increased by $558 million to $2,793 million from $2,235 million in fiscal 2000 primarily due to operating cash inflows of $844 million, or 37% of sales in fiscal 2001, offset by $297 million of capital spending. Investing activities provided $90 million in fiscal 2002 and used $1,220 million in fiscal 2001, while financing activities used $69 million in fiscal 2002 and provided $2 million in fiscal 2001. Accounts receivable of $228 million at the end of fiscal 2002 increased $10 million, or 4.7%, from $218 million at the end of fiscal 2001. This increase resulted principally from a $32 million increase in sales during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2002 as compared to the fourth quarter of fiscal 2001. Days sales outstanding remained at 46 days at the end of the fourth quarter of fiscal 2002 as compared to the fourth quarter of fiscal 2001. As a percentage of annualized fourth quarter sales, accounts receivable was 12.5% at the end of fiscal 2002, down from 12.9% at the end of fiscal 2001. Inventories increased $60 million, or 24%, from the end of fiscal 2001 to $306 million at the end of fiscal 2002. Days cost of sales in inventory increased by 24 days to 135 days as of the end of the fourth quarter of fiscal 2002. The increase in inventory in dollars was attributable to the combination of internal die bank builds and external wafer purchases. The build in die bank inventory was in preparation for the transfer of production from our four-inch wafer fabrication facilities to our six- and eight-inch wafer fabrication facilities. The external wafer purchases were in support of expected demand in our handset and consumer analog business. We are nearing the completion of the die bank build and have cut back on external wafer purchases. Therefore, we expect that inventory will remain relatively flat in dollars during the first quarter of fiscal 2003 and our days cost of sales in inventory will start to decline towards our long-term model of 100 to 110 days during fiscal 2003. Net additions to property, plant and equipment of $57 million in fiscal 2002 were funded with a combination of cash on hand and cash generated from operations. Capital spending in fiscal 2002 was down substantially from the $297 million incurred in fiscal 2001. In response to the slowdown in our served markets, we have substantially reduced our capital spending. We currently plan to make capital expenditures of approximately $80 million in fiscal 2003. Capital expenditures are expected to remain low, as we believe we currently have ample installed capacity to significantly increase internal production levels. Depreciation expense is expected to decrease slightly in fiscal 2003 from $181 million in fiscal 2002. 21 Table of Contents We acquired five companies during fiscal 2001, as more fully described in “Acquisitions.” Total cash used to purchase these companies was approximately $38.5 million in 2001 and another $5.2 million was paid in fiscal 2002 as certain operational objectives were achieved, and these additional payments were accounted for as additional goodwill. During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2000, we issued $1,200 million of 4.75% convertible subordinated notes due 2005, or 2005 notes, with semiannual interest payments on April 1 and October 1 of each year. The 2005 notes are convertible, at the option of the holder, into shares of our common stock at any time unless previously redeemed or repurchased, at a conversion price of $129.78 per share, subject to adjustment in certain events. The net proceeds of the offering were $1,172 million after payment of the underwriting discount and expenses of the offering, which are being amortized over the term of the 2005 notes. The table below summarizes our contractual cash obligations as of November 2, 2002: (thousands) 2003 2004 2005 2006 2007+ Total Contractual obligations: Long-term debt $ 7,773 $ 9,173 $ 1,210,498 $ — $ — $ 1,227,444 Capital lease obligations 3,828 467 — — — 4,295 Operating leases 15,793 13,358 11,889 8,522 11,421 60,983 Total $ 27,394 $ 22,998 $ 1,222,387 $ 8,522 $ 11,421 $ 1,292,722 At November 2, 2002, our principal source of liquidity was $2,898 million of cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments. We believe that our existing sources of liquidity and cash expected to be generated from future operations, together with current and anticipated available long-term financing, will be sufficient to fund operations, capital expenditures and research and development efforts for at least the next twelve months and thereafter for the foreseeable future. Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates Management’s discussion and analysis of the financial condition and results of operations is based upon the consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. We base our estimates and judgments on historical experience, knowledge of current conditions and beliefs of what could occur in the future given available information. We consider the following accounting policies to be both those most important to the portrayal of our financial condition and those that require the most subjective judgment. If actual results differ significantly from management’s estimates and projections, there could be a material effect on our financial statements. Inventories Inventories are valued at the lower of cost (first-in, first-out method) or market. Because of the cyclical nature of the semiconductor industry, inventory levels, obsolescence of technology, and product life cycles, we write down inventories to net realizable value. We employ a variety of consistent methodologies to determine the amount of inventory reserves necessary. While a portion of the reserve is determined via reference to the age of inventory and lower of cost or market calculations, an element of the reserve is subject to significant judgments by us about future demand for our inventory. Additionally, we have built inventory in preparation for the transfer of production from our four-inch wafer fabrication facilities to our six- and eight-inch wafer fabrication facilities for both lifetime supply and transition inventory. We have recorded certain levels of reserves related to these inventory builds. Although we believe that we have used our best efforts and information to estimate future demand, due to the uncertain economic times and the difficulty inherent in predicting future results, it is possible that actual demand for our products will differ from our estimates. If actual demand for products is less than our estimates, additional reserves for existing inventories may need to be recorded in future periods. 22 Table of Contents Long-Lived Assets We review property, plant, and equipment for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of such an asset may not be recoverable. Recoverability of these assets is measured by comparison of their carrying amount to future undiscounted cash flows the assets are expected to generate. If such assets are considered to be impaired, the impairment to be recognized in earnings equals the amount by which the carrying value of the assets exceeds their fair market value determined by either a quoted market price, if any, or a value determined by utilizing a discounted cash flow technique. Although we have recognized no material impairment adjustments related to our property, plant, and equipment during the past three fiscal years, except those made in conjunction with restructuring actions, deterioration in our business in the future could lead to such impairment adjustments in future periods. Evaluation of impairment of long-lived assets requires estimates of future operating results that are used in the preparation of the expected future undiscounted cash flows. Actual future operating results and the remaining economic lives of our long-lived assets could differ from the estimates used in assessing the recoverability of these assets. These differences could result in impairment charges, which could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations. In June 2001, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 142, or FAS 142, “Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets.” In the first quarter of fiscal 2003, we will adopt the new rules of FAS 142 for measuring the impairment of goodwill, which prescribe a fair value-based approach. The estimates and assumptions described above along with other factors such as discount rates will affect the amount of an impairment loss, if any, we recognize under FAS 142. Upon adoption of FAS 142, we will be required to make a transition test of our goodwill for impairment, which may result in a significant transition impairment loss. Any transition impairment loss will be recorded as a change in accounting principle. At least annually thereafter, we will be required to test goodwill for impairment, which may result in additional impairment losses that could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations. Accounting for Income Taxes We account for income taxes in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 109, or FAS 109, “Accounting for Income Taxes,” which requires that deferred tax assets and liabilities be recognized using enacted tax rates for the effect of temporary differences between the book and tax bases of recorded assets and liabilities. FAS 109 also requires that deferred tax assets be reduced by a valuation allowance if it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax asset will not be realized. We evaluate the realizability of our deferred tax assets quarterly by assessing our valuation allowance and by adjusting the amount of such allowance, if necessary. At November 2, 2002, we had deferred tax assets of $159 million primarily resulting from temporary differences between the book and tax bases of assets and liabilities. While these assets are not assured of realization, we have conducted an assessment of the likelihood of realization and concluded that no significant valuation allowance is required. In reaching our conclusion, we evaluated certain relevant criteria including the existence of deferred tax liabilities that can be used to absorb deferred tax assets, the taxable income in prior carryback years that can be used to absorb net operating losses and taxable income in future years. Our judgments regarding future profitability may change due to future market conditions, changes in U.S. or international tax laws and other factors. These changes, if any, may require material adjustments to these deferred tax assets, resulting in a reduction in net income or an increase in net loss in the period when such determinations are made. In addition, we have provided for potential liabilities due in various foreign jurisdictions. Judgment is required in determining our worldwide income tax expense provision. In the ordinary course of global business, there are many transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax outcome is uncertain. Some of these uncertainties arise as a consequence of cost reimbursement arrangements among related entities. Although we believe our estimates are reasonable, no assurance can be given that the final tax outcome of these matters will not be different than that which is reflected in our historical income tax provisions and accruals. Such differences could have a material impact on our income tax provision and operating results in the period in which such determination is made. 23 Table of Contents Contingencies From time to time, we receive notices that our products or manufacturing processes may be infringing the patent or intellectual property rights of others. We periodically assess each matter in order to determine if a contingent liability in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 5, or FAS 5, “Accounting for Contingencies,” should be recorded. In making this determination, we may, depending on the nature of the matter, consult with internal and external legal counsel and technical experts. Based on the information we obtain, combined with our judgment regarding all the facts and circumstances of each matter, we determine whether it is probable that a contingent loss may be incurred and whether the amount of such loss can be estimated. Should a loss be probable and estimable, we record a contingent loss in accordance with FAS 5. In determining the amount of a contingent loss, we consider advice received from experts in the specific matter, current status of legal proceedings, settlement negotiations that may be ongoing, prior case history and other factors. Should the judgments and estimates made by us be incorrect, we may need to record additional contingent losses that could materially adversely impact our results of operations. See Note 11 to our Consolidated Financial Statements contained in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Stock Options We have voluntarily provided the following disclosure in order to provide our stockholders with a single source for information about our stock options. We believe that this disclosure, combined with the disclosure provided in Note 12 to our Consolidated Financial Statements contained in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K and in our 2003 proxy statement, provides detailed information about our stock option programs. Option Program Description Our stock option program is a broad-based, long-term employee retention program that is intended to attract, retain and motivate our employees, officers and directors and to align their interests with those of our stockholders. We have two plans under which we currently grant stock options: 1) The 1998 Stock Option Plan, as amended, under which officers, directors and employees of Analog are granted options to purchase shares of our common stock; and 2) The 2001 Broad-Based Stock Option Plan, as amended, under which options to purchase shares of our common stock may be granted to all employees, consultants and advisors of Analog, other than officers or directors. Substantially all of our employees participate in these plans. Option vesting periods are generally five years for our grants and all options have a term of ten years. Our option plans do not permit us to grant options at exercise prices that are below the fair market value of our common stock as of the date of grant. These plans are critical to our efforts to create and maintain a competitive advantage in the extremely competitive semiconductor industry. Options are generally granted once per year between September and January as part of our annual performance appraisal process. Occasionally, as in fiscal year 2002, two sets of option grants can fall within one fiscal year, as the process spans the end of one fiscal year and the beginning of the next fiscal year. Conversely, as in fiscal year 1999, there are fiscal years in which no annual merit options are granted. We have a goal to keep the dilution related to our option program to a long-term average of approximately 4% annually. The dilution percentage is calculated as the total number of shares of our common stock underlying new option grants for the year, net of options forfeited by employees leaving the company, divided by total outstanding shares of our common stock. All stock option grants to executive officers and directors can be made only from stockholder approved plans and are made after a review by, and with the approval of the compensation committee of our board of directors. All members of the compensation committee are independent directors, as that term is defined in the applicable rules for issuers traded on the New York Stock Exchange.

Forward-Looking Statements This Annual Report on Form 10-K contains or incorporates forward-looking statements within the meaning of section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933 and section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. These forward-looking statements are based on current expectations, estimates, forecasts and projections about the industry and markets in which we operate and management’s beliefs and assumptions. In addition, other written or oral statements that constitute forward-looking statements may be made by or on our behalf. Words such as “expect,” “anticipate,” “intend,” “plan,” “believe,” “seek,” “estimate,” variations of such words and similar expressions are intended to identify such forward-looking statements. These statements are not guarantees of future performance and involve certain risks, uncertainties and assumptions that are difficult to predict. We have included important factors in the cautionary statements below under the heading “Factors That May Affect Future Results” that we believe could cause our actual results to differ materially from the forward-looking statements we make. We do not intend to update publicly any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise. 27 Table of Contents Factors That May Affect Future Results Our future operating results are difficult to predict and may materially fluctuate. Our future operating results are difficult to predict and may be materially affected by a number of factors, including the timing of new product announcements or introductions by us or our competitors, competitive pricing pressures, fluctuations in manufacturing yields, adequate availability of wafers and manufacturing capacity, the risk that our backlog could decline significantly, our ability to hire, retain and motivate adequate numbers of engineers and other qualified employees to meet the demands of our largest customers, changes in product mix, and the effect of adverse changes in economic conditions in the United States and international markets. In addition, the semiconductor market has historically been cyclical and subject to significant economic downturns at various times, including the decline in demand experienced since early in fiscal year 2001. Our business is subject to rapid technological changes and there can be no assurance, depending on the mix of future business, that products stocked in inventory will not be rendered obsolete before we ship them. As a result of these and other factors, there can be no assurance that we will not experience material fluctuations in future operating results on a quarterly or annual basis. Long-term contracts are not typical for us and reductions, cancellations or delays in orders for our products could adversely affect our operating results. In certain markets where end-user demand may be particularly volatile and difficult to predict, some customers place orders that require us to manufacture product and have it available for shipment, even though the customer is unwilling to make a binding commitment to purchase all, or even any, of the product. At any given time, this situation could affect a portion of our backlog. As a result, we are subject to the risk of cancellation of orders leading to a sharp fall-off of sales and backlog. Further, those orders may be for products that meet the customer’s unique requirements so that those cancelled orders would, in addition, result in an inventory of unsaleable products, resulting in potential inventory write-offs. As a result of lengthy manufacturing cycles for certain of the products subject to these uncertainties, the amount of unsaleable product could be substantial. Reductions, cancellations or delays in orders for our products could adversely affect our operating results. Our future success depends upon our ability to develop and market new products and enter new markets. Our success significantly depends on our continued ability to develop and market new products. There can be no assurance that we will be able to develop and introduce new products in a timely manner or that new products, if developed, will achieve market acceptance. In addition, our growth is dependent on our continued ability to penetrate new markets where we have limited experience and competition is intense. There can be no assurance that the markets we serve will grow in the future, that our existing and new products will meet the requirements of these markets, that our products will achieve customer acceptance in these markets, that competitors will not force prices to an unacceptably low level or take market share from us, or that we can achieve or maintain profits in these markets. Also, some of our customers in these markets are less established, which could subject us to increased credit risk. We may not be able to compete successfully in the semiconductor industry in the future. Many other companies offer products that compete with our products. Some also offer other electronic products, and some have greater financial, manufacturing, technical and marketing resources than we have. Additionally, some formerly independent competitors have been purchased by larger companies. Our competitors also include emerging companies selling specialized products to markets we serve. There can be no assurance that we will be able to compete successfully in the future against existing or new competitors, or that our operating results will not be adversely affected by increased price competition. 28 Table of Contents We may not be able to satisfy increasing demand for our products, and increased production may lead to overcapacity and lower prices. The cyclical nature of the semiconductor industry has resulted in sustained or short-term periods when demand for our products has increased or decreased rapidly. We, and the semiconductor industry, experienced a period of rapid decreases in demand that began early in fiscal 2001. As a result, we have overcapacity due to the expansion of our production facilities and increased access to third-party foundries. However, we cannot be sure that we will not encounter unanticipated production problems at either our own facilities or at third-party foundries, or that our capacity will be sufficient to satisfy demand for our products. We believe that other semiconductor manufacturers have expanded their production capacity over the past several years. This expansion by us and our competitors, and the continuation of the decline in the demand for semiconductor products that began early in fiscal 2001, has led to overcapacity in our target markets, which has resulted in a year-over-year decline in our revenue and could lead to price erosion that would adversely affect our operating results. We rely on third-party subcontractors and manufacturers for some industry-standard wafers and assembly/test services, and therefore cannot control their availability or conditions of supply. We rely, and plan to continue to rely, on assembly and test subcontractors and on third-party wafer fabricators to supply most of our wafers that can be manufactured using industry-standard digital processes. This reliance involves several risks, including reduced control over delivery schedules, manufacturing yields and costs. Additionally, we utilize third party wafer fabricators as sole-source suppliers, primarily Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company. These suppliers manufacture components in accordance with our proprietary designs and specifications. We have no written supply agreements with these sole-source suppliers and purchase our custom components through individual purchase orders. If these sole-source suppliers are unable or unwilling to manufacture and deliver sufficient quantities of components to us, on the time schedule and of the quality that we require, we may be forced to seek to engage additional or replacement suppliers, which could result in additional expenses and delays in product development or shipment of product to our customers. Our revenues may not increase enough to offset the expense of additional capacity. Our capacity additions in fiscal 2001 resulted in a significant increase in operating expenses. If revenue levels do not increase enough to offset these additional expense levels, our future operating results could be adversely affected. In addition, asset values could be impaired if the additional capacity is underutilized for an extended period of time. Should we be unsuccessful in completing this expansion on time, or should customer demand fail to increase and we no longer need the additional capacity, our financial position and results of operations could be adversely impacted. Our transition of products to more modern facilities and related inventory builds may not progress as planned. We are transitioning products from our older four-inch wafer fabrication facilities to our six-inch and eight-inch wafer fabrication facilities. We have built inventory in preparation for this transfer for both lifetime supply and transition inventory. We have recorded certain levels of reserves related to these inventory builds. Although we believe that we have used our best efforts and information to estimate future demand, due to the uncertain economic times and the difficulty inherent in predicting future results, it is possible that actual demand for our products will differ from our estimates. If we are unable to transition our products as planned or if actual demand for products included in our inventory builds is less than our estimates, our financial position and results of operations could be adversely impacted. Our manufacturing processes are highly technical and may be interrupted. We have both generic and proprietary manufacturing processes that utilize a substantial amount of technology as the fabrication of integrated circuits is a highly complex and precise process. Minute impurities, 29 Table of Contents contaminants in the manufacturing environment, difficulties in the fabrication process, defects in the masks used in the wafer manufacturing process, manufacturing equipment failures, wafer breakage or other factors can cause a substantial percentage of wafers to be rejected or numerous dice on each wafer to be nonfunctional. While we have significant expertise in semiconductor manufacturing, it is possible that some processes could become unstable. This instability could result in manufacturing delays and product shortages. We rely on manufacturing capacity located in geologically unstable areas, which could affect the availability of supplies and services. We, and many companies in the semiconductor industry, rely on internal manufacturing capacity located in California and Taiwan as well as wafer fabrication foundries in Taiwan and other sub-contractors in geologically unstable locations around the world. This reliance involves risks associated with the impact of earthquakes on us and the semiconductor industry, including temporary loss of capacity, availability and cost of key raw materials and equipment and availability of key services including transport. In addition, California has experienced intermittent interruption in the availability of electricity. To date, the impact on us has been negligible. However, electricity is a critical resource for us, without which our products could not be manufactured at factories exposed to continued lengthy power interruptions. Any prolonged inability to utilize one of our manufacturing facilities as a result of fire, natural disaster, unavailability of electric power or otherwise, would have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition. We are exposed to economic, political and other risks through our significant worldwide operations. During fiscal 2002, approximately 70% of our revenues were derived from customers in international markets. We have manufacturing facilities outside the United States in Ireland, the United Kingdom, the Philippines and Taiwan. In addition to being exposed to the ongoing economic cycles in the semiconductor industry, we are also subject to the economic and political risks inherent in international operations and their impact on the United States economy in general, including the risks associated with ongoing uncertainties and political and economic instability in many countries around the world as well as the economic disruption from acts of terrorism, particularly in the aftermath of the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001 and the response to them by the United States and its allies. These risks include air transportation disruptions, expropriation, currency controls and changes in currency exchange rates, tax and tariff rates, freight rates and social and political unrest. Although we engage in hedging transactions to reduce our exposure to currency exchange rate fluctuations, there can be no assurance that our competitive position will not be adversely affected by changes in the exchange rate of the United States dollar against other currencies. We are involved in frequent litigation regarding intellectual property rights, which could be costly to defend and could require us to redesign products or pay significant royalties. There can be no assurance that any patent will issue on pending applications or that any patent issued will provide substantive protection for the technology or product covered by it. We believe that patent and mask set protection is of less significance in our business than experience, innovation, and management skill. There also can be no assurance that others will not develop or patent similar technology, or reverse engineer our products, or that our confidentiality agreements with employees, consultants, silicon foundries and other suppliers and vendors will be adequate to protect our interests. The semiconductor industry is characterized by frequent claims and litigation involving patent and other intellectual property rights, including claims arising under our contractual indemnification of our customers. We have received from time to time, and may receive in the future, claims from third parties asserting that our products or processes infringe their patents or other intellectual property rights. In the event a third party makes a valid intellectual property claim against us and a license is not available to us on commercially reasonable terms, or at all, we could be forced either to redesign or to stop production of products incorporating that intellectual property, and our operating results could be materially and adversely affected. Litigation may be necessary to enforce our patents or other of our intellectual property rights or to defend us against claims of infringement, and this litigation could be costly and divert the attention of our key personnel. See Note 11 in the Notes to our Consolidated Financial Statements contained in Item 8 of this Annual Report 30 Table of Contents on Form 10-K for information concerning pending litigation that involves us. An adverse outcome in this or other litigation could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position or on our consolidated results of operations or cash flows in the period in which the litigation is resolved. We may be unable to adequately protect our proprietary rights, which may limit our ability to compete effectively. We rely primarily upon know-how, rather than on patents, to develop and maintain our competitive position. There can be no assurance that others will not develop or patent similar technology or reverse engineer our products or that the confidentiality agreements upon which we rely will be adequate to protect our interests. Other companies have obtained patents covering a variety of semiconductor designs and processes, and we might be required to obtain licenses under some of these patents or be precluded from making and selling the infringing products, if such patents are found to be valid. There can be no assurance that we would be able to obtain licenses, if required, upon commercially reasonable terms, or at all. Moreover, the laws of foreign countries in which we design, manufacture and market our products may afford little or no effective protection of our proprietary technology. Leverage and debt service obligations may adversely affect our cash flow. During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2000, we issued $1,200,000,000 of 4.75% convertible subordinated notes due 2005 and, as a result, we have a substantial amount of outstanding indebtedness. We may be unable to generate cash sufficient to pay the principal of, interest on, and other amounts due in respect of, this indebtedness when due. Our substantial leverage could have significant negative consequences. This substantial leverage could increase our vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions. It may require the dedication of a substantial portion of our expected cash flow from operations to service the indebtedness, thereby reducing the amount of our expected cash flow available for other purposes, including capital expenditures. It may also limit our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and the industry in which we operate. If we do not retain our key personnel, our ability to execute our business strategy will be limited. Our success depends to a significant extent upon the continued service of our executive officers and key management and technical personnel, particularly our experienced engineers, and on our ability to continue to attract, retain, and motivate qualified personnel. The competition for these employees is intense. The loss of the services of one or more of our key personnel could have a material adverse effect on our operating results. In addition, there could be a material adverse effect on us should the turnover rates for engineers and other key personnel increase significantly or if we are unable to continue to attract qualified personnel. We do not maintain any key person life insurance policy on any of our officers or employees. Our future operating results are dependent on the performance of independent distributors and sales representatives. A significant portion of our sales are through independent distributors that are not under our control. These independent distributors generally represent product lines offered by several companies and thus could reduce their sales efforts applied to our products or terminate their representation of us. We generally do not require letters of credit from our distributors and are not protected against accounts receivable default or bankruptcy by these distributors. Our inability to collect open accounts receivable could adversely affect our results of operations. Termination of a significant distributor, whether at our initiative or the distributor’s initiative, could disrupt our current business. If we are unable to find suitable replacements in the event of terminations by significant distributors or sales representatives, our operating results could be adversely affected. 31 Table of Contents ITEM 7A. QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK Interest Rate Exposure In January 2002, we entered into an interest rate swap agreement to hedge the benchmark interest rate of our $1,200 million convertible subordinated notes. The effect of the swap was to convert our 4.75% fixed rate to a variable rate, currently based on the 3-month London Interbank Offered Rate, or LIBOR. If LIBOR increases or decreases by 100 basis points, our annual interest expense would change by $12 million for fiscal 2002. Changes in interest rates would affect the fair value of the interest rate swap and the fair value of the debt obligation. For each basis point change in the swap curve, the fair value in fiscal 2002 would change by approximately $0.3 million. The fair value of the swap, and therefore the related debt obligation, would also be affected by the price and volatility of our common stock. Our annual interest income would change by approximately $28 million for each 100 basis point increase or decrease in interest rates. Therefore, the effect to our interest income, net of interest expense, would be approximately $16 million in fiscal year 2002 and $24 million in fiscal 2001. The fair values of our investment portfolio at November 2, 2002 and November 3, 2001 would not be significantly impacted by either an increase or decrease in interest rates primarily due to the short-term nature of the major portion of our investment portfolio. Foreign Currency Exposure As more fully described in Note 2 (i) in the Notes to our Consolidated Financial Statements contained in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, we regularly hedge our non-U.S. dollar-based exposures by entering into forward exchange contracts. The terms of these contracts are for periods matching the duration of the underlying exposure and generally range from three months to one year. The short-term nature of these contracts has resulted in these instruments having insignificant fair values at November 2, 2002 and November 3, 2001. Currently, our largest foreign currency exposure is against the Euro, primarily because Europe has a higher proportion of our local currency denominated expenses. Relative to foreign currency exposures existing at November 2, 2002 and November 3, 2001, a 10% unfavorable movement in foreign currency exchange rates would not expose us to significant losses in earnings or cash flows or significantly diminish the fair value of our foreign currency financial instruments, primarily due to the short lives of the affected financial instruments that effectively hedge substantially all of our year-end exposures against fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. The calculation assumes that each exchange rate would change in the same direction relative to the U.S. dollar. In addition to the direct effects of changes in exchange rates, such changes typically affect the volume of sales or the foreign currency sales price as competitors’ products become more or less attractive. Our sensitivity analysis of the effects of changes in foreign currency exchange rates does not factor in a potential change in sales levels or local currency selling prices. 32 Table of Contents",2023-12-30 19:09:07.212450
6281,ADI,ANALOG DEVICES INC,2003,"ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Results of Operations Fiscal Year 2003 Overview Overall, fiscal 2003 was a better year for Analog Devices than we had anticipated at the beginning of the year. We recorded net sales of $2,047 million in fiscal 2003, which was a 20% increase over the amount recorded in fiscal 2002. Fiscal 2002 was the low point in the current cycle in the industry when revenues were down 25% from the levels recorded in fiscal 2001. However, the gradual recovery, which started for us in the second quarter of fiscal 2002, continued throughout fiscal 2003. Our gross margins improved to 54.9% in fiscal 2003 from 53% in fiscal 2002 and diluted earnings per share improved to $0.78 per share in fiscal 2003 from $0.28 per share in fiscal 2002. We generated $433 million in operating cash during the year and finished the year with $2,117 million of cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments after redeeming all of our $1,200 million outstanding debt. Fiscal 2003 Results of Operations Compared to Fiscal 2002 Sales Net sales were $2,047 million in fiscal 2003, an increase of 20% from net sales of $1,708 million in fiscal 2002. The increase in net sales in fiscal 2003 was attributable to increased demand for analog and DSP products used in wireless handsets, in desktop and laptop computers and for analog products used in consumer applications such as digital cameras and flat panel displays. Sales of analog and DSP products used in wireless infrastructure and broadband access grew slightly in fiscal 2003 and sales of broadband infrastructure applications decreased in fiscal 2003 from the levels recorded in the prior year. We experienced a slow steady improvement in demand for products used in industrial applications during fiscal 2003, particularly analog products used in automotive and automatic test equipment. In general, demand during fiscal 2003 was strongest for products that are used by consumers while demand for products used in applications that depend on industrial, enterprise or carrier capital spending were flat. During fiscal 2003 analog product sales increased 16% from the levels recorded in fiscal 2002. DSP product sales increased by 35% from the prior year during fiscal 2003. In fiscal 2003, approximately 78% of our net sales were from analog products, down from 80% in the prior year. DSP product sales represented the remaining 22% and 20% respectively, of our net sales in fiscal 2003 and fiscal 2002. Sales of new products, which we define as sales of products introduced in the prior six quarters, were 19% of net sales in fiscal 2003 as compared to 21% in fiscal 2002. The year-over-year dollar increase in sales of new products was 8% in fiscal 2003 and was attributable to design wins for some of our communications, consumer and computer products. This increase followed declines of 17% and 33% respectively, in fiscal 2002 and fiscal 2001 as we went through the down-turn of the current cycle in the semiconductor industry. The percentage of sales by geographic region, based upon point of sale, for the last two years is as follows: Region Fiscal 2003 Fiscal 2002 North America 26 % 30 % Europe 19 % 21 % Japan 18 % 17 % Southeast Asia 37 % 32 % The fiscal 2003 decrease in North American sales and the increase in Southeast Asia sales as a percentage of total net sales were principally attributable to the ongoing transfer of customer manufacturing activity to Asia. Sales in dollars increased in fiscal 2003 by 38% and 29% in Southeast Asia and Japan, respectively, as a result of increased demand for products used in communications, consumer and computer applications as well as the ongoing transfer of manufacturing activity to locations primarily in Asia. Sales in dollars in fiscal 2003 increased by 12% in Europe as a result of the steady improvement in demand for our 15 Table of Contents products during the year. The slight increase in North America sales in dollars was attributable to increased regional demand for our products that was largely offset by the transfer of customer manufacturing activity to locations in Asia. Gross Margin Gross margin improved in fiscal 2003 to $1,124 million, or 54.9% of net sales, up 190 basis points from fiscal 2002 gross margin of $905 million, or 53% of net sales. This improvement was primarily the result of spreading fixed manufacturing costs over an increasing sales level each quarter and, to a lesser extent, the impact of restructuring actions we took over the last two years and continued cost constraints at our manufacturing operations. Research and Development Research and development, or R&D, expenses amounted to $450 million in fiscal 2003, an increase of $26 million or 6% from the $424 million recorded in fiscal 2002. R&D expenses declined as a percentage of net sales to 22% in fiscal 2003 from 24.8% in fiscal 2002 as a result of the 20% year-to-year increase in revenue and only a 6% year-to-year increase in R&D expenses. The year-to-year increase in R&D expenses was limited to 6% as a result of acquisition-related expenses declining year-to-year by $5.6 million and the company limiting discretionary expenses including salary increases for higher paid employees and curtailing hiring to strategically important new hires and college hires. The reduction in acquisition-related expenses to $8.2 million in fiscal 2003 from $13.8 million in fiscal 2002 arose primarily because fiscal 2002 costs included expense related to fixed-value contingent compensation and the achievement of final performance-based criteria that did not recur in fiscal 2003. R&D expense as a percentage of net sales will fluctuate from year-to-year depending on the amount of net sales and the success of new product development efforts, which we view as critical for future growth. At any point in time we have hundreds of R&D projects underway, and we believe that none of these projects is material on an individual basis. We expect to continue the development of innovative technologies and processes for new products and we believe that a continued commitment to R&D is essential in order to maintain product leadership with our existing products and to provide innovative new product offerings, and therefore, we expect to continue to make significant R&D investments in the future. Selling, Marketing, General and Administrative Selling, marketing, general and administrative, or SMG&A, expenses were $288 million in fiscal 2003, an increase of $31 million, or 12%, from the $257 million recorded in fiscal 2002. As a percentage of net sales, SMG&A declined to 14% for fiscal 2003 from 15% in fiscal 2002 primarily due to the increase in net sales. The increase in SMG&A expenses in dollars was primarily the result of increased commission expenses paid due to the 20% year-to-year increase in net sales, the decision to add additional field application engineers to assist customers and potential customers design products that incorporate ADI technology to address their specific requirements, as well as initiatives to publicize new products. These increases were offset by limiting discretionary expenses including salary increases for higher paid employees. Amortization of Intangibles Amortization of intangibles was $3 million for fiscal 2003 compared with $57 million for fiscal 2002. The decrease in amortization expense was the result of our fiscal 2003 adoption of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 142, “Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets.” Special Charges During fiscal 2003, we recorded special charges of $9.5 million, and during fiscal 2002 we recorded special charges totaling $48.5 million. Special charges recorded over the last three fiscal years are more fully described under the heading “Special Charges” below. 16 Table of Contents Operating Income Our operating income was $374 million, or 18.3% of net sales, in fiscal 2003, compared to $118 million, or 6.9% of net sales, in fiscal 2002. Nonoperating Income and Expense Interest expense was $32 million in fiscal 2003 compared to $44 million in fiscal 2002. Fiscal 2002 includes interest expense for 12 months and fiscal 2003 includes interest expense for only 11 months because we redeemed our 4.75% Convertible Subordinated Notes, or notes, on October 1, 2003. In addition, an interest rate swap agreement we entered into in January 2002 had the effect of swapping the 4.75% fixed rate of our notes into a LIBOR-based floating rate which was 1.61% as of November 6, 2002 and was 1.14% at the time we redeemed our notes on October 1, 2003. These two items resulted in the year-to-year decline in interest expense. Interest income was $41 million in fiscal 2003 compared to $65 million in fiscal 2002. The year-to-year decrease in interest income was attributable to less income earned on our invested cash balances due to the decline in interest rates during fiscal 2003 as a result of actions taken by the Federal Reserve Board and our decision to increase our holdings of higher credit quality yet lower interest-bearing investments. Provision for Income Taxes Our effective income tax rate decreased to 22% for fiscal 2003 as compared to 25% for fiscal 2002. The decrease was primarily the result of the discontinuance of goodwill amortization in the first quarter of fiscal 2003 as a result of our adoption of Financial Accounting Standards Board Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 142, “Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets.” Goodwill was treated as a permanent difference in prior years’ tax provisions which had the effect of increasing our effective income tax rate. Net Income Fiscal 2003 net income was $298 million, or 14.6% of net sales, and diluted earnings per share was $0.78 compared to net income in fiscal 2002 of $105 million, or 6.2% of net sales, and diluted earnings per share of $0.28. The fiscal 2003 increase in net income from fiscal 2002 was primarily due to increased revenue levels and, to a lesser extent, the cessation of goodwill amortization and reduced expenses related to special charges. The impact of inflation on our business during the past three fiscal years has not been significant. Related Party Transactions One of our directors, who has been a director since 1988, became a director of Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company, or TSMC, in fiscal 2002. We purchased approximately $232 million and $206 million of products from TSMC in fiscal 2003 and 2002, respectively. We believe that the terms and prices for the purchases of these products are at terms no less favorable than those obtained from unaffiliated parties. Approximately $14 million and $19 million was payable to TSMC as of November 1, 2003 and November 2, 2002, respectively. We anticipate that we will make similar purchases from TSMC in fiscal year 2004. Liquidity and Capital Resources Fiscal 2003 net cash flow provided by operations was $433 million, or 21% of net sales, an increase of $207 million over the prior year. The year-over-year increase was primarily due to an increase in net income of $193 million. In addition, we received $71 million in proceeds from our various employee stock programs. These cash inflows were offset by a net payment of $1,198 million related to the redemption of all of our outstanding notes together with the associated redemption premium and the termination of the related interest rate swap and loan agreement and capital expenditures of $68 million. Cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments decreased $781 million during fiscal 2003 to $2,117 million at November 1, 2003 from $2,898 million at November 2, 2002 primarily as a result of these activities. Accounts receivable of $295 million at the end of fiscal 2003 increased $67 million, or 29%, from $228 million at the end of fiscal 2002. This increase resulted principally from a $102 million increase in net 17 Table of Contents sales during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2003 as compared to the fourth quarter of fiscal 2002. Days sales outstanding increased from 46 days at the end of the fourth quarter of fiscal 2002 to 48 days at the end of the fourth quarter of fiscal 2003. The year-to-year increase in days sales outstanding was due to a higher level of sales in the latter part of the fourth quarter of fiscal 2003 as compared to the fourth quarter of fiscal 2002. Inventories declined by $19 million, or 6%, from the end of fiscal 2002 to $288 million at the end of fiscal 2003. Days cost of sales in inventory declined by 29 days to 106 days as of the end of the fourth quarter of fiscal 2003. The decrease in inventory in dollars was attributable to tight control of inventory levels as well as increasing demand for our products as the year progressed. In response to the slowdown in our served markets in fiscal 2001 and 2002, we have substantially reduced our capital spending in the last two years. Net additions to property, plant and equipment were $68 million in fiscal 2003 and $57 million in fiscal 2002, which represented approximately 3% of net sales for each of those years. Fiscal 2004 capital expenditures are expected to return to historical levels of 5% of annual net sales, or approximately $130 million. In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2003, we redeemed for cash all of our outstanding notes. The redemption price was 101.90% of the principal amount of the notes, or $1,223 million. A net pre-tax loss of $0.2 million was recognized in other expense as a result of the redemption, comprised of a $10.8 million gain on the redemption of the notes which was offset by a write-off of $11 million of deferred financing costs. The gain on the redemption of the notes was due to the carrying value of the notes being greater than the redemption value as a result of the mark-to-market of the interest rate component of the notes to fair value. As a result, apart from operating lease obligations, we had no debt at the end of fiscal year 2003. On November 17, 2003, our Board of Directors declared a cash dividend of $0.04 per outstanding share of common stock. The dividend was paid on December 17, 2003 and was approximately $15 million. The payment of future dividends will be based on our quarterly financial performance. The table below summarizes our contractual obligations as of November 1, 2003: Payment due by period (thousands) Total Less than 1 Year 1-3 Years 3-5 Years More than 5 Years Contractual obligations: Operating leases $ 51,448 $ 15,322 $ 22,809 $ 8,953 $ 4,364 At November 1, 2003, our principal source of liquidity was $2,117 million of cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments. We believe that our existing sources of liquidity and cash expected to be generated from future operations, together with anticipated available long-term financing, will be sufficient to fund operations, capital expenditures and research and development efforts for at least the next twelve months and thereafter for the foreseeable future. Outlook Analog Devices is in a strong financial position entering fiscal 2004. We are planning for annual revenue growth of approximately 25%, with gross margins continuing to improve through the year. Similar to fiscal 2003, we anticipate that our operating expenses will grow at a rate well below our revenue growth rate. Our goal remains to increase our earnings at a rate that is twice the growth rate of our sales until we reach our model operating results. We currently plan to make capital expenditures of approximately $130 million in fiscal 2004. Depreciation expense is expected to decrease to $155 million in fiscal 2004 from $166 million in fiscal 2003. We anticipate that our effective tax rate will remain relatively flat year-to-year at approximately 22%. As a result of increased demand for our products during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2003, we are planning for revenues to increase 5% from the fourth quarter of fiscal 2003 to the first quarter of fiscal 2004 and for diluted earnings per share to be in the range of $0.27 to $0.28 in the first quarter of fiscal 2004. 18 Table of Contents Fiscal 2002 Results of Operations Compared to Fiscal 2001 Fiscal 2002 was a challenging year for Analog Devices. The decrease in net sales from fiscal 2001 to fiscal 2002 was due to the declining demand in several markets that we serve, particularly the communications market, as well as an overall decline in the general economy. Quarterly sales reached $806 million in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2000 but declined rapidly throughout fiscal 2001 and reached the lowest point in this cycle in the first quarter of fiscal 2002, for which quarter we recorded sales of $393 million. In the last three quarters of fiscal 2002, we experienced a steady sequential improvement in demand and sales reached $456 million in the fourth quarter. During this downturn, we maintained gross margins at 53% in fiscal 2002 and, as a result of decisive cost containment measures we undertook, we reduced operating expenses year-to-year by 9%. Cash flow remained strong with cash increasing by over $100 million during fiscal 2002 to $2,900 million after we purchased $100 million of our common stock. Profit and loss account year-to-year changes are summarized as follows: • Net sales were $1,708 million, down 25% from $2,277 million in fiscal 2001 as a result of the cyclical downturn in the semiconductor market. The percentage of sales by geographic region, based upon point of sale, for fiscal years 2002 and 2001 is set out below. The decline in North American sales and increase in Southeast Asia sales as a percentage of total sales was primarily due to a decline in the communications market in fiscal 2002 combined with the transfer of customer manufacturing activity to other locations, primarily in Asia. Region Fiscal 2002 Fiscal 2001 North America 30 % 39 % Europe 21 % 24 % Japan 17 % 15 % Southeast Asia 32 % 22 % • Cost of sales was $803 million in fiscal 2002, down from $1,008 million in fiscal 2001. In the second quarter of fiscal 2002, we announced that we would transition products from our older four-inch wafer fabrication facilities to our six-inch and eight-inch wafer fabrication facilities that were then operating well below capacity. As a result, the remaining service lives of certain assets within our wafer fabrication facilities were shortened. Depreciation expense included in cost of sales included additional depreciation of approximately $8.7 million in fiscal 2002 associated with the shortened lives of some equipment in our older four-inch wafer fabrication facilities. • Gross margin in fiscal 2002 was $905 million, or 53% of net sales, down from $1,269 million, or 55.7% of net sales, in the prior year. The reduction was primarily due to the year-to-year decrease in revenue and lower utilization of our internal manufacturing facilities. • R&D expenses declined from $465 million in fiscal 2001 to $424 million in fiscal 2002. The decline was primarily the result of the elimination of bonuses and the temporary reduction of salaries for our more highly compensated employees partially offset by an increase in acquisition-related expenses and selective hiring of engineers. R&D expenses increased from 20.4% of net sales in fiscal 2001 to 24.8% of net sales in fiscal 2002 primarily as a result of the 25% decline in sales year-to-year. • SMG&A expenses declined by $30 million to $257 million in fiscal 2002, from the $287 million recorded in fiscal 2001. The decline year-to-year was due to the elimination of bonuses, the temporary reduction in salaries for our highly compensated employees and tight control over all discretionary expenses. These reductions were offset by our decision to increase our field applications engineers in order to help our customers design in our newest products. SMG&A expenses increased from 12.6% of net sales in fiscal 2001 to 15% of net sales in fiscal 2002 primarily as a result of the reduced sales levels. • Amortization of intangibles was $57 million in fiscal 2002, up from $53 million recorded in fiscal 2001. The increase in amortization expense in fiscal 2002 was primarily due to amortization of goodwill for the full 19 Table of Contents year associated with acquisitions completed in fiscal 2001 where amortization commenced during fiscal 2001. • Special charges recorded in fiscal 2002 and 2001 were $48 million and $47 million, respectively. Special charges recorded over the last three fiscal years are more fully described under the heading “Special Charges” below. • Operating income was $118 million, or 6.9% of net sales, in fiscal 2002, compared to $408 million, or 17.9% of net sales, in fiscal 2001. • Nonoperating Income and Expense • Interest expense was $44 million and $62 million in fiscal 2002 and 2001, respectively. The decrease year-to-year was the result of an interest rate swap agreement entered into in January 2002 that had the effect of swapping the 4.75% fixed rate of our $1,200 million convertible subordinated notes into a LIBOR-based floating rate (1.61% as of November 6, 2002). • Interest income declined from $133 million in fiscal 2001 to $65 million in fiscal 2002 as a result of less income earned on our invested cash balances due to a decline in interest rates during fiscal 2002. • Other income declined approximately $28 million from fiscal 2001 to fiscal 2002 due to a one-time gain on the sale of an investment in WaferTech recorded in the first quarter of fiscal 2001. • Our effective income tax rate decreased from 29.7% for fiscal 2001 to 25% for fiscal 2002 as a result of a shift in the mix of worldwide profits. • Net income decreased to $105 million, or 6.2% of net sales, in fiscal 2002 from $356 million, or 15.7% of net sales, in fiscal 2001. This decrease in net income was primarily due to reduced revenue levels. Liquidity and Capital Resource changes year-to-year are summarized as follows: • Cash, cash equivalents and short term investments amounted to $2,898 million at November 2, 2002, up $105 million from $2,793 million at November 3, 2001. The increase of $105 million was the result of operating cash inflows of $226 million (13% of fiscal 2002 net sales) and $37 million of proceeds from employee stock plans, offset by a $98 million repurchase of shares of our common stock and $57 million of capital expenditures. • Accounts receivable increased by $10 million to $228 million from $218 million at the end of fiscal 2001, as a result of a $32 million increase in fourth quarter sales year-to-year. Days sales outstanding remained flat at 46 days for both fiscal year end 2001 and 2002. • Inventory increased by $60 million, or 24%, to $306 million at the end of fiscal 2002. The inventory increase was primarily the result of a build in die bank inventory in preparation for the transfer of production from our four-inch wafer fabrication facilities to our six- and eight-inch wafer fabrication facilities and the purchase of external wafers in support of expected demand in our handset and consumer analog business. • We acquired five companies during fiscal 2001, as more fully described below under the heading “Acquisitions.” Total cash used to purchase these companies was approximately $38.5 million in 2001 and another $5.2 million was paid in fiscal 2002 as certain operational objectives were achieved, and these additional payments were accounted for as additional goodwill. • Net additions to property, plant and equipment were $57 million in fiscal 2002, down from $297 million in fiscal 2001. The sharp year-to-year reduction in capital spending was in response to the cyclical downturn in the semiconductor industry worldwide. Special Charges Special Charges — Fiscal 2003 During the third quarter of fiscal 2003, we recorded a special charge of $0.3 million. The charge included a $2.0 million write-down of equipment to fair value due to a decision to outsource the assembly of products in 20 Table of Contents plastic packages, which had been done internally at our facility in the Philippines. This amount was the net book value of the assets used in plastic assembly, net of proceeds received from the sale in the third quarter of a portion of the assets. We also decided to abandon efforts to develop a particular expertise in optical communications that resulted in the write-down of $2.7 million of equipment to fair value. During the quarter ended August 2, 2003, we determined that the costs remaining to be paid for certain restructuring charges would be less than the amount originally recorded. Accordingly, we recorded a change in estimate reducing the restructuring accruals by $4.4 million related to prior restructuring charges as more fully described below. During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2003, we recorded a special charge of $9.2 million as a result of a decision to close a small manufacturing facility in Belfast, Northern Ireland that supplied foundry substrate services for optical applications. The charge included $2 million of severance costs for approximately 57 manufacturing employees and 14 engineering and administrative employees, none of whom had been terminated as of November 1, 2003. The charge also included $6 million related to the write-down of property, plant and equipment to fair value and $1.2 million related to the write-down of various other assets to fair values. The closure is anticipated to be completed during the first half of fiscal 2004. We anticipate annual savings from the above actions of approximately $7 million, of which half is in cost of sales and half is in operating expenses. Of the $9.5 million of special charges recorded in fiscal 2003, $2 million related to separation costs remained accrued as of November 1, 2003. All remaining severance will be paid in the first half of fiscal 2004. Special Charges — Fiscal 2002 During the second quarter of fiscal 2002, we recorded special charges of approximately $27.2 million. The second quarter charge was comprised of $25.7 million related to the planned transfer of production from our three older four-inch wafer fabrication facilities to our three six-inch and one eight-inch wafer fabrication facilities, and $3 million primarily related to the impairment of an investment, which was partially offset by an adjustment of $1.5 million related to equipment cancelation fees recorded in fiscal year 2001. The investment impairment, which was related to an equity investment in a private company, was due to our decision to abandon the product strategy for which the investment was made. Included in the $25.7 million special charge were severance and fringe benefit costs of $15.3 million for 509 manufacturing employees in the United States and Ireland, $2.3 million related to the write-down of equipment to be abandoned and $8.1 million of other charges, primarily related to lease termination and cleanup costs. The write-down of equipment was principally due to a decision to discontinue various product development strategies. In the third quarter of fiscal 2003, we reversed $2.9 million of the accrual primarily due to lower than previously expected severance costs. The lower severance costs were the result of a reduction in the number of separated employees and, to a lesser extent, the average tenure of separated employees differing from estimates. The 509 employees projected to be terminated at the time of the original charge was adjusted down to 439, and as of November 1, 2003, 397 employees had been terminated. The reduction in the number of employees to be terminated was due to the transfer of employees, which primarily occurred in the third quarter of fiscal 2003, to positions in our six-inch wafer fabrication facilities where we experienced an unexpected increase in demand for our products. The process of ceasing production in the four-inch wafer fabrication facilities is complete. The equipment disposition and clean-up activity is underway at each site and the related clean-up costs, which were included in the special charge, will be expended as this activity is completed. The remaining clean-up will be substantially complete by the end of the second quarter of fiscal 2004. Since severance costs are paid as income continuance at some locations, these amounts will be expended over time subsequent to the final termination of employment. We anticipate annual savings from the above actions of approximately $60 million, primarily in cost of sales, and the first full year’s impact will be fiscal 2004. In addition to the above special charges, the remaining service lives of certain assets within the older four-inch wafer fabrication facilities were shortened. As a result, cost of sales for the fiscal year 2002 included additional depreciation of approximately $8.7 million associated with the shortened lives. During the third quarter of fiscal 2002, we recorded special charges of approximately $12.8 million. The charges included severance and fringe benefit costs of $3.7 million related to cost reduction actions taken in 21 Table of Contents several product groups and, to a lesser extent, in manufacturing, $3.8 million related to the impairment of an investment, $3.4 million related to the impairment of goodwill associated with the closing of an Austrian design center acquired in fiscal 2001 and $1.9 million primarily related to the abandonment of equipment and lease cancelation fees. The investment impairment, which was related to an equity investment in a private company, was due to our decision to abandon the product strategy for which the investment was made. The severance and fringe benefit costs were for approximately 70 engineering employees in the United States, Europe and Canada, and approximately 30 manufacturing employees in the United States. All of the manufacturing employees and substantially all of the engineering employees had been terminated as of November 1, 2003. The workforce reductions are anticipated to result in annual savings of approximately $10 million, primarily in operating expenses. During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2002, we recorded special charges of approximately $8.4 million. The charges included severance and fringe benefit costs of $2.5 million related to cost reduction actions taken in the sales group, several product groups and our manufacturing test operations for approximately 65 employees in the United States and Europe, all of which had been terminated as of November 1, 2003. The charges also included $2.1 million related to the impairment of investments, $1.8 million primarily related to the abandonment of equipment and lease cancelation fees and a change in estimate of $2.0 million for additional estimated clean-up costs originally recorded in the second quarter of fiscal 2002. The investment impairment charges were related to the decline in fair value of a publicly traded equity investment to less than its cost basis that was determined to be other-than-temporary, and to an equity investment in a private company. The private company equity investment was part of a product strategy that we decided to abandon. The workforce reductions are anticipated to result in annual savings of approximately $4 million, primarily in operating expenses. Of the $48.5 million of special charges recorded in fiscal 2002, $3.2 million primarily related to clean-up costs and $4.7 million related to separation costs, primarily being paid as income continuance, remained accrued as of November 1, 2003. Special Charges — Fiscal 2001 During fiscal 2001, we recorded special charges of approximately $47 million related to cost reduction actions taken in response to the economic climate at that time. The actions consisted of workforce reductions in manufacturing and, to a lesser extent, in selling, marketing and administrative areas as well as a decision to consolidate worldwide manufacturing operations and rationalize production planning and quality activities. The cost reductions included severance and fringe benefit costs of $29.6 million for approximately 1,200 employees in the U.S., Europe, Asia and the Philippines, substantially all of which had been terminated as of November 1, 2003. The special charges also included $11.6 million related to the abandonment of equipment resulting from the consolidation of worldwide manufacturing operations and $5.8 million of other charges primarily related to equipment and lease cancelation fees. Based on the results of negotiations with vendors regarding purchase order cancelation fees, the amount paid was $1.5 million less than the amount recorded for such charges and, accordingly, we adjusted the provision for purchase order cancelation fees by $1.5 million in the second quarter of fiscal 2002 to reflect this change in estimate. In the third quarter of fiscal 2003, we determined that the severance costs remaining to be paid would be $1.3 million less than the amount originally recorded for these charges and also determined that $0.2 million originally reserved for the termination of two leases would not be required. Therefore, we adjusted the provision for these severance and other costs in the third quarter of fiscal 2003 to reflect this change in estimate. The impact in fiscal 2002 of these cost savings was approximately $30 million, consisting of a $20 million reduction in cost of sales and a $10 million reduction in operating expenses. Of the $47.0 million of special charges recorded in fiscal 2001, $1.4 million remained accrued as of November 1, 2003, and primarily represents severance payments being paid as income continuance to certain of the 1,200 terminated employees, predominantly in the U.S., substantially all of which will be paid by the end of fiscal 2004. 22 Table of Contents Acquisitions During the first quarter of fiscal 2001, we completed the following acquisitions: • In the first quarter of fiscal 2001, we completed the acquisitions of Thomas Neuroth AG, Signal Processing Associates Pty. Ltd. and Integrated Micro Instruments, Inc. The total amount paid for these acquisitions, as of November 1, 2003, was $10.2 million. As of November 1, 2003, the remaining contingent consideration was $1.1 million. In order to be entitled to receive the contingent consideration, the former shareholders of Integrated Micro Instruments, Inc., who are employed by Analog, must continue to be employed by Analog. As such, the contingent consideration will be recorded as compensation expense. • On January 4, 2001, we acquired ChipLogic, Inc. of Santa Clara, California. ChipLogic is a developer of high-performance integrated circuits and software focused on the convergence of voice, broadband access and network protocol processing. The total purchase price of $68.3 million consisted of cash of approximately $4 million, approximately 1 million shares of our common stock valued at $60.2 million and the assumption of $4.1 million of outstanding ChipLogic vested stock options. The fair value of our common stock issued was determined based on the average market price of our common stock for the seven-day period, including three days before and after the date the acquisition was announced and the terms of the acquisition were agreed upon. Approximately $9.5 million represented the purchase price of in-process technology and was charged to operations during fiscal 2001 because the software project had not yet reached technological feasibility and had no alternative future use. The in-process technology related to software developed to handle voice processing, signaling, packet management and routing, quality of service and networking interface functions. This software is embedded in a network processor that provides for a wide area to local area network bridge. The fair value of the in-process technology was determined by a third party using the income forecast method, which is a discounted net cash flow approach. At the time of the acquisition, the in-process technology was approximately 40% complete. The in-process technology was completed in the second quarter of fiscal 2002. Expenditures to complete the in-process technology totaled $14 million, representing primarily personnel costs. An additional $8 million of cash consideration and 489,375 shares of common stock were due and payable in the event that the former shareholders and key employees remain employed at Analog and upon the achievement of certain operational objectives. Of these shares, 249,375 shares have been issued to the former shareholders and have a fixed value of $13 million. This amount is being charged ratably to operations over a five-year period based on continuing employment. Accordingly, the issuance of these shares is compensatory and is treated as compensation expense over the service period. The remaining 240,000 shares were subject to operational performance-based criteria and were only issuable to those former shareholders and key employees who remained employed at Analog at the time the operational milestones were met. Accordingly, the issuance of these shares was compensatory and was recorded as compensation expense when the achievement of each defined contractual milestone became probable. As of November 2, 2002, all of the operational milestones had been met and approximately $5.0 million and $4.2 million of expense was recorded related to the issuance of the shares in fiscal 2002 and 2001, respectively. As of November 1, 2003, there was approximately $4.9 million of contingent consideration remaining to be paid. An additional $2.8 million of compensation expense is being recorded annually through fiscal 2005 related to the assumption of unvested stock options. • On January 16, 2001, we acquired Staccato Systems, Inc. of Mountain View, California. Staccato is in the field of audio synthesis technology. The total purchase price of $23.8 million consisted of $23 million in cash and the assumption of $0.8 million of vested outstanding Staccato stock options. We paid an additional $7 million to the selling shareholders related to the achievement of operational objectives. These payments were accounted for as additional purchase price and recorded to goodwill because the payments were not contingent on continued employment by the former shareholders of Staccato who became Analog employees. We paid contingent consideration payments to the former shareholders of $5 million and $2 million in fiscal 2002 and 2001, respectively. No additional contingent consideration payments will be made. An additional $0.2 million of compensation expense is being recorded annually through fiscal 2005 related to the assumption of unvested stock options. 23 Table of Contents New Accounting Pronouncements In June 2001, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued Statements of Financial Accounting Standards No. 141 (FAS 141), “Business Combinations,” and No. 142 (FAS 142), “Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets.” FAS 141 requires that all business combinations initiated after June 30, 2001 be accounted for using the purchase method of accounting. FAS 142, which became effective for our company in fiscal year 2003, prohibits the amortization of goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite useful lives. FAS 142 requires that these assets be reviewed for impairment at least annually, or more frequently if impairment indicators arise. Other intangible assets with finite lives will continue to be amortized over their estimated useful lives and assessed for impairment under FAS 144. We test goodwill for impairment using the two-step process prescribed by FAS 142. The first step is a screen for potential impairment, while the second step measures the amount of the impairment, if any. In the first step, if the fair value of the reporting unit(s) exceed(s) the carrying value, no impairment loss is recognized. If the carrying value of the reporting unit(s) exceed(s) the fair value, goodwill is potentially impaired and we must complete step two in order to measure the impairment loss. Step two compares the implied fair value of the goodwill with the carrying amount of that goodwill. If the carrying amount of goodwill exceeds the implied fair value of that goodwill, an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to that excess. We adopted FAS 142 in the first quarter of fiscal 2003. Application of the nonamortization provisions of FAS 142 resulted in an increase in annual net income of $44 million in fiscal 2003. We completed the required impairment test of goodwill upon adoption of FAS 142 as of November 3, 2002 in the second quarter of fiscal 2003. The results of the impairment review indicated that there was no impairment of goodwill. We also performed the annual impairment test as of the beginning of the fourth quarter of fiscal 2003 and the results indicated that there was no impairment of goodwill. See further discussion under Note 2f. “Goodwill and Other Acquisition-related Intangibles.” Effective November 3, 2002, we adopted Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 143 (FAS 143), “Accounting for Asset Retirement Obligations,” which addresses financial accounting and reporting for legal obligations associated with the retirement of tangible long-lived assets and the associated asset retirement costs. The adoption of FAS 143 did not have a material effect on our financial position or results of operations. Effective November 3, 2002, we adopted Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 144 (FAS 144), “Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets,” which addresses the financial accounting and reporting for the impairment of long-lived assets. This statement supersedes Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 121, “Accounting for the Impairment of Long-Lived Assets and for Long-Lived Assets to Be Disposed Of” and the accounting and reporting provisions for the disposal of a segment of a business of APB Opinion No. 30, “Reporting the Results of Operations-Reporting the Effects of Disposal of a Segment of a Business, and Extraordinary, Unusual and Infrequently Occurring Events and Transactions.” The adoption of FAS 144 did not have a material effect on our financial position or results of operations. Effective November 3, 2002, we adopted Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 145 (FAS 145), “Rescission of FASB Statements No. 4, 44 and 64, Amendment of FASB Statement No. 13, and Technical Corrections.” Under FAS 145, gains and losses on extinguishments of debt are classified as income or loss from continuing operations rather than extraordinary items. The adoption of FAS 145 did not have a material impact on our financial position or results of operations. In July 2002, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 146 (FAS 146), “Accounting for Costs Associated with Exit or Disposal Activities.” The standard requires companies to recognize costs associated with exit or disposal activities when they are incurred rather than at the date of a commitment to an exit or disposal plan. Costs covered by FAS 146 include lease termination costs and certain one-time employee severance costs that are associated with a restructuring, plant closing, or other exit or disposal activity. This statement is to be applied prospectively to exit or disposal activities initiated after December 31, 2002. FAS 146 may affect the timing of recognizing future exit or disposal costs, if any, as well as the amounts recognized. 24 Table of Contents Effective November 3, 2002, we adopted Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 148 (FAS 148), “Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation — Transitions and Disclosure.” FAS 148 amends FAS 123, “Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation,” to provide alternative methods of transition to FAS 123’s fair value method of accounting for stock-based employee compensation. FAS 148 also amends the disclosure provisions of FAS 123 and APB Opinion No. 28, “Interim Financial Reporting,” to require disclosure in the summary of significant accounting policies of the effects of an entity’s accounting policy with respect to stock-based employee compensation on reported net income and earnings per share in annual and interim financial statements. While FAS 148 does not amend FAS 123 to require companies to account for employee stock options using the fair value method, the disclosure provisions of FAS 148 are applicable to all companies with stock-based employee compensation, regardless of whether they account for stock-based compensation using the fair value method of FAS 123 or the intrinsic value method of Accounting Principles Board Opinion No. 25 (APB 25), “Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees,” and related interpretations. We have adopted the disclosure requirements of FAS 148 and will continue to account for stock-based compensation plans in accordance with APB 25. In April 2003, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 149 (FAS 149), “Amendment of Statement 133 on Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities.” This statement amends and clarifies financial accounting and reporting for derivative instruments, including certain derivative instruments embedded in other contracts, and for hedging activities under FAS 133. FAS 149 is effective for contracts entered into or modified after June 30, 2003. The adoption of FAS 149 did not have a material effect on our financial position or results of operations. In May 2003, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 150 (FAS 150), “Accounting for Certain Financial Instruments with Characteristics of both Liabilities and Equity”. FAS 150 establishes standards for how an issuer classifies and measures in its statement of financial position certain financial instruments with characteristics of both liabilities and equity. It requires that an issuer classify a financial instrument that is within its scope as a liability (or an asset in some circumstances) because that financial instrument embodies an obligation of the issuer. This Statement is effective for financial instruments entered into or modified after May 31, 2003, and otherwise is effective at the beginning of the first interim period beginning after June 15, 2003. The adoption of FAS 150 did not have a material effect on our financial position or results of operations. In November 2002, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued Financial Accounting Standards Board Interpretation No. 45 (FIN 45), “Guarantor’s Accounting and Disclosure Requirements for Guarantees, Including Indirect Guarantees of Indebtedness of Others.” FIN 45 requires that upon issuance of a guarantee, the guarantor must disclose and recognize a liability for the fair value of the obligation it assumes under that guarantee. The initial recognition and measurement requirement of FIN 45 is effective for guarantees issued or modified after December 31, 2002. As of November 1, 2003, the fair value of our guarantees that were issued or modified after December 31, 2002 was not material. The disclosure requirements of FIN 45, which are effective for interim and annual periods ending after December 15, 2002. Under the terms of the lease agreement, which was entered into prior to January 1, 2003, related to our headquarters facility in Norwood, Massachusetts, we have agreed to assume the note related to the property in the event of default by the lessor. Assumption of the note, which was approximately $8.8 million at November 1, 2003, would entitle us to a first lien on the property. The lease expires in May 2007. The guarantee was made by us to allow the lessor to obtain a lower cost of borrowing. We have also provided certain indemnities under which we may be required to make payments to an indemnified party in connection with certain transactions and agreements, in particular with respect to certain acquisitions and divestitures, we have provided customary indemnities for such matters as environmental, tax, product and employee liabilities. In addition, in connection with various other agreements, including subsidiary banking agreements, we may provide routine guarantees. Generally, because a maximum obligation is not explicitly stated, the potential amount of future maximum payments cannot be reasonably estimated, and therefore, we have not recorded any liability for these indemnities in the consolidated financial statements. The duration of the indemnities varies, and in many cases is indefinite. 25 Table of Contents In January 2003, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued Financial Accounting Standards Board Interpretation No. 46 (FIN 46), “Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities.” FIN 46 requires that if an entity has a controlling financial interest in a variable interest entity, the assets, liabilities and results of activities of the variable interest entity should be included in the consolidated financial statements of the entity. FIN 46 is effective immediately for all new variable interest entities created or acquired after January 31, 2003. For variable interest entities created or acquired prior to February 1, 2003, the provisions of FIN 46 must be applied for the first interim or annual period beginning after December 15, 2003. We are required to adopt the provisions of FIN 46 in the second quarter of fiscal 2004 and do not expect the adoption to have a material impact on our financial position or results of operations. Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates Management’s discussion and analysis of the financial condition and results of operations is based upon the consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. We base our estimates and judgments on historical experience, knowledge of current conditions and beliefs of what could occur in the future given available information. We consider the following accounting policies to be both those most important to the portrayal of our financial condition and those that require the most subjective judgment. If actual results differ significantly from management’s estimates and projections, there could be a material effect on our financial statements. Inventory Valuation Inventories are valued at the lower of cost (first-in, first-out method) or market. Because of the cyclical nature of the semiconductor industry, changes in inventory levels, obsolescence of technology, and product life cycles, we write down inventories to net realizable value. We employ a variety of consistent methodologies to determine the amount of inventory reserves necessary. While a portion of the reserve is determined via reference to the age of inventory and lower of cost or market calculations, an element of the reserve is subject to significant judgments by us about future demand for our inventory. Additionally, we have built inventory in preparation for the transfer of production from our four-inch wafer fabrication facilities to our six- and eight-inch wafer fabrication facilities for both lifetime supply and transition inventory. We have recorded certain levels of reserves related to these inventory builds. Although we believe that we have used our best efforts and available information to estimate future demand, due to the uncertain economic times and the difficulty inherent in predicting future results, it is possible that actual demand for our products will differ from our estimates. If actual demand for our products is less than our estimates, additional reserves for existing inventories may need to be recorded in future periods. Allowance for Doubtful Accounts We maintain allowances for doubtful accounts, when appropriate, for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments. If the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate, our actual losses may exceed our estimates, and additional allowances would be required. Long-Lived Assets and Goodwill We review property, plant, and equipment for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of assets may not be recoverable. Recoverability of these assets is measured by comparison of their carrying amount to future undiscounted cash flows the assets are expected to generate over their remaining economic life. If such assets are considered to be impaired, the impairment to be recognized in earnings equals the amount by which the carrying value of the assets exceeds their fair market value determined by either a quoted market price, if any, or a value determined by utilizing a discounted cash flow technique. Although we have recognized no material impairment adjustments related to our property, plant, and equipment during the past three fiscal years, except those made in conjunction with restructuring actions, deterioration in our business in the future could lead to such impairment adjustments in future 26 Table of Contents periods. Evaluation of impairment of long-lived assets requires estimates of future operating results that are used in the preparation of the expected future undiscounted cash flows. Actual future operating results and the remaining economic lives of our long-lived assets could differ from the estimates used in assessing the recoverability of these assets. These differences could result in impairment charges, which could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations. In June 2001, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 142, or FAS 142, “Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets.” In the first quarter of fiscal 2003, we adopted the new rules of FAS 142 for measuring and assessing goodwill for impairment. As required by FAS 142, all remaining and future acquired goodwill is subject to annual impairment tests, or earlier if indicators of potential impairment exist. The estimates and assumptions described above along with other factors such as discount rates will affect the amount of an impairment loss, if any, we recognize under FAS 142. We are required to test goodwill for impairment, which may result in impairment losses that could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations. Accounting for Income Taxes We account for income taxes in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 109, or FAS 109, “Accounting for Income Taxes,” which requires that deferred tax assets and liabilities be recognized using enacted tax rates for the effect of temporary differences between the book and tax bases of recorded assets and liabilities. FAS 109 also requires that deferred tax assets be reduced by a valuation allowance if it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax asset will not be realized. We evaluate the realizability of our deferred tax assets quarterly. At November 1, 2003, we had deferred tax assets of $144 million primarily resulting from temporary differences between the book and tax bases of assets and liabilities. While these assets are not assured of realization, we have conducted an assessment of the likelihood of realization and concluded that no significant valuation allowance is required. In reaching our conclusion, we evaluated certain relevant criteria including the existence of deferred tax liabilities that can be used to absorb deferred tax assets, the taxable income in prior carryback years that can be used to absorb net operating losses and taxable income in future years. Our judgments regarding future profitability may change due to future market conditions, changes in U.S. or international tax laws and other factors. These changes, if any, may require material adjustments to these deferred tax assets, resulting in a reduction in net income or an increase in net loss in the period when such determinations are made. In addition, we have provided for potential liabilities due in various foreign jurisdictions. Judgment is required in determining our worldwide income tax expense provision. In the ordinary course of global business, there are many transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax outcome is uncertain. Some of these uncertainties arise as a consequence of cost reimbursement arrangements among related entities. Although we believe our estimates are reasonable, no assurance can be given that the final tax outcome of these matters will not be different than that which is reflected in our historical income tax provisions and accruals. Such differences could have a material impact on our income tax provision and operating results in the period in which such determination is made. Contingencies From time to time, we receive notices that our products or manufacturing processes may be infringing the patent or intellectual property rights of others. We periodically assess each matter in order to determine if a contingent liability in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 5, or FAS 5, “Accounting for Contingencies,” should be recorded. In making this determination, we may, depending on the nature of the matter, consult with internal and external legal counsel and technical experts. Based on the information we obtain, combined with our judgment regarding all the facts and circumstances of each matter, we determine whether it is probable that a contingent loss may be incurred and whether the amount of such loss can be reasonably estimated. Should a loss be probable and reasonably estimable, we record a contingent loss in accordance with FAS 5. In determining the amount of a contingent loss, we consider advice received from experts in the specific matter, current status of legal proceedings, settlement negotiations that may be ongoing, prior case history and other factors. Should the judgments and estimates made by us be incorrect, we 27 Table of Contents may need to record additional contingent losses that could materially adversely impact our results of operations. See Note 12 to our Consolidated Financial Statements contained in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Forward-Looking Statements This Annual Report on Form 10-K contains or incorporates forward-looking statements within the meaning of section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933 and section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. These forward-looking statements are based on current expectations, estimates, forecasts and projections about the industry and markets in which we operate and management’s beliefs and assumptions. In addition, other written or oral statements that constitute forward-looking statements may be made by or on our behalf. Words such as “expect,” “anticipate,” “intend,” “plan,” “believe,” “seek,” “estimate,” variations of such words and similar expressions are intended to identify such forward-looking statements. These statements are not guarantees of future performance and involve certain risks, uncertainties and assumptions that are difficult to predict. We have included important factors in the cautionary statements below under the heading “Factors That May Affect Future Results” that we believe could cause our actual results to differ materially from the forward-looking statements we make. We do not intend to update publicly any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise. Factors That May Affect Future Results Our future operating results are difficult to predict and may materially fluctuate. Our future operating results are difficult to predict and may be materially affected by a number of factors, including the timing of new product announcements or introductions by us or our competitors, competitive pricing pressures, fluctuations in manufacturing yields, adequate availability of wafers and manufacturing capacity, the risk that our backlog could decline significantly, our ability to hire, retain and motivate adequate numbers of engineers and other qualified employees to meet the demands of our customers, changes in product mix, and the effect of adverse changes in economic conditions in the United States and international markets. In addition, the semiconductor market has historically been cyclical and subject to significant economic downturns. Our business is subject to rapid technological changes and there can be no assurance, depending on the mix of future business, that products stocked in inventory will not be rendered obsolete before we ship them. As a result of these and other factors, there can be no assurance that we will not experience material fluctuations in future operating results on a quarterly or annual basis. Long-term contracts are not typical for us and reductions, cancelations or delays in orders for our products could adversely affect our operating results. In certain markets where end-user demand may be particularly volatile and difficult to predict, some customers place orders that require us to manufacture product and have it available for shipment, even though the customer is unwilling to make a binding commitment to purchase all, or even any, of the product. At any given time, this situation could affect a portion of our backlog. As a result, we are subject to the risk of cancelation of orders leading to a sharp fall-off of sales and backlog. Further, those orders may be for products that meet the customer’s unique requirements so that those canceled orders would, in addition, result in an inventory of unsaleable products, resulting in potential inventory write-offs. As a result of lengthy manufacturing cycles for certain of the products subject to these uncertainties, the amount of unsaleable product could be substantial. Reductions, cancelations or delays in orders for our products could adversely affect our operating results. Our future success depends upon our ability to develop and market new products and enter new markets. Our success significantly depends on our continued ability to develop and market new products. There can be no assurance that we will be able to develop and introduce new products in a timely manner or that new products, if developed, will achieve market acceptance. In addition, our growth is dependent on our continued ability to penetrate new markets where we have limited experience and competition is intense. There can be 28 Table of Contents no assurance that the markets we serve will grow in the future, that our existing and new products will meet the requirements of these markets, that our products will achieve customer acceptance in these markets, that competitors will not force prices to an unacceptably low level or take market share from us, or that we can achieve or maintain profits in these markets. Furthermore, a decline in demand in one or several of our end-user markets could have a material adverse effect on the demand for our products and our results of operations. Also, some of our customers in these markets are less established, which could subject us to increased credit risk. We may not be able to compete successfully in the semiconductor industry in the future. Many other companies offer products that compete with our products. Some have greater financial, manufacturing, technical and marketing resources than we have. Additionally, some formerly independent competitors have been purchased by larger companies. Our competitors also include emerging companies selling specialized products to markets we serve. There can be no assurance that we will be able to compete successfully in the future against existing or new competitors, or that our operating results will not be adversely affected by increased price competition. We rely on third-party subcontractors and manufacturers for some industry-standard wafers and assembly/test services, and therefore cannot control their availability or conditions of supply. We rely, and plan to continue to rely, on assembly and test subcontractors and on third-party wafer fabricators to supply most of our wafers that can be manufactured using industry-standard submicron processes. This reliance involves several risks, including reduced control over delivery schedules, manufacturing yields and costs. Additionally, we utilize third-party wafer fabricators as sole-source suppliers, primarily Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company. These suppliers manufacture components in accordance with our proprietary designs and specifications. We have no written supply agreements with these sole-source suppliers and purchase our custom components through individual purchase orders. If these sole-source suppliers are unable or unwilling to manufacture and deliver sufficient quantities of components to us, on the time schedule and of the quality that we require, we may be forced to seek to engage additional or replacement suppliers, which could result in additional expenses and delays in product development or shipment of product to our customers. We may not be able to satisfy increasing demand for our products, and increased production may lead to overcapacity and lower prices. The cyclical nature of the semiconductor industry has resulted in sustained and short-term periods when demand for our products has increased or decreased rapidly. During these periods of rapid increases in demand, our available capacity may not be sufficient to satisfy the available demand. We, and the semiconductor industry generally, expand production facilities and access to third-party foundries in response to these periods of increased demand. These capacity expansions by us and other semiconductor manufacturers has led to overcapacity in our target markets which could lead to price erosion that would adversely impact our operating results. Our revenues may not increase enough to offset the expense of additional capacity. We, and the semiconductor industry generally, expand production facilities and access to third-party foundries in response to periods of increased demand which can cause operating expenses to increase. Should customer demand fail to increase or should the semiconductor industry enter a period of reduced customer demand, our financial position and results of operations could be adversely impacted as a result of underutilization of capacity or asset impairment charges. 29 Table of Contents We may be unable to adequately protect our proprietary rights, which may limit our ability to compete effectively. We rely primarily upon know-how, rather than on patents, to develop and maintain our competitive position. There can be no assurance that others will not develop or patent similar technology or reverse engineer our products or that the confidentiality agreements upon which we rely will be adequate to protect our interests. Other companies have obtained patents covering a variety of semiconductor designs and processes, and we might be required to obtain licenses under some of these patents or be precluded from making and selling the infringing products, if such patents are found to be valid. There can be no assurance that we would be able to obtain licenses, if required, upon commercially reasonable terms, or at all. Moreover, the laws of foreign countries in which we design, manufacture and market our products may afford little or no effective protection of our proprietary technology. We are involved in frequent litigation regarding intellectual property rights, which could be costly to defend and could require us to redesign products or pay significant royalties. There can be no assurance that any patent will issue on pending applications or that any patent issued will provide substantive protection for the technology or product covered by it. We believe that patent and mask set protection is of less significance in our business than experience, innovation and management skill. There also can be no assurance that others will not develop or patent similar technology, or reverse engineer our products, or that our confidentiality agreements with employees, consultants, silicon foundries and other suppliers and vendors will be adequate to protect our interests. The semiconductor industry is characterized by frequent claims and litigation involving patent and other intellectual property rights, including claims arising under our contractual indemnification of our customers. We have received from time to time, and may receive in the future, claims from third parties asserting that our products or processes infringe their patents or other intellectual property rights. In the event a third party makes a valid intellectual property claim against us and a license is not available to us on commercially reasonable terms, or at all, we could be forced either to redesign or to stop production of products incorporating that intellectual property, and our operating results could be materially and adversely affected. Litigation may be necessary to enforce our patents or other of our intellectual property rights or to defend us against claims of infringement, and this litigation could be costly and divert the attention of our key personnel. See Note 12 in the Notes to our Consolidated Financial Statements contained in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for information concerning pending litigation that involves us. An adverse outcome in this or other litigation could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position or on our consolidated results of operations or cash flows in the period in which the litigation is resolved. If we do not retain our key personnel, our ability to execute our business strategy will be limited. Our success depends to a significant extent upon the continued service of our executive officers and key management and technical personnel, particularly our experienced engineers, and on our ability to continue to attract, retain, and motivate qualified personnel. The competition for these employees is intense. The loss of the services of one or more of our key personnel could have a material adverse effect on our operating results. In addition, there could be a material adverse effect on us should the turnover rates for engineers and other key personnel increase significantly or if we are unable to continue to attract qualified personnel. We do not maintain any key person life insurance policy on any of our officers or employees. We rely on manufacturing capacity located in geologically unstable areas, which could affect the availability of supplies and services. We, and many companies in the semiconductor industry, rely on internal manufacturing capacity located in California as well as wafer fabrication foundries in Taiwan and other sub-contractors in geologically unstable locations around the world. This reliance involves risks associated with the impact of earthquakes on us and the semiconductor industry, including temporary loss of capacity, availability and cost of key raw materials and equipment and availability of key services including transport. In addition, California has 30 Table of Contents experienced intermittent interruption in the availability of electricity. To date, the impact on us has been negligible. However, electricity is a critical resource for us, without which our products could not be manufactured at factories exposed to continued lengthy power interruptions. Any prolonged inability to utilize one of our manufacturing facilities as a result of fire, natural disaster, unavailability of electric power or otherwise, would have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition. We are exposed to economic, political and other risks through our significant worldwide operations. During fiscal year 2003, approximately 74% of our revenues were derived from customers in international markets. Although we engage in hedging transactions to reduce our exposure to currency exchange rate fluctuations, there can be no assurance that our competitive position will not be adversely affected by changes in the exchange rate of the United States dollar against other currencies. We have manufacturing facilities outside the United States in Ireland and the Philippines. In addition to being exposed to the ongoing economic cycles in the semiconductor industry, we are also subject to the economic and political risks inherent in international operations and their impact on the United States economy in general, including the risks associated with ongoing uncertainties and political and economic instability in many countries around the world as well as the economic disruption from acts of terrorism, and the response to them by the United States and its allies. These risks include air transportation disruptions, expropriation, currency controls, currency exchange rate movement, and additional costs related to tax, tariff and freight rates. Our future operating results are dependent on the performance of independent distributors and sales representatives. A significant portion of our sales are through independent distributors that are not under our control. These independent distributors generally represent product lines offered by several companies and thus could reduce their sales efforts applied to our products or terminate their representation of us. We generally do not require letters of credit from our distributors and are not protected against accounts receivable default or bankruptcy by these distributors. Our inability to collect open accounts receivable could adversely affect our results of operations. Termination of a significant distributor, whether at our initiative or the distributor’s initiative, could disrupt our current business. If we are unable to find suitable replacements in the event of terminations by significant distributors or sales representatives, our operating results could be adversely affected. Our manufacturing processes are highly complex and may be interrupted. We have manufacturing processes that utilize a substantial amount of technology as the fabrication of integrated circuits is a highly complex and precise process. Minute impurities, contaminants in the manufacturing environment, difficulties in the fabrication process, defects in the masks used in the wafer manufacturing process, manufacturing equipment failures, wafer breakage or other factors can cause a substantial percentage of wafers to be rejected or numerous dice on each wafer to be nonfunctional. While we have significant expertise in semiconductor manufacturing, it is possible that some processes could become unstable. This instability could result in manufacturing delays and product shortages, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial position or results of operations. Our transition of products to more modern facilities and related inventory builds may not progress as planned. We are transitioning products from our older four-inch wafer fabrication facilities to our six-inch and eight-inch wafer fabrication facilities. We have built inventory in preparation for this transfer for both lifetime supply and transition inventory. We have recorded certain levels of reserves related to these inventory builds. Although we believe that we have used our best efforts and information to estimate future demand, due to the uncertain economic times and the difficulty inherent in predicting future results, it is possible that actual demand for our products will differ from our estimates. If actual demand for products included in our inventory builds is less than our estimates, our financial position and results of operations could be adversely impacted. 31 Table of Contents ITEM 7A. QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK Interest Rate Exposure Our annual interest income would change by approximately $29 million in fiscal 2003 and fiscal 2002 for each 100 basis point increase or decrease in interest rates. The fair values of our investment portfolio at November 1, 2003 and November 2, 2002 would not be significantly impacted by either an increase or decrease in interest rates primarily due to the short-term nature of the major portion of our investment portfolio. Foreign Currency Exposure As more fully described in Note 2 (i) in the Notes to our Consolidated Financial Statements contained in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, we regularly hedge our non-U.S. dollar-based exposures by entering into forward exchange contracts. The terms of these contracts are for periods matching the duration of the underlying exposure and generally range from one month to six months. The short-term nature of these contracts has resulted in these instruments having insignificant fair values at November 1, 2003 and November 2, 2002. Currently, our largest foreign currency exposure is against the Euro, primarily because Europe has a higher proportion of our local currency denominated expenses. Relative to foreign currency exposures existing at November 1, 2003 and November 2, 2002, a 10% unfavorable movement in foreign currency exchange rates would not expose us to significant losses in earnings or cash flows or significantly diminish the fair value of our foreign currency financial instruments, primarily due to the short lives of the affected financial instruments that effectively hedge substantially all of our year-end exposures against fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. The calculation assumes that each exchange rate would change in the same direction relative to the U.S. dollar. In addition to the direct effects of changes in exchange rates, such changes typically affect the volume of sales or the foreign currency sales price as competitors’ products become more or less attractive. Our sensitivity analysis of the effects of changes in foreign currency exchange rates does not factor in a potential change in sales levels or local currency selling prices. 32 Table of Contents",2023-12-30 19:09:05.932529

During these two fiscal years we experienced a continuation of what we believe is a broad-based cyclical improvement in the semiconductor industry that began for us in the second quarter of fiscal 2002. We began fiscal year 2004 with a plan to increase net sales by approximately 25% and for gross margins to continue to improve during the year. Net sales increased by 29% to $2,634 million in fiscal 2004 up from the $2,047 million recorded in the prior year. Our gross margins improved by 410 basis points to 59% in fiscal 2004, up from 54.9% recorded in fiscal 2003. For fiscal 2004 we had anticipated that operating expenses would grow at a rate significantly less than that of our revenue growth rate. Operating expenses for the fiscal year increased 14% year-to-year, or slightly less than half the growth rate of net sales for the year. Diluted earnings per share improved to $1.45 per share in fiscal 2004, up 86% from the $0.78 per share recorded in fiscal 2003. Net cash provided by operations was $778 million, or 29.5% of net sales, in fiscal 2004. Sales Net sales recorded in fiscal 2004 were $2,634 million, an increase of 29% over net sales of $2,047 million recorded in fiscal 2003. The $587 million increase in net sales in fiscal 2004 was a result of what we believe was a broad-based increase in demand for our products used in every end market we serve. Increased demand for our products used in industrial products and communications products accounted for approximately 77% of this year-to-year increase and increased demand for our products used in consumer and computer end markets accounted for the remaining increase in net sales. Increased demand for our products used in wireless handsets and infrastructure was the main reason for our increased sales in the communications end market. For fiscal 2003, net sales of $2,047 million increased by 20% from the $1,708 million recorded in fiscal 2002. During fiscal 2003, demand was very strong for our products used in consumer products, while demand was relatively flat for our products used in applications that depend on industrial, enterprise or carrier capital spending. As a result, demand for analog and DSP products used in wireless handsets, desktop and laptop computers, consumer products such as digital cameras and flat panel displays increased in fiscal 2003 above the levels experienced in fiscal 2002. In fiscal 2004, analog product sales increased 31% from the levels recorded in fiscal 2003. In fiscal 2003, analog product sales increased 16% from the levels recorded in fiscal 2002. In fiscal 2004, DSP product sales increased by 21% from the levels recorded in fiscal 2003 after increasing 35% from the levels recorded in fiscal 2002. Over the last three fiscal years, net sales from analog products were in the range of 78% to 80% of net sales and sales of DSP products represented the remaining 20% to 22% of net sales. Sales of new products, which we define as sales of products introduced in the prior six quarters, were 21% of net sales in fiscal 2004 as compared to 19% in fiscal 2003 and 21% in fiscal 2002. The year-over-year dollar increase in sales of new products was 45% in fiscal 2004 and was attributable to increased demand and design wins for some of our products used in communications, industrial, consumer and computer applications. This increase followed a year-to-year dollar increase in sales of new products of 8% in fiscal 2003 and a year-to-year 15 Table of Contents decline of sales of new products of 17% in fiscal 2002 as we went through a down-turn in the semiconductor industry. The percentage of sales by geographic region, based upon point of sale, for the last three years is as follows: Fiscal Year Region 2004 2003 2002 North America 25 % 26 % 30 % Europe 20 % 21 % 22 % Japan 19 % 18 % 17 % China 14 % 11 % 8 % Rest of Asia 22 % 24 % 23 % The decrease in North American and European sales and the increase in sales in Asia and Japan as a percentage of total net sales for fiscal 2004 and fiscal 2003 were attributable to the ongoing transfer of customer manufacturing activity to Asia and increased demand for our products in Japan and in Asia, particularly in China. The increase in sales in dollar terms in Japan was 36% and 29%, respectively, for fiscal 2004 and fiscal 2003, and was the result of a general recovery in demand for our products in Japan and in particular an increase in demand for our products used in the manufacture of automatic test equipment and consumer products. Sales in dollars increased in fiscal 2004 and fiscal 2003 by 73% and 75%, respectively, in China and by 16% and 27%, respectively, in the Rest of Asia as a result of increased demand for products used in communications, industrial, consumer, and computer products. In fiscal 2004, sales in dollar terms increased by 20% in Europe and 24% in North America because of the broad-based improvement in demand for our products used in industrial, communications, consumer and computer products. Sales in dollars in fiscal 2003 increased by 12% as compared to fiscal 2002 in Europe as a result of the steady improvement in demand for our products during the year. The slight increase in fiscal 2003 North America sales in dollars as compared to fiscal 2002 was attributable to increased demand for our products that was largely offset by the transfer of customer manufacturing activity to locations in Asia. Gross Margin Gross margin improved in fiscal 2004 to $1,554 million, or 59% of net sales, up 410 basis points from the gross margin of $1,124 million, or 54.9% of net sales, recorded in fiscal 2003. In fiscal 2002, gross margins were $905 million, or 53% of net sales. The improvement in gross margins for both fiscal 2003 and fiscal 2004 was primarily the result of spreading fixed manufacturing costs over an increasing sales level and, to a lesser extent, the impact of restructuring actions taken in recent years as well as continued tight cost control at our manufacturing operations. Research and Development Fiscal Year 2004 2003 2002 Research and Development (R&D) Expenses $ 511,732 $ 450,232 $ 423,869 R&D Expenses as a % of Net Sales 19.4 % 22.0 % 24.8 % R&D expenses for fiscal 2004 increased by $62 million, or 14%, to $512 million from the $450 million recorded in fiscal 2003. R&D expenses increased $26 million, or 6%, to $450 million in fiscal 2003 from the $424 million recorded in fiscal 2002. R&D expenses declined as a percentage of net sales to 19.4% in fiscal 2004 from 22% in fiscal 2003 and from 24.8% in fiscal 2002 as a result of the 29% and 20% year-to-year increase in revenue for fiscal 2004 and fiscal 2003, respectively. R&D expenses increased by 14% year-to-year in fiscal 2004 primarily as a result of additional salary and benefit costs associated with a 5% increase in engineering headcount during the year. These expenses also increased as a result of annual salary increases and increased bonus payments and, to a lesser extent, an increase in other engineering expenses reflecting the increased R&D activity during the year. For fiscal 2003, the year-to-year increase in R&D expenses was 16 Table of Contents limited to 6% as a result of acquisition-related expenses declining year-to-year by $5.6 million and the company limiting discretionary expenses including salary increases for higher paid employees and curtailing hiring to strategically important new hires and college hires. The reduction in acquisition-related expenses to $8.2 million in fiscal 2003 from $13.8 million in fiscal 2002 arose primarily because fiscal 2002 costs included additional expenses related to fixed-value contingent compensation and the achievement of final performance-based criteria that did not recur in fiscal 2003. R&D expense as a percentage of net sales will fluctuate from year-to-year depending on the amount of net sales and the success of new product development efforts, which we view as critical to our future growth. At any point in time we have hundreds of R&D projects underway, and we believe that none of these projects is material on an individual basis. We expect to continue the development of innovative technologies and processes for new products and we believe that a continued commitment to R&D is essential in order to maintain product leadership with our existing products and to provide innovative new product offerings, and therefore, we expect to continue to make significant R&D investments in the future. Selling, Marketing, General and Administrative (SMG&A) Fiscal Year 2004 2003 2002 SMG&A Expenses $ 340,036 $ 288,009 $ 257,054 SMG&A Expenses as a % of Net Sales 12.9 % 14.0 % 15.1 % SMG&A expenses increased in fiscal 2004 by $52 million, or 18%, from the levels recorded in fiscal 2003. In fiscal 2003, the increase in SMG&A expenses was $31 million, or 12%, from the $257 million recorded in fiscal 2002. As a percentage of net sales, SMG&A declined over the past two fiscal years primarily due to the increases in net sales for each of those years. For fiscal 2004, the increase in SMG&A expenses over the levels recorded in fiscal 2003 was primarily a result of increased salary and employee benefit costs and bonus payments to employees, increased commission payments as a result of the 29% year-to-year increase in net sales and, to a lesser extent, increased legal costs associated with patent and intellectual property activity and other expense increases associated with selling and marketing activities. The increase in SMG&A expenses in fiscal 2003 over fiscal 2002 was primarily the result of increased commission amounts paid due to the 20% year-to-year increase in net sales, the decision to add additional field application engineers to assist existing and potential customers to design products that incorporate ADI technology to address their specific requirements, as well as initiatives to publicize new products. These increases were offset by limitations on discretionary expenses including salary increases for higher paid employees. Amortization of Intangibles Amortization of intangibles was $3 million for fiscal 2004 and fiscal 2003 compared with $57 million for fiscal 2002. The decrease in amortization expense in fiscal 2003 from the levels recorded in fiscal 2002 was the result of our adoption of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 142, or FAS 142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets, effective November 3, 2002, which results in goodwill no longer being amortized. Special Charges During fiscal 2003, we recorded special charges of $9.5 million, and during fiscal 2002 we recorded special charges totaling $48.5 million. Special charges recorded in fiscal years 2003 and 2002 are more fully described under the heading “Special Charges” below. There were no special charges recorded in fiscal 2004. Operating Income Our operating income was $699 million, or 26.6% of net sales, in fiscal 2004, compared to $374 million, or 18.3% of net sales, in fiscal 2003. The improvement in operating income as a percentage of net sales in fiscal 2004 over the levels recorded in fiscal 2003 was a result of the 410 basis point year-to-year improvement in gross margin combined with operating expense increases that were limited to 14%, which was less than half 17 Table of Contents the 29% increase in net sales for the year. Operating income was $118 million, or 6.9% of net sales, in fiscal 2002. Nonoperating Income and Expense Interest expense was $0.2 million in fiscal 2004, $32 million in fiscal 2003 and $44 million in fiscal 2002. Fiscal 2003 included interest expense for only 11 months and fiscal 2002 included interest expense for 12 months as we redeemed our $1,200 million 4.75% Convertible Subordinated Notes, or notes, on October 1, 2003. In addition, an interest rate swap agreement we entered into in January 2002 had the effect of swapping the 4.75% fixed rate of our notes into a LIBOR-based floating rate that was 1.61% as of November 6, 2002 and was 1.14% at the time we redeemed our notes on October 1, 2003. These two items resulted in the year-to-year decline in interest expense from fiscal 2002 to fiscal 2003. Interest income was $36 million in fiscal 2004 compared to $41 million in fiscal 2003 and $65 million in fiscal 2002. The year-to-year decrease in interest income in fiscal 2004 compared to fiscal 2003 was attributable to lower average invested cash balances in fiscal 2004 due to the note redemption in 2003. This was partially mitigated by our decision in fiscal 2004 to increase our holdings of longer term, high-credit quality bonds, which offer higher yields than shorter-term investments, and higher interest rates later in fiscal 2004 as a result of actions taken by the Federal Reserve Board. The year-to-year decrease in interest income in fiscal 2003 as compared to fiscal 2002 was attributable to less income earned on our invested cash balances due to the decline in interest rates during fiscal 2003 as a result of actions taken by the Federal Reserve Board and our decision to increase our holdings of higher credit quality yet lower interest-bearing investments. Provision for Income Taxes Our effective income tax rate was 22% for fiscal 2004 and fiscal 2003 as compared to 25% for fiscal 2002. The decrease in the effective rate from fiscal 2002 to fiscal 2003 was primarily the result of the discontinuance of non-deductible goodwill amortization in the first quarter of fiscal 2003 as a result of our adoption of FAS 142. Goodwill was treated as a permanent difference in the fiscal 2002 tax provision, which had the effect of increasing our effective income tax rate. Net Income Fiscal Year 2004 2003 2002 Net Income $ 570,738 $ 298,281 $ 105,299 Net Income as a % of Net Sales 21.7 % 14.6 % 6.2 % Diluted EPS $ 1.45 $ 0.78 $ 0.28 Fiscal 2004 net income was $571 million, or 21.7% of net sales, and diluted earnings per share was $1.45 compared to net income in fiscal 2003 of $298 million, or 14.6% of net sales, and diluted earnings per share of $0.78. The fiscal 2004 increase in net income of $272 million from the level recorded in fiscal 2003 was primarily due to the year-to-year increase in net sales and, to a lesser extent, the improvement in operating income as a percentage of net sales from 18.3% recorded in fiscal 2003 to 26.6% recorded in fiscal 2004. For fiscal 2002 net income was $105 million, or 6.2% of net sales. The improvement in net income in fiscal 2003 compared to fiscal 2002 was the result of an increase in net sales, the cessation of goodwill amortization and reduced expenses related to special charges. The impact of inflation on our business during the past three fiscal years has not been significant. Related Party Transactions One of our directors, who has been a director since 1988, became a director of Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company, or TSMC, in fiscal 2002. We purchased approximately $337 million, $232 million and $206 million of products from TSMC in fiscal years 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively. We believe that the terms and prices for the purchases of these products are at terms no less favorable than those that could be 18 Table of Contents obtained from unaffiliated parties. Approximately $15 million and $14 million was payable to TSMC as of October 30, 2004 and November 1, 2003, respectively. We anticipate that we will make significant purchases from TSMC in fiscal year 2005. Liquidity and Capital Resources Fiscal Year 2004 2003 2002 Net Cash Provided by Operations $ 778,045 $ 432,963 $ 226,126 Net Cash Provided by Operations as a % of Net Sales 29.5 % 21.1 % 13.2 % During fiscal 2004, net cash provided by operations increased by $345 million from the amount recorded in the prior year primarily due to the year-to-year increase in net income of $272 million. During fiscal 2004 we received $124 million in proceeds from our various employee stock programs. These cash inflows were partially offset by the repurchase of approximately $137 million of our common stock, additions to property, plant and equipment of $146 million and our payment of cash dividends of $75 million in fiscal 2004. Cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments increased by $568 million during fiscal 2004 to $2,685 million at October 30, 2004. During fiscal 2003, net cash from operations increased by $207 million from the amount recorded in fiscal 2002, primarily due to a year-to-year increase in net income of $193 million. In fiscal 2003, we received $71 million from our employee stock plans. Cash inflows in fiscal 2003 were offset by additions to property, plant and equipment of $68 million and by a net payment of $1,198 million related to the redemption of all of our outstanding notes together with the associated redemption premium and the termination of the related interest rate swap and loan agreement. Cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments decreased by $781 million during fiscal 2003 to $2,117 million at November 1, 2003 from $2,898 million at November 2, 2002, primarily as a result of these activities. Accounts receivable of $329 million at the end of fiscal 2004 increased by $34 million, or 12%, from $295 million at the end of fiscal 2003. This increase resulted principally from a $75 million increase in net sales during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2004 as compared to the fourth quarter of fiscal 2003. Accounts receivable of $295 million at the end of fiscal 2003 increased $67 million, or 29%, from $228 million at the end of fiscal 2002. This increase resulted principally from a $102 million increase in net sales during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2003 as compared to the fourth quarter of fiscal 2002. Days sales outstanding increased from 46 days at the end of the fourth quarter of fiscal 2002 to 48 days at the end of the fourth quarter of fiscal 2003 and fiscal 2004. The year-to-year increase in days sales outstanding at the end of fiscal 2003 was due to a higher level of sales in the latter part of the fourth quarter of fiscal 2003 as compared to the fourth quarter of fiscal 2002. Inventories increased by $58 million, or 20%, from the end of fiscal 2003 to $346 million at the end of fiscal 2004. Days cost of sales in inventory increased by 17 days to 123 days as of the end of the fourth quarter of fiscal 2004. The increase in inventory in dollars was the result of an increase in internal production and purchases of fabricated wafers from external foundries in response to the increases in demand for our products, particularly in the first half of fiscal 2004, combined with the impact of a decline in net sales in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2004 compared to the levels recorded in the prior quarter. Net sales in the fourth quarter of 2004 declined 12% from the levels recorded in the prior quarter because incoming order rates from our customers slowed as a result of what we believe is an inventory correction at our customers. Inventories declined by $19 million, or 6%, from the end of fiscal 2002 to $288 million at the end of fiscal 2003. Days cost of sales in inventory declined by 29 days to 106 days as of the end of the fourth quarter of fiscal 2003 as compared to the fourth quarter of fiscal 2002. The decrease in inventory in dollars was attributable to tight control of inventory levels as well as increasing demand for our products as the fiscal year 2003 progressed. Net additions to property, plant and equipment were $146 million in fiscal 2004, $68 million in fiscal 2003 and $57 million in fiscal 2002. The increase in capital expenditures in fiscal 2004 compared to the prior year was principally the result of additions to manufacturing capacity at our facilities in response to the increased 19 Table of Contents demand levels for our products we experienced in fiscal 2003 and 2004. Fiscal 2005 capital expenditures are expected to be approximately $150 million. In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2003, we redeemed all of our outstanding notes for cash. The redemption price was 101.90% of the principal amount of the notes, or $1,223 million. A net pre-tax loss of $0.2 million was recognized in other expense as a result of the redemption, comprised of a $10.8 million gain on the redemption of the notes that was offset by a write-off of $11 million of deferred financing costs. The gain on the redemption of the notes was due to the carrying value of the notes being greater than the redemption value as a result of the mark-to-market of the interest rate component of the notes to fair value. As a result, apart from operating lease obligations, we had no debt outstanding at the end of fiscal year 2003 or fiscal year 2004. During fiscal 2004, our Board of Directors declared cash dividends totaling $0.20 per outstanding share of common stock, which were paid during the fiscal year. These dividend payments amounted in total to approximately $75 million. The payment of future dividends, if any, will be based on our quarterly financial performance. On August 11, 2004, our Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of up to an aggregate of $500 million of our common stock. We may repurchase outstanding shares of our common stock from time to time on the open market or in privately negotiated transactions. Management will determine the timing and amount of share repurchases. During fiscal 2004, we repurchased approximately $137 million of our common stock under this plan. Our previous repurchase program announced on August 15, 2002 was terminated by resolution of our Board of Directors on August 11, 2004. The table below summarizes our significant contractual obligations as of October 30, 2004: Payment due by period Less than More than (thousands) Total 1 Year 1-3 Years 4-5 Years 5 Years Contractual obligations: Operating leasesa $ 42,729 $ 16,177 $ 16,274 $ 6,516 $ 3,762 Software licensesb 35,801 9,375 26,426 — — Deferred compensation planc 322,304 5,388 3,320 934 312,662 Pension fundingd 5,094 5,094 — — — Total $ 405,928 $ 36,034 $ 46,020 $ 7,450 $ 316,424 (a) Certain of our operating lease obligations include escalation clauses. These escalating payment requirements are reflected in the table. (b) Software licenses relate to contractual obligations we have to license electronic design automation software from third parties. (c) These payments relate to obligations under the Analog Devices, Inc. Deferred Compensation Plan, or the Deferred Compensation Plan. The Deferred Compensation Plan allows certain members of management and other highly-compensated employees and non-employee directors to defer receipt of all or any portion of their compensation and gains on stock options and restricted stock granted before July 23, 1997. The payment obligations reflected in the table include the planned distributions from the Deferred Compensation Plan for participants who have terminated employment prior to October 30, 2004 and elected to have their plan balance distributed in installments. The amount in the “More than 5 Years” column of the table represents the remaining total balance under the Deferred Compensation Plan to be paid to participants who have not terminated employment or elected to withdraw their balances prior to October 30, 2004. Since we cannot reasonably estimate the timing of withdrawals for participants who have not yet terminated employment or elected to withdraw their balances, we have included the future obligation to these participants in the “More than 5 Years” column of the table. 20 Table of Contents (d) Our funding policy for our foreign defined benefit plans is consistent with the local requirements of each country. The payment obligations in the table are estimates of our expected contributions to these plans for fiscal year 2005. The actual future payments may differ from the amounts presented in the table and reasonable estimates of payments beyond one year are not practical because of potential future changes in variables such as plan asset performance, interest rates and the rate of increase in compensation levels. Purchase orders for the purchase of raw materials and other goods and services are not included in the table above. We are not able to determine the total amount of these purchase orders that represent contractual obligations, as purchase orders may represent authorizations to purchase rather than binding agreements. In addition, our purchase orders generally allow for cancellation without significant penalties. We do not have significant agreements for the purchase of raw materials or other goods specifying minimum quantities or set prices that exceed our expected short term requirements. The expected timing of payment and amounts of the obligations discussed above are estimated based on current information. At October 30, 2004, our principal source of liquidity was $2,685 million of cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments. We believe that our existing sources of liquidity and cash expected to be generated from future operations, together with anticipated available long-term financing, will be sufficient to fund operations, capital expenditures and research and development efforts for at least the next twelve months and thereafter for the foreseeable future. Outlook During fiscal years 2003 and 2004, we experienced the continuation of what we believe is a broad-based cyclical improvement in the semiconductor industry that started for us in the second quarter of fiscal 2002. However, during the third quarter of fiscal 2004, incoming order rates from our customers slowed and order cancellations increased. We believe this is the result of an inventory correction at our customers. The level of incoming order rates remained low through the end of the fourth quarter of fiscal 2004. As a result, net sales in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2004 declined 12% from the levels recorded in the prior quarter. Net sales declined in all geographic regions but especially in China and Japan where the effects of the inventory correction and the economic constraints imposed by the Chinese government impacted demand for our products used in wireless handsets, wireless infrastructure, semiconductor capital equipment, in particular automatic test equipment, and to a lesser extent consumer and computer products. We are entering fiscal 2005 with a cautious outlook particularly for the first fiscal quarter of the year. Much of the order rate decline we have experienced appears to be related to inventory adjustments and we believe we have already absorbed significant inventory reductions at our customers. There continues to be much uncertainty about interest rate levels and higher energy prices and their potential impact on consumer spending and, as a result, our customers continue to be cautious. Accordingly, we are entering fiscal 2005 with low levels of backlog, which limits our visibility and makes it very difficult to predict revenue levels for fiscal 2005. Against this background, we are planning for revenue in the first quarter of fiscal 2005 to be in the range of $575 million to $600 million and we expect gross margins to remain at 58% to 59% and operating expenses to decline sequentially by between 3% and 4%. Based on these assumptions we expect diluted earnings per share to be in the range of $0.28 to $0.31 for the first quarter of fiscal 2005. While our current lack of visibility causes us to be cautious about fiscal 2005, we are planning for demand for our products to recover in the second quarter of fiscal 2005 and throughout the fiscal year and for our financial results to reflect this improvement in line with the expected recovery in demand. We currently plan to make capital expenditures of approximately $150 million in fiscal 2005. Depreciation expense is expected to increase to approximately $160 million in fiscal 2005 from $150 million in fiscal 2004. We anticipate that our effective tax rate will remain relatively flat year-to-year at approximately 22%. 21 Table of Contents Special Charges Fiscal 2003 Special Charges During the third quarter of fiscal 2003, we recorded a special charge of $0.3 million. The charge included a $2.0 million write-down of equipment to fair value due to a decision to outsource the assembly of products in plastic packages, which had been done internally at our facility in the Philippines. This amount was the net book value of the assets used in plastic assembly, net of proceeds received from the sale in the third quarter of a portion of the assets. We also decided to abandon efforts to develop a particular expertise in optical communications that resulted in the write-down of $2.7 million of equipment to its fair value. During the quarter ended August 2, 2003, we determined that costs remaining to be paid for certain restructuring charges would be less than the amount originally recorded. Accordingly, we recorded a change in estimate reducing the restructuring accruals by $4.4 million related to prior restructuring charges as more fully described below. During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2003, we recorded a special charge of $9.2 million as a result of a decision to close a small manufacturing facility in Belfast, Northern Ireland that supplied foundry substrate services for optical applications. The charge included $2.0 million of severance and fringe benefit costs for approximately 57 manufacturing employees and 14 engineering and administrative employees all of which had been paid by the end of the second quarter of fiscal 2004. The charge also included $6 million related to the write-down of property, plant and equipment to its fair value and $1.2 million related to the write-down of various other assets to their fair values. The closure was completed during the second quarter of fiscal 2004. Fiscal 2002 Special Charges During the second quarter of fiscal 2002, we recorded special charges of approximately $27.2 million. The second quarter charge was comprised of $25.7 million related to the planned transfer of production from our three older four-inch wafer fabrication facilities to our three six-inch and one eight-inch wafer fabrication facilities, and $3 million primarily related to the impairment of an investment, which was partially offset by an adjustment of $1.5 million related to equipment cancelation fees recorded in fiscal year 2001. The investment impairment, which was related to an equity investment in a private company, was due to our decision to abandon the product strategy for which the investment was made. Included in the $25.7 million special charge were severance and fringe benefit costs of $15.3 million for 509 manufacturing employees in the United States and Ireland, $2.3 million related to the write-down of equipment to be abandoned and $8.1 million of other charges, primarily related to lease termination and cleanup costs. The write-down of equipment was principally due to a decision to discontinue various product development strategies. In the third quarter of fiscal 2003, we reversed $2.9 million of the accrual primarily due to lower than previously expected severance costs. The lower severance costs were the result of a reduction in the number of separated employees and, to a lesser extent, the average tenure of separated employees differing from estimates. The 509 employees projected to be terminated at the time of the original charge was adjusted down to 439 and, as of May 1, 2004, all of the employees had been terminated. The reduction in the number of employees to be terminated was due to the transfer of employees, which primarily occurred in the third quarter of fiscal 2003, to positions in our six-inch wafer fabrication facilities where we experienced an unexpected increase in demand for our products. All the planned closure and consolidation actions related to our four-inch wafer fabrication facilities are now complete. Since severance costs are paid as income continuance at some locations, these amounts will be expended over time subsequent to the final termination of employment. During the third quarter of fiscal 2002, we recorded special charges of approximately $12.8 million. The charges included severance and fringe benefit costs of $3.7 million related to cost reduction actions taken in several product groups and, to a lesser extent, in manufacturing, $3.8 million related to the impairment of an investment, $3.4 million related to the impairment of goodwill associated with the closing of an Austrian design center acquired in fiscal 2001 and $1.9 million primarily related to the abandonment of equipment and lease cancelation fees. The investment impairment, which was related to an equity investment in a private company, was due to our decision to abandon the product strategy for which the investment was made. The severance and fringe benefit costs were for approximately 70 engineering employees in the United States, 22 Table of Contents Europe and Canada, and approximately 30 manufacturing employees in the United States, all of whom had been terminated as of the end of the second quarter of fiscal 2004. During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2002, we recorded special charges of approximately $8.4 million. The charges included severance and fringe benefit costs of $2.5 million related to cost reduction actions taken in the sales group, several product groups and our manufacturing test operations for approximately 65 employees in the United States and Europe, all of whom had been terminated as of November 1, 2003. The charges also included $2.1 million related to the impairment of investments, $1.8 million primarily related to the abandonment of equipment and lease cancelation fees and a change in estimate of $2.0 million for additional estimated cleanup costs originally recorded in the second quarter of fiscal 2002. The investment impairment charges were related to the decline in fair value of a publicly traded equity investment to less than its cost basis that was determined to be other-than-temporary, and to an equity investment in a private company. The private company equity investment was part of a product strategy that we decided to abandon. Fiscal 2001 Special Charges During fiscal 2001, we recorded special charges of approximately $47 million related to cost reduction actions taken in response to the economic climate at that time. The actions consisted of workforce reductions in manufacturing and, to a lesser extent, in selling, marketing and administrative areas as well as a decision to consolidate worldwide manufacturing operations and rationalize production planning and quality activities. The cost reductions included severance and fringe benefit costs of $29.6 million for approximately 1,200 employees in the United States, Europe, Asia and the Philippines, all of whom had been terminated as of January 31, 2004. The special charges also included $11.6 million related to the abandonment of equipment resulting from the consolidation of worldwide manufacturing operations and $5.8 million of other charges primarily related to equipment and lease cancelation fees. Based on the results of negotiations with vendors regarding purchase order cancelation fees, the amount paid was $1.5 million less than the amount recorded for such charges and, accordingly, we adjusted the provision for purchase order cancelation fees by $1.5 million in the second quarter of fiscal 2002 to reflect this change in estimate. In the third quarter of fiscal 2003, we determined that the severance costs remaining to be paid would be $1.3 million less than the amount originally recorded for these charges and also determined that $0.2 million originally reserved for the termination of two leases would not be required. Therefore, we adjusted the provision for these severance and other costs in the third quarter of fiscal 2003 to reflect this change in estimate. New Accounting Pronouncements In January 2003, the Financial Accounting Standards Board, or FASB, issued Financial Accounting Standards Board Interpretation No. 46 (FIN 46), Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities, and amended it by issuing FIN 46R in December 2003. FIN 46R requires that if an entity has a controlling financial interest in a variable interest entity, the assets, liabilities and results of activities of the variable interest entity should be included in the consolidated financial statements of the entity. Because we do not have any variable interest entities, the adoption of FIN 46R in the second quarter of fiscal 2004 did not have any effect on our financial position or results of operations. In December 2003, the FASB issued SFAS No. 132 (Revised 2003), Employers’ Disclosures about Pensions and Other Postretirement Benefits, which enhanced the required disclosures about pension plans and other postretirement benefit plans, but did not change the measurement or recognition principles for those plans. The statement requires additional interim and annual disclosures about the assets, obligations, cash flows and net periodic benefit cost of defined benefit pension plans and other defined benefit postretirement plans. The required interim disclosures were effective for us in the second quarter of fiscal year 2004, and the required annual disclosures are included in Note 13 to our consolidated financial statements contained in Item 8 of this annual report on Form 10-K. In December 2003, the SEC issued Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 104, Revenue Recognition (SAB 104). SAB 104 updates portions of the interpretive guidance included in Topic 13 of the codification of Staff 23 Table of Contents Accounting Bulletins in order to make the interpretive guidance consistent with current authoritative accounting and auditing guidance and SEC rules and regulations. We are following the guidance of SAB 104. In March 2004, the FASB issued EITF Issue No. 03-1, The Meaning of Other-Than-Temporary Impairment and Its Application to Certain Investments, which provides new guidance for assessing impairment losses on debt and equity investments. Additionally, EITF Issue No. 03-1 includes new disclosure requirements for investments that are deemed to be temporarily impaired. In September 2004, the FASB delayed the accounting provisions of EITF Issue No. 03-1; however, the disclosure requirements remain effective and have been adopted for our fiscal year ended October 30, 2004. We will evaluate the effect, if any, of EITF Issue No. 03-1 when final guidance is released. Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates Management’s discussion and analysis of the financial condition and results of operations is based upon the consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. We base our estimates and judgments on historical experience, knowledge of current conditions and beliefs of what could occur in the future given available information. We consider the following accounting policies to be both those most important to the portrayal of our financial condition and those that require the most subjective judgment. If actual results differ significantly from management’s estimates and projections, there could be a material effect on our financial statements. We also have other policies that we consider key accounting policies, such as our policy for revenue recognition, including the deferral of revenue on sales to distributors until the products are sold to the end user; however, the application of these policies does not require us to make estimates or judgments that are difficult or subjective. Inventory Valuation Inventories are valued at the lower of cost (first-in, first-out method) or market. Because of the cyclical nature of the semiconductor industry, changes in inventory levels, obsolescence of technology, and product life cycles, we write down inventories to net realizable value. We employ a variety of methodologies to determine the amount of inventory reserves necessary. While a portion of the reserve is determined via reference to the age of inventory and lower of cost or market calculations, an element of the reserve is subject to significant judgments made by us about future demand for our inventory. If actual demand for our products is less than our estimates, additional reserves for existing inventories may need to be recorded in future periods. Allowance for Doubtful Accounts We maintain allowances for doubtful accounts, when appropriate, for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments. If the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate, our actual losses may exceed our estimates, and additional allowances would be required. Long-Lived Assets We review property, plant, and equipment for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of assets may not be recoverable. Recoverability of these assets is measured by comparison of their carrying value to future undiscounted cash flows the assets are expected to generate over their remaining economic life. If such assets are considered to be impaired, the impairment to be recognized in earnings equals the amount by which the carrying value of the assets exceeds their fair market value determined by either a quoted market price, if any, or a value determined by utilizing a discounted cash flow technique. Although we have recognized no material impairment adjustments related to our property, plant, and equipment during the past three fiscal years, except those made in conjunction with restructuring actions, deterioration in our business in the future could lead to such impairment adjustments in future periods. Evaluation of impairment of long-lived assets requires estimates of future operating results that are used in the 24 Table of Contents preparation of the expected future undiscounted cash flows. Actual future operating results and the remaining economic lives of our long-lived assets could differ from the estimates used in assessing the recoverability of these assets. These differences could result in impairment charges, which could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations. Goodwill In June 2001, the FASB issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 142, or FAS 142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets. In the first quarter of fiscal 2003, we adopted the new rules of FAS 142 for measuring and assessing goodwill for impairment. As required by FAS 142, all remaining and future acquired goodwill is subject to annual impairment tests, or earlier if indicators of potential impairment exist and suggest that the carrying value of goodwill may not be recoverable from estimated discounted future cash flows. Because we have one reporting segment under FAS 142, we utilize the entity-wide approach to assess goodwill for impairment and compare our market value to our net book value to determine if an impairment exists. These impairment tests may result in impairment losses that could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations. Accounting for Income Taxes We account for income taxes in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 109, or FAS 109, Accounting for Income Taxes, which requires that deferred tax assets and liabilities be recognized using enacted tax rates for the effect of temporary differences between the book and tax bases of recorded assets and liabilities. FAS 109 also requires that deferred tax assets be reduced by a valuation allowance if it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax asset will not be realized. We evaluate the realizability of our deferred tax assets quarterly. At October 30, 2004, we had gross deferred tax assets of $144 million primarily resulting from temporary differences between the book and tax bases of assets and liabilities. We have conducted an assessment of the likelihood of realization of those deferred tax assets and concluded that a $33 million valuation allowance is needed to reserve the amount of the deferred tax assets that may not be realized due to the expiration of state credit carryovers. In reaching our conclusion, we evaluated certain relevant criteria including the existence of deferred tax liabilities that can be used to absorb deferred tax assets, the taxable income in prior carryback years that can be used to absorb net operating losses and taxable income in future years. Our judgments regarding future profitability may change due to future market conditions, changes in U.S. or international tax laws and other factors. These changes, if any, may require material adjustments to these deferred tax assets, resulting in a reduction in net income or an increase in net loss in the period when such determinations are made. In addition, we have provided for potential liabilities due in various jurisdictions. Judgment is required in determining our worldwide income tax expense provision. In the ordinary course of global business, there are many transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax outcome is uncertain. Some of these uncertainties arise as a consequence of cost reimbursement arrangements among related entities. Although we believe our estimates are reasonable, no assurance can be given that the final tax outcome of these matters will not be different than that which is reflected in our historical income tax provisions and accruals. Such differences could have a material impact on our income tax provision and operating results in the period in which such determination is made. Contingencies From time to time, we receive notices that our products or manufacturing processes may be infringing the patent or intellectual property rights of others. We periodically assess each matter to determine if a contingent liability should be recorded in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 5, or FAS 5, Accounting for Contingencies. In making this determination, we may, depending on the nature of the matter, consult with internal and external legal counsel and technical experts. Based on the information we obtain, combined with our judgment regarding all the facts and circumstances of each matter, we determine whether it is probable that a contingent loss may be incurred and whether the amount of such loss can be reasonably estimated. Should a loss be probable and reasonably estimable, we record a contingent loss in accordance with 25 Table of Contents FAS 5. In determining the amount of a contingent loss, we consider advice received from experts in the specific matter, current status of legal proceedings, settlement negotiations that may be ongoing, prior case history and other factors. Should the judgments and estimates made by us be incorrect, we may need to record additional contingent losses that could materially adversely impact our results of operations. See Note 11 to our Consolidated Financial Statements contained in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Forward-Looking Statements This Annual Report on Form 10-K contains or incorporates forward-looking statements within the meaning of section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933 and section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. These forward-looking statements are based on current expectations, estimates, forecasts and projections about the industry and markets in which we operate and management’s beliefs and assumptions. In addition, other written or oral statements that constitute forward-looking statements may be made by or on our behalf. Words such as “expect,” “anticipate,” “intend,” “plan,” “believe,” “seek,” “estimate,” variations of such words and similar expressions are intended to identify such forward-looking statements. These statements are not guarantees of future performance and involve certain risks, uncertainties and assumptions that are difficult to predict. We have included important factors in the cautionary statements below under the heading “Factors That May Affect Future Results” that we believe could cause our actual results to differ materially from the forward-looking statements we make. We do not intend to update publicly any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise. Factors That May Affect Future Results Our future operating results are difficult to predict and may materially fluctuate. Our future operating results are difficult to predict and may be materially affected by a number of factors, including the timing of new product announcements or introductions by us or our competitors, competitive pricing pressures, fluctuations in manufacturing yields, adequate availability of wafers and manufacturing capacity, the risk that our backlog could decline significantly, our ability to hire, retain and motivate adequate numbers of engineers and other qualified employees to meet the demands of our customers, changes in product mix, and the effect of adverse changes in economic conditions in the United States and international markets. In addition, the semiconductor market has historically been cyclical and subject to significant economic downturns. Our business is subject to rapid technological changes and there can be no assurance, depending on the mix of future business, that products stocked in inventory will not be rendered obsolete before we ship them. As a result of these and other factors, there can be no assurance that we will not experience material fluctuations in future operating results on a quarterly or annual basis. Long-term contracts are not typical for us and reductions, cancelations or delays in orders for our products could adversely affect our operating results. In certain markets where end-user demand may be particularly volatile and difficult to predict, some customers place orders that require us to manufacture product and have it available for shipment, even though the customer is unwilling to make a binding commitment to purchase all, or even any, of the product. At any given time, this situation could affect a portion of our backlog. As a result, we are subject to the risk of cancelation of orders leading to a sharp fall-off of sales and backlog. Further, those orders may be for products that meet the customer’s unique requirements so that those canceled orders would, in addition, result in an inventory of unsaleable products, resulting in potential inventory write-offs. As a result of lengthy manufacturing cycles for certain of the products subject to these uncertainties, the amount of unsaleable product could be substantial. Reductions, cancelations or delays in orders for our products could adversely affect our operating results. Our future success depends upon our ability to develop and market new products and enter new markets. Our success significantly depends on our continued ability to develop and market new products. There can be no assurance that we will be able to develop and introduce new products in a timely manner or that new 26 Table of Contents products, if developed, will achieve market acceptance. In addition, our growth is dependent on our continued ability to penetrate new markets where we have limited experience and competition is intense. There can be no assurance that the markets we serve will grow in the future, that our existing and new products will meet the requirements of these markets, that our products will achieve customer acceptance in these markets, that competitors will not force prices to an unacceptably low level or take market share from us, or that we can achieve or maintain profits in these markets. Furthermore, a decline in demand in one or several of our end-user markets could have a material adverse effect on the demand for our products and our results of operations. Also, some of our customers in these markets are less established, which could subject us to increased credit risk. We may not be able to compete successfully in the semiconductor industry in the future. Many other companies offer products that compete with our products. Some have greater financial, manufacturing, technical and marketing resources than we have. Additionally, some formerly independent competitors have been purchased by larger companies. Our competitors also include emerging companies selling specialized products to markets we serve. There can be no assurance that we will be able to compete successfully in the future against existing or new competitors, or that our operating results will not be adversely affected by increased price competition. We rely on third-party subcontractors and manufacturers for some industry-standard wafers and assembly/test services, and therefore cannot control their availability or conditions of supply. We rely, and plan to continue to rely, on assembly and test subcontractors and on third-party wafer fabricators to supply most of our wafers that can be manufactured using industry-standard submicron processes. This reliance involves several risks, including reduced control over delivery schedules, manufacturing yields and costs. Additionally, we utilize third-party wafer fabricators as sole-source suppliers, primarily Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company. These suppliers manufacture components in accordance with our proprietary designs and specifications. We have no written supply agreements with these sole-source suppliers and purchase our custom components through individual purchase orders. If these sole-source suppliers are unable or unwilling to manufacture and deliver sufficient quantities of components to us, on the time schedule and of the quality that we require, we may be forced to seek to engage additional or replacement suppliers, which could result in additional expenses and delays in product development or shipment of product to our customers. We may not be able to satisfy increasing demand for our products, and increased production may lead to overcapacity and lower prices. The cyclical nature of the semiconductor industry has resulted in sustained and short-term periods when demand for our products has increased or decreased rapidly. During these periods of rapid increases in demand, our available capacity may not be sufficient to satisfy the available demand. We, and the semiconductor industry generally, expand production facilities and access to third-party foundries in response to these periods of increased demand. These capacity expansions by us and other semiconductor manufacturers could lead to overcapacity in our target markets which could lead to price erosion that would adversely impact our operating results. Our revenue may not increase enough to offset the expense of additional capacity. We, and the semiconductor industry generally, expand production facilities and access to third-party foundries in response to periods of increased demand which can cause operating expenses to increase. Should customer demand fail to increase or should the semiconductor industry enter a period of reduced customer demand, our financial position and results of operations could be adversely impacted as a result of underutilization of capacity or asset impairment charges. 27 Table of Contents We may be unable to adequately protect our proprietary rights, which may limit our ability to compete effectively. We rely primarily upon know-how, rather than on patents, to develop and maintain our competitive position. There can be no assurance that others will not develop or patent similar technology or reverse engineer our products or that the confidentiality agreements upon which we rely will be adequate to protect our interests. Other companies have obtained patents covering a variety of semiconductor designs and processes, and we might be required to obtain licenses under some of these patents or be precluded from making and selling the infringing products, if such patents are found to be valid. There can be no assurance that we would be able to obtain licenses, if required, upon commercially reasonable terms, or at all. Moreover, the laws of foreign countries in which we design, manufacture and market our products may afford little or no effective protection of our proprietary technology. We are involved in frequent litigation regarding intellectual property rights, which could be costly to defend and could require us to redesign products or pay significant royalties. There can be no assurance that any patent will issue on pending applications or that any patent issued will provide substantive protection for the technology or product covered by it. We believe that patent and mask set protection is of less significance in our business than experience, innovation and management skill. There also can be no assurance that others will not develop or patent similar technology, or reverse engineer our products, or that our confidentiality agreements with employees, consultants, silicon foundries and other suppliers and vendors will be adequate to protect our interests. The semiconductor industry is characterized by frequent claims and litigation involving patent and other intellectual property rights, including claims arising under our contractual indemnification of our customers. We have received from time to time, and may receive in the future, claims from third parties asserting that our products or processes infringe their patents or other intellectual property rights. In the event a third party makes a valid intellectual property claim against us and a license is not available to us on commercially reasonable terms, or at all, we could be forced either to redesign or to stop production of products incorporating that intellectual property, and our operating results could be materially and adversely affected. Litigation may be necessary to enforce our patents or other of our intellectual property rights or to defend us against claims of infringement, and this litigation could be costly and divert the attention of our key personnel. See Note 11 in the Notes to our Consolidated Financial Statements contained in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for information concerning pending litigation that involves us. An adverse outcome in this or other litigation could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position or on our consolidated results of operations or cash flows in the period in which the litigation is resolved. If we do not retain our key personnel, our ability to execute our business strategy will be limited. Our success depends to a significant extent upon the continued service of our executive officers and key management and technical personnel, particularly our experienced engineers, and on our ability to continue to attract, retain, and motivate qualified personnel. The competition for these employees is intense. The loss of the services of one or more of our key personnel could have a material adverse effect on our operating results. In addition, there could be a material adverse effect on us should the turnover rates for engineers and other key personnel increase significantly or if we are unable to continue to attract qualified personnel. We do not maintain any key person life insurance policy on any of our officers or employees. We rely on manufacturing capacity located in geologically unstable areas, which could affect the availability of supplies and services. We, and many companies in the semiconductor industry, rely on internal manufacturing capacity located in California as well as wafer fabrication foundries in Taiwan and other sub-contractors in geologically unstable locations around the world. This reliance involves risks associated with the impact of earthquakes on us and the semiconductor industry, including temporary loss of capacity, availability and cost of key raw materials and equipment and availability of key services including transport. In addition, California has 28 Table of Contents experienced intermittent interruption in the availability of electricity. To date, the impact on us has been negligible. However, electricity is a critical resource for us, without which our products could not be manufactured at factories exposed to continued lengthy power interruptions. Any prolonged inability to utilize one of our manufacturing facilities as a result of fire, natural disaster, unavailability of electric power or otherwise, would have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition. We are exposed to economic, political and other risks through our significant worldwide operations. During fiscal year 2004, approximately 75% of our revenues were derived from customers in international markets. Although we engage in hedging transactions to reduce our exposure to currency exchange rate fluctuations, there can be no assurance that our competitive position will not be adversely affected by changes in the exchange rate of the United States dollar against other currencies. Potential interest rate increases, particularly in the United States and China, as well as high energy costs could have an adverse impact on industrial and consumer spending patterns and could adversely impact demand for our products. We have manufacturing facilities outside the United States in Ireland and the Philippines. In addition to being exposed to the ongoing economic cycles in the semiconductor industry, we are also subject to the economic and political risks inherent in international operations and their impact on the United States economy in general, including the risks associated with ongoing uncertainties and political and economic instability in many countries around the world as well as the economic disruption from acts of terrorism, and the response to them by the United States and its allies. These risks include air transportation disruptions, expropriation, currency controls, currency exchange rate movement, and additional costs related to tax, tariff and freight rate increases. Our future operating results are dependent on the performance of independent distributors and sales representatives. A significant portion of our sales are through independent distributors that are not under our control. These independent distributors generally represent product lines offered by several companies and thus could reduce their sales efforts applied to our products or terminate their representation of us. We generally do not require letters of credit from our distributors and are not protected against accounts receivable default or bankruptcy by these distributors. Our inability to collect open accounts receivable could adversely affect our results of operations. Termination of a significant distributor, whether at our initiative or the distributor’s initiative, could disrupt our current business. If we are unable to find suitable replacements in the event of terminations by significant distributors or sales representatives, our operating results could be adversely affected. Our manufacturing processes are highly complex and may be interrupted. We have manufacturing processes that utilize a substantial amount of technology as the fabrication of integrated circuits is a highly complex and precise process. Minute impurities, contaminants in the manufacturing environment, difficulties in the fabrication process, defects in the masks used in the wafer manufacturing process, manufacturing equipment failures, wafer breakage or other factors can cause a substantial percentage of wafers to be rejected or numerous dice on each wafer to be nonfunctional. While we have significant expertise in semiconductor manufacturing, it is possible that some processes could become unstable. This instability could result in manufacturing delays and product shortages, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial position or results of operations. ITEM 7A. QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK Interest Rate Exposure Our annual interest income would change by approximately $19 million in fiscal 2004 and $29 million in fiscal 2003 for each 100 basis point increase or decrease in interest rates. The fair values of our investment portfolio at October 30, 2004 would change by approximately $24 million for each 100 basis point increase or decrease in rates. The fair values of our investment portfolio at November 1, 2003 would not be significantly 29 Table of Contents impacted by either an increase or decrease in interest rates primarily due to the short-term nature of a major portion of our investment portfolio. Foreign Currency Exposure As more fully described in Note 2 (i) in the Notes to our Consolidated Financial Statements contained in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, we regularly hedge our non-U.S. dollar-based exposures by entering into forward exchange contracts. The terms of these contracts are for periods matching the duration of the underlying exposure and generally range from one month to six months. The short-term nature of these contracts has resulted in these instruments having insignificant fair values at October 30, 2004 and November 1, 2003. Currently, our largest foreign currency exposure is against the Euro, primarily because Europe has a higher proportion of our local currency denominated expenses. Relative to foreign currency exposures existing at October 30, 2004 and November 1, 2003, a 10% unfavorable movement in foreign currency exchange rates would not expose us to significant losses in earnings or cash flows or significantly diminish the fair value of our foreign currency financial instruments, primarily due to the short lives of the affected financial instruments that effectively hedge substantially all of our year-end exposures against fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. The calculation assumes that each exchange rate would change in the same direction relative to the U.S. dollar. In addition to the direct effects of changes in exchange rates, such changes typically affect the volume of sales or the foreign currency sales price as competitors’ products become more or less attractive. Our sensitivity analysis of the effects of changes in foreign currency exchange rates does not factor in a potential change in sales levels or local currency selling prices. 30 Table of Contents",2023-12-30 19:09:07.096450
6281,ADI,ANALOG DEVICES INC,2005,"ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (all tabular amounts in thousands except per share amounts) Results of Operations Overview Fiscal Year 2005 2004 2003 Net Sales $ 2,388,808 $ 2,633,800 $ 2,047,268 Gross Margin % 57.9 % 59.0 % 54.9 % Diluted EPS $ 1.08 $ 1.45 $ 0.78 Net Income $ 414,787 $ 570,738 $ 298,281 Net Income as a % of Sales 17.4 % 21.7 % 14.6 % Revenue declined 9% in fiscal 2005 as compared to fiscal 2004, primarily as a result of an inventory correction at our customers in the ATE, or automatic test equipment, and wireless handset markets during the fiscal year. Gross margins declined by 110 basis points primarily as a result of the effect of fixed manufacturing costs allocated across lower levels of production. We recorded special charges of $31 million in accordance with our restructuring plan announced in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2005, of which $20 million related to severance costs associated with the closure of our California wafer fabrication facility and $11 million related to severance costs associated with a reorganization of our product development and support programs. During fiscal 2005, we repatriated $1,055 million of accumulated foreign earnings. Under current tax law, the earnings repatriated prior to October 29, 2005 were taxed at a reduced effective tax rate. As a result of this action, we recorded additional income tax expenses of $49 million in fiscal 2005. We generated cash flow from operations of $673 million during fiscal 2005, repurchased $525 million of our common stock and paid $119 million in cash dividends. Our cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments balance increased by $21 million during fiscal 2005 to $2,706 million at October 29, 2005. On October 18, 2005, we accelerated the vesting of all unvested stock options granted after December 31, 2000 awarded to employees under our stock option plans that had exercise prices of $40.00 or greater. The vesting terms of options issued to corporate officers and directors were not accelerated. Unvested options to purchase approximately 18 million shares became exercisable as a result of the vesting acceleration. Because the exercise price of all the modified options was greater than the market price of our underlying common stock on the date of their modification, no compensation expense was recorded in the statement of income in accordance with APB Opinion No. 25, Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees. The primary purpose for modifying the terms of these options to accelerate their vesting was to eliminate the need to recognize the remaining unrecognized non-cash compensation expense in our statement of income associated with these options as measured under SFAS 123 (revised 2004), Share-Based Payment, which is a revision of SFAS No. 123, Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation, or SFAS 123(R). The approximately $188 million ($134 million net of tax) of future expense associated with these options would have been disproportionately high compared to the economic value of the options at the date of modification. We are required to adopt SFAS 123(R) effective as of the beginning of the first quarter of fiscal 2006 and we will be required to record compensation expense associated with stock options in the statement of income, rather than in a pro forma footnote to our consolidated financial statements. Revenue Net sales declined $245 million, or 9%, in fiscal 2005 compared to fiscal 2004. This decline was primarily the result of a 21% decrease in orders for products used in communications applications due to weakness in the wireless handset end markets. Sales to customers in the industrial market decreased 4% as a result of an inventory correction at our customers in the automatic test equipment market in the first half of fiscal 2005. Sales to customers in the computer end market decreased 10% in fiscal 2005 as compared to fiscal 2004. These decreases were partially offset by a 12% increase in sales to customers in the consumer end market. 16 Table of Contents For fiscal 2004, net sales increased $587 million, or 29%, from fiscal 2003. This increase in net sales in fiscal 2004 was a result of what we believed was a broad-based increase in demand for our products used in every end market we serve. Increased demand for our products used in industrial products and communications products accounted for approximately 80% of this year-to-year increase, and increased demand for our products used in consumer and computer end markets accounted for the remaining increase in net sales. Increased demand for our products used in wireless handsets and infrastructure was the main reason for our increased sales in the communications end market. Over the last three fiscal years, net sales from analog products were approximately 80% of net sales and sales of DSP products represented approximately 20% of net sales. In fiscal 2005, analog product sales decreased 7% and DSP product sales decreased 18% from the levels recorded in fiscal 2004. In fiscal 2004, analog product sales increased 31% and DSP product sales increased 21% from the levels recorded in fiscal 2003. The percentage of sales by geographic region, based upon point of sale, for the last three years is as follows: Fiscal Year Region 2005 2004 2003 North America 25 % 25 % 26 % Europe 23 % 20 % 21 % Japan 19 % 19 % 18 % China 11 % 14 % 11 % Rest of Asia 22 % 22 % 24 % The percentage of our net sales in China as a percentage of our total sales decreased in fiscal 2005 as compared to fiscal 2004 and increased in fiscal 2004 as compared to fiscal 2003, primarily as the result of the changes in sales into the wireless handset end markets. Gross Margin Fiscal Year 2005 2004 2003 Gross Margin $ 1,382,840 $ 1,553,801 $ 1,124,108 Gross Margin % 57.9 % 59.0 % 54.9 % Gross margin declined in fiscal 2005 by 110 basis points from the gross margin in fiscal 2004. The decline in gross margin was primarily the result of the effect of fixed manufacturing costs allocated across lower levels of production. Gross margin improved in fiscal 2004 by 410 basis points from the gross margin in fiscal 2003. The improvement in gross margin for fiscal 2004 as compared to fiscal 2003 was primarily the result of spreading fixed manufacturing costs over an increasing sales level and, to a lesser extent, the impact of restructuring actions taken in previous years as well as continued tight cost control at our manufacturing operations. Research and Development Fiscal Year 2005 2004 2003 Research and Development (R&D) Expenses $ 497,097 $ 514,442 $ 452,856 R&D Expenses as a % of Net Sales 20.8 % 19.5 % 22.1 % R&D expenses for fiscal 2005 decreased by $17 million, or 3%, from the amount recorded in fiscal 2004. This decrease was caused by a $9 million reduction in employee bonus expenses and reductions in other expenses of $21 million as a result of our tight control over all other engineering expenses throughout the year. 17 Table of Contents These expense reductions were partially offset by a $13 million increase in salary and employee benefit expenses. R&D expenses increased by $62 million, or 14% in fiscal 2004 from the amount recorded in fiscal 2003. This increase was primarily due to additional salary and benefit costs associated with a 5% increase in engineering headcount during the year as well as annual salary increases and increased bonus payments and, to a lesser extent, an increase in other engineering expenses reflecting the increased R&D activity during the year. R&D expense as a percentage of net sales will fluctuate from year-to-year depending on the amount of net sales and the success of new product development efforts, which we view as critical to our future growth. At any point in time we have hundreds of R&D projects underway, and we believe that none of these projects is material on an individual basis. We expect to continue the development of innovative technologies and processes for new products, and we believe that a continued commitment to R&D is essential in order to maintain product leadership with our existing products and to provide innovative new product offerings, and therefore, we expect to continue to make significant R&D investments in the future. Selling, Marketing, General and Administrative (SMG&A) Fiscal Year 2005 2004 2003 SMG&A Expenses $ 338,276 $ 340,036 $ 288,009 SMG&A Expenses as a % of Net Sales 14.2 % 12.9 % 14.1 % SMG&A expenses decreased in fiscal 2005 by $2 million or 1% from the levels recorded in 2004. The decrease in SMG&A expenses was caused by a reduction in employee bonus expenses of $4 million and reductions in other SMG&A expenses of $10 million as a result of tight control over all discretionary spending throughout the year. These expense reductions were partially offset by a $12 million increase in salary and employee benefit costs. SMG&A expenses increased in fiscal 2004 by $52 million, or 18%, from the levels recorded in fiscal 2003. This increase was primarily the result of increased salary and employee benefit expenses, increased employee bonus expenses, increased commission payments as a result of the 29% year-to-year increase in net sales and, to a lesser extent, increased legal costs associated with patent and intellectual property activity and other expense increases associated with selling and marketing activities. Special Charges — Fiscal 2005 Closure of Wafer Fabrication Facility — During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2005, we recorded a special charge of $20 million as a result of a decision to close our California wafer fabrication operations and transfer production to facilities located in Massachusetts and Ireland, as well as to third-party wafer fabricators. The charge was for severance and fringe benefit costs that were recorded pursuant to our ongoing benefit plan for 339 manufacturing employees and 28 general and administrative employees. As of October 29, 2005, the employment of none of these employees had been terminated. In addition to the charge recorded in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2005, we expect to incur additional expenses related to this action during fiscal 2006. These additional charges will consist of approximately $22 million of non-cash cost of sales expense for additional depreciation due to the shortened useful lives of certain manufacturing equipment, approximately $2.4 million for stay-on bonuses and approximately $6 million for estimated lease termination and clean-up costs. The closure of these facilities is expected to be completed by the end of fiscal 2006 and is estimated to result in cost savings of approximately $44 million per year beginning in fiscal 2007. These savings are expected to be realized as follows: approximately $43 million in cost of sales, of which approximately $7 million relates to non-cash depreciation savings, and approximately $1 million in selling, marketing, general and administrative expense. Reorganization of Product Development and Support Programs — During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2005, we recorded a special charge of $11 million as a result of our decision to reorganize our product 18 Table of Contents development and support programs with the goal of providing greater focus on our analog and DSP product programs. The charge was for severance and fringe benefit costs that were recorded pursuant to our ongoing benefit plan or statutory requirements at foreign locations for 60 manufacturing employees and 154 engineering and selling, marketing, general and administrative employees. As of October 29, 2005, the employment of 49 of these employees had been terminated. In addition to this charge in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2005, we expect to incur approximately $2 million of additional expenses related to this action during fiscal 2006. The additional expenses relate to facilities closure costs and estimated lease termination costs. Most of this action is expected to be completed by the end of the first quarter of fiscal 2006 and will be fully completed by the end of fiscal 2006. These organizational changes are expected to result in savings of approximately $19 million per year once fully completed by the end of fiscal 2006. These savings are expected to be realized as follows: approximately $9 million in research and development expense, approximately $6 million in selling, marketing, general and administrative expense and approximately $4 million in cost of sales. Special Charges — Fiscal 2003 Fiscal 2003 — Fourth Quarter Special Charge — During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2003, we recorded a special charge of $9.2 million as a result of a decision to close a small manufacturing facility in Belfast, Northern Ireland that supplied foundry substrate services for optical applications. The charge included $2.0 million of severance and fringe benefit costs for approximately 57 manufacturing employees and 14 engineering and administrative employees all of which had been paid by the end of the second quarter of fiscal 2004. The charge also included $6 million related to the write-down of property, plant and equipment to its fair value and $1.2 million related to the write-down of various other assets to their fair values. The closure was completed during the second quarter of fiscal 2004. Fiscal 2003 — Third Quarter Special Charge — During the third quarter of fiscal 2003, we recorded a special charge of $0.3 million. The charge included a $2.0 million write-down of equipment to fair value due to a decision to outsource the assembly of products in plastic packages, which had been done internally at our facility in the Philippines. This amount was the net book value of the assets used in plastic assembly, net of proceeds received from the sale in the third quarter of a portion of the assets. We also decided to abandon efforts to develop a particular expertise in optical communications that resulted in the write-down of $2.7 million of equipment to its fair value. During the quarter ended August 2, 2003, we determined that costs remaining to be paid for certain previous restructuring charges would be less than the amount originally recorded, and accordingly, we recorded a change in estimate reducing the restructuring accruals by $4.4 million. Operating Income Fiscal Year 2005 2004 2003 Operating income $ 515,987 $ 699,323 $ 373,709 Operating income as a % of Net Sales 21.6 % 26.6 % 18.3 % The decrease in operating income in fiscal 2005 as compared to fiscal 2004 was primarily a result of a 9% year-to-year decrease in net sales, a 110 basis point year-to-year decrease in gross margin combined with a $31 million special charge in fiscal year 2005 partially offset by operating expense decreases. The increase in operating income in fiscal 2004 as compared to fiscal 2003 was primarily a result of the 410 basis point year-to-year improvement in gross margin offset by operating expense increases that were limited to 14%, which was less than half the 29% increase in net sales for the year. 19 Table of Contents Nonoperating Income and Expense Fiscal Year 2005 2004 2003 Interest expense $ 27 $ 224 $ 32,230 Interest income $ (71,688 ) $ (36,047 ) $ (41,195 ) Other (income)/expense, net $ (42 ) $ 2,410 $ 838 The year-to-year increase in interest income in fiscal 2005 as compared to fiscal 2004 was attributable to higher interest rates as a result of actions taken by the Federal Reserve Board, as well as higher average invested cash balances. The year-to-year decrease in interest income in fiscal 2004 as compared to fiscal 2003 was attributable to lower average invested cash balances in fiscal 2004 due to the note redemption in 2003. This was partially mitigated by our decision in fiscal 2004 to increase our holdings of longer term, high-credit quality bonds, which offer higher yields than shorter-term investments, and higher interest rates later in fiscal 2004 as a result of actions taken by the Federal Reserve Board. Fiscal 2003 included interest expense for our $1,200 million 4.75% Convertible Subordinated Notes that we redeemed on October 1, 2003. Provision for Income Taxes Fiscal Year 2005 2004 2003 Provision for Income Taxes $ 172,903 $ 161,998 $ 83,555 Effective Income Tax Rate 29.4 % 22.1 % 21.9 % On October 22, 2004, the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004, or the AJCA, was signed into law. The AJCA creates a temporary incentive for US multinational corporations to repatriate accumulated foreign income by providing an 85% dividends received deduction for certain dividends from controlled foreign corporations. During fiscal 2005, we repatriated $1,055 million of accumulated foreign earnings. Under current tax law, the earnings repatriated prior to October 29, 2005 were taxed at a reduced effective tax rate. As a result of this action, we recorded additional income tax expense of $49 million in fiscal 2005. We had originally established a deferred tax asset on our consolidated balance sheet with the expectation that the officers subject to the 162(m) limitation of the Internal Revenue Code would not withdraw their balances from the Analog Devices, Inc. Deferred Compensation Plan, or the Deferred Compensation Plan, while they were still subject to the 162(m) limitation, and we would receive a tax deduction at the time of withdrawal, generally upon their retirement. Due to recent changes in tax law that were enacted as part of the AJCA, the laws associated with distributions from deferred compensation plans have changed. As a result, three executive officers who are currently subject to the 162(m) limitation have either withdrawn, or have indicated their intention to withdraw, a portion of their balances from the Deferred Compensation Plan. We incurred additional income tax expense in fiscal 2005 of $7.2 million as a result of the write-off of deferred tax assets associated with balances accumulated in our Deferred Compensation Plan. Net Income Fiscal Year 2005 2004 2003 Net Income $ 414,787 $ 570,738 $ 298,281 Net Income as a % of Net Sales 17.4 % 21.7 % 14.6 % Diluted EPS $ 1.08 $ 1.45 $ 0.78 Net income decreased by $156 million in fiscal 2005 as compared to fiscal 2004. This decrease was primarily the result of the year-to-year decrease in net sales, a $49 million tax charge related to the repatriation of foreign earnings and $31 million of special charges recorded in fiscal 2005. These decreases were partially offset by a $36 million increase in interest income. 20 Table of Contents Net income increased by $272 million in fiscal 2004 as compared to fiscal 2003. The improvement in net income in fiscal 2004 compared to fiscal 2003 was primarily due to the year-to-year increase in net sales, and, to a lesser extent, the improvement in operating income as a percentage of net sales from 18.3% recorded in fiscal 2003 to 26.6% recorded in fiscal 2004. The impact of inflation and foreign currency exchange rate movement on our business during the past three fiscal years has not been significant. Related Party Transaction One of our directors, who has been a director since 1988, became a director of Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company, or TSMC, in fiscal 2002. We purchased approximately $224 million, $337 million and $232 million of products from TSMC in fiscal years 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively. We believe that the terms and prices for the purchases of these products are at terms no less favorable than those that could be obtained from unaffiliated parties. Approximately $27 million and $15 million were payable to TSMC as of October 29, 2005 and October 30, 2004, respectively. We anticipate that we will make significant purchases from TSMC in fiscal year 2006. Liquidity and Capital Resources Fiscal Year 2005 2004 2003 Net Cash Provided by Operations $ 672,704 $ 778,045 $ 432,963 Net Cash Provided by Operations as a % of Net Sales 28.2 % 29.5 % 21.1 % During fiscal 2005, net cash provided by operations decreased by $105 million from the amount recorded in the prior year primarily due to a decline in net income of $156 million. Cash and cash equivalents increased by $109 million during fiscal 2005. This increase was the result of $673 million of cash flow from operations, $89 million in proceeds from our various employee stock programs and $70 million of cash inflows from the net change in our short-term available-for-sale investments. These cash inflows were partially offset by the repurchase of $525 million of our common stock, the payment of $119 million of cash dividends and additions to property, plant and equipment of $85 million. Cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments increased by $21 million during fiscal 2005 to $2,706 million at October 29, 2005. During fiscal 2004, net cash provided by operations increased by $345 million from the amount recorded in the prior year primarily due to the year-to-year increase in net income of $272 million. During fiscal 2004, we received $124 million in proceeds from our various employee stock programs. These cash inflows were partially offset by the repurchase of $137 million of our common stock, additions to property, plant and equipment of $146 million and our payment of cash dividends of $75 million in fiscal 2004. Cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments increased by $568 million during fiscal 2004 to $2,685 million at October 30, 2004. Fiscal Year 2005 2004 Accounts Receivable $ 320,523 $ 330,183 Days Sales Outstanding 47 48 Inventory $ 325,605 $ 348,407 Days Cost of Sales in Inventory 115 124 Accounts receivable at the end of fiscal 2005 decreased by $10 million, or 2.9%, from the amount at the end of fiscal 2004. This decrease was the result of a lower amount of shipments in the last month of the fourth quarter of fiscal 2005 as compared to the last month of the fourth quarter of fiscal 2004. Inventories decreased by $23 million, or 6.5%, and days cost of sales in inventory declined by 9 days during fiscal 2005. This decrease was the result of our aggressive management of spending related to back end 21 Table of Contents manufacturing and fabricated wafer purchases from external foundries and a modest adjustment of our internal capacity. Recent changes in tax law that were enacted as part of the AJCA, had the effect that distributions from the Deferred Compensation Plan after January 1, 2006 could be subject to more stringent tax laws. As a result, some participants have elected to withdraw, or indicated their intention to withdraw, a portion, or all, of their balance from the Deferred Compensation Plan prior to December 31, 2005. Accordingly, during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2005, $234 million of our non-current deferred compensation plan investments and the offsetting liability became current. Net additions to property, plant and equipment were $85 million in fiscal 2005, $146 million in fiscal 2004 and $68 million in fiscal 2003. Fiscal 2006 capital expenditures are expected to be approximately $126 million. During fiscal 2005, our Board of Directors declared cash dividends totaling $0.32 per outstanding share of common stock resulting in dividend payments of $119 million in fiscal 2005. The payment of future dividends, if any, will be based on several factors including our financial performance, outlook and liquidity. After the end of the fiscal year, on November 14, 2005, our Board of Directors declared a cash dividend of $0.12 per outstanding share of our common stock. The dividend is payable on December 14, 2005 to shareholders of record on November 25, 2005 and is expected to be approximately $44 million. On May 11, 2005, our Board of Directors authorized an increase in the aggregate dollar amount of common stock that may be repurchased under our share repurchase program previously adopted by our Board of Directors on August 11, 2004 from $500 million to $1 billion. We may repurchase outstanding shares of our common stock from time to time on the open market or in privately negotiated transactions. Management will determine the timing and amount of share repurchases. During fiscal 2004, we repurchased approximately $137 million of our common stock under this plan. During fiscal 2005, we repurchased approximately $525 million of our common stock under this plan. Our previous repurchase program announced on August 15, 2002 was terminated by resolution of our Board of Directors on August 11, 2004. The table below summarizes our significant contractual obligations as of October 29, 2005: Payment due by period Less than More than (thousands) Total 1 Year 1-3 Years 4-5 Years 5 Years Contractual obligations: Operating leasesa $ 84,313 $ 30,019 $ 42,516 $ 11,371 $ 407 Deferred compensation planb 277,317 234,376 1,992 992 39,957 Pension fundingc 6,536 6,536 — — — Total $ 368,166 $ 270,931 $ 44,508 $ 12,363 $ 40,364 (a) Certain of our operating lease obligations include escalation clauses. These escalating payment requirements are reflected in the table. (b) These payments relate to obligations under our Deferred Compensation Plan. The Deferred Compensation Plan allows certain members of management and other highly-compensated employees and non-employee directors to defer receipt of all or any portion of their compensation. Prior to January 1, 2005, participants could also defer gains on stock options and restricted stock granted before July 23, 1997. The payment obligations reflected in the table include the planned distributions from the Deferred Compensation Plan for the portion of the investments that participants have indicated their intention, prior to October 29, 2005, to have distributed from the Deferred Compensation Plan within a year. The amount in the “More than 5 Years” column of the table represents the remaining total balance under the Deferred Compensation Plan to be paid to participants who, prior to October 29, 2005, have not terminated employment or indicated their intention to withdraw their balances. Since we cannot reasonably estimate the timing of withdrawals for participants who have not yet terminated employment or indicated their 22 Table of Contents intention to withdraw their balances, we have included the future obligation to these participants in the “More than 5 Years” column of the table. (c) Our funding policy for our foreign defined benefit plans is consistent with the local requirements of each country. The payment obligations in the table are estimates of our expected contributions to these plans for fiscal year 2006. The actual future payments may differ from the amounts presented in the table and reasonable estimates of payments beyond one year are not practical because of potential future changes in variables such as plan asset performance, interest rates and the rate of increase in compensation levels. Purchase orders for the purchase of raw materials and other goods and services are not included in the table above. We are not able to determine the total amount of these purchase orders that represent contractual obligations, as purchase orders may represent authorizations to purchase rather than binding agreements. In addition, our purchase orders generally allow for cancellation without significant penalties. We do not have significant agreements for the purchase of raw materials or other goods specifying minimum quantities or set prices that exceed our expected short term requirements. The expected timing of payment and amounts of the obligations discussed above are estimated based on current information. At October 29, 2005, our principal source of liquidity was $2,706 million of cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments. We believe that our existing sources of liquidity and cash expected to be generated from future operations, together with anticipated available long-term financing, will be sufficient to fund operations, capital expenditures and research and development efforts for at least the next twelve months and thereafter for the foreseeable future. Off-balance Sheet Financing As of October 29, 2005, we had no off-balance sheet financing arrangements. Tentative Settlement of the SEC’s Previously Announced Stock Option Investigation In our Form 10-K filing dated November 30, 2004, we disclosed that the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) had initiated an inquiry into our stock option granting practices, focusing on options that were granted shortly before the issuance of favorable financial results. On November 15, 2005, we announced that a tentative settlement has been reached. Since receiving notice of this inquiry, we have been cooperating with the SEC and believe that the matter will be concluded in the near future. We and our President and CEO, Mr. Jerald G. Fishman, have made an offer of settlement to the Staff of the SEC, which is subject to agreement regarding the specific language of the SEC’s administrative order and other settlement documents. The SEC Staff has decided to recommend the offer of settlement to the Commission. A final settlement is subject to review and approval by the Commission. Our Board of Directors and Mr. Fishman, believe that it is in the best interests of our shareholders to settle this case on the proposed terms rather than face a protracted dispute with the SEC. The contemplated settlement addresses two separate issues. The first issue concerns our disclosure regarding grants of options to our employees and directors prior to the release of favorable financial results. Specifically, the issue relates to options granted to our employees (including officers) on November 30, 1999 and to employees (including officers) and directors on November 10, 2000. The SEC settlement would conclude that we should have made disclosures in our proxy filings to the effect that we priced these stock options prior to releasing favorable financial results. The second issue addressed by the tentative settlement concerns the grant dates for options granted to our employees (including officers) in 1998 and 1999, and the grant date for options granted to employees (including officers) and directors in 2001. Specifically, the settlement would conclude that the appropriate grant date for the September 4, 1998 options should have been September 8th (which is one trading day later than the date that was used to price the options); the appropriate grant date for the November 30, 1999 23 Table of Contents options should have been November 29th (which is one trading day earlier than the date that was used); and the appropriate grant date for the July 18, 2001 options should have been July 26th (which is five trading days after the original date). In connection with the contemplated settlement, we would consent to a cease-and-desist order under Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, would pay a civil money penalty of $3 million, and would reprice options granted to Mr. Fishman and other directors in certain years. Options granted to all other employees would be excluded from the repricing. Mr. Fishman would consent to a cease-and-desist order under Sections 17(a)(2) and (3) of the Securities Act, would pay a civil money penalty of $1 million, and would make a disgorgement payment with respect to options granted in certain years. With the exception of options granted in 1998, Mr. Fishman has not exercised or sold any of the options identified in this matter. We and Mr. Fishman would settle this matter without admitting or denying the Commission’s findings. We have determined that no restatement of our historical financial results would be necessary due to the proposed settlement, because the effects of using revised measurement dates for options granted in 1998, 1999 and 2001 are not material to any of the fiscal years 1998 through 2005, based on the materiality guidelines contained in SAB 99. If a stock-based compensation charge had been taken as a result of the revised measurement dates for these option grants to all employees (including officers) and directors, our net income for fiscal years 1998 through 2005 would have been reduced by $21.8 million in total. During this period, we earned cumulative net income of over $2.5 billion. There would be no impact on revenue, cash flow from operations, or shareholders’ equity as a result of using the revised measurement dates. The impact on net income in individual fiscal years would have been as follows: fiscal 1998 ($0.2 million), fiscal 1999 ($1.4 million), fiscal 2000 ($1.8 million), fiscal 2001 ($3.7 million), fiscal 2002 ($8.1 million), fiscal 2003 ($6.1 million), fiscal 2004 ($0.5 million). Outlook We are planning for revenue in the first quarter of fiscal 2006 to be similar to the levels recorded in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2005. With the adoption of SFAS 123(R) in the first quarter of fiscal 2006, we estimate that stock-based compensation expense will have an impact on diluted earnings per share of approximately $0.04 in the first quarter of fiscal 2006. Including this stock-based compensation expense we expect diluted earnings per share to be approximately $0.31 for the first quarter of fiscal 2006. New Accounting Pronouncements Accounting Changes and Error Corrections In May 2005, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 154, Accounting Changes and Error Corrections (SFAS 154) which supersedes APB Opinion No. 20, Accounting Changes and SFAS No. 3, Reporting Accounting Changes in Interim Financial Statements. SFAS 154 provides guidance on the accounting for and reporting of accounting changes and error corrections. It establishes, unless impracticable, retrospective application as the required method for reporting a change in accounting principle in the absence of explicit transition requirements specific to the newly adopted accounting principle. The correction of an error in previously issued financial statements is not an accounting change. However, the reporting of an error correction involves adjustments to previously issued financial statements similar to those generally applicable to reporting an accounting change retroactively. Therefore, the reporting of a correction of an error by restating previously issued financial statements is also addressed by this Statement. SFAS 154 is effective for accounting changes and corrections of errors made in fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2005. We do not expect the adoption of SFAS 154 to have a material impact on our consolidated results of operations and financial condition. Asset Retirements In March 2005, the FASB issued FASB Interpretation No. 47 (FIN 47), Accounting for Conditional Asset Retirement Obligations — an interpretation of FASB Statement No. 143. FIN 47 clarifies that the term 24 Table of Contents “conditional asset retirement obligation” as used in FASB Statement No. 143, Accounting for Asset Retirement Obligations, refers to a legal obligation to perform an asset retirement activity in which the timing and (or) method of settlement are conditional on a future event that may or may not be within the control of the entity. The obligation to perform the asset retirement activity is unconditional even though uncertainty exists about the timing and (or) method of settlement. Uncertainty about the timing and (or) method of settlement of a conditional asset retirement obligation should be factored into the measurement of the liability when sufficient information exists. FIN 47 also clarifies when an entity would have sufficient information to reasonably estimate the fair value of an asset retirement obligation. FIN 47 is effective no later than the end of fiscal years ending after December 15, 2005. We are currently analyzing FIN 47 and believe the adoption of FIN 47 will not have a material impact on our financial condition, results of operations or liquidity. Nonmonetary Assets In December 2004, the FASB issued SFAS No. 153, Exchanges of Nonmonetary Assets — an amendment of APB Opinion No. 29, (SFAS 153). SFAS 153 is based on the principle that exchanges of nonmonetary assets should be measured based on the fair value of the assets exchanged. SFAS 153 eliminates the exception for nonmonetary exchanges of similar productive assets and replaces it with a general exception for exchanges of nonmonetary assets that do not have commercial substance. SFAS 153 is effective for nonmonetary asset exchanges in fiscal periods beginning after June 15, 2005. The adoption of SFAS 153 in our fourth fiscal quarter of fiscal 2005 did not impact our financial condition, results of operations, or liquidity. Inventory Costs In November 2004, the FASB issued SFAS No. 151, Inventory Costs, an amendment of Accounting Research Bulletin (ARB) No. 43, Chapter 4 (SFAS 151). SFAS 151 amends the guidance in ARB No 43, Chapter 4, “Inventory Pricing,” to clarify that abnormal amounts of idle facility expense, freight, handling costs, and wasted material (spoilage) should be recognized as current-period charges. In addition, SFAS 151 requires that allocation of fixed production overhead to the costs of conversion be based on the normal capacity of the production facilities. The provisions of SFAS 151 are effective for fiscal years beginning after June 15, 2005. We are currently evaluating the provisions of SFAS 151 and do not believe that its adoption will have a material impact on our financial condition, results of operations or liquidity. Stock-Based Compensation On December 16, 2004, the FASB issued SFAS 123 (revised 2004), Share-Based Payment, which is a revision of SFAS No. 123, Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation (SFAS 123(R)). SFAS 123(R) supersedes APB Opinion No. 25, Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees, and amends SFAS No. 95, Statement of Cash Flows. SFAS 123(R) requires all share-based payments to employees, including grants of employee stock options, to be recognized in the income statement based on their fair values at the date of grant. Pro forma disclosure is no longer an alternative. SFAS 123(R) permits public companies to adopt its requirements using one of two methods. The “modified prospective” method recognizes compensation cost beginning with the effective date (a) based on the requirements of SFAS 123(R) for all share-based payments granted after the effective date and (b) based on the requirements of SFAS 123 for all awards granted to employees prior to the effective date of SFAS 123(R) that remain unvested on the effective date. The “modified retrospective” method includes the requirements of the modified prospective method described above, but also permits entities to restate their historical financial statements based on the amounts previously recognized under SFAS 123 for purposes of pro forma disclosures either (a) for all prior periods presented or (b) for prior interim periods of the year of adoption. As permitted by SFAS 123, we currently account for share-based payments to employees using APB Opinion No. 25’s intrinsic value method and, as such, generally recognize no compensation cost for employee stock options. Accordingly, the adoption of SFAS 123(R) will have a significant impact on our results of 25 Table of Contents operations, although it will have no impact on our overall financial position. SFAS 123(R) is required to be adopted effective at the beginning of the first quarter of fiscal 2006. We adopted SFAS 123(R) in fiscal year 2006 on October 30, 2005 using the modified prospective method. We estimate that expense related to share-based payments to employees will have an impact on diluted earnings per share of approximately $0.04 in the first quarter of fiscal 2006. Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates Management’s discussion and analysis of the financial condition and results of operations is based upon the consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. We base our estimates and judgments on historical experience, knowledge of current conditions and beliefs of what could occur in the future given available information. We consider the following accounting policies to be both those most important to the portrayal of our financial condition and those that require the most subjective judgment. If actual results differ significantly from management’s estimates and projections, there could be a material effect on our financial statements. We also have other policies that we consider key accounting policies, such as our policy for revenue recognition, including the deferral of revenue on sales to distributors until the products are sold to the end user; however, the application of these policies does not require us to make estimates or judgments that are difficult or subjective. Inventory Valuation Inventories are valued at the lower of cost (first-in, first-out method) or market. Because of the cyclical nature of the semiconductor industry, changes in inventory levels, obsolescence of technology, and product life cycles, we write down inventories to net realizable value. We employ a variety of methodologies to determine the amount of inventory reserves necessary. While a portion of the reserve is determined via reference to the age of inventory and lower of cost or market calculations, an element of the reserve is subject to significant judgments made by us about future demand for our inventory. If actual demand for our products is less than our estimates, additional reserves for existing inventories may need to be recorded in future periods. Allowance for Doubtful Accounts We maintain allowances for doubtful accounts, when appropriate, for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments. If the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate, our actual losses may exceed our estimates, and additional allowances would be required. Long-Lived Assets We review property, plant, and equipment for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of assets may not be recoverable. Recoverability of these assets is measured by comparison of their carrying value to future undiscounted cash flows the assets are expected to generate over their remaining economic lives. If such assets are considered to be impaired, the impairment to be recognized in earnings equals the amount by which the carrying value of the assets exceeds their fair market value determined by either a quoted market price, if any, or a value determined by utilizing a discounted cash flow technique. Although we have recognized no material impairment adjustments related to our property, plant, and equipment during the past three fiscal years, except those made in conjunction with restructuring actions, deterioration in our business in the future could lead to such impairment adjustments in future periods. Evaluation of impairment of long-lived assets requires estimates of future operating results that are used in the preparation of the expected future undiscounted cash flows. Actual future operating results and the remaining economic lives of our long-lived assets could differ from the estimates used in assessing the recoverability of these assets. These differences could result in impairment charges, which could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations. In addition, in certain instances, assets may not be impaired but their 26 Table of Contents estimated useful lives may have decreased. In these situations, we amortize the remaining net book values over the revised useful lives. Goodwill In June 2001, the FASB issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 142, or SFAS 142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets. As required by SFAS 142, goodwill is subject to annual impairment tests, or earlier if indicators of potential impairment exist and suggest that the carrying value of goodwill may not be recoverable from estimated discounted future cash flows. Because we have one reporting segment under SFAS 142, we utilize the entity-wide approach to assess goodwill for impairment and compare our market value to our net book value to determine if an impairment exists. These impairment tests may result in impairment losses that could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations. Accounting for Income Taxes We account for income taxes in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 109, or SFAS 109, Accounting for Income Taxes, which requires that deferred tax assets and liabilities be recognized using enacted tax rates for the effect of temporary differences between the book and tax bases of recorded assets and liabilities. SFAS 109 also requires that deferred tax assets be reduced by a valuation allowance if it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax asset will not be realized. We evaluate the realizability of our deferred tax assets quarterly. At October 29, 2005, we had gross deferred tax assets of $142 million primarily resulting from temporary differences between the book and tax bases of assets and liabilities. We have conducted an assessment of the likelihood of realization of those deferred tax assets and concluded that a $42 million valuation allowance is needed to reserve the amount of the deferred tax assets that may not be realized due to the expiration of state credit carryovers. In reaching our conclusion, we evaluated certain relevant criteria including the existence of deferred tax liabilities that can be used to absorb deferred tax assets, the taxable income in prior carryback years that can be used to absorb net operating losses and taxable income in future years. Our judgments regarding future profitability may change due to future market conditions, changes in U.S. or international tax laws and other factors. These changes, if any, may require material adjustments to these deferred tax assets, resulting in a reduction in net income or an increase in net loss in the period when such determinations are made. In addition, we have provided for potential liabilities due in various jurisdictions. Judgment is required in determining our worldwide income tax expense provision. In the ordinary course of global business, there are many transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax outcome is uncertain. Some of these uncertainties arise as a consequence of cost reimbursement and royalty arrangements among related entities. Although we believe our estimates are reasonable, no assurance can be given that the final tax outcome of these matters will not be different than that which is reflected in our historical income tax provisions and accruals. Such differences could have a material impact on our income tax provision and operating results in the period in which such determination is made. Contingencies From time to time, we receive notices that our products or manufacturing processes may be infringing the patent or intellectual property rights of others. We periodically assess each matter to determine if a contingent liability should be recorded in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 5, or SFAS 5, Accounting for Contingencies. In making this determination, we may, depending on the nature of the matter, consult with internal and external legal counsel and technical experts. Based on the information we obtain, combined with our judgment regarding all the facts and circumstances of each matter, we determine whether it is probable that a contingent loss may be incurred and whether the amount of such loss can be reasonably estimated. Should a loss be probable and reasonably estimable, we record a contingent loss in accordance with SFAS 5. In determining the amount of a contingent loss, we consider advice received from experts in the specific matter, current status of legal proceedings, settlement negotiations that may be ongoing, prior case history and other factors. Should the judgments and estimates made by us be incorrect, we may need to record additional contingent losses that could materially adversely impact our results of operations. 27 Table of Contents See Note 11 to our Consolidated Financial Statements contained in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Forward-Looking Statements This Annual Report on Form 10-K contains or incorporates forward-looking statements within the meaning of section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933 and section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. These forward-looking statements are based on current expectations, estimates, forecasts and projections about the industry and markets in which we operate and management’s beliefs and assumptions. In addition, other written or oral statements that constitute forward-looking statements may be made by or on our behalf. Words such as “expect,” “anticipate,” “intend,” “plan,” “believe,” “seek,” “estimate,” variations of such words and similar expressions are intended to identify such forward-looking statements. These statements are not guarantees of future performance and involve certain risks, uncertainties and assumptions that are difficult to predict. We have included important factors in the cautionary statements below under the heading “Factors That May Affect Future Results” that we believe could cause our actual results to differ materially from the forward-looking statements we make. We do not intend to update publicly any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise. Factors That May Affect Future Results Our future operating results are difficult to predict and may materially fluctuate. Our future operating results are difficult to predict and may be materially affected by a number of factors, including the timing of new product announcements or introductions by us or our competitors, competitive pricing pressures, fluctuations in manufacturing yields, adequate availability of wafers and manufacturing capacity, the risk that our backlog could decline significantly, our ability to hire, retain and motivate adequate numbers of engineers and other qualified employees to meet the demands of our customers, changes in product mix, and the effect of adverse changes in economic conditions in the United States and international markets. In addition, the semiconductor market has historically been cyclical and subject to significant economic downturns. Our business is subject to rapid technological changes and there can be no assurance, depending on the mix of future business, that products stocked in inventory will not be rendered obsolete before we ship them. As a result of these and other factors, there can be no assurance that we will not experience material fluctuations in future operating results on a quarterly or annual basis. Long-term contracts are not typical for us and reductions, cancelations or delays in orders for our products could adversely affect our operating results. In certain markets where end-user demand may be particularly volatile and difficult to predict, some customers place orders that require us to manufacture product and have it available for shipment, even though the customer is unwilling to make a binding commitment to purchase all, or even any, of the product. At any given time, this situation could affect a portion of our backlog. As a result, we are subject to the risk of cancelation of orders leading to a sharp fall-off of sales and backlog. Further, those orders may be for products that meet the customer’s unique requirements so that those canceled orders would, in addition, result in an inventory of unsaleable products, resulting in potential inventory write-offs. As a result of lengthy manufacturing cycles for certain of the products subject to these uncertainties, the amount of unsaleable product could be substantial. Reductions, cancelations or delays in orders for our products could adversely affect our operating results. Our future success depends upon our ability to develop and market new products and enter new markets. Our success significantly depends on our continued ability to develop and market new products. There can be no assurance that we will be able to develop and introduce new products in a timely manner or that new products, if developed, will achieve market acceptance. In addition, our growth is dependent on our continued ability to penetrate new markets where we have limited experience and competition is intense. There can be no assurance that the markets we serve will grow in the future, that our existing and new products will meet 28 Table of Contents the requirements of these markets, that our products will achieve customer acceptance in these markets, that competitors will not force prices to an unacceptably low level or take market share from us, or that we can achieve or maintain profits in these markets. Furthermore, a decline in demand in one or several of our end-user markets could have a material adverse effect on the demand for our products and our results of operations. Also, some of our customers in these markets are less established, which could subject us to increased credit risk. We may not be able to compete successfully in the semiconductor industry in the future. Many other companies offer products that compete with our products. Some have greater financial, manufacturing, technical and marketing resources than we have. Additionally, some formerly independent competitors have been purchased by larger companies. Our competitors also include emerging companies selling specialized products to markets we serve. There can be no assurance that we will be able to compete successfully in the future against existing or new competitors, or that our operating results will not be adversely affected by increased price competition. We rely on third-party subcontractors and manufacturers for some industry-standard wafers and assembly/test services, and therefore cannot control their availability or conditions of supply. We rely, and plan to continue to rely, on assembly and test subcontractors and on third-party wafer fabricators to supply most of our wafers that can be manufactured using industry-standard submicron processes. This reliance involves several risks, including reduced control over delivery schedules, manufacturing yields and costs. Additionally, we utilize third-party wafer fabricators as sole-source suppliers, primarily Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company. These suppliers manufacture components in accordance with our proprietary designs and specifications. We have no written supply agreements with these sole-source suppliers and purchase our custom components through individual purchase orders. If these sole-source suppliers are unable or unwilling to manufacture and deliver sufficient quantities of components to us, on the time schedule and of the quality that we require, we may be forced to seek to engage additional or replacement suppliers, which could result in additional expenses and delays in product development or shipment of product to our customers. We may not be able to satisfy increasing demand for our products, and increased production may lead to overcapacity and lower prices. The cyclical nature of the semiconductor industry has resulted in sustained and short-term periods when demand for our products has increased or decreased rapidly. During these periods of rapid increases in demand, our available capacity may not be sufficient to satisfy the available demand. We, and the semiconductor industry generally, expand production facilities and access to third-party foundries in response to these periods of increased demand. These capacity expansions by us and other semiconductor manufacturers could lead to overcapacity in our target markets which could lead to price erosion that would adversely impact our operating results. Our revenue may not increase enough to offset the expense of additional capacity. We, and the semiconductor industry generally, expand production facilities and access to third-party foundries in response to periods of increased demand which can cause operating expenses to increase. Should customer demand fail to increase or should the semiconductor industry enter a period of reduced customer demand, our financial position and results of operations could be adversely impacted as a result of underutilization of capacity or asset impairment charges. We may be unable to adequately protect our proprietary rights, which may limit our ability to compete effectively. We rely primarily upon know-how, rather than on patents, to develop and maintain our competitive position. There can be no assurance that others will not develop or patent similar technology or reverse 29 Table of Contents engineer our products or that the confidentiality agreements upon which we rely will be adequate to protect our interests. Other companies have obtained patents covering a variety of semiconductor designs and processes, and we might be required to obtain licenses under some of these patents or be precluded from making and selling the infringing products, if such patents are found to be valid. There can be no assurance that we would be able to obtain licenses, if required, upon commercially reasonable terms, or at all. Moreover, the laws of foreign countries in which we design, manufacture and market our products may afford little or no effective protection of our proprietary technology. We are involved in frequent litigation regarding intellectual property rights, which could be costly to defend and could require us to redesign products or pay significant royalties. There can be no assurance that any patent will issue on pending applications or that any patent issued will provide substantive protection for the technology or product covered by it. We believe that patent and mask set protection is of less significance in our business than experience, innovation and management skill. There also can be no assurance that others will not develop or patent similar technology, or reverse engineer our products, or that our confidentiality agreements with employees, consultants, silicon foundries and other suppliers and vendors will be adequate to protect our interests. The semiconductor industry is characterized by frequent claims and litigation involving patent and other intellectual property rights, including claims arising under our contractual indemnification of our customers. We have received from time to time, and may receive in the future, claims from third parties asserting that our products or processes infringe their patents or other intellectual property rights. In the event a third party makes a valid intellectual property claim against us and a license is not available to us on commercially reasonable terms, or at all, we could be forced either to redesign or to stop production of products incorporating that intellectual property, and our operating results could be materially and adversely affected. Litigation may be necessary to enforce our patents or other of our intellectual property rights or to defend us against claims of infringement, and this litigation could be costly and divert the attention of our key personnel. See Note 11 in the Notes to our Consolidated Financial Statements contained in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for information concerning pending litigation that involves us. An adverse outcome in this or other litigation could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position or on our consolidated results of operations or cash flows in the period in which the litigation is resolved. If we do not retain our key personnel, our ability to execute our business strategy will be limited. Our success depends to a significant extent upon the continued service of our executive officers and key management and technical personnel, particularly our experienced engineers, and on our ability to continue to attract, retain, and motivate qualified personnel. The competition for these employees is intense. The loss of the services of one or more of our key personnel could have a material adverse effect on our operating results. In addition, there could be a material adverse effect on us should the turnover rates for engineers and other key personnel increase significantly or if we are unable to continue to attract qualified personnel. We do not maintain any key person life insurance policy on any of our officers or employees. We rely on manufacturing capacity located in geologically unstable areas, which could affect the availability of supplies and services. We, and many companies in the semiconductor industry, rely on internal manufacturing capacity located in California as well as wafer fabrication foundries in Taiwan and other sub-contractors in geologically unstable locations around the world. This reliance involves risks associated with the impact of earthquakes on us and the semiconductor industry, including temporary loss of capacity, availability and cost of key raw materials and equipment and availability of key services including transport. Any prolonged inability to utilize one of our manufacturing facilities, or those of our subcontractors or third-party wafer-fabrication foundries, as a result of fire, natural disaster, unavailability of electric power or otherwise, would have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition. 30 Table of Contents We are exposed to economic, political and other risks through our significant worldwide operations. During fiscal year 2005, approximately 75% of our revenues were derived from customers in international markets. Although we engage in hedging transactions to reduce our exposure to currency exchange rate fluctuations, there can be no assurance that our competitive position will not be adversely affected by changes in the exchange rate of the United States dollar against other currencies. Potential interest rate increases, particularly in the United States and China, as well as high energy costs could have an adverse impact on industrial and consumer spending patterns and could adversely impact demand for our products. We have manufacturing facilities outside the United States in Ireland and the Philippines. In addition to being exposed to the ongoing economic cycles in the semiconductor industry, we are also subject to the economic and political risks inherent in international operations and their impact on the United States economy in general, including the risks associated with ongoing uncertainties and political and economic instability in many countries around the world as well as the economic disruption from acts of terrorism, and the response to them by the United States and its allies. These risks include air transportation disruptions, expropriation, currency controls, currency exchange rate movement, and additional costs related to tax, tariff and freight rate increases. Our future operating results are dependent on the performance of independent distributors and sales representatives. A significant portion of our sales are through independent distributors that are not under our control. These independent distributors generally represent product lines offered by several companies and thus could reduce their sales efforts applied to our products or terminate their representation of us. We generally do not require letters of credit from our distributors and are not protected against accounts receivable default or bankruptcy by these distributors. Our inability to collect open accounts receivable could adversely affect our results of operations. Termination of a significant distributor, whether at our initiative or the distributor’s initiative, could disrupt our current business. If we are unable to find suitable replacements in the event of terminations by significant distributors or sales representatives, our operating results could be adversely affected. Our manufacturing processes are highly complex and may be interrupted. We have manufacturing processes that utilize a substantial amount of technology as the fabrication of integrated circuits is a highly complex and precise process. Minute impurities, contaminants in the manufacturing environment, difficulties in the fabrication process, defects in the masks used in the wafer manufacturing process, manufacturing equipment failures, wafer breakage or other factors can cause a substantial percentage of wafers to be rejected or numerous dice on each wafer to be nonfunctional. While we have significant expertise in semiconductor manufacturing, it is possible that some processes could become unstable. This instability could result in manufacturing delays and product shortages, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial position or results of operations. ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK Interest Rate Exposure Our annual interest income would change by approximately $16 million in fiscal 2005 and $19 million in fiscal 2004 for each 100 basis point increase or decrease in interest rates. The fair values of our investment portfolio at October 29, 2005 and October 30, 2004 would change by approximately $14 million and $24 million, respectively, for each 100 basis point increase or decrease in rates. Foreign Currency Exposure As more fully described in Note 2 (i) in the Notes to our Consolidated Financial Statements contained in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, we regularly hedge our non-U.S. dollar-based exposures by entering into forward exchange contracts. The terms of these contracts are for periods matching the duration of the underlying exposure and generally range from one month to six months. The short-term nature of these 31 Table of Contents contracts has resulted in these instruments having insignificant fair values at October 29, 2005 and October 30, 2004. Currently, our largest foreign currency exposure is against the Euro, primarily because our European operations have a higher proportion of our local currency denominated expenses. Relative to foreign currency exposures existing at October 29, 2005 and October 30, 2004, a 10% unfavorable movement in foreign currency exchange rates would not expose us to significant losses in earnings or cash flows or significantly diminish the fair value of our foreign currency financial instruments, primarily due to the short lives of the affected financial instruments that effectively hedge substantially all of our year-end exposures against fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. The calculation assumes that each exchange rate would change in the same direction relative to the U.S. dollar. In addition to the direct effects of changes in exchange rates, such changes typically affect the volume of sales or the foreign currency sales price as competitors’ products become more or less attractive. Our sensitivity analysis of the effects of changes in foreign currency exchange rates does not factor in a potential change in sales levels or local currency selling prices. 32 Table of Contents",2023-12-30 19:08:44.869467
6281,ADI,ANALOG DEVICES INC,2006,"ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (all tabular amounts in thousands except per share amounts) This Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations contains forward-looking statements regarding future events and our future results that are subject to the safe harbors created under the Securities Act of 1933 (the “Securities Act”) and the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the “Exchange Act”). These statements are based on current expectations, estimates, forecasts, and projections about the industries in which we operate and the beliefs and assumptions of our management. Words such as “expects,” “anticipates,” “targets,” “goals,” “projects,” “intends,” “plans,” “believes,” “seeks,” “estimates,” “continues,” “may,” variations of such words and similar expressions are intended to identify such forward-looking statements. In addition, any statements that refer to projections of our future financial performance, our anticipated growth and trends in our businesses, and other characterizations of future events or circumstances are forward-looking statements. Readers are cautioned that these forward-looking statements are only predictions and are subject to risks, uncertainties, and assumptions that are difficult to predict, including those identified in Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors and elsewhere in our Annual Report on Form 10-K. Therefore, actual results may differ materially and adversely from those expressed in any forward-looking statements. We undertake no obligation to revise or update any forward-looking statements for any reason. Results of Operations Overview Fiscal Year 2006 2005 2004 Net Sales $ 2,573,176 $ 2,388,808 $ 2,633,800 Gross Margin % 58.5 % 57.9 % 59.0 % Net Income $ 549,482 $ 414,787 $ 570,738 Net Income as a % of Net Sales 21.4 % 17.4 % 21.7 % Diluted EPS $ 1.48 $ 1.08 $ 1.45 Net sales increased $184.4 million, or 8% in fiscal 2006, from the amount recorded in fiscal 2005. The increase in net sales in fiscal 2006 was offset by the impact of a $41 million decrease in sales in fiscal 2006 as compared to fiscal 2005 as a result of the loss of sales from our DSP-based DSL ASIC and network processor product line that we sold in the second quarter of fiscal 2006. Net sales declined $245 million, or 9%, in fiscal 2005 from fiscal 2004. Revenue Trends by End Market The categorization of sales by end market is determined using a variety of data points including the technical characteristics of the product, the “sold to” customer information, the “ship to” customer information and the end customer product or application into which our product will be incorporated. As data systems for capturing and tracking this data evolve and improve, the categorization of products by end market can vary over time and when 23 Table of Contents this occurs we reclassify sales by end market for prior periods. Such reclassifications typically do not materially change the sizing, or the underlying trends of results within each end market. Fiscal Year 2006 2005 2004 Industrial $ 1,083,602 $ 939,020 $ 950,659 % Total sales 42 % 39 % 36 % Y-Y 15 % (1 )% 32 % Computer $ 298,844 $ 332,062 $ 374,362 % Total sales 12 % 14 % 14 % Y-Y (10 )% (11 )% 14 % Communications $ 748,176 $ 735,743 $ 959,872 % Total sales 29 % 31 % 37 % Y-Y 2 % (23 )% 30 % Consumer $ 442,554 $ 381,983 $ 348,907 % Total sales 17 % 16 % 13 % Y-Y 16 % 9 % 34 % Total ADI $ 2,573,176 $ 2,388,808 $ 2,633,800 % Total sales 100 % 100 % 100 % Y-Y 8 % (9 )% 29 % Industrial — Revenue from products sold into the industrial end market (which includes factory automation, scientific and medical instrumentation, semiconductor automatic test equipment (ATE), defense electronics and automotive applications) increased 15% in fiscal 2006 as compared to fiscal 2005. The increase reflects a broad based increase in demand for our products across a wide range of customers in this end market. The industrial end market represented approximately 42% of our total revenue in fiscal 2006. Sales to customers in the industrial end market decreased 1% from fiscal 2004 to fiscal 2005 as a result of a decline in revenues from our customers in the automatic test equipment market in the first half of fiscal 2005. The industrial end market represented approximately 39% and 36% of our total revenue in fiscal years 2005 and 2004, respectively. Computer — Revenue from products sold into the computer end market declined 10% in fiscal 2006 as compared to fiscal 2005. The decline was primarily the result of refocusing our power management portfolio, lower sales of our personal computer audio codecs and an overall slow down in the personal computer market. The computer end market represented approximately 12% of our total revenue in fiscal 2006. Revenue from products sold into the computer end market decreased 11% in fiscal 2005 as compared to fiscal 2004. The computer end market represented approximately 14% of our total revenue in fiscal years 2005 and 2004. Communications — Revenue from products sold into the communications end market increased 2% in fiscal 2006 compared to fiscal 2005 as a result of an increase in sales of our products used in basestations. These increases were offset by decreases in wireless handset revenue and decreases in sales to networking customers. The sales decline attributable to networking customers was approximately $41 million and was the result of the loss of sales from our DSP-based DSL ASIC and network processor product line, which we sold in the second quarter of fiscal 2006. The communications end market represented approximately 29% of our total revenue in fiscal 2006. Revenue from products sold into the communications end market declined 23% in fiscal 2005 compared to fiscal 2004. The decline was primarily the result of a significant decline in revenues from wireless handset customers in fiscal 2005. The communications end market represented approximately 31% and 37% of our total revenue in fiscal years 2005 and 2004, respectively. Consumer — Revenue from products sold into the consumer end market increased 16% in fiscal 2006 as compared to fiscal 2005. The increase was primarily the result of the success of our products in digital home applications and to a lesser extent in digital cameras and a broad array of audio and video applications. The consumer end market represented approximately 17% of our total revenue in fiscal 2006. Revenue from sales in the consumer end market increased 9% in fiscal 2005 as compared to fiscal 2004. The consumer end market represented approximately 16% and 13% of our total revenue in fiscal years 2005 and 2004, respectively. 24 Table of Contents Revenue Trends by Product The following table summarizes sales trends by product categories showing what proportion of our total sales are represented by each product category as well as the annual sequential growth rates for each product category. The categorization of our products into broad categories is based on the characteristics of the individual products, the specification of the products and in some cases the specific uses that certain products have within applications. The categorization of products into categories is therefore subject to judgment in some cases and can vary over time. In instances where products move between product categories we reclassify the amounts in the product categories for all prior periods Such reclassifications typically do not materially change the sizing, or the underlying trends of results within each product category.

The wireless handset chipset sales are characterized by high sales volumes in periods of significant growth followed by periods of sales declines as demand for our product declines or shifts to our competition. Revenue Trends by Geographic Region The percentage of sales by geographic region, based upon point of sale, for the last three years is as follows: Fiscal Year Region 2006 2005 2004 North America 25 % 25 % 25 % Europe 22 % 23 % 20 % Japan 19 % 19 % 19 % China 13 % 11 % 14 % Rest of Asia 21 % 22 % 22 % There was no major shift in the distribution of revenue by geographic region in fiscal 2006 as compared to fiscal 2005. The percentage of our net sales in China as a percentage of our total sales decreased in fiscal 2005 as compared to fiscal 2004 primarily as the result of the changes in sales into the wireless handset end markets. Gross Margin Fiscal Year 2006 2005 2004 Gross Margin $ 1,506,140 $ 1,382,840 $ 1,553,801 Gross Margin % 58.5 % 57.9 % 59.0 % The increase in gross margin percentage was primarily related to the increase in utilization of our wafer fabrication facilities and increased sales of higher margin products during fiscal 2006 as compared to fiscal 2005. These increases were partially offset by stock-based compensation expense and restructuring related expenses, primarily accelerated depreciation of $18.3 million, included in cost of sales during fiscal 2006. Gross margin included an aggregate $30.3 million of stock-based compensation expense, restructuring-related and acquisition-related expenses in fiscal 2006. Gross margin declined in fiscal 2005 by 110 basis points from the gross margin recorded in fiscal 2004. The decline in gross margin was primarily the result of the effect of fixed manufacturing costs allocated across lower levels of production in fiscal 2005. Stock-based Compensation Expense During the first quarter of fiscal 2006, on October 30, 2005, we adopted the Financial Accounting Standards Board’s Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 123 (revised 2004), Share-Based Payment, or SFAS 123R, using the modified prospective application method. Compensation cost is calculated on the date of grant using the fair value of the options as calculated using the Black-Scholes valuation model. The Black-Scholes valuation model requires us to make several assumptions. One of the key assumptions is expected volatility. For options granted prior to fiscal 2005, we used historical volatility to estimate the grant-date fair value of stock options. We changed our method of estimating expected volatility for all stock options granted after fiscal 2004 from exclusively relying on historical volatility to exclusively relying on implied volatility. This change was the result of a thorough review we undertook which included consultations with several third-party advisors. We currently believe that the exclusive use of implied volatility results in a more accurate estimate of the grant-date fair value of employee stock options because it more appropriately reflects the market’s current expectations of future volatility. Historical volatility during the period commensurate with the expected term of our stock options over the past several years included a period of time during which our stock price experienced unprecedented increases and subsequent declines. We believe that this past stock price volatility is unlikely to be indicative of future stock price behavior. 26 Table of Contents As a result of adopting SFAS 123R on October 30, 2005, the Company’s income before income taxes and net income for fiscal 2006, are $73.9 million and $52.6 million lower, respectively, than if it had continued to account for share-based compensation under APB Opinion 25. Basic and diluted earnings per share for the year ended October 28, 2006 are $0.15 and $0.14 lower, respectively, than if the Company had continued to account for share-based compensation under APB Opinion 25. Prior to the adoption of SFAS 123R, we accounted for share-based payments to employees under APB Opinion No. 25, Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees, using the intrinsic value method and, as such, generally recognized no compensation cost for employee stock options. The adoption of SFAS 123R under the modified prospective application method allowed us to recognize compensation cost beginning with the effective date (a) based on the requirement of SFAS 123R for all share-based payments granted after the effective date and (b) based on the requirements of SFAS 123 for all awards granted to employees prior to the effective date of SFAS 123R that remain unvested on the effective date. Under the modified prospective application method, prior periods are not restated for the effect of SFAS 123R. We used the graded attribution method to recognize expense for all options granted prior to the adoption of SFAS 123R. Upon adoption of SFAS 123R on October 30, 2005, we switched to the straight-line attribution method to recognize expense for all grants made after October 29, 2005. The expense associated with the unvested portion of the pre-adoption grants will continue to be expensed using the graded attribution method. Prior to the adoption of SFAS 123R, on October 18, 2005, we accelerated the vesting of all unvested stock options awarded to employees after December 31, 2000 that had exercise prices of $40.00 per share or greater. Options issued to our corporate officers and directors were not accelerated. Unvested options to purchase approximately 18 million shares became exercisable as a result of the vesting acceleration. Because the exercise price of all the modified options was greater than the market price of our underlying common stock on the date of the modification, no stock-based compensation expense was recorded in the statement of income in accordance with APB Opinion No. 25. The primary purpose for modifying the terms of these out-of-the-money stock options to accelerate their vesting was to eliminate the need to recognize the remaining unrecognized non-cash compensation expense in our statement of income associated with these stock options as measured under SFAS 123, Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation, because the approximately $188 million ($134 million net of tax) of future expense associated with these options would have been disproportionately high compared to the economic value of the options at the date of modification. As of October 28, 2006, the total compensation cost related to unvested awards not yet recognized in the statement of income was approximately $156.6 million, which will be recognized over a weighted average period of 1.7 years. See Note 3 to our Consolidated Financial Statements contained in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further information regarding our adoption of SFAS 123R. Research and Development (R&D) Fiscal Year 2006 2005 2004 R&D Expenses $ 536,747 $ 497,097 $ 514,442 R&D Expenses as a % of Net Sales 20.9 % 20.8 % 19.5 % R&D expenses for fiscal 2006 increased by $39.7 million, or 8%, from the amount recorded in fiscal 2005. The increase in R&D expense was primarily the result of recognizing $33.0 million of stock-based compensation expense due to the adoption of SFAS 123R and an increase in employee bonus expense. These increases were partially offset by the savings realized from the restructuring actions we initiated in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2005 and the sale of our DSP-based DSL ASIC and network processor product line in the second quarter of fiscal 2006. R&D expenses for fiscal 2005 decreased by $17 million, or 3%, from the amount recorded in fiscal 2004. The decrease in R&D expenses was caused by a $9 million reduction in employee bonus expenses and reductions in other expenses of $21 million as a result of our tight control over all other engineering expenses throughout the year. These expense reductions were partially offset by a $13 million increase in salary and employee benefit expenses. 27 Table of Contents R&D expense as a percentage of net sales will fluctuate from year-to-year depending on the amount of net sales and the success of new product development efforts, which we view as critical to our future growth. At any point in time we have hundreds of R&D projects underway, and we believe that none of these projects is material on an individual basis. We expect to continue the development of innovative technologies and processes for new products, and we believe that a continued commitment to R&D is essential in order to maintain product leadership with our existing products and to provide innovative new product offerings, and therefore, we expect to continue to make significant R&D investments in the future. Selling, Marketing, General and Administrative (SMG&A) Fiscal Year 2006 2005 2004 SMG&A Expenses $ 394,086 $ 338,276 $ 340,036 SMG&A Expenses as a % of Net Sales 15.3 % 14.2 % 12.9 % SMG&A expenses for fiscal 2006 increased $55.8 million, or 16%, from the levels recorded in fiscal 2005. The increase in SMG&A expenses was primarily the result of recording $33.2 million of stock-based compensation expense related to the adoption of SFAS 123R and higher employee salary, employee benefit and employee bonus expenses. These increases were partially offset by savings realized from the restructuring actions we initiated in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2005 and the sale of our DSP-based DSL ASIC and network processor product line in the second quarter of fiscal 2006. SMG&A expenses for fiscal 2005 decreased by $2 million, or 1%, from the levels recorded in 2004. The decrease in SMG&A expenses was caused by a reduction in employee bonus expenses of $4 million and reductions in other SMG&A expenses of $10 million as a result of tight control over all discretionary spending throughout the year. These expense reductions were partially offset by a $12 million increase in salary and employee benefit expenses. Purchased In-process Research and Development Fiscal Year 2006 TTPCom Limited $ 5,500 Integrant 11,124 AudioAsics 5,087 Total Purchased in-Process R&D $ 21,711 We incurred charges totaling $21.7 million for the write-off of in-process technology that had not yet reached technological feasibility associated with our acquisitions in the third and fourth quarters of fiscal 2006. There were no charges for the write-off of in-process research and development in fiscal 2005 or 2004. See “— Acquisitions” below for additional information regarding these acquisitions. Special Charges — Fiscal 2005 and Fiscal 2006 Closure of Wafer Fabrication Facility During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2005, we recorded a special charge of $20.3 million as a result of a decision to close our California wafer fabrication operations and transfer virtually all of the production of products manufactured there to our facility located in Wilmington, Massachusetts. The charge was for severance and fringe benefit costs that were recorded pursuant to SFAS 88, Employers’ Accounting for Settlements and Curtailments of Defined Benefit Pension Plans and for Termination Benefits, or SFAS 88, under our ongoing benefit plan for 339 manufacturing employees and 28 general and administrative employees. The severance benefit was calculated based on length of past service, and employees must continue to be employed until they are involuntarily terminated in order to receive the severance benefit. As of October 28, 2006, 72 of these employees remained employed at our company. The employment of 42 of these employees was terminated on November 9, 2006. The remaining 30 employees will continue working over the next three months on the cleanup and closure of this wafer fabrication facility. 28 Table of Contents In addition to the charge recorded in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2005, we recorded additional expense during fiscal 2006, which consisted of $18.3 million of non-cash cost of sales expenses for additional depreciation due to shortened useful lives of certain manufacturing equipment and $2.0 million for stay-on bonuses. We reversed approximately $2.0 million of our severance accrual during fiscal 2006. The accrual reversal was required because some employees voluntarily left the company, other employees found alternative employment within the company, and there was an over accrual related to fringe benefits because severance payments, normally paid as income continuance, were paid as lump sum payments, which reduced the benefit costs associated with these payments. We ceased production at the wafer fabrication facility on November 9, 2006. We expect to incur additional expenses related to this action in the first half of fiscal 2007 of approximately $12 million for lease termination, clean-up and closure costs. In accordance with SFAS 146, Accounting for Costs Associated with Exit or Disposal Activities, the lease charge will be taken when we cease using the building and the cleanup and closure costs will be expensed as incurred. The closure of this facility is estimated to result in annual cost savings of approximately $50 million per year beginning in fiscal 2007. These annual savings are expected to be realized as follows: approximately $49 million in cost of sales, of which approximately $7 million relates to non-cash depreciation savings, and approximately $1 million in SMG&A expenses. Reorganization of Product Development and Support Programs During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2005, we recorded a special charge of $11.2 million as a result of our decision to reorganize our product development and support programs with the goal of providing greater focus on our analog and DSP product programs. The charge was for severance and fringe benefit costs that were recorded pursuant to SFAS 88 under our ongoing benefit plan or statutory requirements at foreign locations for 60 manufacturing employees and 154 engineering and selling, marketing, general and administrative employees. These employees must continue to be employed until they are involuntarily terminated in order to receive the severance benefit. As of October 28, 2006, 23 of these employees were still employed by the company. During fiscal 2006, we recorded an additional special charge of $3.8 million related to this reorganization action. Approximately $1.5 million of this charge was for lease obligation costs for a facility we ceased using during the first quarter of fiscal 2006 and the write-off of property, plant and equipment and other items. The remaining $2.3 million relates to the severance and fringe benefit costs that were recorded in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2006 pursuant to SFAS 88 under our ongoing benefit plan or statutory requirements at foreign locations for 46 engineering and selling, marketing, general and administrative employees. These employees must continue to be employed until they are involuntarily terminated in order to receive the severance benefit. As of October 28, 2006, 35 of these employees were still employed by the company. We do not expect to incur any further material charges related to this reorganization action. These organizational changes are expected to result in savings of approximately $25 million per year once fully completed by the end of the first quarter of fiscal 2007. These savings are expected to be realized as follows: approximately $14 million in R&D expenses, approximately $8 million in SMG&A expenses and approximately $3 million in cost of sales. A portion of these savings associated with the charge we recorded in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2005 have already been realized during the second half of fiscal 2006. Operating Income Fiscal Year 2006 2005 2004 Operating income $ 551,806 $ 515,987 $ 699,323 Operating income as a % of Net Sales 21.4 % 21.6 % 26.6 % The $35.8 million increase in operating income in fiscal 2006 as compared to fiscal 2005 was primarily the result of an 8% increase in net sales and a 60 basis point increase in gross margin percentage. These increases were partially offset by $73.9 million of stock-based operating expenses associated with the adoption of SFAS 123R and the $21.7 million write-off of purchased in-process research and development from our recent acquisitions. The special charges in fiscal 2006 were lower by $29.7 million from the special charges recorded in fiscal 2005. 29 Table of Contents The decrease in operating income in fiscal 2005 as compared to fiscal 2004 was primarily a result of a 9% decrease in net sales, a 110 basis point decrease in gross margin combined with a $31.5 million special charge in fiscal year 2005 partially offset by a decrease in operating expense. Nonoperating (Income) Expense Fiscal Year 2006 2005 2004 Interest expense $ 52 $ 27 $ 224 Interest income (100,169 ) (71,688 ) (36,047 ) Other (income)/expense, net (10,472 ) (42 ) 2,410 Total nonoperating income $ (110,589 ) $ (71,703 ) $ (33,413 ) Nonoperating income increased by $38.9 million in fiscal 2006 as compared to fiscal 2005. This increase was primarily the result of higher interest income, which was primarily attributable to higher interest rates in fiscal 2006 as compared to fiscal 2005. Non-operating income for fiscal 2006 also included a $13.0 million gain on the sale of our DSP-based DSL ASIC and network processor product line during the second quarter of fiscal 2006. The year-to-year increase in interest income in fiscal 2005 as compared to fiscal 2004 was primarily attributable to higher interest rates as well as higher average invested cash balances. Provision for Income Taxes Fiscal Year 2006 2005 2004 Provision for Income Taxes $ 113,661 $ 172,903 $ 161,998 Effective Income Tax Rate 17.2 % 29.4 % 22.1 % Our effective tax rate reflects the applicable tax rate in effect in the various tax jurisdictions around the world where our income is earned. The tax rate was lower in fiscal 2006 compared to fiscal 2005 primarily due to the recording of tax benefits of $35.2 million associated with the completion of an Internal Revenue Service (IRS) examination during fiscal 2006, including the reversal of penalty accruals and the filing of refund claims in other jurisdictions associated with the completion of the IRS audit. In addition, the effective tax rate was higher in fiscal 2005 as a result of our repatriation of foreign earnings and the write-off of deferred tax assets associated with balances accumulated in our deferred compensation plan as more fully described below. On October 22, 2004, the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004, or the AJCA, was signed into law. The AJCA created a temporary incentive for US multinational corporations to repatriate accumulated foreign income by providing an 85% dividends received deduction for certain dividends from controlled foreign corporations. During fiscal 2005, we repatriated $1,055 million of accumulated foreign earnings. Under current tax law, the earnings repatriated prior to October 29, 2005 were taxed at a reduced effective tax rate. As a result of this action, we recorded additional income tax expense of $49 million in fiscal 2005. We had originally established a deferred tax asset on our consolidated balance sheet with the expectation that the officers subject to the 162(m) limitation of the Internal Revenue Code would not withdraw their balances from the Analog Devices, Inc. Deferred Compensation Plan, or the deferred compensation plan, while they were still subject to the 162(m) limitation, and we would receive a tax deduction at the time of withdrawal, generally upon their retirement. Due to changes in tax law during 2005 that were enacted as part of the AJCA, the laws associated with distributions from deferred compensation plans have changed. As a result, in fiscal 2005 three executive officers who were subject to the 162(m) limitation withdrew, or indicated their intention to withdraw a portion of their balances from the deferred compensation plan. We incurred additional income tax expense in fiscal 2005 of $7.2 million as a result of the write-off of deferred tax assets associated with balances accumulated in the deferred compensation plan. 30 Table of Contents Net Income Fiscal Year 2006 2005 2004 Net Income $ 549,482 $ 414,787 $ 570,738 Net Income as a % of Net Sales 21.4 % 17.4 % 21.7 % Diluted EPS $ 1.48 $ 1.08 $ 1.45 Net income increased by $134.7 million in fiscal 2006 as compared to fiscal 2005, primarily as the result of the 8% increase in net sales, the improvement in gross margin percentage, the increase in nonoperating income and lower tax expense. This increase in net income was partially offset by a year-to-year increase in operating expenses of $87.5 million, primarily as a result of $66.2 million of stock-based operating expenses related to the adoption of SFAS 123R and $23.1 million of operating expenses related to the our acquisitions during fiscal 2006. These operating expense increases were partially offset by a $29.7 million decrease in special charges in fiscal 2006 as compared to fiscal 2005. Net income decreased by $156 million in fiscal 2005 as compared to fiscal 2004. This decrease was primarily the result of the year-to-year decrease in net sales, a $49 million tax charge related to the repatriation of foreign earnings and $31 million of special charges recorded in fiscal 2005. The decrease in net income was partially offset by a $36 million increase in interest income. The impact of inflation and foreign currency exchange rate movement on our business during the past three fiscal years has not been significant. Acquisitions In the third quarter of fiscal 2006, we completed a transaction with TTPCom Limited (TTPCom), whereby TTPCom transferred to us intellectual property, engineering resources, and related assets associated with the support and customization of TTPCom’s GSM/GPRS/EDGE modem software for use on our existing and future generations of SoftFone(R) baseband processors. We also acquired development rights for AJAR, TTPCom’s advanced applications platform. As a result of this transaction, we are the single point of contact for both hardware and software support for our new and existing wireless handset customers, thus improving our abilities to service the needs of individual customers. We paid $11.9 million in initial cash payments and may become obligated to make additional cash payments of up to an aggregate of $12 million based on the achievement of technological milestones during the period from May 2006 through November 2006. The purchase price was allocated to the tangible and intangible assets acquired based on their estimated fair values at the date of acquisition. The estimated fair values of the assets exceeded the initial payments by $7.8 million, resulting in negative goodwill. Pursuant to Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No 141, Business Combinations, we recorded a liability for the contingent consideration that will be accounted for as additional purchase price, up to the amount of the negative goodwill. As contingent payments become due, the payments will be applied against the contingent liability. Contingent payments in excess of $7.8 million, if any, will be recorded as additional purchase price. As of October 28, 2006, we had paid $6 million of contingent payments, and the remaining contingent liability was $1.8 million. The purchase price included $5.5 million of in-process technology that had not yet reached technological feasibility, had no alternative future use and was charged to operations during the third quarter of fiscal 2006. The in-process technology related to software code developed for use in our semiconductor chipsets manufactured for devices that use both the 2G and 2.5G cellular wireless technology standards. The fair value of the in-process technology was determined by a third party using the income forecast method, which is a discounted net cash flow approach. At the time of the acquisition, the in-process technology was approximately 56% complete. As of October 28, 2006, the in-process research and development projects are on schedule. We expect to complete these projects in the first quarter of fiscal 2007 and incur an additional $1.3 million of expense related to these projects. The acquisition also included $13.2 million of intangible assets that will be amortized over their estimated useful lives of five years using an accelerated amortization method that reflects the estimated pattern of economic use. In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2006, we acquired substantially all the outstanding stock of privately-held Integrant Technologies, Inc. (Integrant) of Seoul, Korea. The acquisition enabled us to enter the mobile TV market as well as strengthened our presence in the Asian region. We paid $127.2 million in initial cash payments at closing 31 Table of Contents and may be obligated to make additional cash payments of up to an aggregate of $33 million upon the satisfaction of certain conditions. The initial cash payments include $4.2 million held in escrow for the purchase of the remaining non-founder outstanding shares. The preliminary purchase price was allocated to the tangible and intangible assets acquired based on their estimated fair values at the date of acquisition. We expect to complete the purchase accounting in the first quarter of fiscal 2007 upon obtaining certain additional information. The $33 million of potential cash payments is comprised of $25 million for the achievement of revenue-based milestones that may be payable during the period from July 2006 through December 2007 and $8 million related to the purchase of shares from the founder of Integrant during the period from July 2007 through July 2009. The additional cash payments, if any, will be recorded as additional purchase price. The purchase price included $11.1 million of in-process technology that had not yet reached technological feasibility, had no alternative future use and was charged to operations during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2006. The in-process technology related to technologies currently in development for Dual DAB, T-DMB, DVB-H, RFID and WiBro applications. The fair value of the in-process technology was determined by a third-party using the income forecast method, which is a discounted net cash flow approach. At the time of the acquisition, the in-process technology was approximately 74% complete. As of October 28, 2006, the in-process research and development projects are on schedule. We expect to complete the projects in the second quarter of fiscal 2007 and incur an additional $3.3 million of expense related to these projects. The acquisition also included $21.6 million of intangible assets that will be amortized over their estimated useful lives of two to five years using an accelerated amortization method that reflects the estimated pattern of economic use. In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2006, we acquired all the outstanding stock of privately-held AudioAsics A/S (AudioAsics) of Roskilde, Denmark. The acquisition of AudioAsics allows us to continue developing our low-power audio solutions, while expanding our presence in the Nordic and Eastern European regions. We paid $19.3 million in initial cash payments at closing and may be obligated to make additional cash payments of up to an aggregate of $8 million upon the satisfaction of certain conditions. The purchase price was allocated to the tangible and intangible assets acquired based on their estimated fair values at the date of acquisition. The $8 million of potential cash payments is comprised of $4.8 million for the achievement of revenue-based milestones that may be payable during the period from October 2006 through January 2009 and $3.2 million based on the achievement of technological milestones during the period from October 2006 through January 2009. In order to be entitled to receive $2.4 million of the revenue-based contingent consideration, certain key employees must continue to be employed by us. As such, that portion of the revenue-based contingent consideration will be recorded as compensation expense when, and if, it is earned. The technological milestones require post-acquisition services to be rendered in order to be achieved and, as such, will be recorded as compensation expense when earned. The purchase price included $5.1 million of in-process technology that had not yet reached technological feasibility, had no alternative future use and was charged to operations during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2006. The in-process technology related to technologies currently in development for analog and digital microphone pre-amplifiers. The fair value of the in-process technology was determined by a third party using the income forecast method, which is a discounted net cash flow approach. At the time of the acquisition, the in-process technology was approximately 69% complete. As of October 28, 2006, the in-process research and development projects are on schedule. We expect to complete the projects by April 2007 and incur an additional $1.0 million of expense related to these projects. The acquisition also included $8.3 million of intangible assets that will be amortized over their estimated useful lives of five years using an accelerated amortization method that reflects the estimated pattern of economic use. Pro forma results of operations for TTPCom, Integrant and AudioAsics have not been provided herein as they were not material to us on either an individual or an aggregate basis. The results of operations of each acquisition are included in our consolidated statement of income from the date of such acquisition. Related Party Transaction One of our directors, who has served on our Board of Directors since 1988, became a director of Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company, or TSMC, in fiscal 2002 and continues to serve as a director of TSMC. Management believes the terms and prices for the purchases of products from TSMC are not affected by the presence of one of our directors on the Board of Directors of TSMC. We purchased approximately $281 million, $224 million and $337 million of products from TSMC in fiscal years 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively. 32 Table of Contents Approximately $17 million and $27 million were payable to TSMC as of October 28, 2006 and October 29, 2005, respectively. We anticipate that we will make significant purchases from TSMC in fiscal year 2007. Liquidity and Capital Resources Fiscal Year 2006 2005 2004 Net Cash Provided by Operations $ 621,102 $ 672,704 $ 778,045 Net Cash Provided by Operations as a % of Net Sales 24.1 % 28.2 % 29.5 % At October 28, 2006, cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments totaled $2,128 million, a decrease of $577.6 million from fiscal 2005. Our statement of cash flows reflects the impact of $181.2 million for allocating the excess tax benefit from the exercise of stock options over a period of several years between the financing and operating section of the statement of cash flows, as required by SFAS 123R. The primary sources of funds for fiscal 2006 were net cash generated from operating activities of $621.1 million (which is net of the $181.2 million of non-cash excess tax benefit discussed above), $305.6 million of cash inflows from the net change in our short-term available-for-sale investments, proceeds from the sale of a product line of $23.1 million and proceeds of $94.4 million from our various employee stock plans. The principal uses of funds during fiscal 2006 were the repurchase of approximately 30.7 million shares of our common stock for an aggregate of $1,025 million, cash dividend payments of $201.5 million, payments of $157.0 million for acquisitions and capital expenditures of $129.3 million. During fiscal 2005, net cash provided by operations decreased by $105 million from the amount recorded in fiscal 2004 primarily due to a decline in net income of $156 million. Cash and cash equivalents increased by $109 million during fiscal 2005. This increase was the result of $673 million of cash flow from operations, $89 million in proceeds from our various employee stock programs and $70 million of cash inflows from the net change in our short-term available-for-sale investments. These cash inflows were partially offset by the repurchase of $525 million of our common stock, the payment of $119 million of cash dividends and additions to property, plant and equipment of $85 million. Cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments increased by $21 million during fiscal 2005 to $2,706 million at October 29, 2005. Fiscal Year 2006 2005 Accounts Receivable $ 329,393 $ 320,523 Days Sales Outstanding 47 47 Inventory $ 378,651 $ 325,605 Days Cost of Sales in Inventory 128 115 Accounts receivable at the end of fiscal 2006 increased by $8.9 million, or 3%, from the amount at the end of fiscal 2005. This increase was the result of higher sales in the last month of the fourth quarter of fiscal 2006 as compared to the last month of the fourth quarter of fiscal 2005. Inventories at the end of fiscal 2006 increased by $53.0 million, or 16%, from the amount at the end of fiscal 2005 and days cost of sales in inventory at the end of fiscal 2006 increased by 13 days from the amount at the end of fiscal 2005. Approximately $19.0 million of this increase relates to the inventory that was built in preparation for the planned closure of our wafer fabrication facility in California and approximately $3.7 million relates to the capitalization of manufacturing related stock-based compensation expense as a result of our adoption of SFAS 123R in the first quarter of fiscal 2006. The remainder of the increase primarily relates to increased inventory to support anticipated higher sales demand. Current liabilities decreased to $490.9 million at October 28, 2006, a decrease of $328.0 million, or 40%, from $818.9 million at the end of fiscal 2005. The decrease in current liabilities was largely the result of a $233.3 million net decrease in the current portion of the deferred compensation plan liability, primarily as a result of withdrawals by plan participants in response to certain provisions of the American Jobs Creation Act, as more fully described below. Additionally, income taxes payable at October 28, 2006 decreased by a net of $111.3 million compared to the end of fiscal 2005, which was primarily as a result of recording tax deductions in 2006 for stock options exercised 33 Table of Contents over a period of several years becoming available upon the completion of the IRS examination. These decreases were partially offset by a $27.7 million increase in deferred income on shipments to distributors due to the increase in inventory held by our distributors as a result of increases in demand for our products during fiscal 2006. During fiscal 2006, we distributed $254.1 million from our amended and restated deferred compensation plan, or the Deferred Compensation Plan, as a result of participant terminations or at the direction of the participants. This amount represented compensation and/or stock option gains previously deferred by those participants pursuant to the terms of our Deferred Compensation Plan and earnings on those deferred amounts. As a result of certain provisions of the American Jobs Creation Act, participants had the opportunity until December 31, 2005 to elect to withdraw amounts previously deferred. Net additions to property, plant and equipment were $129.3 million in fiscal 2006, $85.5 million in fiscal 2005 and $146.2 million in fiscal 2004. Fiscal 2007 capital expenditures are expected to total approximately $175 million. During fiscal 2006, our Board of Directors declared cash dividends totaling $0.56 per outstanding share of common stock resulting in dividend payments of $201.5 million in fiscal 2006. The payment of future dividends, if any, will be based on several factors including our financial performance, outlook and liquidity. After the end of the fiscal year, on November 13, 2006, our Board of Directors declared a cash dividend of $0.16 per outstanding share of our common stock. The dividend is payable on December 13, 2006 to shareholders of record on November 24, 2006 and is expected to total approximately $54 million. On May 11, 2005, our Board of Directors authorized an increase in the aggregate dollar amount of common stock that may be repurchased under our share repurchase program previously adopted by our Board of Directors on August 11, 2004 from $500 million to $1 billion. On March 14, 2006, our Board of Directors authorized the repurchase by us of an additional $1 billion of our common stock, increasing the total amount of our common stock we can repurchase from $1 billion to $2 billion of our common stock. Under the repurchase program, we may repurchase outstanding shares of our common stock from time to time in the open market and through privately negotiated transactions. Unless terminated earlier by resolution of our Board of Directors, the repurchase program will expire when we have repurchased all shares authorized for repurchase under the repurchase program. During fiscal 2006, we repurchased approximately $1,025 million of our common stock under this plan. During fiscal 2005, we repurchased approximately $525.5 million of our common stock under this program. As of October 28, 2006, we had $312.4 million of authorization remaining under our repurchase program. The table below summarizes our contractual obligations as of October 28, 2006: Payment due by period Less than More than (thousands) Total 1 Year 1-3 Years 4-5 Years 5 Years Contractual obligations: Operating leasesa $ 83,634 $ 30,311 $ 39,777 $ 8,570 $ 4,976 Deferred compensation planb 31,742 1,109 2,204 — 28,429 Pension fundingc 7,497 7,497 — — — Total $ 122,873 $ 38,917 $ 41,981 $ 8,570 $ 33,405 (a) Certain of our operating lease obligations include escalation clauses. These escalating payment requirements are reflected in the table. (b) These payments relate to obligations under our deferred compensation plan. The deferred compensation plan allows certain members of management and other highly-compensated employees and non-employee directors to defer receipt of all or any portion of their compensation. Prior to January 1, 2005, participants could also defer gains on stock options and restricted stock granted before July 23, 1997. The amount in the “More than 5 Years” column of the table represents the remaining total balance under the deferred compensation plan to be paid to participants who have not terminated employment. Since we cannot reasonably estimate the timing of withdrawals for participants who have not yet terminated employment we have included the future obligation to these participants in the “More than 5 Years” column of the table. All other columns represent installment payments to be made to those employees who have retired or are on long-term disability. 34 Table of Contents (c) Our funding policy for our foreign defined benefit plans is consistent with the local requirements of each country. The payment obligations in the table are estimates of our expected contributions to these plans for fiscal year 2007. The actual future payments may differ from the amounts presented in the table and reasonable estimates of payments beyond one year are not practical because of potential future changes in variables such as plan asset performance, interest rates and the rate of increase in compensation levels. Purchase orders for the purchase of raw materials and other goods and services are not included in the table above. We are not able to determine the total amount of these purchase orders that represent contractual obligations, as purchase orders may represent authorizations to purchase rather than binding agreements. In addition, our purchase orders generally allow for cancellation without significant penalties. We do not have significant agreements for the purchase of raw materials or other goods specifying minimum quantities or set prices that exceed our expected short-term requirements. The expected timing of payments and the amounts of the obligations discussed above are estimated based on current information. At October 28, 2006, our principal source of liquidity was $2,128 million of cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments. We believe that our existing sources of liquidity and cash expected to be generated from future operations, together with anticipated available long-term financing, will be sufficient to fund operations, capital expenditures and research and development efforts for at least the next twelve months and thereafter for the foreseeable future. Off-balance Sheet Financing As of October 28, 2006, we had no off-balance sheet financing arrangements. Outlook The following statements are based on current expectations. These statements are forward looking, and actual results may differ materially. These statements do not give effect to the potential impact of any mergers, acquisitions, divestitures, or business combinations that may be announced or closed after the date of filing this report. These statements supersede all prior statements regarding business outlook made by the Company. Product sales in the first quarter of fiscal 2007 are planned to be approximately $635 to $670 million. This includes an additional week of operations as the first quarter of fiscal 2007 will have a total of 14 weeks. In addition, revenue in the first quarter of fiscal 2007 will include a $35 million one-time, non-recurring payment received by us on November 9, 2006 in exchange for licensing certain intellectual property rights to a third party. Total revenue in the first quarter of fiscal 2007 is expected to range from $670 to $705 million. Gross margin percentage is planned to be approximately 61.2% to 61.6% of revenue in the first quarter of fiscal 2007 which includes the impact of the $35 million one-time payment that has no cost of sales associated with it. Diluted EPS is planned to be approximately $0.36 to $0.42 for the first quarter of fiscal 2007. New Accounting Pronouncements Accounting for Prior Year Misstatements In September 2006, the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) issued Staff Accounting Bulletin (SAB) No. 108, Considering the Effects of Prior Year Misstatements when Quantifying Misstatements in Current Year Financial Statements (SAB 108). This SAB provides guidance on the consideration of the effects of prior year misstatements in quantifying current year misstatements for the purpose of a materiality assessment. SAB 108 establishes an approach that requires quantification of financial statement errors based on the effects of each of the company’s balance sheet and statement of operations financial statements and the related financial statement disclosures. The SAB permits existing public companies to record the cumulative effect of initially applying this approach in the first year ending after November 15, 2006 by recording the necessary correcting adjustments to the carrying values of assets and liabilities as of the beginning of that year with the offsetting adjustment recorded to the opening balance of retained earnings. Additionally, the use of the cumulative effect transition method requires detailed disclosure of the nature and amount of each individual error being corrected 35 Table of Contents through the cumulative adjustment and how and when it arose. We are currently evaluating the impact, if any, that SAB 108 may have on our financial condition, results of operations or liquidity. Accounting for Defined Benefit Pension and Other Postretirement Plans In September 2006, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standard (SFAS) No. 158, Employers’ Accounting for Defined Benefit Pension and Other Postretirement Plans — An Amendment of FASB Statements No. 87, 88, 106, and 132R (SFAS 158). SFAS 158 requires companies to recognize the funded status of pension and other postretirement benefit plans on sponsoring employers’ balance sheets and to recognize changes in the funded status in the year the changes occur. It also requires the measurement date of plan assets and obligations to occur at the end of the employers’ fiscal year. SFAS 158 is effective for us at the end of fiscal 2007, except for the change in measurement date, which is effective for us in fiscal 2008. The effect on our financial statements is dependent upon the discount rate at our fiscal 2007 measurement date (September 30, 2007) and actual returns on our pension plan assets during the year. We are currently evaluating the impact, if any, that SFAS 158 may have on our financial condition, results of operations or liquidity. Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes In June 2006, the FASB issued FASB Interpretation No. 48, Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes — an interpretation of FASB Statement No. 109 (FIN 48). FIN 48 clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in an enterprise’s financial statements in accordance with SFAS 109, Accounting for Income Taxes. FIN 48 prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. FIN 48 also provides guidance on derecognition, classification, interest and penalties, accounting in interim periods, disclosure, and transition. FIN 48 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2006. We are currently evaluating the impact, if any, that FIN 48 may have on our financial condition, results of operations or liquidity. Accounting Changes and Error Corrections In May 2005, the FASB issued SFAS No. 154, Accounting Changes and Error Corrections (SFAS 154) which supersedes APB Opinion No. 20, Accounting Changes and SFAS No. 3, Reporting Accounting Changes in Interim Financial Statements. SFAS 154 provides guidance on the accounting for and reporting of accounting changes and error corrections. It establishes, unless impracticable, retrospective application as the required method for reporting a change in accounting principle in the absence of explicit transition requirements specific to the newly adopted accounting principle. The correction of an error in previously issued financial statements is not an accounting change. However, the reporting of an error correction involves adjustments to previously issued financial statements similar to those generally applicable to reporting an accounting change retroactively. Therefore, the reporting of a correction of an error by restating previously issued financial statements is also addressed by this statement. SFAS 154 is effective for accounting changes and corrections of errors made in fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2005. The adoption of SFAS 154 during fiscal 2006 did not have a material impact on our financial condition, results of operations or liquidity. Asset Retirements In March 2005, the FASB issued FIN 47, Accounting for Conditional Asset Retirement Obligations — an interpretation of FASB Statement No. 143. FIN 47 clarifies that the term “conditional asset retirement obligation” as used in FASB Statement No. 143, Accounting for Asset Retirement Obligations, refers to a legal obligation to perform an asset retirement activity in which the timing and (or) method of settlement are conditional on a future event that may or may not be within the control of the entity. The obligation to perform the asset retirement activity is unconditional even though uncertainty exists about the timing and (or) method of settlement. Uncertainty about the timing and (or) method of settlement of a conditional asset retirement obligation should be factored into the measurement of the liability when sufficient information exists. FIN 47 also clarifies when an entity would have sufficient information to reasonably estimate the fair value of an asset retirement obligation. FIN 47 is effective no 36 Table of Contents later than the end of fiscal years ending after December 15, 2005. The adoption of FIN 47 in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2006 did not impact our financial condition, results of operations or liquidity. Inventory Costs In November 2004, the FASB issued SFAS No. 151, Inventory Costs, an amendment of Accounting Research Bulletin (ARB) No. 43, Chapter 4 (SFAS 151). SFAS 151 amends the guidance in ARB No 43, Chapter 4, “Inventory Pricing,” to clarify that abnormal amounts of idle facility expense, freight, handling costs, and wasted material (spoilage) should be recognized as current-period charges. In addition, SFAS 151 requires that the allocation of fixed production overhead to the costs of conversion be based on the normal capacity of the production facilities. The provisions of SFAS 151 are effective for fiscal years beginning after June 15, 2005. The adoption of SFAS 151 in the first quarter of fiscal 2006 did not impact our financial condition, results of operations or liquidity. Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates Management’s discussion and analysis of the financial condition and results of operations is based upon the consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue and expenses, and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. We base our estimates and judgments on historical experience, knowledge of current conditions and beliefs of what could occur in the future given available information. We consider the following accounting policies to be both those most important to the portrayal of our financial condition and those that require the most subjective judgment. If actual results differ significantly from management’s estimates and projections, there could be a material effect on our financial statements. We also have other policies that we consider key accounting policies, such as our policy for revenue recognition, including the deferral of revenue on sales to distributors until the products are sold to the end user; however, the application of these policies does not require us to make significant estimates or judgments that are difficult or subjective. Inventory Valuation Inventories are valued at the lower of cost (first-in, first-out method) or market. Because of the cyclical nature of the semiconductor industry, changes in inventory levels, obsolescence of technology, and product life cycles, we write down inventories to net realizable value. We employ a variety of methodologies to determine the amount of inventory reserves necessary. While a portion of the reserve is determined via reference to the age of inventory and lower of cost or market calculations, an element of the reserve is subject to significant judgments made by us about future demand for our inventory. If actual demand for our products is less than our estimates, additional reserves for existing inventories may need to be recorded in future periods. Allowance for Doubtful Accounts We maintain allowances for doubtful accounts, when appropriate, for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments. If the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate, our actual losses may exceed our estimates, and additional allowances would be required. Long-Lived Assets We review property, plant, and equipment and identified intangible assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of assets may not be recoverable. Recoverability of these assets is measured by comparison of their carrying value to future undiscounted cash flows the assets are expected to generate over their remaining economic lives. If such assets are considered to be impaired, the impairment to be recognized in earnings equals the amount by which the carrying value of the assets exceeds their fair market value determined by either a quoted market price, if any, or a value determined by utilizing a discounted cash flow technique. Although we have recognized no material impairment adjustments related to our property, plant, and equipment and identified intangible assets during the past three fiscal years, except those made in conjunction with restructuring actions, deterioration in our business in the future could lead to such impairment adjustments in future 37 Table of Contents periods. Evaluation of impairment of long-lived assets requires estimates of future operating results that are used in the preparation of the expected future undiscounted cash flows. Actual future operating results and the remaining economic lives of our long-lived assets could differ from the estimates used in assessing the recoverability of these assets. These differences could result in impairment charges, which could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations. In addition, in certain instances, assets may not be impaired but their estimated useful lives may have decreased. In these situations, we amortize the remaining net book values over the revised useful lives. Goodwill In accordance with SFAS 142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets, goodwill is subject to annual impairment tests, or earlier if indicators of potential impairment exist and suggest that the carrying value of goodwill may not be recoverable from estimated discounted future cash flows. Because we have one reporting segment under SFAS 142, we utilize the entity-wide approach to assess goodwill for impairment and compare our market value to our net book value to determine if an impairment exists. These impairment tests may result in impairment losses that could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations. Accounting for Income Taxes We account for income taxes in accordance with SFAS 109, Accounting for Income Taxes, which requires that deferred tax assets and liabilities be recognized using enacted tax rates for the effect of temporary differences between the book and tax bases of recorded assets and liabilities. SFAS 109 also requires that deferred tax assets be reduced by a valuation allowance if it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax asset will not be realized. We evaluate the realizability of our deferred tax assets quarterly. At October 28, 2006, we had gross deferred tax assets of $188.4 million primarily resulting from temporary differences between the book and tax bases of assets and liabilities. We have conducted an assessment of the likelihood of realization of those deferred tax assets and concluded that a $42.6 million valuation allowance is needed to reserve the amount of the deferred tax assets that may not be realized due to the expiration of state credit carryovers. In reaching our conclusion, we evaluated certain relevant criteria including the existence of deferred tax liabilities that can be used to absorb deferred tax assets, the taxable income in prior carryback years that can be used to absorb net operating losses and taxable income in future years. Our judgments regarding future profitability may change due to future market conditions, changes in U.S. or international tax laws and other factors. These changes, if any, may require material adjustments to these deferred tax assets, resulting in a reduction in net income or an increase in net loss in the period when such determinations are made. In the ordinary course of global business, there are many transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax outcome is uncertain. Some of these uncertainties arise as a consequence of cost reimbursement and royalty arrangements among related entities. Although we believe our estimates are reasonable, no assurance can be given that the final tax outcome of these matters will not be different than that which is reflected in our historical income tax provisions and accruals. Such differences could have a material impact on our income tax provision and operating results in the period in which such determination is made. Stock-Based Compensation The adoption of SFAS 123R in the first quarter of fiscal 2006 requires that stock-based compensation expense associated with stock options and related awards be recognized in the statement of income, rather than being disclosed in a pro forma footnote to the consolidated financial statements. Determining the amount of stock-based compensation to be recorded requires us to develop estimates to be used in calculating the grant-date fair value of stock options. We calculate the grant-date fair values using the Black-Scholes valuation model. The use of valuation models requires us to make estimates of the following assumptions: Expected volatility — We are responsible for estimating volatility and have considered a number of factors, including third-party estimates, when estimating volatility. For options granted prior to fiscal 2005, we used historical volatility to estimate the grant-date fair value of stock options. We changed our method of estimating expected volatility for all stock options granted after fiscal 2004 from exclusively relying on historical volatility to exclusively relying on implied volatility. This change was the result of a thorough review we undertook which 38 Table of Contents included consultations with several third-party advisors. We currently believe that the exclusive use of implied volatility results in a more accurate estimate of the grant-date fair value of employee stock options because it more appropriately reflects the market’s expectations of future volatility. Historical volatility during the period commensurate with the expected term of our stock options over the past several years included a period of time that our stock price experienced unprecedented increases and subsequent declines. We believe that this past stock price volatility is unlikely to be indicative of future stock price behavior. Options in our stock are actively traded on several exchanges. Implied volatility is calculated for the period that is commensurate with the option’s expected term assumption. Because this term often exceeds the period for which there are exchange-traded options in our stock, statistical techniques are used to derive the implied volatility for traded options with terms commensurate with the option’s expected term of five years. This calculation of implied volatility is derived from the closing prices of the Company’s stock and exchange traded options from the most recent five trading days prior to the grant date of the employee stock option. In general, the higher the expected volatility used in the Black-Scholes valuation model, the higher the grant-date fair value of the option. Expected term — We use historical employee exercise and option expiration data to estimate the expected term assumption for the Black-Scholes grant date valuation. We believe that this historical data is currently the best estimate of the expected term of a new option, and that generally, all of our employees exhibit similar exercise behavior. In general, the longer the expected term used in the Black-Scholes valuation model, the higher the grant-date fair value of the option. Risk-free interest rate — The yield on zero-coupon U.S. Treasury securities for a period that is commensurate with the expected term assumption is used as the risk-free interest rate. Expected dividend yield — Expected dividend yield is calculated by annualizing the cash dividend declared by our Board of Directors for the current quarter and dividing that result by the closing stock price on the date of grant of the option. Until such time as our Board of Directors declares a cash dividend for an amount that is different from the current quarter’s cash dividend, the current dividend will be used in deriving this assumption. Cash dividends are not paid on options, restricted stock or restricted stock units. The amount of stock-based compensation expense recognized during a period is based on the value of the portion of the awards that are ultimately expected to vest. SFAS 123R requires forfeitures to be estimated at the time of grant and revised, if necessary, in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates. The term “forfeitures” is distinct from “cancellations” or “expirations” and represents only the unvested portion of the surrendered option. We currently expect, based on an analysis of our historical forfeitures, that approximately 84% of our options will vest, and therefore have applied an annual forfeiture rate of 3.4% to all unvested options as of October 28, 2006. The 3.4% represents the portion that is expected to be forfeited each year over the vesting period, therefore, the cumulative amount, on a compounded basis, that is expected to be forfeited is approximately 16% of the aggregate options granted. This analysis will be re-evaluated quarterly and the forfeiture rate will be adjusted as necessary. Ultimately, the actual expense recognized over the vesting period will only be for those shares that vest. Contingencies From time to time, we receive notices that our products or manufacturing processes may be infringing the patent or intellectual property rights of others. We periodically assess each matter to determine if a contingent liability should be recorded in accordance with SFAS 5, Accounting for Contingencies. In making this determination, we may, depending on the nature of the matter, consult with internal and external legal counsel and technical experts. Based on the information we obtain, combined with our judgment regarding all the facts and circumstances of each matter, we determine whether it is probable that a contingent loss may be incurred and whether the amount of such loss can be reasonably estimated. Should a loss be probable and reasonably estimable, we record a contingent loss in accordance with SFAS 5. In determining the amount of a contingent loss, we consider advice received from experts in the specific matter, current status of legal proceedings, settlement negotiations that may be ongoing, prior case history and other factors. Should the judgments and estimates made by us be incorrect, we may need to record additional contingent losses that could materially adversely impact our results of operations. See Note 13 to our Consolidated Financial Statements contained in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for information regarding our commitments and contingencies. 39 Table of Contents ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK Interest Rate Exposure Our annual interest income would change by approximately $16 million in fiscal 2006 and $16 million in fiscal 2005 for each 100 basis point increase or decrease in interest rates. The fair values of our investment portfolio at October 28, 2006 and October 29, 2005 would change by approximately $6 million and $14 million, respectively, for each 100 basis point increase or decrease in rates. Foreign Currency Exposure As more fully described in Note 2 (i) in the Notes to our Consolidated Financial Statements contained in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, we regularly hedge our non-U.S. dollar-based exposures by entering into forward exchange contracts. The terms of these contracts are for periods matching the duration of the underlying exposure and generally range from one month to twelve months. The short-term nature of these contracts has resulted in these instruments having insignificant fair values at October 28, 2006 and October 29, 2005. Currently, our largest foreign currency exposure is the Euro, primarily because our European operations have a higher proportion of our local currency denominated expenses. Relative to foreign currency exposures existing at October 28, 2006, and October 29, 2005, a 10% unfavorable movement in foreign currency exchange rates would not expose us to significant losses in earnings or cash flows or significantly diminish the fair value of our foreign currency financial instruments, primarily due to the short lives of the affected financial instruments that effectively hedge substantially all of our year-end exposures against fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. The calculation assumes that each exchange rate would change in the same direction relative to the U.S. dollar. In addition to the direct effects of changes in exchange rates, such changes typically affect the volume of sales or the foreign currency sales price as competitors’ products become more or less attractive. Our sensitivity analysis of the effects of changes in foreign currency exchange rates does not factor in a potential change in sales levels or local currency selling prices. 40 Table of Contents",2023-12-30 19:08:44.742064
6281,ADI,ANALOG DEVICES INC,2007,"ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (all tabular amounts in thousands except per share amounts) This Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, including in particular the section entitled “Outlook” contains forward-looking statements regarding future events and our future results that are subject to the safe harbors created under the Securities Act of 1933 (the “Securities Act”) and the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the “Exchange Act”). These statements are based on current expectations, estimates, forecasts, and projections about the industries in which we operate and the beliefs and assumptions of our management. Words such as “expects,” “anticipates,” “targets,” “goals,” “projects,” “intends,” “plans,” “believes,” “seeks,” “estimates,” “continues,” “may,” variations of such words and similar expressions are intended to identify such forward-looking statements. In addition, any statements that refer to projections of our future financial performance, our anticipated growth and trends in our businesses, and other characterizations of future events or circumstances are forward-looking statements. Readers are cautioned that these forward-looking statements are only predictions and are subject to risks, uncertainties, and assumptions that are difficult to predict, including those identified in Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors and elsewhere in our Annual Report on Form 10-K. Therefore, actual results may differ materially and adversely from those expressed in any forward-looking statements. We undertake no obligation to revise or update any forward-looking statements for any reason. In September 2007, we entered into a definitive agreement to sell our baseband chipset business and related support operations, or Baseband Chipset Business, to MediaTek Inc. We have reflected the financial results of this business as discontinued operations in the consolidated statement of income for all years presented. The assets and liabilities of this business are reflected as assets and liabilities of discontinued operations in the consolidated balance sheets as of November 3, 2007 and October 28, 2006. Unless otherwise noted, this Management’s Discussion and Analysis relates only to financial results from continuing operations. Results of Operations Overview Fiscal Year 2007 2006 2005 Total Revenue $ 2,546,117 $ 2,342,919 $ 2,134,800 Gross Margin % 59.7 % 59.9 % 60.0 % Net income from Continuing Operations $ 500,695 $ 516,314 $ 375,944 Net income from Continuing Operations as a % of Total Revenue 19.7 % 22.0 % 17.6 % Diluted EPS from Continuing Operations $ 1.51 $ 1.39 $ 0.98 Diluted EPS $ 1.50 $ 1.48 $ 1.08 The year-to-year revenue changes by end market and product category is more fully outlined below under Revenue Trends by End Market and Revenue Trends by Product. Revenue Trends by End Market The categorization of revenue by end market is determined using a variety of data points including the technical characteristics of the product, the “sold to” customer information, the “ship to” customer information and the end customer product or application into which our product will be incorporated. As data systems for capturing and tracking this data evolve and improve, the categorization of products by end market can vary over time. When this occurs, we reclassify revenue by end market for prior periods. Such reclassifications typically do not materially change the sizing of, or the underlying trends of results within, each end market. 24 Table of Contents 2007 2006 2005 % of % of % of Total Total Total Product Product Product Revenue Revenue Y/Y% Revenue Revenue Revenue Revenue Industrial $ 1,184,891 47 % 7 % $ 1,105,261 47 % $ 952,662 45 % Communications 545,792 22 % 7 % 510,137 22 % 475,284 22 % Consumer 544,415 22 % 23 % 441,871 19 % 380,160 18 % Computer 236,019 9 % (17 )% 285,650 12 % 326,694 15 % Total Product Revenue $ 2,511,117 100 % 7 % $ 2,342,919 100 % $ 2,134,800 100 % Revenue from one-time IP license 35,000 — — Total Revenue $ 2,546,117 $ 2,342,919 $ 2,134,800 Industrial — The year-to-year increase from fiscal 2006 to fiscal 2007 was primarily the result of revenue growth in products sold into the automotive area and to a lesser extent the instrumentation portion of the industrial end market. These sales increases were partially offset by a decline in sales to automatic test equipment customers. The year-to-year increase from fiscal 2005 to fiscal 2006 was a result of a broad based increase in demand for our products across a wide range of customers in this end market. Communications — The year-to-year increase from fiscal 2006 to fiscal 2007 was the result of an increase in sales to customers in the wireless basestation and analog wireless handset end markets. The increase in sales in these end markets was partially offset by a decrease in sales to networking customers. The year-to-year increase from fiscal 2005 to fiscal 2006 was the result of an increase in sales of our products sold to customers in the wireless basestation end market and to a lesser extent, an increase in sales of our products sold into optical applications. These increases were offset by a decrease in sales to networking customers as a result of the sale of our DSP-based DSL ASIC and network processor product line, which we sold in the second quarter of fiscal 2006. Consumer — The year-to-year increase from fiscal 2006 to fiscal 2007 was primarily the result of increased sales of our products used in video game applications, advanced television systems and digital home applications. The year-to-year increase from fiscal 2005 to fiscal 2006 was primarily the result of the success of our products in digital home applications and advanced television systems and to a lesser extent in a broad array of audio and video applications. Computer — The year-to-year decreases in each of the last two fiscal years was the result of our decision to deemphasize power management products used in desktop and laptop computers. Revenue from One-Time IP License — During the first quarter of fiscal 2007, we recorded revenue of $35 million received in exchange for licensing of certain intellectual property rights to a third party. Revenue Trends by Product The following table summarizes revenue by product categories. The categorization of our products into broad categories is based on the characteristics of the individual products, the specification of the products and in some cases the specific uses that certain products have within applications. The categorization of products into categories is therefore subject to judgment in some cases and can vary over time. In instances where products move between 25 Table of Contents product categories we reclassify the amounts in the product categories for all prior periods. Such reclassifications typically do not materially change the sizing of, or the underlying trends of results within, each product category. 2007 2006 2005 % of % of % of Total Total Total Product Product Product Revenue Revenue Y/Y% Revenue Revenue Revenue Revenue Converters $ 1,106,615 44 % 8 % $ 1,023,499 44 % $ 927,711 43 % Amplifiers 557,515 22 % 5 % 532,046 23 % 445,732 21 % Power management & reference 205,497 8 % (6 )% 219,651 9 % 214,169 10 % Other analog 393,724 16 % 27 % 310,075 13 % 255,385 12 % Total analog products $ 2,263,351 90 % 9 % $ 2,085,271 89 % $ 1,842,997 86 % General purpose DSP 214,000 9 % 4 % 205,483 9 % 186,660 9 % Other DSP 33,766 1 % (35 )% 52,165 2 % 105,143 5 % Total DSP products $ 247,766 10 % (4 %) $ 257,648 11 % $ 291,803 14 % Total Product Revenue $ 2,511,117 100 % 7 % $ 2,342,919 100 % $ 2,134,800 100 % Revenue from one-time IP license 35,000 — — Total Revenue $ 2,546,117 $ 2,342,919 $ 2,134,800 The significant changes in our revenue trends by product type from fiscal 2007 to fiscal 2006, and from fiscal 2006 to fiscal 2005, were the year-to-year increases in our other analog product category, primarily as a result of increased sales of products used in video game applications and continued growth in converters and amplifiers. Sales of products in the power management and reference product category were lower in fiscal 2007 as compared to fiscal 2006 as a result of our decision to deemphasize power management products used in desktop and laptop computers. The year-to-year declines from fiscal 2006 to fiscal 2007, and from fiscal 2005 to fiscal 2006, in the DSP product category were primarily attributable to the loss of revenue from our DSP-based DSL ASIC and network processor product line that we sold in the second quarter of fiscal 2006. These decreases were partially offset by an increase in revenues from our general purpose DSP products. Revenue Trends by Geographic Region The percentage of product sales from continuing operations by geographic region, based upon point of sale, for the last three years is as follows: Fiscal Year Region 2007 2006 2005 United States 26 % 27 % 27 % Europe 24 % 24 % 25 % Japan 20 % 20 % 20 % China 13 % 11 % 9 % Rest of Asia* 17 % 18 % 19 % * The predominant countries comprising “Rest of Asia” are Taiwan and Korea. There was no major shift in the distribution of revenue by geographic region in fiscal 2007 as compared to fiscal 2006. 26 Table of Contents Gross Margin Fiscal Year 2007 2006 2005 Gross Margin $ 1,519,217 $ 1,403,166 $ 1,281,315 Gross Margin % 59.7 % 59.9 % 60.0 % Gross margin in fiscal 2007 decreased by 20 basis points from the gross margin recorded in fiscal 2006. This decrease was primarily the result of higher sales of products used in consumer electronics, which currently earn relatively lower gross margins than our average gross margin. This decrease was partially offset by the $35 million in revenue recorded in the first quarter of fiscal 2007 in exchange for licensing of certain intellectual property rights to a third party with no associated cost of sales. Fiscal year 2006 cost of sales also included approximately $20.3 million of restructuring-related expenses, of which $18.3 million was accelerated depreciation. Gross margin in fiscal 2006 decreased by 10 basis points from the gross margin recorded in fiscal 2005. This decrease was the result of recognizing $29.3 million of stock-based compensation expense, restructuring-related and acquisition-related expenses in cost of sales in fiscal 2006. The restructuring expense primarily related to accelerated depreciation of $18.3 million. These increases in expenses were partially offset by an increase in utilization of our wafer fabrication facilities and increased sales of higher margin products during fiscal 2006 as compared to fiscal 2005. Stock-based Compensation Expense During the first quarter of fiscal 2006, on October 30, 2005, we adopted the Financial Accounting Standards Board’s Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 123 (revised 2004), Share-Based Payment, or SFAS 123R, using the modified prospective application method. Compensation cost is calculated on the date of grant using the fair value of the options as calculated using the Black-Scholes option pricing model. The Black-Scholes option pricing model requires us to make several assumptions. One of the key assumptions is expected volatility. For options granted prior to fiscal 2005, we used historical volatility to estimate the grant-date fair value of stock options. We changed our method of estimating expected volatility for all stock options granted after fiscal 2004 from exclusively relying on historical volatility to exclusively relying on implied volatility. This change was the result of a thorough review we undertook, which included consultations with several third-party advisors. We currently believe that the exclusive use of implied volatility results in a more accurate estimate of the grant-date fair value of employee stock options because it more appropriately reflects the market’s current expectations of future volatility. Historical volatility during the period commensurate with the expected term of our stock options over the past several years included a period of time during which our stock price experienced unprecedented increases and subsequent declines. We believe that this past stock price volatility is unlikely to be indicative of future stock price behavior. Prior to the adoption of SFAS 123R, we accounted for share-based payments to employees under APB Opinion No. 25, Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees, using the intrinsic value method and, as such, generally recognized no compensation cost for employee stock options. The adoption of SFAS 123R under the modified prospective application method allowed us to recognize compensation cost beginning with the effective date (a) based on the requirement of SFAS 123R for all share-based payments granted after the effective date and (b) based on the requirements of SFAS 123 for all awards granted to employees prior to the effective date of SFAS 123R that were unvested on the effective date. Under the modified prospective application method, prior periods are not restated for the effect of SFAS 123R. We used the graded attribution method to recognize expense for all options granted prior to the adoption of SFAS 123R. Upon adoption of SFAS 123R on October 30, 2005, we switched to the straight-line attribution method to recognize expense for all grants made after October 29, 2005. The expense associated with the unvested portion of the pre-adoption grants continues to be expensed using the graded attribution method. Prior to the adoption of SFAS 123R on October 18, 2005, we accelerated the vesting of all unvested stock options awarded to employees after December 31, 2000 that had exercise prices of $40.00 per share or greater. The vesting of options issued to our corporate officers and directors was not accelerated. Unvested options to purchase approximately 18 million shares became exercisable as a result of the vesting acceleration. Because the exercise 27 Table of Contents price of all the modified options was greater than the market price of our underlying common stock on the date of the modification, no stock-based compensation expense was recorded in the statement of income in accordance with APB Opinion No. 25. The primary purpose for modifying the terms of these out-of-the-money stock options to accelerate their vesting was to eliminate the need to recognize the remaining unrecognized non-cash compensation expense in our statement of income associated with these stock options as measured under SFAS 123, Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation, because the approximately $188 million ($134 million net of tax) of future expense associated with these options would have been disproportionately high compared to the economic value of the options at the date of modification. Our income from continuing operations before income taxes and net income from continuing operations for fiscal 2007, are $67.0 million and $47.3 million lower, respectively, than if we had continued to account for share-based compensation under APB Opinion 25. Basic and diluted earnings per share for fiscal 2007 were $0.15 and $0.14 lower, respectively, than if we had continued to account for share-based compensation under APB Opinion 25. We expect that stock-based compensation related to our adoption of SFAS 123R will reduce diluted EPS by approximately $0.03 in the first quarter of fiscal 2008. Our income from continuing operations before income taxes and net income from continuing operations for fiscal 2006, were $69.8 million and $49.7 million lower, respectively, than if we had continued to account for share-based compensation under APB Opinion 25. Basic and diluted earnings per share for fiscal 2006 were $0.14 and $0.13 lower, respectively, than if we had continued to account for share-based compensation under APB Opinion 25. As of November 3, 2007, the total compensation cost related to unvested awards not yet recognized in the statement of income was approximately $144.5 million (before tax consideration), which will be recognized over a weighted average period of 1.7 years. See Note 3 to our Consolidated Financial Statements contained in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further information regarding our adoption of SFAS 123R. Research and Development (R&D) Fiscal Year 2007 2006 2005 R&D Expenses $ 519,315 $ 469,396 $ 438,183 R&D Expenses as a % of Product Revenue 20.7 % 20.0 % 20.5 % R&D expenses for fiscal 2007 increased by $49.9 million, or 11%, from the amount recorded in fiscal 2006. The increase in R&D expense was primarily the result of an increase in employee salary and benefit expense in fiscal 2007, primarily as a result of an increase in our employee population and to a lesser extent the impact of the extra week of operations in fiscal 2007. These increases were partially offset by lower employee bonus expense during fiscal 2007 as compared to fiscal 2006. R&D expenses for fiscal 2006 increased by $31.2 million, or 7%, from the amount recorded in fiscal 2005. The increase in R&D expense in fiscal 2006 was primarily the result of recognizing $29.6 million of stock-based compensation expense due to the adoption of SFAS 123R and an increase in employee bonus expense. These increases were partially offset by the savings realized from the restructuring actions we initiated in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2005 and the sale of our DSP-based DSL ASIC and network processor product line in the second quarter of fiscal 2006. R&D expense as a percentage of net sales will fluctuate from year-to-year depending on the amount of net sales and the success of new product development efforts, which we view as critical to our future growth. At any point in time we have hundreds of R&D projects underway, and we believe that none of these projects is material on an individual basis. We expect to continue the development of innovative technologies and processes for new products, and we believe that a continued commitment to R&D is essential in order to maintain product leadership with our existing products and to provide innovative new product offerings, and therefore, we expect to continue to make significant R&D investments in the future. 28 Table of Contents Selling, Marketing, General and Administrative (SMG&A) Fiscal Year 2007 2006 2005 SMG&A Expenses $ 393,221 $ 387,874 $ 333,091 SMG&A Expenses as a % of Product Revenue 15.7 % 16.6 % 15.6 % SMG&A expenses for fiscal 2007 increased by $5.3 million, or 1%, from the levels recorded in fiscal 2006. The increase in SMG&A expenses was primarily the result of higher employee salary and benefit expense and an extra week of operations in the first quarter of fiscal 2007. These increases were partially offset by lower employee bonus expense and $8.5 million related to the reimbursement of legal expenses we received as a result of the settlement of litigation in the second quarter of fiscal 2007. SMG&A expenses for fiscal 2006 increased by $54.8 million, or 16%, from the levels recorded in fiscal 2005. The increase in SMG&A expenses was primarily the result of recording $32.6 million of stock-based compensation expense related to the adoption of SFAS 123R and higher employee salary, benefit and bonus expenses. These increases were partially offset by savings realized from the restructuring actions we initiated in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2005 and the sale of our DSP-based DSL ASIC and network processor product line in the second quarter of fiscal 2006. Purchased In-process Research and Development Fiscal Year 2006 TTPCom Limited $ 5,500 Integrant 11,124 AudioAsics 5,087 Total Purchased in-Process R&D $ 21,711 We incurred charges totaling $21.7 million for the write-off of in-process technology that had not yet reached technological feasibility associated with our acquisitions in the third and fourth quarters of fiscal 2006. There were no charges for the write-off of in-process research and development in fiscal 2007 or 2005. See “Acquisitions” below for additional information regarding these acquisitions. Special Charges Closure of Wafer Fabrication Facility in Sunnyvale During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2005, we recorded a special charge of $20.3 million as a result of a decision to close our California wafer fabrication operations and transfer virtually all of the production of products manufactured there to our facility in Wilmington, Massachusetts. The charge was for severance and fringe benefit costs that were recorded pursuant to SFAS 88, Employers’ Accounting for Settlements and Curtailments of Defined Benefit Pension Plans and for Termination Benefits, or SFAS 88, under our ongoing benefit plan for 339 manufacturing employees and 28 general and administrative employees. The severance benefit was calculated based on length of past service, and employees had to continue to be employed until they were involuntarily terminated in order to receive the severance benefit. We completed the final cleanup and closure activities associated with this action during the second quarter of fiscal 2007. In addition to the charge recorded in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2005, we recorded additional expense during fiscal 2006, which consisted of $18.3 million of non-cash cost of sales expenses for additional depreciation due to shortened useful lives of certain manufacturing equipment and $2.0 million for stay-on bonuses. We reversed approximately $2.0 million of our severance accrual during fiscal 2006 because some employees voluntarily left the company, other employees found alternative employment within the company, and there was an over accrual related to fringe benefits because severance payments, normally paid as income continuance, were paid in lump sum payments, which reduced the benefit costs associated with these payments. We have terminated the employment of all of the remaining employees included in this action. 29 Table of Contents We ceased production at the wafer fabrication facility on November 9, 2006. During the first quarter of fiscal 2007, we recorded additional expense, in accordance with SFAS 146, Accounting for Costs Associated with Exit or Disposal Activities, which consisted of $3.2 million for clean-up and closure costs that were charged to expense as incurred and $0.4 million for lease obligation costs for a warehouse facility we ceased using during the first quarter of fiscal 2007. During the second quarter of fiscal 2007, we recorded a special charge, in accordance with SFAS 146, which included $5.0 million of expense for future lease obligation costs for the wafer fabrication facility that we ceased using during the second quarter of fiscal 2007. Also included in this special charge was $1.7 million for clean-up and closure costs that were charged to expense as incurred. The clean-up activity was completed during the second quarter of fiscal 2007, and we do not expect to incur any additional charges related to this action. The closure of this facility has resulted in annual cost savings of approximately $50 million per year beginning in fiscal 2007. These annual savings include: approximately $49 million in cost of sales, of which approximately $7 million relates to non-cash depreciation savings, and approximately $1 million in SMG&A expenses. At current demand levels, if this facility were still in operation, the capacity of the facility would be largely underutilized resulting in significant adverse manufacturing variances associated with the underutilization of our wafer fabrication facilities. Reorganization of Product Development and Support Programs During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2005, we recorded a special charge of $11.2 million as a result of our decision to reorganize our product development and support programs with the goal of providing greater focus on our analog and digital signal processing product programs. The charge was for severance and fringe benefit costs that were recorded pursuant to SFAS 88 under our ongoing benefit plan or statutory requirements at foreign locations for 60 manufacturing employees and 154 engineering and selling, marketing, general and administrative employees. During fiscal 2006, we recorded an additional special charge of $3.8 million related to this reorganization action. Approximately $1.5 million of this charge was for lease obligation costs for a facility we ceased using during the first quarter of fiscal 2006 and the write-off of property, plant and equipment and other items at this facility. The remaining $2.3 million related to the severance and fringe benefit costs that were recorded in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2006 pursuant to SFAS 88 under our ongoing benefit plan or statutory requirements at foreign locations for 46 engineering and selling, marketing, general and administrative employees. During the first quarter of fiscal 2007, we recorded an additional special charge of $1.6 million related to this reorganization action. Approximately $0.6 million of this charge was for contract termination costs. The remaining $1.0 million relates to severance and fringe benefit costs recorded pursuant to SFAS 88 under our ongoing benefit plan for six engineering employees. During the second quarter of fiscal 2007, we recorded an additional special charge of $3.4 million related to this reorganization action. Approximately $3.2 million relates to the severance and fringe benefit costs recorded pursuant to SFAS 88 under our ongoing benefit plan or minimum statutory requirements at foreign locations for 20 engineering and selling, marketing, general and administrative employees. The remaining $0.2 million of this charge was for lease obligation costs for a facility we ceased using during the second quarter of fiscal 2007. During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2007, we reversed approximately $0.9 million of our severance accrual because some employees voluntarily left the company and other employees found alternative employment within the company, and were therefore no longer entitled to severance payments. The employment of all employees included in this action has been terminated. We do not expect to incur any further charges related to this reorganization action. These organizational changes, which were fully implemented in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2007, are expected to result in savings of approximately $30 million per year. These savings are expected to be realized as follows: approximately $17 million in R&D expenses, approximately $10 million in SMG&A expenses and approximately $3 million in cost of sales. A portion of these savings associated with these charges is reflected in our fiscal 2007 results. 30 Table of Contents Fourth Quarter of Fiscal 2007 Special Charges Consolidation of a Wafer Fabrication Facility in Limerick During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2007, we recorded a special charge of $13.7 million as a result of our decision to focus the wafer fabrication capacity at our Limerick facility on eight-inch technology. Certain manufacturing processes and products produced on our six-inch production line will transition to our existing eight-inch production line in Limerick while others will transition to external foundries. The charge is for severance and fringe benefit costs recorded pursuant to SFAS 88 under our ongoing benefit plan for 150 manufacturing employees. Production is expected to cease in the six-inch wafer fabrication facility during the first half of 2009, and the affected employees will be terminated. These employees must continue to be employed until their employment is involuntarily terminated in order to receive the severance benefit. We expect to incur additional expenses related to this action during fiscal year 2009 of approximately $6 million related to cleanup and closure costs. In accordance with SFAS 146, these costs will be expensed as incurred. The closure of this facility is estimated to result in annual cost savings of approximately $25 million per year, expected to start during the second quarter of fiscal 2009. These annual savings will be in cost of sales, of which approximately $1 million relates to non-cash depreciation savings. Reduction of Overhead Infrastructure Costs During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2007, we decided to either deemphasize or exit certain businesses or products and focus investments in products and end markets where we have better opportunities for profitable growth. In September 2007, we entered into a definitive agreement to sell our Baseband Chipset Business. As a result of these decisions, we decided to reduce the support infrastructure in manufacturing, engineering and SMG&A to more appropriately reflect our required overhead structure. Consequently, we recorded a special charge of $12.3 million, of which $10.7 million is for severance and fringe benefit costs recorded pursuant to SFAS 88 under our ongoing benefit plan or statutory requirements at foreign locations for 25 manufacturing employees and 127 engineering and selling, marketing, general and administrative employees. The remaining $1.6 million is for contract termination costs related to a license agreement associated with products we will no longer develop and for which there is no future alternative use. As of November 3, 2007, 77 of the 152 employees included in this cost reduction action were still employed by us. These employees must continue to be employed until their employment is involuntarily terminated in order to receive the severance benefit. These cost reduction actions are expected to result in savings of approximately $15 million per year once substantially completed in the second quarter of fiscal 2008. These savings are expected to be realized as follows: approximately $7 million in R&D expenses, approximately $6 million in SMG&A expenses and approximately $2 million in cost of sales. Operating Income from Continuing Operations Fiscal Year 2007 2006 2005 Operating income from Continuing Operations $ 566,186 $ 522,395 $ 478,561 Operating income from Continuing Operations as a % of Total Revenue 22.2 % 22.3 % 22.4 % Operating income increased by $43.8 million, or 8%, in fiscal 2007 as compared to fiscal 2006. This increase was the result of a $203.2 million increase in revenue, which was offset by a 0.2% reduction in gross margin percentage and a $72.3 million increase in operating expenses as more fully described above under the headings Research and Development and Selling, Marketing, General and Administrative, Special Charges and Purchased In-process Research and Development. The $43.8 million, or 9%, increase in operating income in fiscal 2006 as compared to fiscal 2005 was primarily the result of a 10% increase in revenue. This increase was partially offset by $69.8 million of stock-based operating expenses associated with the adoption of SFAS 123R and the $21.7 million write-off of purchased in-process research and development as a result of our fiscal 2006 acquisitions. In addition, the special charges in fiscal 2006 were lower by $29.7 million than the special charges recorded in fiscal 2005. 31 Table of Contents Nonoperating (Income) Expense Fiscal Year 2007 2006 2005 Interest expense $ — $ 52 $ 27 Interest income (77,007 ) (100,169 ) (71,688 ) Other, net (15,727 ) (10,472 ) (42 ) Total nonoperating income $ (92,734 ) $ (110,589 ) $ (71,703 ) The $17.9 million decrease in nonoperating income in fiscal 2007 as compared to fiscal 2006 was a result of lower invested cash balances that were partially offset by the higher interest rates in fiscal 2007 as compared to fiscal 2006. This decrease in interest income was partially offset by a $7.9 million gain from the sale of an investment and a $10.5 million settlement we received in fiscal 2007. In fiscal 2006, we also recognized a $13.0 million gain on the sale of our DSP-based DSL ASIC and network processor product line. Nonoperating income increased by $38.9 million in fiscal 2006 as compared to fiscal 2005. This increase was primarily the result of higher interest income, which was primarily attributable to higher interest rates in fiscal 2006 as compared to fiscal 2005. Nonoperating income for fiscal 2006 also included a $13.0 million gain on the sale of our DSP-based DSL ASIC and network processor product line during the second quarter of fiscal 2006. Provision for Income Taxes Fiscal Year 2007 2006 2005 Provision for Income Taxes $ 158,444 $ 117,418 $ 174,320 Effective Income Tax Rate 24.0 % 18.5 % 31.7 % Our effective tax rate reflects the applicable tax rate in effect in the various tax jurisdictions around the world where our income is earned. Our effective tax rate for fiscal 2007 was higher by 550 basis points compared to our effective tax rate for fiscal 2006. This increase was primarily attributable to the recording of tax benefits of $35.2 million associated with the completion of an Internal Revenue Service, or IRS, examination during fiscal 2006, including the reversal of penalty accruals and the filing of refund claims in other jurisdictions associated with the completion of the IRS audit. The increase was also attributable to the following fiscal 2007 transactions, which were taxed at the higher U.S. tax rate: the one-time receipt of $35 million associated with the licensing of intellectual property to a third party, the gain on the sale of an investment of $7.9 million and the $19 million received from the settlement of litigation. In addition, we recorded an additional $4.4 million of taxes and penalties in fiscal 2007 for proposed adjustments related to the IRS examination of fiscal 2005 and fiscal 2004 and a $5.6 million tax adjustment related to the finalization of the accounting associated with a fiscal 2006 acquisition. These items were partially offset by a tax benefit of $4.7 million from the reinstatement of the U.S. federal research and development tax credit in fiscal 2007 and a $9.9 million cumulative adjustment recorded in fiscal 2007 related to the application of this credit to a portion of our fiscal 2006 results. The tax rate was lower in fiscal 2006 as compared to fiscal 2005 primarily due to the recording of tax benefits of $35.2 million associated with the completion of an IRS examination during fiscal 2006, including the reversal of penalty accruals and the filing of refund claims in other jurisdictions associated with the completion of the IRS audit. In addition, the effective tax rate was higher in fiscal 2005 as a result of our repatriation of foreign earnings and the write-off of deferred tax assets associated with balances accumulated in our deferred compensation plan as more fully described below. On October 22, 2004, the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004, or the AJCA, was signed into law. The AJCA created a temporary incentive for U.S. multinational corporations to repatriate accumulated foreign income by providing an 85% dividends received deduction for certain dividends from controlled foreign corporations. During fiscal 2005, we repatriated $1,055 million of accumulated foreign earnings, taking the benefit of current tax law allowing for earnings repatriated prior to October 29, 2005 to be taxed at a reduced effective tax rate. In connection with the repatriation of earnings, we recorded additional income tax expense of $49 million in fiscal 2005. 32 Table of Contents We had originally established a deferred tax asset on our consolidated balance sheet with the expectation that the officers subject to the 162(m) limitation of the Internal Revenue Code would not withdraw their balances from the Analog Devices, Inc. Deferred Compensation Plan, or the deferred compensation plan, while they were still subject to the 162(m) limitation, and we would receive a tax deduction at the time of withdrawal, generally upon their retirement. Due to changes in tax law during 2005 that were enacted as part of the AJCA, the laws associated with distributions from deferred compensation plans changed. In fiscal 2005 three executive officers who were subject to the 162(m) limitation withdrew, or indicated their intention to withdraw a portion of their balances from the deferred compensation plan. As a result, we incurred additional income tax expense in fiscal 2005 of $7.2 million due to the write-off of deferred tax assets associated with balances accumulated in the deferred compensation plan. Net Income from Continuing Operations Fiscal Year 2007 2006 2005 Net income from Continuing Operations $ 500,695 $ 516,314 $ 375,944 Net income from Continuing Operations as a % of Total Revenue 19.7 % 22.0 % 17.6 % Diluted EPS from Continuing Operations $ 1.51 $ 1.39 $ 0.98 Net income from continuing operations was lower in fiscal 2007 than in fiscal 2006 by approximately $15.6 million primarily as a result of the $17.9 million decrease in nonoperating income and the impact of a higher effective income tax rate in fiscal 2007, partially offset by the $43.8 million increase in operating income from continuing operations. Net income from continuing operations increased by $140.4 million in fiscal 2006 as compared to fiscal 2005, primarily as the result of the 10% increase in revenue, the increase in nonoperating income and lower tax expense. This increase in net income was partially offset by a year-to-year increase in operating expenses of $78.0 million, primarily as a result of $62.2 million of stock-based operating expenses related to the adoption of SFAS 123R and $22.2 million of operating expenses related to our acquisitions during fiscal 2006. These operating expense increases were partially offset by a $29.7 million decrease in special charges in fiscal 2006 as compared to fiscal 2005. The impact of inflation and foreign currency exchange rate movement on our business during the past three fiscal years has not been significant. Discontinued Operations Fiscal Year 2007 2006 2005 Net (loss) income from discontinued operations $ (3,788 ) $ 33,168 $ 38,843 Diluted (loss) earnings per share from discontinued operations $ (0.01 ) $ 0.09 $ 0.10 We entered into a definitive agreement in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2007 to sell our Baseband Chipset Business to MediaTek Inc. Accordingly, these operations have been presented as a discontinued operation within the consolidated financial statements in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 144, Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets (SFAS 144). We expect to record a gain from the sale of this business upon the completion of the sale in the first quarter of fiscal 2008. We estimate this gain after taxes will be in the range of $150 million to $160 million. Acquisitions In the third quarter of fiscal 2006, we completed a transaction with TTPCom Limited (TTPCom), whereby TTPCom transferred to us intellectual property, engineering resources, and related assets associated with the support and customization of TTPCom’s GSM/GPRS/EDGE modem software for use on our existing and future generations of SoftFone® baseband processors. We also acquired development rights for AJAR, TTPCom’s advanced applications platform. As a result of this transaction, we became the single point of contact for both hardware and software support for our new and existing wireless handset customers, thus improving our abilities to 33 Table of Contents service the needs of individual customers. We paid TTPCom $11.9 million in initial cash payments. The purchase price was allocated to the tangible and intangible assets acquired based on their estimated fair values at the date of acquisition. The estimated fair values of the assets exceeded the initial payments by $7.8 million, resulting in negative goodwill. Pursuant to Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No 141, Business Combinations, we recorded a liability for the contingent consideration that will be accounted for as additional purchase price, up to the amount of the negative goodwill. As contingent payments became due, the payments were applied against the contingent liability. As of October 28, 2006, we had paid $6 million of contingent payments and the remaining contingent liability was $1.8 million. The purchase price included $5.5 million of in-process technology that had not yet reached technological feasibility, had no alternative future use and was charged to operations during the third quarter of fiscal 2006. The in-process technology related to software code developed for use in our semiconductor chipsets manufactured for devices that use both the 2G and 2.5G cellular wireless technology standards. The fair value of the in-process technology was determined with the assistance of a third party using the income approach. At the time of the acquisition, the in-process technology was approximately 56% complete. As of November 3, 2007, the in-process research and development projects were complete. During fiscal 2007, we paid an additional $6.1 million of contingent consideration, which resulted in reducing the $1.8 million liability and recording additional goodwill of $4.3 million. As of November 3, 2007, all technological milestones have been met and no additional payments will be made. The acquisition also included $13.2 million of intangible assets that were being amortized over their estimated useful lives of five years using an accelerated amortization method that reflects the estimated pattern of economic use. As a result of the definitive agreement to sell our Baseband Chipset Business to MediaTek Inc., $7.9 million and $11.4 million of net intangible assets were reclassified to assets of discontinued operations at November 3, 2007 and October 28, 2006, respectively, as the TTPCom assets will be transferred to Media Tek Inc. as part of the transaction. See Note 2u. to our Consolidated Financial Statements contained in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further information regarding assets of discontinued operations. In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2006, we acquired substantially all the outstanding stock of privately-held Integrant Technologies, Inc. (Integrant) of Seoul, Korea. The acquisition enabled us to enter the mobile TV market and strengthened our presence in the Asian region. We paid $127.2 million in initial cash payments at closing and may be obligated to make additional cash payments of up to an aggregate of $33 million upon the satisfaction of certain conditions. The initial cash payments included $4.2 million held in escrow for the purchase of the remaining non-founder outstanding shares. These shares were purchased during fiscal 2007 and were recorded as additional goodwill. The purchase price was allocated to the tangible and intangible assets acquired based on their estimated fair values at the date of acquisition. We completed the final purchase accounting for this transaction during the first quarter of fiscal 2007, which resulted in an additional $5.6 million of goodwill. The $33 million of potential cash payments is comprised of $25 million for the achievement of revenue-based milestones that may be payable during the period from July 2006 through December 2007 and $8 million related to the purchase of shares from the founder of Integrant during the period from July 2007 through July 2009. The additional cash payments will be recorded as additional purchase price. During fiscal 2007, we paid $3.5 million to repurchase founder shares. No revenue-based milestones have been met as of November 3, 2007. The purchase price included $11.1 million of in-process technology that had not yet reached technological feasibility, had no alternative future use and was charged to operations during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2006. The in-process technology related to technologies currently in development for Dual DAB, T-DMB, DVB-H, RFID and WiBro applications. The fair value of the in-process technology was determined with the assistance of a third party using the income approach. At the time of the acquisition, the in-process technology was approximately 74% complete. As of November 3, 2007, the in-process research and development projects were complete. The acquisition also included $21.6 million of intangible assets that are being amortized over their estimated useful lives of two to five years using an accelerated amortization method that reflects the estimated pattern of economic use. In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2006, we acquired all the outstanding stock of privately-held AudioAsics A/S (AudioAsics) of Roskilde, Denmark. The acquisition of AudioAsics allows us to continue developing our low-power audio solutions, while expanding our presence in the Nordic and Eastern European regions. We paid $19.3 million in initial cash payments at closing and may be obligated to make additional cash payments of up to an aggregate of $8 million upon the satisfaction of certain conditions. The purchase price was allocated to the tangible and intangible assets acquired based on their estimated fair values at the date of acquisition. The $8 million of potential cash payments is comprised of $4.8 million for the achievement of revenue-based milestones that may be 34 Table of Contents payable during the period from October 2006 through January 2009 and $3.2 million based on the achievement of technological milestones during the period from October 2006 through January 2009. In order to be entitled to receive $2.4 million of the revenue-based contingent consideration, certain key employees must continue to be employed by us. As such, that portion of the revenue-based contingent consideration will be recorded as compensation expense when, and if, it is earned. The technological milestones require post-acquisition services to be rendered in order to be achieved and, as such, will be recorded as compensation expense when earned. The purchase price included $5.1 million of in-process technology that had not yet reached technological feasibility, had no alternative future use and was charged to operations during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2006. The in-process technology related to technologies currently in development for analog and digital microphone pre-amplifiers. The fair value of the in-process technology was determined with the assistance of a third party using the income approach. At the time of the acquisition, the in-process technology was approximately 69% complete. As of November 3, 2007, the in-process research and development projects were complete. The acquisition also included $8.3 million of intangible assets that are being amortized over their estimated useful lives of five years using an accelerated amortization method that reflects the estimated pattern of economic use. As of November 3, 2007, no contingent consideration has been paid. Pro forma results of operations for TTPCom, Integrant and AudioAsics have not been provided herein as they were not material to us on either an individual or an aggregate basis. The results of operations of each acquisition are included in our consolidated statement of income from the date of such acquisition. Related Party Transaction One of our directors, who has served on our Board of Directors since 1988, became a director of Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company, or TSMC, in fiscal 2002 and continues to serve as a director of TSMC. Management believes the terms and prices for the purchases of products from TSMC are not affected by the presence of one of our directors on the Board of Directors of TSMC. We purchased approximately $302 million, $281 million and $224 million of products from TSMC in fiscal years 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively. Approximately $47 million and $17 million were payable to TSMC as of November 3, 2007 and October 28, 2006, respectively. We anticipate that we will make significant purchases from TSMC in fiscal year 2008. Liquidity and Capital Resources Fiscal Year 2007 2006 2005 Net Cash Provided by Operations $ 820,365 $ 621,102 $ 672,704 Net Cash Provided by Operations as a % of Total Revenue 32.2 % 26.5 % 31.5 % At November 3, 2007, cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments totaled $1,081.2 million, a decrease of $1,047.1 million from the end of the fourth quarter of fiscal 2006. The primary sources of funds for fiscal 2007 were net cash generated from operating activities of $820.4 million and proceeds of $109.1 million from our employee stock plans. The principal uses of funds during fiscal 2007 were the repurchase of approximately 45.9 million shares of our common stock for an aggregate of $1,647.2 million, dividend payments of $228.3 million and capital expenditures of $141.8 million. In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2007, we entered into a definitive agreement to sell our Baseband Chipset Business to MediaTek Inc. The cash flows from this discontinued operation have been combined with the operating, investing and financing cash flows from continuing operations (i.e. no separate classification of cash flows from discontinued operations) for all periods presented. We believe the absence of the cash flows from this discontinued operation will not have a material impact on our future liquidity and financial position. Additionally, as a result of this agreement, we reclassified certain assets and liabilities related to this business to assets or liabilities of discontinued operations. See Note 2u. to our Consolidated Financial Statements contained in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further information regarding this discontinued operation. The anticipated closure of the sale of our Baseband Chipset Business to MediaTek Inc. and the anticipated closure of the sale of our CPU voltage regulation and PC thermal monitoring business to ON Semiconductor 35 Table of Contents Corporation are expected to generate approximately $250 million to $270 million of cash in fiscal 2008 after the payment of all applicable taxes. Fiscal Year 2007 2006 Accounts Receivable $ 336,381 $ 305,761 Days Sales Outstanding* 47 46 Inventory $ 347,519 $ 362,945 Days Cost of Sales in Inventory* 118 133 * We use the annualized fourth quarter revenue in our calculation of days sales outstanding and we use the annualized fourth quarter cost of sales in our calculation of days cost of sales in inventory. Accounts receivable at the end of fiscal 2007 increased by $30.6 million, or 10%, from the amount at the end of fiscal 2006. This increase was the result of higher sales in the last month of fiscal 2007 as compared to the last month of fiscal 2006. Inventories at the end of fiscal 2007 decreased by $15.4 million, or 4%, from the amount at the end of fiscal 2006 and days cost of sales in inventory at the end of fiscal 2007 decreased by 15 days from the amount at the end of fiscal 2006. The decrease in inventory is a result of our continued effort to balance production, demand and inventory levels as well as the sale of inventory (valued at approximately $19 million at October 28, 2006) which had been built during fiscal 2006 in anticipation of the closure of the Sunnyvale, California wafer fabrication facility. Current liabilities increased to $548.1 million at November 3, 2007, an increase of $57.2 million, or 11.6%, from $490.9 million at the end of fiscal 2006. Net additions to property, plant and equipment including that related to our Baseband Chipset Business, which is reflected as a discontinued operation, were $141.8 million in fiscal 2007, $129.3 million in fiscal 2006 and $85.5 million in fiscal 2005. Fiscal 2008 capital expenditures are expected to total approximately $160 million. During fiscal 2007, our Board of Directors declared cash dividends totaling $0.70 per outstanding share of common stock resulting in dividend payments of $228.3 million in fiscal 2007. The payment of future dividends, if any, will be based on several factors including our financial performance, outlook and liquidity. After the end of the fiscal year, on November 26, 2007, our Board of Directors declared a cash dividend of $0.18 per outstanding share of our common stock. The dividend is payable on December 26, 2007 to shareholders of record on December 7, 2007 and is expected to total approximately $54 million. On May 11, 2005, our Board of Directors authorized an increase in the aggregate dollar amount of common stock that may be repurchased under our share repurchase program previously adopted by our Board of Directors on August 11, 2004 from $500 million to $1 billion. On March 14, 2006, our Board of Directors authorized the repurchase by us of an additional $1 billion of our common stock, increasing the total amount of our common stock we can repurchase from $1 billion to $2 billion of our common stock. On December 6, 2006, our Board of Directors authorized the repurchase by us of an additional $1 billion of our common stock, increasing the total amount of our common stock we are authorized to repurchase from $2 billion to $3 billion. On June 6, 2007, our Board of Directors authorized the repurchase by us of an additional $1 billion of our common stock, increasing the total amount of our common stock we are authorized to repurchase from $3 billion to $4 billion. Under the repurchase program, we may repurchase outstanding shares of our common stock from time to time in the open market and through privately negotiated transactions. Unless terminated earlier by resolution of our Board of Directors, the repurchase program will expire when we have repurchased all shares authorized for repurchase under the repurchase program. During fiscal 2007, we repurchased approximately $1,647.2 million of our common stock under this plan. As of November 3, 2007, we had $665.2 million of authorized repurchases remaining under our repurchase program. We plan to continue to repurchase shares during fiscal 2008. The timing and number of shares repurchased can not be reasonably estimated at this time; however, from the end of fiscal year 2007 through November 26, 2007, we repurchased approximately 4.6 million shares for approximately $151 million. 36 Table of Contents The table below summarizes our contractual obligations as of November 3, 2007: Payment due by period Less than More than (thousands) Total 1 Year 1-3 Years 4-5 Years 5 Years Contractual obligations: Operating leasesa $ 91,478 $ 30,774 $ 39,173 $ 9,272 $ 12,259 Deferred compensation planb 36,553 1,233 1,233 — 34,087 Pension fundingc 7,993 7,993 — — — Total $ 136,024 $ 40,000 $ 40,406 $ 9,272 $ 46,346 (a) Certain of our operating lease obligations include escalation clauses. These escalating payment requirements are reflected in the table. (b) These payments relate to obligations under our deferred compensation plan. The deferred compensation plan allows certain members of management and other highly-compensated employees and non-employee directors to defer receipt of all or any portion of their compensation. Prior to January 1, 2005, participants could also defer gains on stock options and restricted stock granted before July 23, 1997. The amount in the “More than 5 Years” column of the table represents the remaining total balance under the deferred compensation plan to be paid to participants who have not terminated employment. Since we cannot reasonably estimate the timing of withdrawals for participants who have not yet terminated employment we have included the future obligation to these participants in the “More than 5 Years” column of the table. All other columns represent installment payments to be made to those employees who have retired or are on long-term disability. (c) Our funding policy for our foreign defined benefit plans is consistent with the local requirements of each country. The payment obligations in the table are estimates of our expected contributions to these plans for fiscal year 2008. The actual future payments may differ from the amounts presented in the table and reasonable estimates of payments beyond one year are not practical because of potential future changes in variables such as plan asset performance, interest rates and the rate of increase in compensation levels. Purchase orders for the purchase of raw materials and other goods and services are not included in the table above. We are not able to determine the total amount of these purchase orders that represent contractual obligations, as purchase orders may represent authorizations to purchase rather than binding agreements. In addition, our purchase orders generally allow for cancellation without significant penalties. We do not have significant agreements for the purchase of raw materials or other goods specifying minimum quantities or set prices that exceed our expected short-term requirements. The expected timing of payments and the amounts of the obligations discussed above are estimated based on current information. At November 3, 2007, our principal source of liquidity was $1,081.2 million of cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments. We believe that our existing sources of liquidity and cash expected to be generated from future operations, together with anticipated available long-term financing, will be sufficient to fund operations, capital expenditures and research and development efforts for at least the next twelve months and thereafter for the foreseeable future. Off-balance Sheet Financing As of November 3, 2007, we had no off-balance sheet financing arrangements. Outlook The following statements are based on current expectations. These statements are forward-looking, and actual results may differ materially. Unless specifically mentioned, these statements do not give effect to the potential impact of any mergers, acquisitions, divestitures, or business combinations that may be announced or closed after the date of filing this report. These statements supersede all prior statements regarding business outlook made by the Company. Upon entering into the definitive agreement to sell our CPU Voltage regulator and PC thermal monitoring 37 Table of Contents business on November 8, 2007, the assets of this business met the held-for-sale criteria, and will therefore be reclassified as discontinued operations during the first quarter of fiscal 2008. This business generated approximately $25 million of sales in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2007. Therefore, once we reclassify the $25 million of revenue to discontinued operations, our fourth quarter revenue will be $623 million. On this basis, we expect product sales from continuing operations in the first quarter of fiscal 2008 to be approximately $610 million to $635 million. Gross margin percentage is planned to be up slightly in the first quarter of fiscal 2008 as compared to the fourth quarter of fiscal 2007. Diluted EPS is planned to be approximately $0.38 to $0.42 for the first quarter of fiscal 2008. As previously announced, we also expect to close on the sales of two businesses in the first quarter of fiscal 2008. The estimated gains on these sales are not reflected in the estimates above. We expect to realize a gain, net of tax, of between approximately $150 million and $160 million related to the sale of our Baseband Chipset Business to MediaTek Inc. We also expect to recognize a gain, net of taxes of between approximately $52 million and $60 million related to the sale of our CPU voltage regulation and PC thermal monitoring business. The gains on both of these sales will be included in income from discontinued operations. New Accounting Pronouncements Accounting for Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities In February 2007, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB), issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standard (SFAS) 159, The Fair Value Option for Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities — Including an amendment of FASB Statement No. 115 (SFAS 159). SFAS 159 permits entities to choose to measure many financial instruments and certain other items at fair value. The objective is to improve financial reporting by providing entities with the opportunity to mitigate volatility in reported earnings caused by measuring related assets and liabilities differently without having to apply complex hedge accounting provisions. SFAS 159 is effective as of the beginning of an entity’s first fiscal year that begins after November 15, 2007, which is our fiscal year 2009 that begins on November 2, 2008. We are currently evaluating the impact, if any, that SFAS 159 may have on our financial condition and results of operations. Fair Value Measurements In September 2006, the FASB issued SFAS 157, Fair Value Measurements (SFAS 157). SFAS 157 provides enhanced guidance for using fair value to measure assets and liabilities. The standard also responds to investors’ requests for expanded information about the extent to which companies measure assets and liabilities at fair value, the information used to measure fair value and the effect of fair value measurements on earnings. SFAS 157 applies whenever other standards require or permit assets or liabilities to be measured at fair value. This standard does not expand the use of fair value in any new circumstances. SFAS 157 is effective for fiscal years beginning after November 15, 2007, which is our fiscal year 2009 that begins on November 2, 2008. We are currently evaluating the impact that SFAS 157 may have on our financial condition and results of operations. Accounting for Prior Year Misstatements In September 2006, the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) issued Staff Accounting Bulletin (SAB) No. 108, Considering the Effects of Prior Year Misstatements when Quantifying Misstatements in Current Year Financial Statements (SAB 108). This SAB provides guidance on the consideration of the effects of prior year misstatements in quantifying current year misstatements for the purpose of a materiality assessment. SAB 108 establishes an approach that requires quantification of financial statement errors based on the effects on each of the company’s balance sheet and statement of operations and the related financial statement disclosures. SAB 108 permits existing public companies to record the cumulative effect of initially applying this approach in the first year ending after November 15, 2006 by recording the necessary correcting adjustments to the carrying values of assets and liabilities as of the beginning of that year with the offsetting adjustment recorded to the opening balance of retained earnings. Additionally, the use of the cumulative effect transition method requires detailed disclosure of the nature and amount of each individual error being corrected through the cumulative adjustment and how and when it arose. The adoption of SAB 108 in the first quarter of fiscal 2007 did not have any impact on our financial condition or results of operations. 38 Table of Contents Accounting for Defined Benefit Pension and Other Postretirement Plans In September 2006, the FASB issued SFAS No. 158, Employers’ Accounting for Defined Benefit Pension and Other Postretirement Plans — An Amendment of FASB Statements No. 87, 88, 106, and 132R (SFAS 158). SFAS 158 requires companies to recognize the funded status of pension and other postretirement benefit plans on sponsoring employers’ balance sheets and to recognize changes in the funded status in the year the changes occur. It also requires the measurement date of plan assets and obligations to occur at the end of the employers’ fiscal year. SFAS 158 was effective for us at the end of fiscal 2007, except for the change in measurement date, which is effective for us in fiscal 2009. The adoption of SFAS 158 in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2007 did not have a material impact on our financial condition or results of operations. Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes In June 2006, the FASB issued FASB Interpretation No. 48, Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes — an interpretation of FASB Statement No. 109 (FIN 48). FIN 48 clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in an enterprise’s financial statements in accordance with SFAS 109, Accounting for Income Taxes. FIN 48 prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. FIN 48 also provides guidance on derecognition, classification, interest and penalties, accounting in interim periods, disclosure, and transition. FIN 48 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2006. We are currently evaluating the impact, if any, that FIN 48 may have on our financial condition or results of operations. Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates Management’s discussion and analysis of the financial condition and results of operations is based upon the consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with United States generally accepted accounting principles. The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue and expenses, and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. We base our estimates and judgments on historical experience, knowledge of current conditions and beliefs of what could occur in the future based on available information. We consider the following accounting policies to be both those most important to the portrayal of our financial condition and those that require the most subjective judgment. If actual results differ significantly from management’s estimates and projections, there could be a material effect on our financial statements. We also have other policies that we consider key accounting policies, such as our policy for revenue recognition, including the deferral of revenue on sales to distributors until the products are sold to the end user; however, the application of these policies does not require us to make significant estimates or judgments that are difficult or subjective. Inventory Valuation Inventories are valued at the lower of cost (first-in, first-out method) or market. Because of the cyclical nature of the semiconductor industry, changes in inventory levels, obsolescence of technology, and product life cycles, we write down inventories to net realizable value. We employ a variety of methodologies to determine the net realizable value of inventory. While a portion of the calculation is determined via reference to the age of inventory and lower of cost or market calculations, an element is subject to significant judgments made by us about future demand for our inventory. If actual demand for our products is less than our estimates, additional adjustments to existing inventories may need to be recorded in future periods. Allowance for Doubtful Accounts We maintain allowances for doubtful accounts, when appropriate, for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments. If the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate, our actual losses may exceed our estimates, and additional allowances would be required. 39 Table of Contents Long-Lived Assets We review property, plant, and equipment and identified intangible assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of assets may not be recoverable. Recoverability of these assets is measured by comparison of their carrying value to future undiscounted cash flows the assets are expected to generate over their remaining economic lives. If such assets are considered to be impaired, the impairment to be recognized in earnings equals the amount by which the carrying value of the assets exceeds their fair market value determined by either a quoted market price, if any, or a value determined by utilizing a discounted cash flow technique. Although we have recognized no material impairment adjustments related to our property, plant, and equipment and identified intangible assets during the past three fiscal years, except those made in conjunction with restructuring actions, deterioration in our business in the future could lead to such impairment adjustments in future periods. Evaluation of impairment of long-lived assets requires estimates of future operating results that are used in the preparation of the expected future undiscounted cash flows. Actual future operating results and the remaining economic lives of our long-lived assets could differ from the estimates used in assessing the recoverability of these assets. These differences could result in impairment charges, which could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations. In addition, in certain instances, assets may not be impaired but their estimated useful lives may have decreased. In these situations, we amortize the remaining net book values over the revised useful lives. Goodwill In accordance with SFAS 142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets, goodwill is subject to annual impairment tests, or earlier if indicators of potential impairment exist and suggest that the carrying value of goodwill may not be recoverable from estimated discounted future cash flows. Because we have one reporting segment under SFAS 142, we utilize the entity-wide approach to assess goodwill for impairment and compare our market value to our net book value to determine if an impairment exists. These impairment tests may result in impairment losses that could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations. Accounting for Income Taxes We account for income taxes in accordance with SFAS 109, Accounting for Income Taxes, which requires that deferred tax assets and liabilities be recognized using enacted tax rates for the effect of temporary differences between the book and tax bases of recorded assets and liabilities. SFAS 109 also requires that deferred tax assets be reduced by a valuation allowance if it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax asset will not be realized. We evaluate the realizability of our deferred tax assets quarterly. At November 3, 2007, we had gross deferred tax assets of $210.9 million primarily resulting from temporary differences between the book and tax bases of assets and liabilities. We have conducted an assessment of the likelihood of realization of those deferred tax assets and concluded that a $46.8 million valuation allowance is needed to reserve the amount of the deferred tax assets that may not be realized due to the expiration of certain state credit carryovers. In reaching our conclusion, we evaluated certain relevant criteria including the existence of deferred tax liabilities that can be used to absorb deferred tax assets, the taxable income in prior carryback years in the impacted state jurisdictions that can be used to absorb net operating losses and taxable income in future years. Our judgments regarding future profitability may change due to future market conditions, changes in U.S. or international tax laws and other factors. These changes, if any, may require material adjustments to these deferred tax assets, resulting in a reduction in net income or an increase in net loss in the period when such determinations are made. In the ordinary course of global business, there are many transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax outcome is uncertain. Some of these uncertainties arise as a consequence of cost reimbursement and royalty arrangements among related entities. Although we believe our estimates are reasonable, no assurance can be given that the final tax outcome of these matters will not be different than that which is reflected in our historical income tax provisions and accruals. Such differences could have a material impact on our income tax provision and operating results in the period in which such determination is made. 40 Table of Contents Stock-Based Compensation The adoption of SFAS 123R in the first quarter of fiscal 2006 required that stock-based compensation expense associated with stock options and related awards be recognized in the statement of income, rather than being disclosed in a pro forma footnote to the consolidated financial statements. Determining the amount of stock-based compensation to be recorded requires us to develop estimates to be used in calculating the grant-date fair value of stock options. We calculate the grant-date fair values using the Black-Scholes valuation model. The use of valuation models requires us to make estimates of the following assumptions: Expected volatility — We are responsible for estimating volatility and have considered a number of factors, including third-party estimates, when estimating volatility. For options granted prior to fiscal 2005, we used historical volatility to estimate the grant-date fair value of stock options. We changed our method of estimating expected volatility for all stock options granted for fiscal 2005 and thereafter from exclusively relying on historical volatility to exclusively relying on implied volatility. This change was the result of a thorough review we undertook, which included consultations with several third-party advisors. Historical volatility during the period commensurate with the expected term of our stock options over the past several years included a period of time when our stock price experienced unprecedented increases and subsequent declines. We believe that this past stock price volatility is unlikely to be indicative of future stock price behavior, and as such, we currently believe that the exclusive use of implied volatility results in a more accurate estimate of the grant-date fair value of employee stock options because it more appropriately reflects the market’s current expectations of future volatility. In evaluating the appropriateness of exclusively relying on implied volatility we concluded that: (1) options in the Company’s common stock are actively traded with sufficient volume on several exchanges; (2) the market prices of both the traded options and the underlying shares are measured at a similar point in time to each other and on a date close to the grant date of the employee share options; (3) the traded options have exercise prices that are both near-the-money and close to the exercise price of the employee share options; and (4) the maturities of the traded options used to estimate volatility are at least one year. Expected term — We use historical employee exercise and option expiration data to estimate the expected term assumption for the Black-Scholes grant-date valuation. We believe that this historical data is currently the best estimate of the expected term of a new option, and that generally, all of our employees exhibit similar exercise behavior. In general, the longer the expected term used in the Black-Scholes valuation model, the higher the grant-date fair value of the option. Risk-free interest rate — The yield on zero-coupon U.S. Treasury securities for a period that is commensurate with the expected term assumption is used as the risk-free interest rate. Expected dividend yield — Expected dividend yield is calculated by annualizing the cash dividend declared by our Board of Directors for the current quarter and dividing that result by the closing stock price on the date of grant of the option. Until such time as our Board of Directors declares a cash dividend for an amount that is different from the current quarter’s cash dividend, the current dividend will be used in deriving this assumption. Cash dividends are not paid on options, restricted stock or restricted stock units. The amount of stock-based compensation expense recognized during a period is based on the value of the portion of the awards that are ultimately expected to vest. SFAS 123R requires forfeitures to be estimated at the time of grant and revised, if necessary, in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates. The term “forfeitures” is distinct from “cancellations” or “expirations” and represents only the unvested portion of the surrendered option. Based on an analysis of our historical forfeitures, we have applied an annual forfeiture rate of 4.3% to all unvested stock-based awards as of November 3, 2007. The rate of 4.3% represents the portion that is expected to be forfeited each year over the vesting period. This analysis is re-evaluated quarterly and the forfeiture rate is adjusted as necessary. Ultimately, the actual expense recognized over the vesting period will only be for those awards that vest. Contingencies From time to time, we receive notices that our products or manufacturing processes may be infringing the patent or intellectual property rights of others. We periodically assess each matter to determine if a contingent 41 Table of Contents liability should be recorded in accordance with SFAS 5, Accounting for Contingencies. In making this determination, we may, depending on the nature of the matter, consult with internal and external legal counsel and technical experts. Based on the information we obtain, combined with our judgment regarding all the facts and circumstances of each matter, we determine whether it is probable that a contingent loss may be incurred and whether the amount of such loss can be reasonably estimated. If a loss is probable and reasonably estimable, we record a contingent loss in accordance with SFAS 5. In determining the amount of a contingent loss, we consider advice received from experts in the specific matter, current status of legal proceedings, settlement negotiations that may be ongoing, prior case history and other factors. If the judgments and estimates made by us are incorrect, we may need to record additional contingent losses that could materially adversely impact our results of operations. See Note 12 in the Notes to our Consolidated Financial Statements contained in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information regarding our commitments and contingencies. ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK Interest Rate Exposure Based on our marketable securities and short term investments outstanding as of November 3, 2007 and October 28, 2006, our annual interest income would change by approximately $9 million and $16 million, respectively, for each 100 basis point increase or decrease in interest rates. The fair values of our investment portfolio at November 3, 2007 and October 28, 2006 would change by approximately $2 million and $6 million, respectively, for each 100 basis point increase or decrease in rates. Foreign Currency Exposure As more fully described in Note 2i. in the Notes to our Consolidated Financial Statements contained in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, we regularly hedge our non-U.S. dollar-based exposures by entering into forward exchange contracts. The terms of these contracts are for periods matching the duration of the underlying exposure and generally range from one month to twelve months. The fair values of these instruments were approximately $7 million at November 3, 2007 and were insignificant at October 28, 2006. Currently, our largest foreign currency exposure is the Euro, primarily because our European operations have the highest proportion of our local currency denominated expenses. Relative to foreign currency exposures existing at November 3, 2007 and October 28, 2006, a 10% unfavorable movement in foreign currency exchange rates would not expose us to significant losses in earnings or cash flows because we hedge substantially all of our year-end exposures against fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. For contracts outstanding at November 3, 2007, a 10% unfavorable movement in foreign currency exchange rates from the rates as of our 2007 fiscal year end would increase the fair value of our foreign currency financial instruments by approximately $24 million and a 10% favorable movement in foreign currency exchange rates would decrease their fair value by approximately $9 million. As at October 28, 2006, a 10% movement in foreign currency exchange rates from the rates as of our 2006 fiscal year end would not expose us to significant gains or losses in the contracts’ fair values. The calculation assumes that each exchange rate would change in the same direction relative to the U.S. dollar. In addition to the direct effects of changes in exchange rates, such changes typically affect the volume of sales or the foreign currency sales price as competitors’ products become more or less attractive. Our sensitivity analysis of the effects of changes in foreign currency exchange rates does not factor in a potential change in sales levels or local currency selling prices. 42 Table of Contents",2023-12-30 19:09:03.319394
6281,ADI,ANALOG DEVICES INC,2008,"ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (all tabular amounts in thousands except per share amounts) This Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, including in particular the section entitled “Outlook” contains forward-looking statements regarding future events and our future results that are subject to the safe harbors created under the Securities Act of 1933 (the “Securities Act”) and the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the “Exchange Act”). These statements are based on current expectations, estimates, forecasts, and projections about the industries in which we operate and the beliefs and assumptions of our management. Words such as “expects,” “anticipates,” “targets,” “goals,” “projects,” “intends,” “plans,” “believes,” “seeks,” “estimates,” “continues,” “may,” variations of such words and similar expressions are intended to identify such forward-looking statements. In addition, any statements that refer to projections regarding our future financial performance, particularly in light of the global credit and financial market crisis; our anticipated growth and trends in our businesses, our capital needs and capital expenditures; our market position and competitive changes in the marketplace for our products; our ability to innovate new products and technologies; the effectiveness of our efforts to refocus our operations and reduce our cost structure; our ability to access credit or capital markets; our ability to pay dividends or repurchase stock; our third-party suppliers; intellectual property and litigation matters; potential acquisitions or divestitures; key personnel; the effect of new accounting pronouncements and other characterizations of future events or circumstances are forward-looking statements. Readers are cautioned that these forward-looking statements are only predictions and are subject to risks, uncertainties, and assumptions that are difficult to predict, including those identified in Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors and elsewhere in our Annual Report on Form 10-K. Therefore, actual results may differ materially and adversely from those expressed in any forward-looking statements. We undertake no obligation to revise or update any forward-looking statements for any reason. During the first quarter of fiscal 2008 we sold our baseband chipset business and related support operations, or Baseband Chipset Business, to MediaTek Inc. and sold our CPU voltage regulation and PC thermal monitoring business to certain subsidiaries of ON Semiconductor Corporation. The financial results of these businesses are presented as discontinued operations in the consolidated statements of income for all periods presented. The assets and liabilities related to these businesses are reflected as assets and liabilities of discontinued operations in the consolidated balance sheets as of November 1, 2008 and November 3, 2007. The historical results of operations of these businesses have been segregated from our consolidated financial statements and are included in income (loss) from discontinued operations, net of tax, in the consolidated statements of income. Unless otherwise noted, this Management’s Discussion and Analysis relates only to financial results from continuing operations. Results of Operations Overview Fiscal Year 2008 2007 2006 Total Revenue $ 2,582,931 $ 2,464,721 $ 2,250,100 Gross Margin % 61.1 % 61.2 % 61.9 % Net income from Continuing Operations $ 525,177 $ 502,123 $ 519,175 Net income from Continuing Operations as a % of Total Revenue 20.3 % 20.4 % 23.1 % Diluted EPS from Continuing Operations $ 1.77 $ 1.51 $ 1.40 Diluted EPS $ 2.65 $ 1.50 $ 1.48 The year-to-year revenue changes by end market and product category are more fully outlined below under Revenue Trends by End Market and Revenue Trends by Product. In fiscal year 2008, our product revenue increased 6% from fiscal 2007 and our diluted earnings per share from continuing operations increased by 17%. We sold two businesses during the year that resulted in net cash proceeds of $403 million and a $248 million net gain in fiscal 2008. We report these two businesses below as discontinued operations. Our fiscal 2008 cash flow from operations was $669 million, or 26% of revenue, and we had $1,310 million of cash and short-term investments and no debt as of November 1, 2008. 23 Table of Contents While we achieved good operating results for fiscal 2008, the global credit crisis and deteriorating economic conditions have resulted in more cautious customer spending behavior and generally lower demand for our products. We cannot predict the severity, duration or precise impact of the economic downturn on our future financial results. Consequently, our reported results for the fourth quarter and fiscal year 2008 may not be indicative of our future results. Order rates slowed in late September 2008, and backlog declined significantly from the prior quarter, which limits our short-term visibility. Forecasting revenue in this environment is difficult. Therefore, as more fully described in the Outlook section below, our operating plan is for revenues to decline approximately 20% in the first quarter of fiscal 2009 from the amount recorded in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2008. Revenue Trends by End Market The categorization of revenue by end market is determined using a variety of data points including the technical characteristics of the product, the “sold to” customer information, the “ship to” customer information and the end customer product or application into which our product will be incorporated. As data systems for capturing and tracking this data evolve and improve, the categorization of products by end market can vary over time. When this occurs, we reclassify revenue by end market for prior periods. Such reclassifications typically do not materially change the sizing of, or the underlying trends of results within, each end market. 2008 2007* 2006 % of % of % of Total Total Total Product Product Product Revenue Revenue Y/Y% Revenue Revenue Revenue Revenue Industrial $ 1,274,924 49 % 6 % $ 1,198,984 49 % $ 1,117,602 50 % Communications 637,277 25 % 21 % 527,287 22 % 498,199 22 % Consumer 544,274 21 % (2 )% 557,373 23 % 449,754 20 % Computer 126,456 5 % (13 )% 146,077 6 % 184,545 8 % Total Product Revenue $ 2,582,931 100 % 6 % $ 2,429,721 100 % $ 2,250,100 100 % Revenue from one-time IP license — 35,000 — Total Revenue $ 2,582,931 $ 2,464,721 $ 2,250,100 * The year ended November 3, 2007 was a 53-week year. We follow a 52-week, or 364-day fiscal calendar that results in a 53-week year approximately every seventh year, as occurred in fiscal 2007. Industrial — The year-to-year increase from fiscal 2007 to fiscal 2008 was primarily the result of revenue growth in products sold into the instrumentation and automotive sectors and, to a lesser extent, the defense sector. These increases were partially offset by a decline in revenue from automatic test equipment. The year-to-year increase from fiscal 2006 to fiscal 2007 was primarily the result of revenue growth in products sold into the automotive area and to a lesser extent the instrumentation portion of the industrial end market. These sales increases were partially offset by a decline in sales to automatic test equipment customers. Communications — The year-to-year increases from fiscal 2007 to fiscal 2008 and from fiscal 2006 to fiscal 2007 were primarily the result of revenue growth in sales of analog products used in basestations and wireless handsets. The increase in sales from fiscal 2006 to fiscal 2007 was partially offset by a decrease in sales to networking customers. Consumer — The year-to-year decrease from fiscal 2007 to fiscal 2008 was primarily the result of an increase in revenue from advanced television and digital camera applications that was offset by a decline in revenue from other consumer applications, consistent with the global slowdown in consumer spending. The year-to-year increase from fiscal 2006 to fiscal 2007 was primarily the result of increased sales of our products used in video game applications, advanced television systems and digital home applications. 24 Table of Contents Computer — The year-to-year decreases from fiscal 2007 to fiscal 2008 and from fiscal 2006 to fiscal 2007 were primarily the result of broad-based declines in sales of our products into this end market. Revenue from One-Time IP License — During the first quarter of fiscal 2007, we recorded revenue of $35 million received in exchange for licensing of certain intellectual property rights to a third party. Revenue Trends by Product The following table summarizes revenue by product categories. The categorization of our products into broad categories is based on the characteristics of the individual products, the specification of the products and in some cases the specific uses that certain products have within applications. The categorization of products into categories is therefore subject to judgment in some cases and can vary over time. In instances where products move between product categories we reclassify the amounts in the product categories for all prior periods. Such reclassifications typically do not materially change the sizing of, or the underlying trends of results within, each product category. 2008 2007* 2006 % of % of % of Total Total Total Product Product Product Revenue Revenue Y/Y% Revenue Revenue Revenue Revenue Converters $ 1,190,964 46 % 8 % $ 1,104,842 46 % $ 1,021,174 45 % Amplifiers 590,275 23 % 6 % 557,515 23 % 532,046 24 % Other analog 393,856 15 % (0 )% 395,494 16 % 312,401 14 % Subtotal analog signal processing 2,175,095 84 % 6 % 2,057,851 85 % 1,865,621 83 % Power management & reference 143,702 6 % 16 % 124,101 5 % 126,833 6 % Total analog products $ 2,318,797 90 % 6 % $ 2,181,952 90 % $ 1,992,454 89 % General purpose DSP 234,946 9 % 10 % 214,339 9 % 205,483 9 % Other DSP 29,188 1 % (13 )% 33,430 1 % 52,163 2 % Total DSP products $ 264,134 10 % 7 % $ 247,769 10 % $ 257,646 11 % Total Product Revenue $ 2,582,931 100 % 6 % $ 2,429,721 100 % $ 2,250,100 100 % Revenue from one-time IP license — 35,000 — Total Revenue $ 2,582,931 $ 2,464,721 $ 2,250,100 * The year ended November 3, 2007 was a 53-week year. We follow a 52-week, or 364-day fiscal calendar that results in a 53-week year approximately every seventh year, as occurred in fiscal 2007. The increase in sales from fiscal 2007 to fiscal 2008 was the result of a broad-based increase in sales across many of our product categories. The increase in sales of converters and amplifiers was primarily attributable to an increase in demand for our products used in the industrial and communications end markets. The significant changes in our revenue trends by product type from fiscal 2006 to fiscal 2007 were the year-to-year increases in our converters and amplifiers. In addition the other analog product category increased primarily as a result of increased sales of products used in video game applications. The year-to-year decrease from fiscal 2006 to fiscal 2007 in the other DSP product category was primarily attributable to the loss of revenue from our DSP-based DSL ASIC and network processor product line that we sold in fiscal 2006. This decrease was partially offset by an increase in revenues from our general purpose DSP products. 25 Table of Contents Revenue Trends by Geographic Region The percentage of product sales from continuing operations by geographic region, based upon point of sale, for the last three years is as follows: Fiscal Year Region 2008 2007 2006 United States 20 % 23 % 24 % Rest of North and South America 4 % 3 % 4 % Europe 26 % 24 % 24 % Japan 19 % 21 % 21 % China 16 % 13 % 11 % Rest of Asia 15 % 16 % 16 % The predominant countries comprising “Rest of North and South America” are Canada and Mexico. The predominant countries comprising European operations are Germany, France and the United Kingdom. The predominant countries comprising “Rest of Asia” are Taiwan and Korea. Revenue in the United States declined from 24% to 20% of total revenue over the past three fiscal years. This geographic shift of revenue reflects the increased manufacturing activity of our customers in locations outside the United States, primarily China and our success in markets located outside of the United States. Gross Margin Fiscal Year 2008 2007 2006 Gross Margin $ 1,577,275 $ 1,508,276 $ 1,393,601 Gross Margin % 61.1 % 61.2 % 61.9 % Gross margin percentage in fiscal 2008 was lower by 10 basis points from the gross margin recorded in fiscal 2007. Gross margin percentage in fiscal 2007 was higher primarily as a result of recording revenue of $35 million we received in exchange for the licensing of certain intellectual property rights to a third party with no associated cost of sales. Gross margin percentage in fiscal 2007 decreased by 70 basis points from the gross margin recorded in fiscal 2006. This decrease was primarily the result of higher sales of products used in consumer electronics in fiscal 2007, which were primarily manufactured at external foundries where we earned lower gross margins compared to our average gross margin. This gross margin percentage decrease in fiscal 2007 was partially offset by the $35 million in revenue recorded in the first quarter of fiscal 2007 in exchange for licensing of certain intellectual property rights to a third party with no associated cost of sales. Fiscal year 2006 cost of sales also included approximately $20.3 million of restructuring-related expenses, of which $18.3 million was accelerated depreciation. Stock-based Compensation Expense During the first quarter of fiscal 2006, on October 30, 2005, we adopted the Financial Accounting Standards Board’s Statement of Financial Accounting Standards, or SFAS, No. 123 (revised 2004), Share-Based Payment, or SFAS 123R, using the modified prospective transition method. We calculate compensation cost on the date of grant using the fair value of stock options as calculated using the Black-Scholes option pricing model. As of November 1, 2008, the total compensation cost related to unvested awards not yet recognized in the statement of income was approximately $116.7 million (before tax consideration), which will be recognized over a weighted average period of 1.7 years. See Note 3 in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements contained in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further information regarding our adoption of SFAS 123R. 26 Table of Contents Research and Development (R&D) Fiscal Year 2008 2007 2006 R&D Expenses $ 533,480 $ 509,553 $ 459,846 R&D Expenses as a % of Product Revenue 20.7 % 21.0 % 20.4 % R&D expenses in fiscal 2008 increased by $23.9 million, or 5%, from the amount recorded in fiscal 2007. This increase was primarily the result of higher employee salary, benefit and bonus expenses, which were partially offset by one fewer week of operations in fiscal 2008 than in fiscal 2007 and lower employee stock option expenses. R&D expenses in fiscal 2007 increased by $49.7 million, or 11%, from the amount recorded in fiscal 2006. The increase in R&D expenses was primarily the result of an increase in employee salary and benefit expense in fiscal 2007, primarily as a result of an increase in our employee population and to a lesser extent the impact of the extra week of operations in fiscal 2007. These increases were partially offset by lower employee bonus expenses during fiscal 2007 as compared to fiscal 2006. R&D expenses as a percentage of revenue will fluctuate from year-to-year depending on the amount of revenue and the success of new product development efforts, which we view as critical to our future growth. At any point in time we have hundreds of R&D projects underway, and we believe that none of these projects is material on an individual basis. We expect to continue the development of innovative technologies and processes for new products, and we believe that a continued commitment to R&D is essential in order to maintain product leadership with our existing products and to provide innovative new product offerings, and therefore, we expect to continue to make significant R&D investments in the future. Selling, Marketing, General and Administrative (SMG&A) Fiscal Year 2008 2007 2006 SMG&A Expenses $ 415,682 $ 389,505 $ 384,051 SMG&A Expenses as a % of Product Revenue 16.1 % 16.0 % 17.1 % SMG&A expenses increased by $26.2 million, or 7%, in fiscal 2008 as compared to the amount recorded in fiscal 2007. This increase was primarily the result of higher employee salary, benefit and bonus expenses, which were partially offset by lower employee stock option expenses and one less week of operations in fiscal 2008 than in fiscal 2007. Fiscal 2007 also included $8.5 million related to the reimbursement of legal expenses we received as a result of the settlement of litigation in fiscal 2007. SMG&A expenses for fiscal 2007 increased by $5.5 million, or 1%, from the amount recorded in fiscal 2006. The increase in SMG&A expenses was primarily the result of higher employee salary and benefit expenses and to a lesser extent an extra week of operations in fiscal 2007. These increases were partially offset by lower employee bonus expenses and $8.5 million related to the reimbursement of legal expenses we received as a result of the settlement of litigation in fiscal 2007. Purchased In-process Research and Development Fiscal Year 2006 TTPCom Limited $ 5,500 Integrant 11,124 AudioAsics 5,087 Total Purchased in-Process R&D $ 21,711 We incurred charges totaling $21.7 million for the write-off of in-process technology that had not yet reached technological feasibility associated with our acquisitions in fiscal 2006. There were no charges for the write-off of 27 Table of Contents in-process research and development in fiscal 2008 or 2007. See “Acquisitions” below for additional information regarding these acquisitions. Special Charges Closure of Wafer Fabrication Facility in Sunnyvale During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2005, we recorded a special charge of $20.3 million as a result of a decision to close our California wafer fabrication operations and transfer virtually all of the production of products manufactured there to our facility in Wilmington, Massachusetts. The charge was for severance and fringe benefit costs that we recorded pursuant to SFAS 88, Employers’ Accounting for Settlements and Curtailments of Defined Benefit Pension Plans and for Termination Benefits, or SFAS 88, under our ongoing benefit plan for 339 manufacturing employees and 28 general and administrative employees. The severance benefit is based on the length of past service, and employees had to continue to be employed until their employment was involuntarily terminated in order to receive the severance benefit. We completed the final cleanup and closure activities associated with this action during the second quarter of fiscal 2007. In addition we recorded additional expense during fiscal 2006 related to the Sunnyvale facility closure, which consisted of $18.3 million of non-cash cost of sales expenses for additional depreciation due to shortened useful lives of certain manufacturing equipment and $2.0 million for stay-on bonuses for certain employees critical to facilitating the closure of this facility. We reversed approximately $2.0 million of the severance accrual during fiscal 2006 because some employees voluntarily left the company and other employees found alternative employment within the company. In addition, there was an over-accrual related to fringe benefits because severance payments, normally paid as income continuance, were paid in lump sum payments, which reduced the benefit costs associated with these payments. We have terminated the employment of all of the employees included in this action. We ceased production at the wafer fabrication facility on November 9, 2006. During the first quarter of fiscal 2007, we recorded additional expense, in accordance with SFAS 146, Accounting for Costs Associated with Exit or Disposal Activities or, SFAS 146, which consisted of $3.2 million for clean-up and closure costs that were charged to expense as incurred and $0.4 million for lease obligation costs for a warehouse facility we ceased using during the first quarter of fiscal 2007. During the second quarter of fiscal 2007, we recorded a special charge, in accordance with SFAS 146, which included $5.0 million of expense for future lease obligation costs for the wafer fabrication facility that we ceased using during the second quarter of fiscal 2007. The lease obligation costs are being paid out on a monthly basis over the remaining lease term, which expires in 2010. Also included in this special charge was $1.7 million for facility clean-up and closure costs that were charged to expense as incurred. We completed the clean-up activity during the second quarter of fiscal 2007, and we do not expect to incur any additional charges related to this action. The closure of this facility has resulted in annual cost savings of approximately $50 million per year beginning in fiscal 2007. These annual savings include: approximately $49 million in cost of sales, of which approximately $7 million relates to non-cash depreciation savings, and approximately $1 million in SMG&A expenses. At current demand levels, if this facility were still in operation, the capacity of the facility would be largely underutilized resulting in significant adverse manufacturing variances associated with the underutilization of our wafer fabrication facilities. Reorganization of Product Development and Support Programs During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2005, we recorded a special charge of $11.2 million as a result of our decision to reorganize our product development and support programs with the goal of providing greater focus on our analog and digital signal processing product programs. The charge was for severance and fringe benefit costs recorded pursuant to SFAS 88 under our ongoing benefit plan or statutory requirements at foreign locations for 60 manufacturing employees and 154 engineering and selling, marketing, general and administrative employees associated with these programs. During fiscal 2006, we recorded an additional special charge of $3.8 million related to this reorganization action. Approximately $1.5 million of this charge was for lease obligation costs for a facility that we ceased using 28 Table of Contents during the first quarter of fiscal 2006 and the write-off of property, plant and equipment and other items at this facility. The remaining $2.3 million related to the severance and fringe benefit costs recorded in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2006 pursuant to SFAS 88 under our ongoing benefit plan or statutory requirements at foreign locations for 46 engineering and selling, marketing, general and administrative employees associated with these programs. During the first quarter of fiscal 2007, we recorded an additional special charge of $1.6 million related to this reorganization action. Approximately $0.6 million of this charge was for contract termination costs. The remaining $1.0 million relates to severance and fringe benefit costs recorded pursuant to SFAS 88 under our ongoing benefit plan for six engineering employees associated with these programs. During the second quarter of fiscal 2007, we recorded an additional special charge of $3.4 million related to this reorganization action. Approximately $3.2 million related to the severance and fringe benefit costs recorded pursuant to SFAS 88 under our ongoing benefit plan or minimum statutory requirements at foreign locations for 20 engineering and selling, marketing, general and administrative employees. The remaining $0.2 million of this charge was for lease obligation costs for a facility that we ceased using during the second quarter of fiscal 2007. During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2007, we reversed approximately $0.9 million of our severance accrual because some employees voluntarily left the company and other employees found alternative employment within the company, and were therefore no longer entitled to severance payments. The employment of all employees associated with these programs has been terminated and amounts owed to employees for severance are being paid out as income continuance. We do not expect to incur any further charges related to this reorganization action. These organizational changes, which were fully implemented in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2007, have resulted in savings of approximately $30 million per year. These annual savings include: approximately $17 million in R&D expenses, approximately $10 million in SMG&A expenses and approximately $3 million in cost of sales. As this action was completed during fiscal 2007, a portion of these annual savings is reflected in our results for fiscal 2007 and all of the annual savings are reflected in our fiscal 2008 results. Fourth Quarter of Fiscal 2007 Special Charges Consolidation of a Wafer Fabrication Facility in Limerick During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2007, we recorded a special charge of $13.7 million as a result of our decision to only use eight-inch technology at our wafer fabrication facility in Limerick. Certain manufacturing processes and products produced on the Limerick facility’s six-inch production line will transition to our existing eight-inch production line in Limerick while others will transition to external foundries. The charge is for severance and fringe benefit costs recorded pursuant to SFAS 88 under our ongoing benefit plan for 150 manufacturing employees associated with these action. As of November 1, 2008, 126 of the 150 employees included in this cost reduction action were still employed by us. We expect production to cease in the six-inch wafer fabrication facility during the first half of 2009, at which time the employment of the remaining affected employees will be terminated. These employees must continue to be employed by us until their employment is involuntarily terminated in order to receive the severance benefit. During the fourth quarter of 2008, we recorded an additional charge of $1.5 million related to this action, of which $1.2 million was an adjustment to our original estimate of the severance costs and $0.3 million was for clean-up and closure costs that were charged to expense as incurred. We expect to incur additional clean-up and closure costs related to this action over the next three quarters totaling approximately $1.5 million. In accordance with SFAS 146, we will expense these costs as incurred. We estimate that the closure of this facility will result in annual cost savings of approximately $25 million per year, expected to start during the second quarter of fiscal 2009. We expect these annual savings will be in cost of sales, of which approximately $1 million relates to non-cash depreciation savings. Reduction of Overhead Infrastructure Costs During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2007, we decided to either deemphasize or exit certain businesses or products and focus investments in products and end markets where we have better opportunities for profitable growth. In September 2007, we entered into a definitive agreement to sell our Baseband Chipset Business. As a result, we decided to reduce the support infrastructure in manufacturing, engineering and SMG&A to more appropriately reflect our required overhead structure. Consequently, during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2007, we 29 Table of Contents recorded a special charge of $12.3 million, of which $10.7 million was for severance and fringe benefit costs recorded pursuant to SFAS 88 under our ongoing benefit plan or statutory requirements at foreign locations for 25 manufacturing employees and 127 engineering and selling, marketing, general and administrative employees associated with this action. The remaining $1.6 million was for contract termination costs related to a license agreement associated with products we will no longer develop and for which there is no future alternative use. As of November 1, 2008, we still employed 6 of the 152 employees included in this cost reduction action. These employees must continue to be employed by us until their employment is involuntarily terminated in order to receive the severance benefit. We expect these cost reduction actions, which were substantially completed in the second quarter of fiscal 2008, to result in savings of approximately $15 million per year. We expect these savings to be realized as follows: approximately $7 million in R&D expenses, approximately $6 million in SMG&A expenses and approximately $2 million in cost of sales. A portion of these savings is reflected in our results for fiscal 2008. Fourth Quarter of 2008 Special Charge During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2008, we decided to further reduce the operating cost structure of our company. Consequently, during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2008, we recorded a special charge of $1.6 million for severance and fringe benefit costs recorded pursuant to SFAS 88 under our ongoing benefit plan or statutory requirements at foreign locations for 19 engineering and SMG&A employees. As of November 1, 2008 we still employed, 14 of the 19 employees included in this cost reduction action. These employees must continue to be employed by us until their employment is involuntarily terminated in order to receive the severance benefit. We expect this cost reduction action, which we expect to complete during the first quarter of fiscal 2009, to result in savings of approximately $2.1 million per year. We expect these savings to be realized as follows: approximately $0.5 million in R&D expenses and approximately $1.6 million in SMG&A expenses. Operating Income from Continuing Operations Fiscal Year 2008 2007 2006 Operating income from Continuing Operations $ 625,025 $ 568,723 $ 526,203 Operating income from Continuing Operations as a % of Total Revenue 24.2 % 23.1 % 23.4 % The $56.3 million, or 10%, increase in operating income in fiscal 2008 as compared to fiscal 2007 was primarily the result of an increase in total revenue of $118.2 million and, to a lesser extent, a decrease in special charges of $37.4 million. This increase in operating income from continuing operations was partially offset by a 10 basis point decrease in gross margin percentage, an increase in operating expenses as more fully described above under the headings Research and Development and Selling, Marketing, General and Administrative, and the fact that fiscal 2007 included $35 million in non-product revenue that we received in exchange for the licensing of certain intellectual property rights to a third party with no associated cost of sales. Operating income increased by $42.5 million, or 8%, in fiscal 2007 as compared to fiscal 2006. This increase was the result of a $214.6 million increase in revenue, which was partially offset by a 70 basis point decrease in gross margin percentage and a $72.2 million increase in operating expenses as more fully described above under the headings Research and Development and Selling, Marketing, General and Administrative, Special Charges and Purchased In-process Research and Development. Nonoperating (Income) Expense Fiscal Year 2008 2007 2006 Interest income (41,041 ) (77,007 ) (100,117 ) Other, net (36 ) (15,727 ) (10,472 ) Total nonoperating income $ (41,077 ) $ (92,734 ) $ (110,589 ) Nonoperating income in fiscal 2008 was lower by $51.7 million as compared to fiscal 2007 primarily as a result of lower average invested cash balances and, to a lesser extent, lower interest rates in fiscal 2008 as compared 30 Table of Contents to fiscal 2007. In addition, other income in fiscal 2007 included $10.5 million we received as part of a litigation settlement and a $7.9 million gain from the sale of an investment. The $17.9 million decrease in nonoperating income in fiscal 2007 as compared to fiscal 2006 was a result of lower invested cash balances that were partially offset by the higher interest rates in fiscal 2007 as compared to fiscal 2006. This decrease in interest income was partially offset by a $7.9 million gain from the sale of an investment and a $10.5 million settlement we received in fiscal 2007. In fiscal 2006, we also recognized a $13.0 million gain on the sale of our DSP-based DSL ASIC and network processor product line. Provision for Income Taxes Fiscal Year 2008 2007 2006 Provision for Income Taxes $ 140,925 $ 159,553 $ 118,365 Effective Income Tax Rate 21.2 % 24.1 % 18.6 % Our effective tax rate reflects the applicable tax rate in effect in the various tax jurisdictions around the world where our income is earned. Our effective tax rate for fiscal 2008 was lower by 290 basis points compared to our effective tax rate for fiscal 2007. The 2007 tax rate included the following transactions, which were taxed at the higher U.S. tax rate: the one-time receipt of $35 million associated with the licensing of intellectual property to a third party, $19 million we received from a settlement of litigation and the $7.9 million gain on the sale of an investment. In addition, the 2007 tax rate included tax expense related to the finalization of the accounting for a 2006 acquisition. These items, which had the effect of increasing the 2007 tax rate, were partially offset by a higher R&D credit in fiscal 2007 than in fiscal 2008. In addition to these isolated transactions that impacted our tax rate, a larger percentage of our profits were earned in lower tax jurisdictions during fiscal 2008, as compared to fiscal 2007 causing a decrease in our tax rate. Our effective tax rate for fiscal 2007 was higher by 550 basis points compared to our effective tax rate for fiscal 2006. This increase was primarily attributable to the recording of tax benefits of $35.2 million associated with the completion of an Internal Revenue Service, or IRS, examination during fiscal 2006, including the reversal of penalty accruals and the filing of refund claims in other jurisdictions associated with the completion of the IRS audit. The increase was also attributable to the following fiscal 2007 transactions, which were taxed at the higher U.S. tax rate: the one-time receipt of $35 million associated with the licensing of intellectual property to a third party, the gain on the sale of an investment of $7.9 million and $19 million received from the settlement of litigation. In addition, we recorded an additional $4.4 million of taxes and penalties in fiscal 2007 for proposed adjustments related to the IRS examination of fiscal 2005 and fiscal 2004 and a $5.6 million tax adjustment related to the finalization of the accounting associated with a fiscal 2006 acquisition. These items were partially offset by a tax benefit of $4.7 million from the reinstatement of the U.S. federal research and development tax credit in fiscal 2007 and a $9.9 million cumulative adjustment recorded in fiscal 2007 related to the application of this credit to a portion of our fiscal 2006 results. Income from Continuing Operations, Net of Tax Fiscal Year 2008 2007 2006 Income from Continuing Operations, net of tax $ 525,177 $ 502,123 $ 519,175 Income from Continuing Operations, net of tax as a % of Total Revenue 20.3 % 20.4 % 23.1 % Diluted EPS from Continuing Operations $ 1.77 $ 1.51 $ 1.40 Income from continuing operations, net of tax, in fiscal 2008 was higher than in fiscal 2007 by approximately $23.1 million primarily as a result of the $56.3 million increase in operating income from continuing operations that was partially offset by a $51.7 million decrease in nonoperating income and a lower provision for income taxes in fiscal 2008. 31 Table of Contents Income from continuing operations, net of tax, was lower in fiscal 2007 than in fiscal 2006 by approximately $17.1 million primarily as a result of the $17.9 million decrease in nonoperating income and the impact of a higher effective income tax rate in fiscal 2007. These items, which had the impact of decreasing 2007 income from continuing operations, net of tax, were partially offset by the $42.5 million increase in operating income from continuing operations. The impact of inflation and foreign currency exchange rate movement on our results of operations during the past three fiscal years has not been significant. Discontinued Operations Fiscal Year 2008 2007 2006 Income (loss) from Discontinued Operations, net of tax $ 12,779 $ (5,216 ) $ 30,307 Gain on sale of Discontinued Operations, net of tax 248,328 — — Total income (loss) from Discontinued Operations, net of tax $ 261,107 $ (5,216 ) $ 30,307 Diluted earnings (loss) per share from Discontinued Operations $ 0.88 $ (0.02 ) $ 0.08 We sold our Baseband Chipset Business to MediaTek Inc. and our CPU voltage regulation and PC thermal monitoring business to certain subsidiaries of ON Semiconductor Corporation during the first quarter of fiscal 2008. Accordingly, the results of the operations of these businesses have been presented as discontinued operations within the consolidated financial statements in accordance with SFAS No. 144, Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets. Acquisitions In fiscal 2006, we completed a transaction with TTPCom Limited (TTPCom), whereby TTPCom transferred to us intellectual property, engineering resources, and related assets associated with the support and customization of TTPCom’s GSM/GPRS/EDGE modem software for use on our existing and future generations of SoftFone® baseband processors. We also acquired development rights for AJAR, TTPCom’s advanced applications platform. As a result of this transaction, we became the single point of contact for both hardware and software support for our new and existing wireless handset customers, thus improving our ability to service the needs of individual customers. We paid TTPCom $11.9 million in initial cash payments. We allocated the purchase price to the tangible and intangible assets acquired based on their estimated fair values at the date of acquisition. The estimated fair values of the assets exceeded the initial payments by $7.8 million, resulting in negative goodwill. Pursuant to SFAS No. 141, Business Combinations, we recorded a liability for the contingent consideration that was accounted for as additional purchase price, up to the amount of the negative goodwill. As contingent payments became due, we applied the payments against the contingent liability. As of October 28, 2006, we had paid $6 million of contingent payments and the remaining contingent liability was $1.8 million. The purchase price included $5.5 million of in-process technology that had not yet reached technological feasibility, had no alternative future use and was charged to operations during fiscal 2006. The in-process technology related to software code developed for use in our semiconductor chipsets manufactured for devices that use both the 2G and 2.5G cellular wireless technology standards. We determined the fair value of the in-process technology with the assistance of a third party using the income approach. At the time of the acquisition, the in-process technology was approximately 56% complete. We completed the in-process research and development projects during fiscal 2007. During fiscal 2007, we paid an additional $6.1 million of contingent consideration, which resulted in reducing the $1.8 million liability and recording additional goodwill of $4.3 million. All technological milestones have been met and no additional payments will be made. The acquisition also included $13.2 million of intangible assets that we were amortizing over their estimated useful lives of five years using an accelerated amortization method that reflects the estimated pattern of economic use. As a result of the sale of our Baseband Chipset Business to MediaTek Inc., we reclassified $7.9 million of net intangible assets to assets of discontinued operations at November 3, 2007 and transferred them to MediaTek Inc. during the first quarter of fiscal 2008. See Note 2u. in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements contained in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information on assets of discontinued operations. 32 Table of Contents In fiscal 2006, we acquired substantially all the outstanding stock of privately-held Integrant Technologies, Inc. (Integrant) of Seoul, Korea. The acquisition enabled us to enter the mobile TV market and strengthened our presence in the Asian region. We paid $127.2 million in initial cash payments at closing and were obligated to make additional cash payments of up to an aggregate of $33 million upon the satisfaction of certain conditions. The initial cash payments included $4.2 million held in escrow for the purchase of the remaining non-founder outstanding shares. We purchased these shares during fiscal 2007 and recorded them as additional goodwill. We allocated the purchase price to the tangible and intangible assets acquired based on their estimated fair values at the date of acquisition. We completed the final purchase accounting for this transaction during fiscal 2007, which resulted in an additional $5.6 million of goodwill. The $33 million of potential cash payments is comprised of $25 million for the achievement of revenue-based milestones during the period from July 2006 through December 2007, none of which were met, and $8.4 million related to the purchase of shares from the founder of Integrant during the period from July 2007 through July 2009. We recorded or will record these payments as additional purchase price. We have paid $6.3 million to repurchase founder shares through November 1, 2008 and will make the remaining $2.1 million payment during fiscal 2009. The purchase price included $11.1 million of in-process technology that had not yet reached technological feasibility, had no alternative future use and was charged to operations during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2006. The in-process technology related to technologies currently in development for Dual DAB, T-DMB, DVB-H, RFID and WiBro applications. We determined the fair value of the in-process technology with the assistance of a third party using the income forecast approach. At the time of the acquisition, the in-process technology was approximately 74% complete. We completed the in-process research and development projects during fiscal 2007. The acquisition also included $21.6 million of intangible assets that we are amortizing over their estimated useful lives of two to five years using an accelerated amortization method that reflects the estimated pattern of economic use. In fiscal 2006, we acquired all the outstanding stock of privately-held AudioAsics A/S (AudioAsics) of Roskilde, Denmark. The acquisition of AudioAsics allows us to continue developing low-power audio solutions, while expanding our presence in the Nordic and Eastern European regions. We paid $19.3 million in initial cash payments at closing and may be obligated to make additional cash payments of up to an aggregate of $8 million upon the satisfaction of certain conditions. We allocated the purchase price to the tangible and intangible assets acquired based on their estimated fair values at the date of acquisition. The $8 million of potential cash payments is comprised of $4.8 million for the achievement of revenue-based milestones that may be payable during the period from October 2006 through January 2009 and $3.2 million based on the achievement of technological milestones during the period from October 2006 through January 2009. If the revenue-based milestone is met by January 2009, it will be recorded as additional goodwill. The technological milestones required post-acquisition services to be rendered and, as such, we recorded them as compensation expense in fiscal 2008. These technological milestones were achieved during fiscal 2008 and will be paid during fiscal 2009. The purchase price included $5.1 million of in-process technology that had not yet reached technological feasibility, had no alternative future use and was charged to operations during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2006. The in-process technology related to technologies currently in development for analog and digital microphone pre-amplifiers. We determined the fair value of the in-process technology with the assistance of a third party using the income approach. At the time of the acquisition, the in-process technology was approximately 69% complete. We completed the in-process research and development projects during fiscal 2007. The acquisition also included $8.3 million of intangible assets that we are amortizing over their estimated useful lives of five years using an accelerated amortization method that reflects the estimated pattern of economic use. We have not provided pro forma results of operations for TTPCom, Integrant and AudioAsics herein as they were not material to us on either an individual or an aggregate basis. We included the results of operations of each acquisition in our consolidated statement of income from the date of such acquisition. Liquidity and Capital Resources Fiscal Year 2008 2007 2006 Net Cash Provided by Operations $ 669,368 $ 820,365 $ 621,102 Net Cash Provided by Operations as a % of Total Revenue 25.9 % 33.3 % 27.6 % 33 Table of Contents At November 1, 2008, cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments totaled $1,309.7 million, an increase of $228.5 million from the end of the fourth quarter of fiscal 2007. The primary sources of funds for fiscal 2008 were net cash generated from operating activities of $669.4 million, $403.2 million received from the sale of two businesses and proceeds of $94.2 million from the exercise of stock options. The principal uses of funds during fiscal 2008 were the repurchase of approximately 19.4 million shares of our common stock for an aggregate of $569.9 million, dividend payments of $222.5 million, and capital expenditures of $157.4 million. Included in the cash flow from operations is $110.4 million of tax payments related to the sale of the two businesses. Under SFAS No. 95, Statement of Cash Flows, all income tax payments are included in determining net cash flow from operating activities, but the cash received from the sale of the businesses must be reported as an investing cash inflow. We sold our Baseband Chipset Business to MediaTek Inc. and our CPU voltage regulation and PC thermal monitoring business to certain subsidiaries of ON Semiconductor Corporation during the first quarter of fiscal 2008. The cash flows from these discontinued operations have been combined with the operating, investing and financing cash flows from continuing operations (i.e. no separate classification of cash flows from discontinued operations) for all periods presented. We believe the absence of the cash flows from these discontinued operations will not have a material impact on our future liquidity and financial position. Additionally, as a result of these dispositions, we reclassified certain assets and liabilities related to these businesses to assets or liabilities of discontinued operations. See Note 2u. in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements contained in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further information regarding these discontinued operations. Fiscal Year 2008 2007 Accounts Receivable $ 315,290 $ 323,777 Days Sales Outstanding* 44 47 Inventory $ 314,629 $ 324,373 Days Cost of Sales in Inventory* 112 119 * We use the annualized fourth quarter revenue in our calculation of days sales outstanding and we use the annualized fourth quarter cost of sales in our calculation of days cost of sales in inventory. Accounts receivable at the end of fiscal 2008 decreased by $8.5 million, or 3%, from the amount at the end of fiscal 2007. This decrease was the result of lower product shipments in the last month of fiscal 2008 as compared to the last month of fiscal 2007. Inventories at the end of fiscal 2008 decreased by $9.7 million, or 3%, from the amount at the end of fiscal 2007 and days cost of sales in inventory at the end of fiscal 2008 decreased by 7 days from the amount at the end of fiscal 2007. This decrease in inventory is primarily the result of lower revenue forecasted for the first quarter of fiscal 2009 as compared to the first quarter of fiscal 2008. Current liabilities increased to $569.1 million at November 1, 2008, an increase of $21.0 million, or 4%, from $548.1 million at the end of fiscal 2007. This increase was primarily the result of an increase in accrued liabilities as a result of increases in compensation and benefit accruals and to a lesser extent an increase in deferred income on shipments to distributors as a result of our shipments to distributors in fiscal 2008 exceeding the distributors’ sales to their end customers. These increases were partially offset by a decrease in accounts payable. Net additions to property, plant and equipment including discontinued operations, were $157.4 million in fiscal 2008, $141.8 million in fiscal 2007 and $129.3 million in fiscal 2006. We expect fiscal 2009 capital expenditures to total approximately $55 million. During fiscal 2008, our Board of Directors declared cash dividends totaling $0.76 per outstanding share of common stock resulting in dividend payments of $222.5 million. The payment of future dividends, if any, will be based on several factors, including our financial performance, outlook and liquidity. After the end of the fiscal year, on November 20, 2008, our Board of Directors declared a cash dividend of $0.20 per outstanding share of our common stock. The dividend is payable on December 24, 2008 to shareholders of record on December 5, 2008 and is expected to total approximately $58.2 million. 34 Table of Contents Our common stock repurchase program has been in place since August 2004. In the aggregate, the Board of Directors has authorized us to repurchase $4 billion of our common stock under the program. Under the program, we may repurchase outstanding shares of our common stock from time to time in the open market and through privately negotiated transactions. Unless terminated earlier by resolution of our Board of Directors, the repurchase program will expire when we have repurchased all shares authorized under the program. We repurchased approximately 19.4 million shares for approximately $569.9 million during fiscal 2008. As of November 1, 2008, we had repurchased a total of approximately 114.5 million shares of our common stock for approximately $3,904.7 million under this program and an additional $95.4 million remains under the current authorized program. The repurchased shares are held as authorized but unissued shares of common stock. We also from time to time repurchase shares in settlement of employee tax withholding obligations due upon the vesting of restricted stock or restricted stock units or the exercise of stock options. Any future common stock repurchases will be dependent upon the amount of cash we have available to us in the United States. At November 1, 2008, our principal source of liquidity was $1,309.7 million of cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments. As of November 1, 2008, approximately $89.0 million of our cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments were held in the United States. The balance of our cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments was held outside the United States in various foreign subsidiaries. As we intend to reinvest certain of our foreign earnings indefinitely, this cash is not available to meet certain of our cash requirements in the United States, including for cash dividends and common stock repurchases. As a result, we entered into a five-year $165 million unsecured revolving credit facility in May 2008 in order to supplement our occasional cash requirements in the United States. To date, we have not borrowed under this credit facility but we may borrow in the future and use the proceeds for support of commercial paper issuance, stock repurchases, dividend payments, acquisitions, capital expenditures, working capital and other lawful corporate purposes. The volatility in the credit markets has generally diminished liquidity and capital availability in worldwide markets. We are unable to predict the likely duration and severity of the current disruptions in the credit and financial markets and adverse global economic conditions. However, we believe that our existing sources of liquidity and cash expected to be generated from future operations, together with existing and anticipated available long-term financing, will be sufficient to fund operations, capital expenditures, research and development efforts, dividend payments (if any) and purchases of stock (if any) under our stock repurchase program for at least the next twelve months. The table below summarizes our contractual obligations and the amounts we owe under these contracts in specified periods as of November 1, 2008: Payment due by period Less than More than (thousands) Total 1 Year 1-3 Years 4-5 Years 5 Years Contractual obligations: Operating leasesa $ 83,492 $ 27,929 $ 36,201 $ 8,802 $ 10,560 Deferred compensation planb 32,742 942 — — 31,800 Pension fundingc 7,624 7,624 — — — Total $ 123,858 $ 36,495 $ 36,201 $ 8,802 $ 42,360 (a) Certain of our operating lease obligations include escalation clauses. These escalating payment requirements are reflected in the table. (b) These payments relate to obligations under our deferred compensation plan. The deferred compensation plan allows certain members of management and other highly-compensated employees and non-employee directors to defer receipt of all or any portion of their compensation. Prior to January 1, 2005, participants could also defer gains on stock options and restricted stock granted before July 23, 1997. The amount in the “More than 5 Years” column of the table represents the remaining total balance under the deferred compensation plan to be paid to participants who have not terminated employment. Since we cannot reasonably estimate the timing of withdrawals for participants who have not yet terminated employment we have included the future obligation 35 Table of Contents to these participants in the “More than 5 Years” column of the table. All other columns represent installment payments to be made to those employees who have retired or are on long-term disability. (c) Our funding policy for our foreign defined benefit plans is consistent with the local requirements of each country. The payment obligations in the table are estimates of our expected contributions to these plans for fiscal year 2009. The actual future payments may differ from the amounts presented in the table and reasonable estimates of payments beyond one year are not practical because of potential future changes in variables such as plan asset performance, interest rates and the rate of increase in compensation levels. Purchase orders for the purchase of raw materials and other goods and services are not included in the table above. We are not able to determine the total amount of these purchase orders that represent contractual obligations, as purchase orders may represent authorizations to purchase rather than binding agreements. In addition, our purchase orders generally allow for cancellation without significant penalties. We do not have significant agreements for the purchase of raw materials or other goods specifying minimum quantities or set prices that exceed our expected short-term requirements. As of November 1, 2008, our total liabilities associated with uncertain tax positions under FIN 48 was $20.2 million, which are included in “Other non-current liabilities” in our Consolidated Balance Sheet contained in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K as a result of our adoption of FIN 48. Due to the complexity associated with our tax uncertainties, we cannot make a reasonably reliable estimate of the period in which we expect to settle the non-current liabilities associated with these uncertain tax positions. Therefore, we have not included these uncertain tax positions in the above contractual obligations table. The expected timing of payments and the amounts of the obligations discussed above are estimated based on current information. Off-balance Sheet Financing As of November 1, 2008, we had no off-balance sheet financing arrangements. Outlook The following statements are based on current expectations. These statements are forward-looking, and actual results may differ materially. Unless specifically mentioned, these statements do not give effect to the potential impact of any mergers, acquisitions, divestitures, or business combinations that may be announced or closed after the date of filing this report. These statements supersede all prior statements regarding business outlook made by us. The global credit crisis and deteriorating economic conditions have resulted in more cautious customer spending behavior and generally lower demand. Order rates slowed in late September 2008, and backlog declined significantly from the prior quarter, which limits our short-term visibility into future revenues. Forecasting revenue in this environment is difficult. Our operating plan is for revenue to decline approximately 20% in the first quarter of fiscal 2009 from revenue in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2008. We are planning to take steps to avoid a large inventory buildup by significantly reducing manufacturing output, which we expect will temporarily impact our gross margin by approximately 3 to 4 percentage points. We are therefore planning for gross margin to be approximately 57% to 58% in the first quarter of fiscal 2009, depending on the actual product mix and level of sales we achieve. Further, we are planning to take actions in the first quarter of fiscal 2009 that we expect will result in operating expense reductions from fourth quarter levels of approximately 10%, or $25 million. We expect to realize over half of that savings in the first quarter of fiscal 2009 and the balance in the second quarter of fiscal 2009. As a result of these anticipated actions, we plan to record a restructuring charge in the first quarter of fiscal 2009. We are currently in the process of finalizing our plans to reduce costs and are unable to determine the amount of the restructuring charge at this point. Assuming these levels of sales and resulting gross margin, anticipated cost reductions, and an effective tax rate of 22%, we expect diluted earnings per share from continuing operations in the first quarter of fiscal 2009 to be approximately $0.22 to $0.23, excluding restructuring charges. We are responding to the current economic environment by taking actions that we expect will reduce expenses in the short-term while strengthening our position for the long-term. We anticipate that our variable and discretionary cost reductions will fluctuate with general economic conditions, while the actions related to realigning our product 36 Table of Contents portfolio and streamlining our manufacturing infrastructure will result in short-term savings as well as a lower cost structure. While we believe that we have taken steps to mitigate the short-term reduction in our earnings and position ourselves for significant earnings leverage when growth resumes, there can be no assurances that market conditions will improve or that our actions will be sufficient to counteract those market conditions. New Accounting Pronouncements Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities In March 2008, the FASB issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 161, Disclosures about Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities — an amendment of FASB Statement No. 133 (SFAS 161). SFAS 161 changes the disclosure requirements for derivative instruments and hedging activities. SFAS 161 requires entities to provide enhanced disclosures about how and why an entity uses derivative instruments; how derivative instruments and related hedged items are accounted for under SFAS 133 and its related interpretations; and how derivative instruments and related hedged items affect an entity’s financial position, financial performance and cash flows. This statement is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years and interim periods beginning after November 15, 2008. We are currently evaluating the impact, if any, that SFAS 161 may have on our financial condition and results of operations. The adoption of SFAS 161 will change our disclosures for derivative instruments and hedging activities beginning in the second quarter of fiscal year 2009. Business Combinations In December 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 141 (revised 2007), Business Combinations (SFAS 141R). SFAS 141R requires an acquiring entity in a business combination to recognize the assets acquired, liabilities assumed and any noncontrolling interest in the acquiree at their fair value on the acquisition date. It further requires that acquisition-related costs and restructuring costs be recognized separately from the acquisition. SFAS 141R is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2008, which is our fiscal year 2010. We are currently evaluating the impact, if any, that SFAS 141R may have on our financial condition and results of operations. The adoption of SFAS 141R will change our accounting treatment for business combinations on a prospective basis beginning in the first quarter of fiscal year 2010. Noncontrolling Interests In December 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 160, Noncontrolling Interests in Consolidated Financial Statements (SFAS 160). SFAS 160 clarifies that a noncontrolling or minority interest in a subsidiary is considered an ownership interest and, accordingly, requires all entities to report such interests in subsidiaries as equity in the consolidated financial statements. SFAS 160 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2008, which is our fiscal year 2010. We are currently evaluating the impact, if any, that SFAS 160 may have on our financial condition and results of operations. Accounting for Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities In February 2007, the FASB, issued SFAS No. 159, The Fair Value Option for Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities — Including an amendment of FASB Statement No. 115 (SFAS 159). SFAS 159 permits entities to choose to measure many financial instruments and certain other items at fair value. The objective is to improve financial reporting by providing entities with the opportunity to mitigate volatility in reported earnings caused by measuring related assets and liabilities differently without having to apply complex hedge accounting provisions. SFAS 159 is effective for fiscal years beginning after November 15, 2007, which is our fiscal year 2009. We are currently evaluating the impact, if any, that SFAS 159 may have on our financial condition and results of operations. Fair Value Measurements In September 2006, the FASB issued SFAS No. 157, Fair Value Measurements (SFAS 157). SFAS 157 provides enhanced guidance for using fair value to measure assets and liabilities. The standard also provides for expanded information about the extent to which companies measure assets and liabilities at fair value, the information used to measure fair value and the effect of fair value measurements on earnings. SFAS 157 applies 37 Table of Contents whenever other standards require or permit assets or liabilities to be measured at fair value. This standard does not expand the use of fair value in any new circumstances. SFAS 157 is effective for fiscal years beginning after November 15, 2007, which is our fiscal year 2009. The adoption of SFAS 157 in the first quarter of fiscal 2009 will not materially impact our financial condition and results of operations. The adoption of SFAS 157 will expand our disclosures pertaining to the measurement of assets and liabilities beginning in the first quarter of fiscal year 2009. Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates Management’s discussion and analysis of the financial condition and results of operations is based upon the consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue and expenses, and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. We base our estimates and judgments on historical experience, knowledge of current conditions and beliefs of what could occur in the future based on available information. We consider the following accounting policies to be both those most important to the portrayal of our financial condition and those that require the most subjective judgment. If actual results differ significantly from management’s estimates and projections, there could be a material effect on our financial statements. We also have other policies that we consider key accounting policies, such as our policy for revenue recognition, including the deferral of revenue on sales to distributors until the products are sold to the end user; however, the application of these policies does not require us to make significant estimates or judgments that are difficult or subjective. Inventory Valuation We value inventories at the lower of cost (first-in, first-out method) or market. Because of the cyclical nature of the semiconductor industry, changes in inventory levels, obsolescence of technology, and product life cycles, we write down inventories to net realizable value. We employ a variety of methodologies to determine the net realizable value of inventory. While a portion of the calculation is determined via reference to the age of inventory and lower of cost or market calculations, an element of the calculation is subject to significant judgments made by us about future demand for our inventory. If actual demand for our products is less than our estimates, additional adjustments to existing inventories may need to be recorded in future periods. To date our actual results have not been materially different than our estimates, and we do not expect them to be materially different in the future. Allowance for Doubtful Accounts We maintain allowances for doubtful accounts, when appropriate, for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments. If the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate, our actual losses may exceed our estimates, and additional allowances would be required. To date our actual results have not been materially different than our estimates, and we do not expect them to be materially different in the future. Long-Lived Assets We review property, plant, and equipment and intangible assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of assets may not be recoverable. Recoverability of these assets is measured by comparison of their carrying value to future undiscounted cash flows that the assets are expected to generate over their remaining economic lives. If such assets are considered to be impaired, the impairment to be recognized in earnings equals the amount by which the carrying value of the assets exceeds their fair value determined by either a quoted market price, if any, or a value determined by utilizing a discounted cash flow technique. Although we have recognized no material impairment adjustments related to our property, plant, and equipment and identified intangible assets during the past three fiscal years, except those made in conjunction with restructuring actions, deterioration in our business in the future could lead to such impairment adjustments in future periods. Evaluation of impairment of long-lived assets requires estimates of future operating results that are used in the preparation of the expected future undiscounted cash flows. Actual future operating results and the remaining economic lives of our long-lived assets could differ from the estimates used in assessing the recoverability of these assets. These differences could result in impairment charges, which could have a material adverse impact on our 38 Table of Contents results of operations. In addition, in certain instances, assets may not be impaired but their estimated useful lives may have decreased. In these situations, we amortize the remaining net book values over the revised useful lives. Goodwill In accordance with SFAS 142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets, goodwill is subject to annual impairment tests, or earlier if indicators of potential impairment exist and suggest that the carrying value of goodwill may not be recoverable from estimated discounted future cash flows. Because we have one reporting segment under SFAS 142, we utilize the entity-wide approach to assess goodwill for impairment and compare our market value to our net book value to determine if an impairment exists. These impairment tests may result in impairment losses that could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations. Accounting for Income Taxes We must make certain estimates and judgments in determining income tax expense for financial statement purposes. These estimates and judgments occur in the calculation of tax credits, benefits, and deductions, and in the calculation of certain tax assets and liabilities, which arise from differences in the timing of the recognition of revenue and expense for tax and financial statement purposes, as well as the interest and penalties relating to these uncertain tax positions. We assessed the likelihood of the realization of deferred tax assets and concluded that a valuation allowance is needed to reserve the amount of the deferred tax assets that may not be realized due to the expiration of certain state credit carryovers. In reaching our conclusion, we evaluated certain relevant criteria including the existence of deferred tax liabilities that can be used to absorb deferred tax assets, the taxable income in prior carryback years in the impacted state jurisdictions that can be used to absorb net operating losses and taxable income in future years. Our judgments regarding future profitability may change due to future market conditions, changes in U.S. or international tax laws and other factors. These changes, if any, may require material adjustments to these deferred tax assets, resulting in a reduction in net income or an increase in net loss in the period when such determinations are made, which in turn, may result in an increase or decrease to our tax provision in a subsequent period. On November 4, 2007 (the first day of our 2008 fiscal year), we adopted FASB Interpretation No. 48, Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes — an interpretation of FASB Statement No. 109 (FIN 48). FIN 48 differs from the prior standards in that it requires companies to determine that it is “more likely than not” that a tax position will be sustained by the appropriate taxing authorities before any benefit can be recorded in the financial statements. An uncertain income tax position is not recognized if it has less than a 50% likelihood of being sustained. For those tax positions where it is more likely than not that a tax benefit will be sustained, we have recorded the largest amount of tax benefit with a greater than 50 percent likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement with a taxing authority that has full knowledge of all relevant information. For those income tax positions where it is not more likely than not that a tax benefit will be sustained, no tax benefit has been recognized in the financial statements. We reevaluate these uncertain tax positions on a quarterly basis. This evaluation is based on factors including, but not limited to, changes in known facts or circumstances, changes in tax law, effectively settled issues under audit, and new audit activity. A change in these factors would result in the recognition of a tax benefit or an additional charge to the tax provision. In the ordinary course of global business, there are many transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax outcome is uncertain. Some of these uncertainties arise as a consequence of cost reimbursement and royalty arrangements among related entities. Although we believe our estimates are reasonable, no assurance can be given that the final tax outcome of these matters will not be different than that which is reflected in our historical income tax provisions and accruals. In the event our assumptions are incorrect, the differences could have a material impact on our income tax provision and operating results in the period in which such determination is made. Stock-Based Compensation The adoption of SFAS 123R in the first quarter of fiscal 2006 required that stock-based compensation expense associated with stock options and related awards be recognized in the statement of income, rather than being disclosed in a pro forma footnote to the consolidated financial statements. Determining the amount of stock-based 39 Table of Contents compensation to be recorded requires us to develop estimates to be used in calculating the grant-date fair value of stock options. We calculate the grant-date fair values using the Black-Scholes valuation model. The use of valuation models requires us to make estimates of the following assumptions: Expected volatility — We are responsible for estimating volatility and have considered a number of factors, including third-party estimates, when estimating volatility. We currently believe that the exclusive use of implied volatility results in the best estimate of the grant-date fair value of employee stock options because it reflects the market’s current expectations of future volatility. In evaluating the appropriateness of exclusively relying on implied volatility, we concluded that: (1) options in the Company’s common stock are actively traded with sufficient volume on several exchanges; (2) the market prices of both the traded options and the underlying shares are measured at a similar point in time to each other and on a date close to the grant date of the employee share options; (3) the traded options have exercise prices that are both near-the-money and close to the exercise price of the employee share options; and (4) the maturities of the traded options used to estimate volatility are at least one year. Expected term — We use historical employee exercise and option expiration data to estimate the expected term assumption for the Black-Scholes grant-date valuation. We believe that this historical data is currently the best estimate of the expected term of a new option, and that generally, all of our employees exhibit similar exercise behavior. In general, the longer the expected term used in the Black-Scholes valuation model, the higher the grant-date fair value of the option. Risk-free interest rate — The yield on zero-coupon U.S. Treasury securities for a period that is commensurate with the expected term assumption is used as the risk-free interest rate. Expected dividend yield — Expected dividend yield is calculated by annualizing the cash dividend declared by our Board of Directors for the current quarter and dividing that result by the closing stock price on the date of grant of the option. Until such time as our Board of Directors declares a cash dividend for an amount that is different from the current quarter’s cash dividend, the current dividend will be used in deriving this assumption. Cash dividends are not paid on options, restricted stock or restricted stock units. The amount of stock-based compensation expense recognized during a period is based on the value of the portion of the awards that are ultimately expected to vest. SFAS 123R requires forfeitures to be estimated at the time of grant and revised, if necessary, in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates. The term “forfeitures” is distinct from “cancellations” or “expirations” and represents only the unvested portion of the surrendered option. Based on an analysis of our historical forfeitures, we have applied an annual forfeiture rate of 4.3% to all unvested stock-based awards as of November 1, 2008. The rate of 4.3% represents the portion that is expected to be forfeited each year over the vesting period. This analysis is re-evaluated quarterly and the forfeiture rate is adjusted as necessary. Ultimately, the actual expense recognized over the vesting period will only be for those awards that vest. Contingencies From time to time, we receive notices that our products or manufacturing processes allegedly infringe the patent or intellectual property rights of others. We periodically assess each matter to determine if a contingent liability should be recorded in accordance with SFAS 5, Accounting for Contingencies. In making this determination, we may, depending on the nature of the matter, consult with internal and external legal counsel and technical experts. Based on the information we obtain, combined with our judgment regarding all the facts and circumstances of each matter, we determine whether it is probable that a contingent loss may be incurred and whether the amount of such loss can be reasonably estimated. If a loss is probable and reasonably estimable, we record a contingent loss in accordance with SFAS 5. In determining the amount of a contingent loss, we consider advice received from experts in the specific matter, current status of legal proceedings, settlement negotiations that may be ongoing, prior case history and other factors. If the judgments and estimates made by us are incorrect, we may need to record additional contingent losses that could materially adversely impact our results of operations. See Note 12 in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements contained in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information regarding our commitments and contingencies. 40 Table of Contents ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK Interest Rate Exposure Based on our marketable securities and short term investments outstanding as of November 1, 2008 and November 3, 2007, our annual interest income would change by approximately $14 million and $9 million, respectively, for each 100 basis point increase or decrease in interest rates. The fair values of our investment portfolio at November 1, 2008 and November 3, 2007 would each change by approximately $2 million for each 100 basis point increase or decrease in rates. Foreign Currency Exposure As more fully described in Note 2i. in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements contained in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, we regularly hedge our non-U.S. dollar-based exposures by entering into forward foreign currency exchange contracts. The terms of these contracts are for periods matching the duration of the underlying exposure and generally range from one month to twelve months. Currently, our largest foreign currency exposure is the Euro, primarily because our European operations have the highest proportion of our local currency denominated expenses. Relative to foreign currency exposures existing at November 1, 2008 and November 3, 2007, a 10% unfavorable movement in foreign currency exchange rates would not expose us to significant losses in earnings or cash flows because we hedge substantially all of our year-end exposures against fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. The market risk associated with our derivative instruments results from currency exchange rate or interest rate movements that are expected to offset the market risk of the underlying transactions, assets and liabilities being hedged. The counterparties to the agreements relating to our foreign exchange instruments consist of a number of major international financial institutions with high credit ratings. We do not believe that there is significant risk of nonperformance by these counterparties because we continually monitor the credit ratings of such counterparties, and limit the financial exposure with any one financial institution. While the contract or notional amounts of derivative financial instruments provide one measure of the volume of these transactions, they do not represent the amount of our exposure to credit risk. The amounts potentially subject to credit risk (arising from the possible inability of counterparties to meet the terms of their contracts) are generally limited to the amounts, if any, by which the counterparties’ obligations under the contracts exceed our obligations to the counterparties. The following table illustrates the effect that a 10% unfavorable or favorable movement in foreign currency exchange rates, relative to the U.S. dollar, would have on the fair value of our forward exchange contracts as of November 1, 2008 and November 3, 2007: November 1, 2008 November 3, 2007 Fair value of forward exchange contracts (liability) asset $ (23,158 ) $ 6,924 Fair value of forward exchange contracts after a 10% unfavorable movement in foreign currency exchange rates (liability) asset $ (9,457 ) $ 24,414 Fair value of forward exchange contracts after a 10% favorable movement in foreign currency exchange rates liability $ (38,294 ) $ (9,233 ) The calculation assumes that each exchange rate would change in the same direction relative to the U.S. dollar. In addition to the direct effects of changes in exchange rates, such changes typically affect the volume of sales or the foreign currency sales price as competitors’ products become more or less attractive. Our sensitivity analysis of the effects of changes in foreign currency exchange rates does not factor in a potential change in sales levels or local currency selling prices. 41 Table of Contents",2023-12-30 19:09:03.749415
