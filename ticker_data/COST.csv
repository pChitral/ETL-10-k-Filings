We are principally engaged in the operation of membership warehouses in the United States (U.S.) and Puerto Rico, Canada, United Kingdom (U.K.), Mexico, Japan, Korea, Australia, Spain, France, Iceland, China, and through a majority-owned subsidiary in Taiwan. Costco operated 782, 762, and 741 warehouses worldwide at September 1, 2019, September 2, 2018, and September 3, 2017, respectively. Our common stock trades on the NASDAQ Global Select Market, under the symbol “COST.”We report on a 52/53-week fiscal year, consisting of thirteen four-week periods and ending on the Sunday nearest the end of August. The first three quarters consist of three periods each, and the fourth quarter consists of four periods (five weeks in the thirteenth period in a 53-week year). The material seasonal impact in our operations is increased net sales and earnings during the winter holiday season. References to 2019 and 2018 relate to the 52-week fiscal years ended September 1, 2019, and September 2, 2018, respectively. References to 2017 relate to the 53-week fiscal year ended September 3, 2017.GeneralWe operate membership warehouses based on the concept that offering our members low prices on a limited selection of nationally branded and private-label products in a wide range of categories will produce high sales volumes and rapid inventory turnover. When combined with the operating efficiencies achieved by volume purchasing, efficient distribution and reduced handling of merchandise in no-frills, self-service warehouse facilities, these volumes and turnover enable us to operate profitably at significantly lower gross margins (net sales less merchandise costs) than most other retailers. We generally sell inventory before we are required to pay for it, even while taking advantage of early payment discounts. We buy most of our merchandise directly from manufacturers and route it to cross-docking consolidation points (depots) or directly to our warehouses. Our depots receive large shipments from manufacturers and quickly ship these goods to warehouses. This process creates freight volume and handling efficiencies, lowering costs associated with traditional multiple-step distribution channels.Our average warehouse space is approximately 146,000 square feet, with newer units being slightly larger. Floor plans are designed for economy and efficiency in the use of selling space, the handling of merchandise, 3Table of Contentsand the control of inventory. Because shoppers are attracted principally by the quality of merchandise and low prices, our warehouses are not elaborate. By strictly controlling the entrances and exits and using a membership format, we believe our inventory losses (shrinkage) are well below those of typical retail operations.Our warehouses on average operate on a seven-day, 70-hour week. Gasoline operations generally have extended hours. Because the hours of operation are shorter than other retailers, and due to other efficiencies inherent in a warehouse-type operation, labor costs are lower relative to the volume of sales. Merchandise is generally stored on racks above the sales floor and displayed on pallets containing large quantities, reducing labor required. In general, with variations by country, our warehouses accept certain credit cards, including Costco co-branded cards, debit cards, cash, checks, and our proprietary stored-value card (shop card). Our strategy is to provide our members with a broad range of high-quality merchandise at prices we believe are consistently lower than elsewhere. We seek to limit items to fast-selling models, sizes, and colors. We carry an average of approximately 3,700 active stock keeping units (SKUs) per warehouse in our core warehouse business, significantly less than other broadline retailers. Many consumable products are offered for sale in case, carton, or multiple-pack quantities only.In keeping with our policy of member satisfaction, we generally accept returns of merchandise. On certain electronic items, we typically have a 90-day return policy and provide, free of charge, technical support services, as well as an extended warranty. Additional third-party warranty coverage is sold on certain electronic items.We offer merchandise in the following categories:•Food and Sundries (including dry foods, packaged foods, groceries, snack foods, candy, alcoholic and nonalcoholic beverages, and cleaning supplies)•Hardlines (including major appliances, electronics, health and beauty aids, hardware, and garden and patio)•Fresh Foods (including meat, produce, deli, and bakery)•Softlines (including apparel and small appliances)•Ancillary (including gasoline and pharmacy businesses)Ancillary businesses within or next to our warehouses provide expanded products and services, encouraging members to shop more frequently. These businesses include gas stations, pharmacies, optical dispensing centers, food courts, and hearing-aid centers. The number of warehouses with gas stations varies significantly by country, and we do not currently operate our gasoline business in Korea, France or China. We operated 593 gas stations at the end of 2019. Net sales for our gasoline business represented approximately 11% of total net sales in 2019.Our e-commerce operations allow us to connect with our members online and provide additional products and services, many not found in our warehouses. At the end of 2019, we operated e-commerce websites in the U.S., Canada, Mexico, U.K., Korea, and Taiwan. Net sales for e-commerce represented approximately 4% of total net sales in 2019. Additionally, we offer business delivery, travel and various other services online in certain countries.We have direct buying relationships with many producers of national brand-name merchandise. We do not obtain a significant portion of merchandise from any one supplier. We generally have not experienced difficulty in obtaining sufficient quantities of merchandise and believe that if current sources of supply became unavailable, we would be able to obtain alternative sources without substantial disruption of our business. We also purchase and manufacture private-label merchandise, as long as quality and member demand are high and the value to our members is significant.4Table of ContentsCertain financial information for our segments and geographic areas is included in Note 11 to the consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this Report.Membership Our members may utilize their memberships at our warehouses worldwide. Gold Star memberships are available to individuals; Business memberships are limited to businesses, including individuals with a business license, retail sales license or comparable document. Business members may add additional cardholders (affiliates), to which the same annual fee applies. Affiliates are not available for Gold Star members. Our annual fee for these memberships is $60 in our U.S. and Canadian operations and varies in other countries. All paid memberships include a free household card. Our member renewal rate was 91% in the U.S. and Canada and 88% on a worldwide basis at the end of 2019. The majority of members renew within six months following their renewal date. Our renewal rate is a trailing calculation that captures renewals during the period seven to eighteen months prior to the reporting date. Our membership was made up of the following (in thousands): 2019 2018 2017Gold Star42,900 40,700 38,600Business, including affiliates11,000 10,900 10,800Total paid members53,900 51,600 49,400Household cards44,600 42,700 40,900 Total cardholders98,500 94,300 90,300Paid cardholders (except affiliates) are eligible to upgrade to an Executive membership in the U.S. and Canada, for an additional annual fee of $60. Executive memberships are also available in Mexico, the U.K., and Korea, for which the additional annual fee varies. Executive members earn a 2% reward on qualified purchases (up to a maximum reward of $1,000 per year in the U.S. and Canada and varies in Mexico, the U.K. and Korea), which can be redeemed only at Costco warehouses. This program also offers (except in Mexico and Korea), access to additional savings and benefits on various business and consumer services, such as auto and home insurance, the Costco auto purchase program, and check printing. These services are generally provided by third parties and vary by state and country. Executive members, who represented 39% of paid members at the end of 2019, generally shop more frequently and spend more than other members.LaborOur employee count was as follows: 2019 2018 2017Full-time employees149,000 143,000 133,000Part-time employees105,000 102,000 98,000Total employees254,000 245,000 231,000Approximately 16,000 employees are union employees. We consider our employee relations to be very good.5Table of ContentsCompetitionOur industry is highly competitive, based on factors such as price, merchandise quality and selection, location, convenience, distribution strategy, and customer service. We compete on a worldwide basis with global, national, and regional wholesalers and retailers, including supermarkets, supercenters, internet retailers, gasoline stations, hard discounters, department and specialty stores, and operators selling a single category or narrow range of merchandise. Walmart, Target, Kroger, and Amazon.com are among our significant general merchandise retail competitors. We also compete with other warehouse clubs (primarily Walmart’s Sam’s Club and BJ’s Wholesale Club), and many of the major metropolitan areas in the U.S. and certain of our Other International locations have multiple club operations.Intellectual PropertyWe believe that, to varying degrees, our trademarks, trade names, copyrights, proprietary processes, trade secrets, trade dress, domain names and similar intellectual property add significant value to our business and are important to our success. We have invested significantly in the development and protection of our well-recognized brands, including the Costco Wholesale® trademarks and our private-label brand, Kirkland Signature®. We believe that Kirkland Signature products are high quality, offered to our members at prices that are generally lower than national brands, and that they help lower costs, differentiate our merchandise offerings, and generally earn higher margins. We expect to continue to increase the sales penetration of our private-label items.We rely on trademark and copyright laws, trade-secret protection, and confidentiality, license and other agreements with our suppliers, employees and others to protect our intellectual property. The availability and duration of trademark registrations vary by country; however, trademarks are generally valid and may be renewed indefinitely as long as they are in use and registrations are maintained.Available InformationOur U.S. website is www.costco.com. We make available through the Investor Relations section of that site, free of charge, our Annual Reports on Form 10-K, Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q, Current Reports on Form 8-K, Proxy Statements and Forms 3, 4 and 5, and any amendments to those reports, as soon as reasonably practicable after filing such materials with or furnishing such documents to the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). The information found on our website is not part of this or any other report filed with or furnished to the SEC. The SEC maintains a site that contains reports, proxy and information statements, and other information regarding issuers, such as the Company, that file electronically with the SEC at www.sec.gov.We have adopted a code of ethics for senior financial officers pursuant to Section 406 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act.

We could also be affected by additional risks that apply to all companies operating in the U.S. and globally, as well as other risks that are not presently known to us or that we currently consider to be immaterial. These Risk Factors should be carefully reviewed in conjunction with Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations in Item 7 and our consolidated financial statements and related notes in Item 8 of this Report.Business and Operating RisksWe are highly dependent on the financial performance of our U.S. and Canadian operations.Our financial and operational performance is highly dependent on our U.S. and Canadian operations, which comprised 87% and 84% of net sales and operating income in 2019, respectively. Within the U.S., we are highly dependent on our California operations, which comprised 30% of U.S. net sales in 2019. Our California market, in general, has a larger percentage of higher volume warehouses as compared to our other domestic markets. Any substantial slowing or sustained decline in these operations could materially adversely affect our business and financial results. Declines in financial performance of our U.S. operations, particularly in California, and our Canadian operations could arise from, among other things: slow growth or declines in comparable warehouse sales (comparable sales); negative trends in operating expenses, including increased labor, healthcare and energy costs; failing to meet targets for warehouse openings; cannibalizing existing locations with new warehouses; shifts in sales mix toward lower gross margin products; changes or uncertainties in economic conditions in our markets, including higher levels of unemployment and depressed home values; and failing to consistently provide high quality and innovative new products.We may be unsuccessful implementing our growth strategy, including expanding our business in existing markets and new markets, which could have an adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations.Our growth is dependent, in part, on our ability to acquire property and build or lease new warehouses and depots. We compete with other retailers and businesses for suitable locations. Local land use and other regulations restricting the construction and operation of our warehouses and depots, as well as local community actions opposed to the location of our warehouses or depots at specific sites and the adoption of local laws restricting our operations and environmental regulations, may impact our ability to find suitable locations and increase the cost of sites and of constructing, leasing and operating warehouses and depots. We also may have difficulty negotiating leases or purchase agreements on acceptable terms. In addition, certain jurisdictions have enacted or proposed laws and regulations that would prevent or restrict the operation or expansion plans of certain large retailers and warehouse clubs, including us. Failure to effectively manage these and other similar factors may affect our ability to timely build or lease and operate new warehouses and depots, which could have a material adverse effect on our future growth and profitability.We seek to expand in existing markets to attain a greater overall market share. A new warehouse may draw members away from our existing warehouses and adversely affect their comparable sales performance, member traffic, and profitability.We intend to continue to open warehouses in new markets, including China. Associated risks include difficulties in attracting members due to a lack of familiarity with us, attracting members of other wholesale club operators, our lesser familiarity with local member preferences, and seasonal differences in the market. Entry into new markets may bring us into competition with new competitors or with existing competitors with a large, established market presence. We cannot ensure that new warehouses and new e-commerce websites will be profitable and, as a result, future profitability could be delayed or otherwise materially adversely affected.8Table of ContentsOur failure to maintain membership growth, loyalty and brand recognition could adversely affect our results of operations.Membership loyalty and growth are essential to our business. The extent to which we achieve growth in our membership base, increase the penetration of Executive members, and sustain high renewal rates materially influences our profitability. Damage to our brands or reputation may negatively impact comparable sales, diminish member trust, and reduce renewal rates and, accordingly, net sales and membership fee revenue, negatively impacting our results of operations.We sell many products under our Kirkland Signature brand. Maintaining consistent product quality, competitive pricing, and availability of these products is essential to developing and maintaining member loyalty. These products also generally carry higher margins than national brand products carried in our warehouses and represent a growing portion of our overall sales. If the Kirkland Signature brand experiences a loss of member acceptance or confidence, our sales and gross margin results could be adversely affected.Disruptions in our merchandise distribution or processing, packaging, manufacturing, and other facilities could adversely affect sales and member satisfaction.We depend on the orderly operation of the merchandise receiving and distribution process, primarily through our depots. We also rely upon processing, packaging, manufacturing and other facilities to support our business, which includes the production of certain private-label items. Although we believe that our operations are efficient, disruptions due to fires, tornadoes, hurricanes, earthquakes or other catastrophic events, labor issues or other shipping problems may result in delays in the production and delivery of merchandise to our warehouses, which could adversely affect sales and the satisfaction of our members.We may not timely identify or effectively respond to consumer trends, which could negatively affect our relationship with our members, the demand for our products and services, and our market share.It is difficult to consistently and successfully predict the products and services that our members will desire. Our success depends, in part, on our ability to identify and respond to trends in demographics and consumer preferences. Failure to identify timely or effectively respond to changing consumer tastes, preferences (including those relating to sustainability of product sources and animal welfare) and spending patterns could negatively affect our relationship with our members, the demand for our products and services, and our market share. If we are not successful at predicting our sales trends and adjusting our purchases accordingly, we may have excess inventory, which could result in additional markdowns and reduce our operating performance. This could have an adverse effect on net sales, gross margin and operating income.We rely extensively on information technology to process transactions, compile results, and manage our business. Failure or disruption of our primary and back-up systems could adversely affect our business. A failure to adequately update our existing systems and implement new systems could harm our business and adversely affect our results of operations. Given the very high volume of transactions we process it is important that we maintain uninterrupted operation of our business-critical systems. Our systems, including our back-up systems, are subject to damage or interruption from power outages, computer and telecommunications failures, computer viruses, internal or external security breaches, catastrophic events such as fires, earthquakes, tornadoes and hurricanes, and errors or misfeasance by our employees. If our systems are damaged or cease to function properly, we may have to make significant investments to fix or replace them, and we may suffer interruptions in our operations. Any material interruption in these systems could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.We are currently making and will continue to make investments to improve or advance critical information systems and processing capabilities. Failure to monitor and choose the right investments and implement them at the right pace could be harmful. The risk of system disruption is increased when significant system changes are undertaken, although we believe that our change management process should mitigate this risk. Excessive technological change could impact the effectiveness of adoption, and could make it more 9Table of Contentsdifficult for us to realize benefits. Targeting the wrong opportunities, failing to make the best investments, or making an investment commitment significantly above or below our needs could result in the loss of our competitive position and adversely impact our financial condition and results of operations. The potential problems and interruptions associated with implementing technology initiatives could disrupt or reduce the efficiency of our operations. These initiatives might not provide the anticipated benefits or may provide them on a delayed schedule or at a higher cost. We previously identified a material weakness in our internal control related to ineffective information technology general controls and if we fail to maintain an effective system of internal control in the future, this could result in loss of investor confidence and adversely impact our stock price.Internal controls related to the operation of technology systems are critical to maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting. We reported in our Annual Report on Form 10-K as of September 2, 2018, a material weakness in internal control related to ineffective information technology general controls (ITGCs) in the areas of user access and program change-management over certain information technology systems that support the Company’s financial reporting processes. During 2019, we completed the remediation measures related to the material weakness and concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of September 1, 2019. Completion of remediation does not provide assurance that our remediation or other controls will continue to operate properly. If we are unable to maintain effective internal control over financial reporting or disclosure controls and procedures, our ability to record, process and report financial information accurately, and to prepare financial statements within required time periods could be adversely affected, which could subject us to litigation or investigations requiring management resources and payment of legal and other expenses, negatively affect investor confidence in our financial statements and adversely impact our stock price.If we do not maintain the privacy and security of personal and business information, we could damage our reputation with members and employees, incur substantial additional costs, and become subject to litigation.We receive, retain, and transmit personal information about our members and employees and entrust that information to third-party business associates, including cloud service-providers that perform activities for us. Our warehouse and online businesses depend upon the secure transmission of confidential information over public networks, including information permitting cashless payments. A compromise of our security systems or defects within our hardware or software, or those of our business associates, that results in our members' or employees' information being obtained by unauthorized persons could adversely affect our reputation with our members and others, as well as our operations, results of operations, financial condition and liquidity, and could result in litigation, government actions, or the imposition of penalties. In addition, a breach could require expending significant additional resources related to the security of information systems and could disrupt our operations.The use of data by our business and our business associates is highly regulated in all of our operating countries. Privacy and information-security laws and regulations change, and compliance with them may result in cost increases due to, among other things, systems changes and the development of new processes. If we or those with whom we share information fail to comply with laws and regulations, such as the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA), our reputation could be damaged, possibly resulting in lost business, and we could be subjected to additional legal risk or financial losses as a result of non-compliance.We have security measures and controls to protect personal and business information and continue to make investments to secure access to our information technology network. These measures may be undermined, however, due to the actions of outside parties, employee error, internal or external malfeasance, or otherwise, and, as a result an unauthorized party may obtain access to our data systems and misappropriate business and personal information. Because the techniques used to obtain unauthorized access, disable or degrade service, or sabotage systems change frequently and may not immediately produce signs of intrusion, we may be unable to anticipate these techniques, timely discover or counter them, or implement adequate 10Table of Contentspreventative measures. Any such breach or unauthorized access could result in significant legal and financial exposure, damage to our reputation, and potentially have an adverse effect on our business and results of operations.We are subject to payment-related risks.We accept payments using a variety of methods, including cash and checks, select credit and debit cards, and our shop card. As we offer new payment options to our members, we may be subject to additional rules, regulations, compliance requirements, and higher fraud losses. For certain payment methods, we pay interchange and other related acceptance fees, along with additional transaction processing fees. We rely on third parties to provide payment transaction processing services for credit and debit cards and our shop card. It could disrupt our business if these companies become unwilling or unable to provide these services to us. We are also subject to evolving payment card association and network operating rules, including data security rules, certification requirements and rules governing electronic funds transfers. For example, we are subject to Payment Card Industry Data Security Standards (“PCI DSS”), which contain compliance guidelines and standards with regard to our security surrounding the physical and electronic storage, processing and transmission of individual cardholder data. If our internal systems are breached or compromised, we may be liable for card re-issuance costs, subject to fines and higher transaction fees and lose our ability to accept card payments from our members, and our business and operating results could be adversely affected.We might sell products that cause illness or injury to our members, harm to our reputation, and expose us to litigation.If our merchandise, such as food and prepared food products for human consumption, drugs, children's products, pet products and durable goods, do not meet or are perceived not to meet applicable safety standards or our members' expectations regarding safety, we could experience lost sales, increased costs, litigation or reputational harm. The sale of these items involves the risk of health-related illness or injury to our members. Such illnesses or injuries could result from tampering by unauthorized third parties, product contamination or spoilage, including the presence of foreign objects, substances, chemicals, other agents, or residues introduced during the growing, manufacturing, storage, handling and transportation phases, or faulty design. Our suppliers are generally contractually required to comply with product safety laws, and we are dependent on them to ensure that the products we buy comply with safety and other standards. While we are subject to governmental inspection and regulations and work to comply in all material respects with applicable laws and regulations, we cannot be sure that consumption or use of our products will not cause illness or injury or that we will not be subject to claims, lawsuits, or government investigations relating to such matters, resulting in costly product recalls and other liabilities that could adversely affect our business and results of operations. Even if a product liability claim is unsuccessful or is not fully pursued, negative publicity could adversely affect our reputation with existing and potential members and our corporate and brand image, and these effects could be long term.If we do not successfully develop and maintain a relevant omnichannel experience for our members, our results of operations could be adversely impacted.Omnichannel retailing is rapidly evolving, and we must keep pace with changing member expectations and new developments by our competitors. Our members are increasingly using mobile phones, tablets, computers, and other devices to shop and to interact with us through social media. We are making investments in our websites and mobile applications. If we are unable to make, improve, or develop relevant member-facing technology in a timely manner, our ability to compete and our results of operations could be adversely affected.11Table of ContentsInability to attract, train and retain highly qualified employees could adversely impact our business, financial condition and results of operations.Our success depends on the continued contributions of members of our senior management and other key operations, merchandising and administrative personnel. Failure to identify and implement a succession plan for key senior management could negatively impact our business. We must attract, train and retain a large and growing number of qualified employees, while controlling related labor costs and maintaining our core values. Our ability to control labor and benefit costs is subject to numerous internal and external factors, including regulatory changes, prevailing wage rates, and healthcare and other insurance costs. We compete with other retail and non-retail businesses for these employees and invest significant resources in training and motivating them. There is no assurance that we will be able to attract or retain highly qualified employees in the future, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.We may incur property, casualty or other losses not covered by our insurance.The Company is predominantly self-insured for employee health care benefits, workers’ compensation, general liability, property damage, directors’ and officers’ liability, vehicle liability, and inventory loss. Insurance coverage is maintained in certain instances to limit exposures arising from very large losses. The types and amounts of insurance may vary from time to time based on our decisions with respect to risk retention and regulatory requirements. Significant claims or events, regulatory changes, a substantial rise in costs of health care or costs to maintain our insurance or the failure to maintain adequate insurance coverage could have an adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations.Although we maintain specific coverages for catastrophic property losses, we still bear the risk of losses incurred as a result of any physical damage to, or the destruction of, any warehouses, depots, manufacturing or home office facilities, loss or spoilage of inventory, and business interruption caused by any such events to the extent they are below catastrophic levels of coverage, as well as any losses to the extent they exceed our aggregate limits of applicable coverages. Such losses could materially impact our cash flows and results of operations.Market and Other External RisksWe face strong competition from other retailers and warehouse club operators, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.The retail business is highly competitive. We compete for members, employees, sites, products and services and in other important respects with a wide range of local, regional and national wholesalers and retailers, both in the United States and in foreign countries, including other warehouse-club operators, supermarkets, supercenters, internet retailers, gasoline stations, hard discounters, department and specialty stores and operators selling a single category or narrow range of merchandise. Such retailers and warehouse club operators compete in a variety of ways, including pricing, selection and availability, services, location, convenience, store hours, and the attractiveness and ease of use of websites and mobile applications. The evolution of retailing in online and mobile channels has improved the ability of customers to comparison shop, which has enhanced competition. Some competitors may have greater financial resources and technology capabilities, better access to merchandise, and greater market penetration than we do. Our inability to respond effectively to competitive pressures, changes in the retail markets and member expectations could result in lost market share and negatively affect our financial results. General economic factors, domestically and internationally, may adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations.Higher energy and gasoline costs, inflation, levels of unemployment, healthcare costs, consumer debt levels, foreign-currency exchange rates, unsettled financial markets, weaknesses in housing and real estate markets, reduced consumer confidence, changes and uncertainties related to government fiscal and tax policies including changes in tax rates, duties, tariffs, or other restrictions, sovereign debt crises, and other 12Table of Contentseconomic factors could adversely affect demand for our products and services, require a change in product mix, or impact the cost of or ability to purchase inventory. Additionally, actions in various countries, particularly China and the United States, have created uncertainty with respect to tariff impacts on the costs of some of our merchandise. The degree of our exposure is dependent on (among other things) the type of goods, rates imposed, and timing of the tariffs. The impact to our business, including net sales and gross margin, will be influenced in part by merchandising and pricing strategies in response to potential cost increases by us and our competitors. While these potential impacts are uncertain, they could have an adverse impact on our financial results.Prices of certain commodities, including gasoline and consumable goods used in manufacturing and our warehouse retail operations, are historically volatile and are subject to fluctuations arising from changes in domestic and international supply and demand, labor costs, competition, market speculation, government regulations, taxes and periodic delays in delivery. Rapid and significant changes in commodity prices and our ability and desire to pass them through to our members may affect our sales and profit margins. These factors could also increase our merchandise costs and selling, general and administrative expenses, and otherwise adversely affect our operations and financial results. General economic conditions can also be affected by events like the outbreak of war or acts of terrorism.Suppliers may be unable to timely supply us with quality merchandise at competitive prices or may fail to adhere to our high standards, resulting in adverse effects on our business, merchandise inventories, sales, and profit margins.We depend heavily on our ability to purchase quality merchandise in sufficient quantities at competitive prices. As the quantities we require continue to grow, we have no assurances of continued supply, appropriate pricing or access to new products, and any supplier has the ability to change the terms upon which they sell to us or discontinue selling to us. Member demands may lead to out-of-stock positions leading to loss of sales and profits.We buy from numerous domestic and foreign manufacturers and importers. Our inability to acquire suitable merchandise on acceptable terms or the loss of key suppliers could negatively affect us. We may not be able to develop relationships with new suppliers, and products from alternative sources, if any, may be of a lesser quality or more expensive. Because of our efforts to adhere to high quality standards for which available supply may be limited, particularly for certain food items, the large volumes we demand may not be consistently available.Our suppliers (and those they depend upon for materials and services) are subject to risks, including labor disputes, union organizing activities, financial liquidity, inclement weather, natural disasters, supply constraints, and general economic and political conditions that could limit their ability to timely provide us with acceptable merchandise. One or more of our suppliers might not adhere to our quality control, legal, regulatory, labor, environmental or animal welfare standards. These deficiencies may delay or preclude delivery of merchandise to us and might not be identified before we sell such merchandise to our members. This failure could lead to recalls and litigation and otherwise damage our reputation and our brands, increase costs, and otherwise adversely impact our business.Fluctuations in foreign exchange rates may adversely affect our results of operations.During 2019, our international operations, including Canada, generated 27% and 35% of our net sales and operating income, respectively. Our international operations have accounted for an increasing portion of our warehouses, and we plan to continue international growth. To prepare our consolidated financial statements, we translate the financial statements of our international operations from local currencies into U.S. dollars using current exchange rates. Future fluctuations in exchange rates that are unfavorable to us may adversely affect the financial performance of our Canadian and Other International operations and have a corresponding adverse period-over-period effect on our results of operations. As we continue to expand internationally, our exposure to fluctuations in foreign exchange rates may increase.13Table of ContentsA portion of the products we purchase is paid for in a currency other than the local currency of the country in which the goods are sold. Currency fluctuations may increase our cost of goods and may not be passed on to members. Consequently, fluctuations in currency exchange rates may adversely affect our results of operations.Natural disasters or other catastrophes could negatively affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations.Natural disasters, such as hurricanes, typhoons or earthquakes, particularly in California or Washington state, where our centralized operating systems and administrative personnel are located, could negatively affect our operations and financial performance. Such events could result in physical damage to our properties, the temporary closure of warehouses, depots, manufacturing or home office facilities, the temporary lack of an adequate work force, the temporary or long-term disruption in the supply of products from some local or overseas suppliers, the temporary disruption in the transport of goods to or from overseas, delays in the delivery of goods to our warehouses or depots, and the temporary reduction in the availability of products in our warehouses. Public health issues, whether occurring in the U.S. or abroad, could disrupt our operations, disrupt the operations of suppliers or members, or have an adverse impact on consumer spending and confidence levels. These events could also reduce demand for our products or make it difficult or impossible to procure products. We may be required to suspend operations in some or all of our locations, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.Factors associated with climate change could adversely affect our business.We use natural gas, diesel fuel, gasoline, and electricity in our distribution and warehouse operations. U.S. and foreign government regulations limiting carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gas emissions may increase compliance and merchandise costs, and other regulation affecting energy inputs could materially affect our profitability. Climate change and extreme weather conditions, such as hurricanes, thunderstorms, tornadoes, and snow or ice storms, as well as rising sea levels could affect our ability to procure commodities at costs and in quantities we currently experience. We also sell a substantial amount of gasoline, the demand for which could be impacted by concerns about climate change and which could face increased regulation. Failure to meet financial market expectations could adversely affect the market price and volatility of our stock.We believe that the price of our stock currently reflects high market expectations for our future operating results. Any failure to meet or delay in meeting these expectations, including our warehouse and e-commerce comparable sales growth rates, membership renewal rates, new member sign-ups, gross margin, earnings, earnings per share, new warehouse openings, or dividend or stock repurchase policies could cause the market price of our stock to decline.Legal and Regulatory RisksOur international operations subject us to risks associated with the legislative, judicial, accounting, regulatory, political and economic factors specific to the countries or regions in which we operate, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.At the end of 2019, we operated 239 warehouses outside of the U.S., and we plan to continue expanding our international operations. Future operating results internationally could be negatively affected by a variety of factors, many similar to those we face in the U.S., certain of which are beyond our control. These factors include political and economic conditions, regulatory constraints, currency regulations, policy changes such as the U.K.'s vote to withdraw from the European Union, commonly known as ""Brexit"", and other matters in any of the countries or regions in which we operate, now or in the future. Other factors that may impact international operations include foreign trade (including tariffs and trade sanctions), monetary and fiscal policies and the laws and regulations of the U.S. and foreign governments, agencies and similar organizations, and risks associated with having major facilities in locations which have been historically less stable than the U.S. Risks inherent in international operations also include, among others, the costs and difficulties of 14Table of Contentsmanaging international operations, adverse tax consequences, and difficulty in enforcing intellectual property rights.Changes in accounting standards and subjective assumptions, estimates and judgments by management related to complex accounting matters could significantly affect our financial condition and results of operations.Accounting principles and related pronouncements, implementation guidelines, and interpretations we apply to a wide range of matters that are relevant to our business, including self-insurance liabilities and income taxes, are highly complex and involve subjective assumptions, estimates and judgments by our management. Changes in rules or interpretation or changes in underlying assumptions, estimates or judgments by our management could significantly change our reported or expected financial performance and have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.We could be subject to additional tax liabilities.We are subject to a variety of taxes and tax collection and remittance obligations in the U.S. and numerous foreign jurisdictions. Additionally, at any point in time, we may be under examination for value added, sales-based, payroll, product, import or other non-income taxes. We may recognize additional tax expense, be subject to additional tax liabilities, or incur losses and penalties, due to changes in laws, regulations, administrative practices, principles, assessments by authorities and interpretations related to tax, including tax rules in various jurisdictions. We compute our income tax provision based on enacted tax rates in the countries in which we operate. As tax rates vary among countries, a change in earnings attributable to the various jurisdictions in which we operate could result in an unfavorable change in our overall tax provision. Additionally, changes in the enacted tax rates or adverse outcomes in tax audits, including transfer pricing disputes, could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.Significant changes in or failure to comply with regulations relating to the use, storage, discharge and disposal of hazardous materials, hazardous and non-hazardous wastes and other environmental matters could adversely impact our business, financial condition and results of operations.We are subject to a wide variety of federal, state, regional, local and international laws and regulations relating to the use, storage, discharge and disposal of hazardous materials, hazardous and non-hazardous wastes and other environmental matters. Failure to comply with these laws could result in harm to our members, employees or others, significant costs to satisfy environmental compliance, remediation or compensatory requirements, or the imposition of severe penalties or restrictions on operations by governmental agencies or courts that could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.We are involved in a number of legal proceedings and audits and some of these outcomes could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.Our business requires compliance with many laws and regulations. Failure to achieve compliance could subject us to lawsuits and other proceedings, and lead to damage awards, fines, penalties, and remediation costs. We are or may become involved in a number of legal proceedings and audits, including grand jury investigations, government and agency investigations, and consumer, employment, tort, unclaimed property laws, and other litigation. We cannot predict with certainty the outcomes of these proceedings and other contingencies, including environmental remediation and other proceedings commenced by governmental authorities. The outcome of some of these proceedings, audits, unclaimed property laws, and other contingencies could require us to take, or refrain from taking, actions which could negatively affect our operations or could require us to pay substantial amounts of money, adversely affecting our financial condition and results of operations. Additionally, defending against these lawsuits and proceedings may involve significant expense and diversion of management's attention and resources.15Table of ContentsItem 1B—Unresolved Staff CommentsNone.Item 2—PropertiesWarehouse PropertiesAt September 1, 2019, we operated 782 membership warehouses: Own Landand Building Lease Landand/orBuilding(1) TotalUnited States and Puerto Rico437 106 543Canada86 14 100Mexico38 1 39United Kingdom23 6 29Japan13 13 26Korea 12 4 16Taiwan— 13 13Australia8 3 11Spain2 — 2Iceland— 1 1France1 — 1China— 1 1Total620 162 782_______________(1)114 of the 162 leases are land-only leases, where Costco owns the building.The following schedule shows warehouse openings, net of closings and relocations, and expected openings through December 31, 2019: United States Canada OtherInternational Total Total Warehousesin Operation2015 and prior480 89 117 686 686201621 2 6 29 715201713 6 7 26 741201813 3 5 21 762201916 — 4 20 7822020 (expected through 12/31/2019)3 — — 3 785Total546 100 139 785 At the end of 2019, our warehouses contained approximately 113.9 million square feet of operating floor space: 79.9 million in the U.S.; 14.0 million in Canada; and 20.0 million in Other International.

In October 1993, Costco merged with The Price Company, which had pioneered the membership warehouse concept in 1976, to form Price/Costco, Inc., a Delaware corporation. In January 1997, after the spin-off of most of its non-warehouse assets to Price Enterprises, Inc., the Company changed its name to Costco Companies, Inc. On August 30, 1999, the Company reincorporated from Delaware to Washington and changed its name to Costco Wholesale Corporation, which trades on the NASDAQ under the symbol “COST”. General Costco operates membership warehouses based on the concept that offering members very low prices on a limited selection of nationally branded and selected private label products in a wide range of merchandise categories will produce high sales volumes and rapid inventory turnover. This rapid inventory turnover, when combined with the operating efficiencies achieved by volume purchasing, efficient distribution and reduced handling of merchandise in no-frills, self-service warehouse facilities, enables Costco to operate profitably at significantly lower gross margins than traditional wholesalers, discount retailers and supermarkets. Costco buys the majority of its merchandise directly from manufacturers for shipment either directly to Costco’s selling warehouses or to a consolidation point (“depot”) where various shipments are combined so as to minimize freight and handling costs. As a result, Costco eliminates many of the costs associated with multiple step distribution channels, which include purchasing from distributors as opposed to manufacturers, use of central receiving, storing and distributing warehouses, and storage of merchandise in locations off the sales floor. By providing this more cost-effective means of distributing goods, Costco meets the needs of business customers who otherwise would pay a premium for small purchases and for the distribution services of traditional wholesalers, and who cannot otherwise obtain the full range of their product requirements from any single source. In addition, these business members will often combine personal shopping with their business purchases. The cost savings on brand name and selected private label merchandise are the primary motivation for individuals shopping for their personal needs. Costco’s merchandise selection is designed to appeal to both the business and consumer requirements of its members by offering a wide range of nationally branded and selected private label products, often in case, carton or multiple-pack quantities, at attractively low prices. Because of its high sales volume and rapid inventory turnover, Costco generally has the opportunity to receive cash from the sale of a substantial portion of its inventory at mature warehouse operations before it is required to pay all its merchandise vendors, even though Costco takes advantage of early payment terms to obtain payment discounts. As sales in a given warehouse increase and inventory turnover becomes more rapid, a greater percentage of the inventory is financed through payment terms provided by vendors rather than by working capital. Costco’s typical warehouse format averages approximately 139,000 square feet. Floor plans are designed for economy and efficiency in the use of selling space, in the handling of merchandise and in the control of inventory. Because shoppers are attracted principally by the availability of low prices on brand name and selected private label goods, Costco’s warehouses need not be located on prime commercial real estate sites or have elaborate facilities. By strictly controlling the entrances and exits of its warehouses and using a membership format, Costco has been able to limit inventory losses to less than two-tenths of one percent of net sales—well below those of typical discount retail operations. Losses associated with dishonored checks have also been minimal and bank information from business members is verified prior to establishing a check purchase limit. Members are identified and prevented from cashing checks at the point of sale when they have presented dishonored checks to Costco. 3 Table of Contents Item 1—Business (Continued) Costco’s policy is generally to limit marketing and promotional expenses to new warehouse openings, occasional direct mail marketing to prospective new members and direct marketing programs to existing members promoting selected merchandise. These practices result in lower marketing expenses as compared to typical discount retailers and supermarkets. In connection with new warehouse openings, Costco’s marketing teams personally contact businesses in the area that are potential wholesale members. These contacts are supported by direct mailings during the period immediately prior to opening. Potential Gold Star (individual) members are contacted by direct mail or by providing such mailings to be distributed through employee associations and other entities. After a membership base is established in an area, most new memberships result from word-of-mouth advertising, follow-up contact by direct mail distributed through regular payroll or other organizational communications to employee groups and ongoing direct solicitations to prospective wholesale members. Costco’s warehouses generally operate on a seven-day, 69-hour week, and are open somewhat longer during the holiday season. Generally, warehouses are open weekdays between 10:00 a.m. and 8:30 p.m., with earlier closing hours on the weekend. Gasoline operations generally have extended hours. Because the hours of operation are shorter than those of traditional wholesalers, discount grocery retailers and supermarkets and due to other operational efficiencies inherent in a warehouse-type operation, labor costs are lower relative to the volume of sales. Merchandise is generally stored on racks above the sales floor and displayed on pallets containing large quantities of each item, thereby reducing labor required for handling and stocking. In addition, sales are processed through centralized, automated check-out stands. Most items are not individually price-marked; rather, each item is bar-coded so it can be scanned into electronic cash registers. This allows price changes without remarking merchandise. Substantially all manufacturers provide merchandise pre-marked with the item numbers and bar codes and many provide special, larger package sizes. Costco’s merchandising strategy is to provide the customer with a broad range of high quality merchandise at prices consistently lower than could be obtained through traditional wholesalers, discount retailers or supermarkets. An important element of this strategy is to carry only those products on which Costco can provide its members significant cost savings. Items that members may request but that cannot be purchased at prices low enough to pass along meaningful cost savings are often not carried. Costco seeks to limit specific items in each product line to fast selling models, sizes and colors. Therefore, the Company carries an average of approximately 4,000 active stockkeeping units (“SKU’s”) per warehouse in its core warehouse business, as opposed to discount retailers and supermarkets that normally stock 40,000 to 60,000 SKU’s or more. These practices are consistent with Costco’s membership policies of satisfying both the business and personal shopping needs of its wholesale members, thereby encouraging high volume shopping. Many consumable products are offered for sale in case, carton or multiple-pack quantities only. Appliances, equipment and tools often feature commercial and professional models. In keeping with its policy of customer satisfaction, Costco’s policy is to accept returns of merchandise. The following table indicates the approximate percentage of net sales accounted for by each major category of items sold by Costco during fiscal 2005, 2004 and 2003: 2005 2004 2003 Food (including dry and fresh foods and institutionally packaged foods) 31 % 31 % 30 % Sundries (including candy, snack foods, health and beauty aids, tobacco, alcoholic beverages, soft drinks and cleaning and institutional supplies) 29 % 29 % 30 % Hardlines (including major appliances, electronics, hardware, office supplies, garden and patio, sporting goods, furniture, cameras and automotive supplies) 16 % 16 % 16 % Softlines (including apparel, domestics, jewelry, housewares, media, home furnishings and small appliances) 12 % 13 % 14 % Other (including gas stations, pharmacy, food court, optical, one-hour photo, hearing aid and print shop) 12 % 11 % 10 % 100 % 100 % 100 % 4 Table of Contents Item 1—Business (Continued) Costco has direct buying relationships with many producers of national brand name merchandise. No significant portion of merchandise is obtained by Costco from any one of these or any other single supplier. Costco has not experienced any difficulty in obtaining sufficient quantities of merchandise, and believes that if one or more of its current sources of supply became unavailable, it would be able to obtain alternative sources without experiencing a substantial disruption of its business. Costco may also purchase selected private label merchandise of the same product, as long as quality and customer demand are comparable and the savings to its members are greater. Financial information of the Company’s segments and geographic areas is included in Note 9, Segment Reporting, to the accompanying consolidated financial statements. Costco reports on a 52/53-week fiscal year, consisting of thirteen four-week periods and ending on the Sunday nearest the end of August. The first, second and third quarters consist of three periods each, and the fourth quarter consists of four periods (five weeks in the thirteenth period in a 53-week year). There is no material seasonal impact on Costco’s operations, except an increased level of sales and earnings during the Christmas holiday season. Fiscal years 2005, 2004 and 2003 all consisted of 52 weeks. Membership Policy Costco’s membership format is designed to reinforce customer loyalty and provide a continuing source of membership fee revenue. Costco has two primary types of members: Business and Gold Star (individual) members. In addition, the Company offers an Executive Membership program to both Business and Gold Star members. Businesses, including individuals with a business license, retail sales license or other evidence of business existence, may become Business members. Costco promotes Business membership through its merchandise selection and its membership marketing programs. Business members generally pay an annual membership fee of $45 for the primary and spouse membership card with add-on membership cards available for an annual fee of $35 (including a free spouse card). Individual memberships (Gold Star memberships) are available to employees of federal, state and local governments, financial institutions, corporations, utility and transportation companies, public and private educational institutions, other organizations and to other persons. Individual members generally pay an annual membership fee of $45, which includes a spouse card. Executive memberships are available to all members for an annual fee of $100. The Executive Membership program offers members additional savings and benefits on various business and consumer services offered by Costco, such as merchant credit card processing, small business loans, auto and home insurance, long-distance telephone service, check printing, and real estate and mortgage services. The services offered are generally provided by third-party providers and vary by state. In addition, Executive members qualify for a 2% reward (which can be redeemed at Costco warehouses), up to a maximum of $500 per year, on all qualified purchases made at Costco. As of August 28, 2005, Costco had approximately 5.0 million primary Business memberships and approximately 16.2 million Gold Star memberships. Included within this membership base are approximately 4.2 million members that have upgraded to the Executive Membership program. Members can utilize their memberships at any Costco warehouse location. Labor As of August 28, 2005, Costco had approximately 118,000 employees, including approximately 8,000 individuals who were employed by Costco Mexico (a 50%-owned joint venture), which is not consolidated. Approximately forty-five percent of the employee base is part-time. Approximately 13,500 hourly employees in 5 Table of Contents Item 1—Business (Continued) certain of the Company’s locations in California, Maryland, New Jersey, New York and one warehouse in Virginia are represented by the International Brotherhood of Teamsters. All remaining employees are non-union. Costco considers its employee relations to be good. Competition The Company operates in the rapidly changing and highly competitive merchandising industry. When The Price Company pioneered the membership warehouse club concept in 1976, the dominant companies selling comparable lines of merchandise were department stores, grocery stores and traditional wholesalers. Since then, new merchandising concepts and aggressive marketing techniques have led to a more intense and focused competitive environment. Wal-Mart has become the largest retailer in the United States (and the world) and has expanded further into various food merchandising formats. Target and Kohl’s have also emerged as significant retail competitors. Over 1,100 warehouse club locations exist across the U.S. and Canada, including the 403 warehouses operated by the Company in North America; and every major metropolitan area has one, if not several, club operations. Low-cost operators selling a single category or narrow range of merchandise, such as Lowe’s, Home Depot, Office Depot, PetSmart, Staples, Best Buy and Barnes & Noble, have significant market share in their categories. New forms of retailing involving modern technology are boosting sales in certain stores, while home shopping and electronic commerce over the Internet is becoming increasingly popular. Regulation Certain state laws require that the Company apply minimum markups to its selling prices for specific goods, such as tobacco products and alcoholic beverages. While compliance with such laws may cause the Company to charge somewhat higher prices than it otherwise would charge, other retailers are also typically governed by the same restrictions, and the Company believes that compliance with such laws does not have a material adverse effect on its operations. It is the policy of the Company to sell at lower than manufacturers’ suggested retail prices. Some manufacturers attempt to maintain the resale price of their products by refusing to sell to the Company or to other purchasers that do not adhere to suggested retail prices or that otherwise sell at discounted prices. To date, the Company believes that it has not been materially affected by its inability to purchase directly from such manufacturers. Both federal and state legislation is proposed from time to time which, if enacted, would restrict the Company’s ability to purchase goods or extend the application of laws enabling the establishment of minimum prices. The Company cannot predict the effect on its business of the enactment of such federal or state legislation. Certain states, counties and municipalities have enacted or proposed laws and regulations that would prevent or restrict the operations or expansion plans of certain large retailers and warehouse clubs, including the Company, within their jurisdictions. The Company believes that, if enacted, such laws and regulations could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s operations.

At August 28, 2005, the Company operated 27 warehouses in Mexico (through a 50%-owned joint venture). These warehouses are not included in the number of warehouses open in any period because the joint venture is accounted for using the equity method and, therefore, its operations are not consolidated in the Company’s financial statements. Costco’s executive offices are located in Issaquah, Washington and occupy approximately 361,000 square feet. In addition, the Company operated eight regional offices in the United States, two regional offices in Canada and four regional offices internationally at the end of fiscal 2005, containing approximately 309,000 square feet. Additionally, the Company operates regional cross-docking facilities (depots) for the consolidation and distribution of certain shipments to the warehouses, and operates various processing, packaging, and other facilities to support ancillary and other businesses. At the end of fiscal 2005, Costco operated nine depots in the United States, three in Canada and two internationally, excluding Mexico, consisting of approximately 5.3 million square feet. 7 Table of Contents Item 3—Legal Proceedings The Company is involved from time to time in claims, proceedings and litigation arising from its business and property ownership. The Company is a defendant in two actions purportedly brought as class actions on behalf of certain present and former Costco managers in California, in which plaintiffs allege that they have not been properly compensated for overtime work. Scott M. Williams v. Costco Wholesale Corporation, United States District Court (San Diego), Case No. 02-CV-2003 NAJ (JFS); Superior Court for the County of San Diego, Case No. GIC-792559; Greg Randall v. Costco Wholesale Corporation, Superior Court for the County of Los Angeles, Case No. BC-296369. The Company is also a defendant in an overtime compensation case purportedly brought as a class action on behalf of present and former hourly employees in California, in which plaintiffs allege that Costco’s semi-annual bonus formula is improper with regard to retroactive overtime pay. Anthony Marin v. Costco Wholesale Corporation, Superior Court for the County of Alameda, Case No. RG-04150447. The Company is also a defendant in an action purportedly brought as a class action on behalf of present and former hourly employees in California, in which plaintiffs allege that Costco did not properly compensate and record hours worked by employees and failed to provide meal and rest breaks. Kevin Doty and Sarah Doty v. Costco Wholesale Corporation, United States District Court ( Los Angeles), Case No. CV-05-3241 FMC (JWJx). Claims in these four actions are made under various provisions of the California Labor Code and the California Business and Professions Code. Plaintiffs seek restitution/disgorgement, compensatory damages, various statutory penalties, liquidated damages, punitive, treble and exemplary damages, and attorneys’ fees. The Company also is a defendant in an action purportedly brought as a class action on behalf of certain present and former female managers, in which plaintiffs allege denial of promotion based on gender in violation of Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964. Shirley “Rae” Ellis v. Costco Wholesale Corporation, United States District Court (San Francisco), Case No. C-04-3341-MHP. Plaintiffs seek compensatory damages, exemplary and punitive damages, injunctive relief, and attorneys’ fees. In none of these five cases has the Court been asked yet to determine whether the action should proceed as a class action or, if so, the definition of the class. The Company expects to vigorously defend these actions and does not believe that any claim, proceeding or litigation, either alone or in the aggregate, will have a material adverse effect on the Company’s financial position or results of its operations. Item 4—Submission of Matters to a Vote of Security Holders The Company’s annual meeting is scheduled for 4:00 p.m. on January 25, 2006, at the Meydenbauer Center in Bellevue, Washington. Matters to be voted on will be included in the Company’s proxy statement to be filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission and distributed to stockholders prior to the meeting. 8 Table of Contents PART II Item 5—Market for Registrant’s Common Equity, Related Stockholder Matters and Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities Costco Common Stock is quoted on The NASDAQ Stock Market’s National Market under the symbol “COST.” The following table sets forth the closing high and low sales prices of Costco Common Stock for the period September 2, 2002 through October 28, 2005.

(Amounts in thousands, except per share data.) Participants in the Company’s 401(k) plan may have purchased more shares of the Company’s common stock in their plan accounts than were registered with the Securities and Exchange Commission. The Company received no proceeds from any of these sales. The Company has made a rescission offer to plan participants who purchased the Company’s common stock in 401(k) plan accounts from November 16, 2003 through November 15, 2004. The rescission offer expired October 27, 2005. The offer will have no material effect on the Company’s consolidated results of operations, financial position or cash flows. DIVIDEND POLICY Under its two revolving credit agreements, Costco is generally permitted to pay dividends in any fiscal year up to an amount equal to fifty percent of its consolidated net income for that fiscal year. Costco’s Board of Directors declared four quarterly cash dividends during fiscal year 2005. The first two dividends of $0.10 per share were paid November 26, 2004 and February 25, 2005, to shareholders of record at the close of business on November 5, 2004 and February 8, 2005, respectively. The third and fourth dividends of $0.115 per share were paid May 27, 2005 and August 26, 2005 to shareholders of record at the close of business on May 6, 2005 and August 5, 2005, respectively. In fiscal 2004 the Company paid dividends of $0.10 per share in the third and fourth quarters. Payment of future dividends is subject to declaration by the Board of Directors. Factors considered in determining the size of the dividends are profitability and expected capital needs of the Company. Subject to qualifications stated above, the Company presently expects to pay dividends on a quarterly basis.

For these purposes, forward-looking statements are statements that address activities, events, conditions or developments that the Company expects or anticipates may occur in the future. Such forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties that may cause actual events, results or performance to differ materially from those indicated by such statements. These risks and uncertainties include, but are not limited to, domestic and international economic conditions including exchange rates, the effects of competition and regulation, consumer and small business spending patterns and debt levels, conditions affecting the acquisition, development, ownership or use of real estate, actions of vendors, rising costs associated with employees (including health care and workers’ compensation costs), rising costs associated with the acquisition of merchandise (including the direct and indirect effects of the rising cost of petroleum-based products and fuel and energy costs), geopolitical conditions and other risks identified from time to time in the Company’s public statements and reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Executive Overview and Selected Consolidated Statements of Income Data (dollars in thousands, except earnings per share) Overview Costco operates membership warehouses based on the concept that offering members very low prices on a limited selection of nationally branded and selected private label products in a wide range of merchandise categories will produce high sales volumes and rapid inventory turnover. This rapid inventory turnover, when combined with the operating efficiencies achieved by volume purchasing, efficient distribution and reduced handling of merchandise in no-frills, self-service warehouse facilities, enables Costco to operate profitably at significantly lower gross margins than traditional wholesalers, discount retailers and supermarkets. Key items for fiscal year 2005 included: • Net sales increased 10% over the prior year, driven by an increase in comparable sales of 7% and the opening of 16 new warehouses; • Membership fees for fiscal 2005 increased 11.6% to $1,073,156, representing new member sign-ups at new warehouses opened during the fiscal year, increasing penetration of the Company’s Executive Membership program, and continued strong member renewal rates; • Gross margin (net sales less merchandise costs) decreased nine basis points as a percent of net sales over the prior year. Gross margins increased year-over-year in most of the Company’s merchandise categories, but were offset by changes in the sales mix with higher penetration of lower margin departments, primarily gas. Additionally, margins were negatively impacted by ten basis points due to increased sales penetration of the Executive Membership Program and its related costs; • Selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of net sales improved two basis points over the prior year, largely due to increased payroll leverage due to increased sales, a decrease in health care costs as a percent of net sales and a flattening of the rising trend in workers’ compensation costs, offset by higher stock option expense; • Net income for fiscal 2005 increased 20.5% to $1,063,092, or $2.18 per diluted share. Net income during fiscal 2005 was impacted by several non-recurring items that are discussed further in the comparison of fiscal 2005 and fiscal 2004 below. Exclusive of these items, net income for fiscal 2005 would have been $998,326 or $2.04 per diluted share, a 10% increase in earnings per share over the prior fiscal year. • The Board of Directors approved an increase in the quarterly cash dividend from $0.10 to $0.115 per share; and • During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2005 the Company repurchased shares of Costco common stock, expending approximately $413,252 repurchasing 9.2 million shares of stock at an average cost of $44.89 per share. 13 Table of Contents Item 7—Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) SELECTED CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF INCOME DATA The table below presents selected operational data, the percentage relationship between net sales and major categories in the Consolidated Statements of Income and the percentage change in the dollar amounts of each of the items.

Comparison of Fiscal 2005 (52 weeks) and Fiscal 2004 (52 weeks): (dollars in thousands, except earnings per share) Net Income Net income for fiscal 2005 increased 20.5% to $1,063,092, or $2.18 per diluted share, from $882,393, or $1.85 per diluted share, during fiscal year 2004. Net income during fiscal 2005 was impacted by the following: a $54,155 (approximately $.11 per diluted share) income tax benefit resulting primarily from the settlement of a transfer pricing dispute between the United States and Canada (covering the years 1996-2003); a cumulative pre-tax, non-cash charge to preopening expenses of $15,999 (approximately $.02 per diluted share) related to a correction to the Company’s method of accounting for ground leases (entered into over the past twenty years) that did not require rental payments during the period of construction; and a net tax benefit with respect to excess foreign tax credits on unremitted foreign earnings recorded in the fourth quarter of $20,592 (approximately $.04 per diluted share). Exclusive of these items, net income for fiscal 2005 would have been $998,326 or $2.04 per diluted share, a 10% increase in earnings per share over the prior fiscal year. Net Sales Net sales increased 10.0% to $51,862,072 in fiscal 2005 from $47,145,712 in fiscal 2004. Approximately 71% of the increase was due to an increase in comparable warehouse sales, that is sales in warehouses open for at least a year. The balance of the increase was due to opening 16 new warehouses during fiscal 2005 and 20 new warehouses during fiscal 2004, a portion of which is not included in comparable warehouse sales. Net sales were reduced by the implementation of Emerging Issues Task Force (EITF) Issue No. 03-10, “Application of Issue No. 02-16, “Accounting by a Customer (Including a Reseller) for Certain Consideration Received from a 14 Table of Contents Item 7—Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) Vendor,” by Resellers to Sales Incentives Offered to Consumers by Manufacturers,” which was effective at the beginning of the Company’s fiscal 2004 third quarter. EITF 03-10, which primarily impacts the Company’s vendor coupon programs, reduces net sales and merchandise costs by an equal amount and does not affect the Company’s consolidated gross margin or net income. Had EITF 03-10 been in effect for the comparable periods in fiscal 2004, the net sales increase in fiscal 2005 would have been 10.4%. (See Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements, EITF 03-10.) For fiscal 2005, comparable sales increased 7% from fiscal 2004. Had EITF 03-10 been in effect for the comparable periods in fiscal 2004, the comparable sales increase for fiscal 2005 would have been 8%. Changes in prices of merchandise did not materially affect the sales increases, with the exception of gasoline, where price increases accounted for approximately 89 basis points of the sales increase. In addition, translation of foreign sales into U.S. dollars contributed to the increase in sales due to stronger foreign currencies, accounting for approximately 134 basis points year-over-year of the comparable sales increase. Membership Fees Membership fees increased 11.6% to $1,073,156, or 2.07% of net sales, in fiscal 2005 from $961,280, or 2.04% of net sales, in fiscal 2004. This increase was primarily due to additional membership sign-ups at the 16 new warehouses opened in fiscal 2005, increased penetration of the Company’s Executive membership and high overall member renewal rates consistent with recent years, currently 86%. Gross Margin Gross margin increased 9.1% to $5,515,111, or 10.63% of net sales, in fiscal 2005 from $5,053,696, or 10.72% of net sales, in fiscal 2004. The nine basis point decrease in gross margin as a percentage of net sales reflected a decrease of three basis points in gross margin in the Company’s merchandise departments. The three basis point decrease in merchandising is largely due to changes in the sales mix, with higher penetration of lower margin departments. This effect was offset by gross margin gains in most of the Company’s merchandise departments, as well as the international operations. Gross margin as a percentage of net sales was positively impacted by five basis points due to the implementation of EITF 03-10, whereby net sales and merchandise costs were reduced equally. The gross margin percentage was reduced by 10 basis points due to the increased penetration of the Executive Member program, increased spending by Executive Members and the resulting increases in the related costs. The gross margin figures reflect accounting for most U.S. merchandise inventories on the last-in, first-out (LIFO) method. Fiscal 2005 included a $13,410 LIFO charge (increase in merchandise costs), while fiscal 2004 included a $6,090 LIFO charge. The impact of the LIFO adjustment on a year-over-year basis negatively impacted gross margin, as a percentage of sales, by one additional basis point. Selling, General and Administrative Expenses Selling, general and administrative (SG&A) expenses increased 9.7% to $5,044,341, or 9.73% of net sales, in fiscal 2005, from $4,597,877, or 9.75% of net sales, in fiscal 2004. Had EITF 03-10 been in effect for all of fiscal 2004, SG&A expenses as a percent to net sales would have shown additional improvement of four basis points in fiscal 2005. For fiscal 2005, warehouse and central operating costs positively impacted SG&A comparisons year-over-year by approximately 13 basis points, primarily due to improved payroll utilization at the warehouse level, including increased leverage from increased comparable sales and cost control measures employed in employee 15 Table of Contents Item 7—Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) benefits, primarily health care. This improvement was partially offset by the implementation of EITF 03-10, which negatively impacted SG&A as a percentage of net sales by five basis points and an increase in stock-based compensation costs approximating six basis points year-over-year. Preopening Expenses Preopening expenses totaled $53,230, or 0.10% of net sales, during fiscal 2005 compared to $30,451, or 0.07% of net sales, during fiscal 2004. During the second quarter of fiscal 2005, in response to the Securities and Exchange Commission’s February 7, 2005 letter related to leases, the Company adjusted its method of accounting for leases (entered into over the past twenty years), primarily related to ground leases at certain warehouse locations that did not require rental payments during the period of construction. As a result, the Company recorded a cumulative pre-tax, non-cash charge of $15,999 to preopening expense in the second quarter of fiscal 2005 to effect this accounting adjustment. Prior periods’ financial results have not been restated due to the immateriality of this amount to the consolidated financial statements. Twenty-one warehouses (including five relocations) were opened in fiscal 2005 compared to the opening of 20 warehouses in fiscal 2004. Pre-opening expenses also include costs related to remodels and expanded ancillary operations at existing warehouses. Provision for Impaired Assets and Closing Costs, net The net provision for impaired assets and closing costs was $16,393 in fiscal 2005, compared to $1,000 in fiscal 2004. The provision includes costs related to impairment of long-lived assets, future lease obligations of warehouses that have been relocated to new facilities, and any losses or gains resulting from the sale of real property. The provision for fiscal 2005 included charges of $3,893 for impairment of long-lived assets, $11,619 for warehouse closing expenses and $881 for net losses on the sale of real property. The provision for fiscal 2004 included charges of $16,548 for warehouse closing expenses that were offset by gains of $15,548 on the sale of real property. At August 28, 2005, the reserve for warehouse closing costs was $9,556, of which $9,118 related to future lease obligations. This compares to a reserve for warehouse closing costs of $10,367 at August 29, 2004, of which $9,184 related to future lease obligations. Interest Expense Interest expense totaled $34,437 in fiscal 2005, compared to $36,651 in fiscal 2004. Interest expense in both fiscal 2005 and 2004 includes interest on the 3 1/2% Zero Coupon Notes, 7 1/8% and 5 1/2% Senior Notes and on balances outstanding under the Company’s bank credit facilities and promissory notes. The decrease was primarily a result of a decrease in interest on the Company’s 3 1/2% Zero Coupon Notes as note holders converted approximately $280,811 in principle amount of the Notes into common stock during fiscal 2005. Additionally, capitalized interest increased year-over-year as interest rates and construction costs increased in fiscal 2005 over fiscal 2004. These decreases were partially offset by increases in interest on the Senior Notes as these fixed rate instruments were swapped into variable rate debt in November 2001 and March 2002, which was mitigated by the fact that the 7 1/8% Senior Notes matured and were repaid on June 15, 2005. Interest Income and Other Interest income and other totaled $109,096 in fiscal 2005, compared to $51,627 in fiscal 2004. The increase primarily reflects increased interest income resulting from higher cash and cash equivalents balances and short-term investments on hand throughout fiscal 2005, as well as higher interest rates earned on the balances as compared to fiscal 2004. 16 Table of Contents Item 7—Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) Provision for Income Taxes The effective income tax rate on earnings was 31.4% in fiscal 2005 and 37% in fiscal 2004. The decrease in the effective income tax rate is attributable to a one-time $54,155 income tax benefit resulting primarily from the settlement of a transfer pricing dispute between the United States and Canada (covering the years 1996-2003) and a net tax benefit on excess foreign tax credits on unremitted foreign earnings of $20,592. Excluding these benefits the effective income tax rate on earnings in fiscal 2005 was 36.2%. For the fourth quarter of fiscal 2005 and 2004, the effective tax rate was 28.9% and 37.0%, respectively. The decrease in the fourth quarter tax rate for fiscal 2005 is primarily attributable to the net tax benefit of $20,592, noted above, and a tax benefit of $13,895 primarily associated with lower state taxes. The state tax benefit recorded in the fourth quarter was primarily due to a reduction in the estimated effective state tax rate utilized in the first through third quarters of fiscal 2005. Excluding the benefit of these two items, the fourth quarter tax rate for fiscal 2005 would be 35.8%. Comparison of Fiscal 2004 (52 weeks) and Fiscal 2003 (52 weeks): (dollars in thousands, except earnings per share) Net Income Net income for fiscal 2004 increased 22.4% to $882,393, or $1.85 per diluted share, from $721,000, or $1.53 per diluted share during fiscal year 2003. Net Sales Net sales increased 13.1% to $47,145,712 in fiscal 2004 from $41,692,699 in fiscal 2003. Approximately 78% of the increase was due to an increase in comparable warehouse sales, that is sales in warehouses open for at least a year. The balance of the increase was due to opening 20 new warehouses during fiscal 2004 and a net of 23 new warehouses (29 opened, 6 closed) during fiscal 2003, a portion of which is not included in comparable warehouse sales. Net sales were reduced by the implementation of Emerging Issues Task Force (EITF) Issue No. 03-10, “Application of Issue No. 02-16, “Accounting by a Customer (Including a Reseller) for Certain Consideration Received from a Vendor,” by Resellers to Sales Incentives Offered to Consumers by Manufacturers,” which was effective at the beginning of the Company’s fiscal 2004 third quarter. EITF 03-10, which primarily impacts the Company’s vendor coupon programs, reduces net sales and merchandise costs by an equal amount and does not affect the Company’s consolidated gross margin or net income. Had EITF 03-10 been in effect for the comparable periods in fiscal 2003, the net sales increase in fiscal 2004 would have been 13.8%. (See Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements, EITF 03-10.) For fiscal 2004, comparable sales increased 10% from fiscal 2003. Had EITF 03-10 been in effect for the comparable periods in fiscal 2003, the comparable sales increase for fiscal 2004 would have been 11%. Changes in prices of merchandise did not materially affect the sales increases, with the exception of gasoline, where price increases accounted for a sales increase of approximately 70 basis points. In addition, due to the weaker U.S. dollar throughout fiscal 2004 as compared to fiscal 2003, translation of foreign sales into U.S. dollars contributed to the increase in sales, accounting for a comparable sales increase of approximately 190 basis points year-over-year. Sales were also positively impacted by the supermarket strikes in Southern California during the first half of the Company’s 2004 fiscal year. The positive impact to sales for the entire fiscal year was estimated to be 35 to 50 basis points. 17 Table of Contents Item 7—Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) Membership Fees Membership fees increased 12.7% to $961,280, or 2.04% of net sales, in fiscal 2004 from $852,853, or 2.05% of net sales, in fiscal 2003. This increase was primarily due to additional membership sign-ups at the 20 new warehouses opened in fiscal 2004; increased penetration of the Company’s Executive membership, including the rollout of the program into Canada, which began in the first quarter of fiscal 2004; and high overall member renewal rates consistent with recent years, currently at 86%. Gross Margin Gross margin increased 13.4% to $5,053,696, or 10.72% of net sales, in fiscal 2004 from $4,457,316, or 10.69% of net sales, in fiscal 2003. The three basis point increase, as a percent of net sales, reflected a 14 basis point increase in gross margin in the Company’s merchandise departments, helped by strong year-over-year gross margin gains in the Company’s ancillary business operations, particularly gasoline and pharmacy. Year-over-year gross margin, as a percentage of net sales, was also positively impacted by the implementation of EITF 03-10, whereby net sales and merchandise costs were reduced, resulting in an eight basis point increase. The year-over-year gross margin percentage was reduced by 12 basis points due to the increased rewards related to the Executive Membership Two-Percent Reward Program, resulting from an increase in the penetration of the Executive Member program. The gross margin figures reflect accounting for most U.S. merchandise inventories on the LIFO method. Fiscal 2004 included a $6,090 LIFO charge (increase in merchandise costs), while fiscal 2003 included a $19,650 LIFO credit (reduction in merchandise costs). The impact of the LIFO adjustment on a year-over-year basis negatively impacted margin by an additional six basis points. Selling, General and Administrative Expenses Selling, general and administrative (SG&A) expenses as a percent of net sales decreased to 9.75% during fiscal 2004 from 9.83% during fiscal 2003. Had EITF 03-10 been in effect in fiscal 2003, SG&A expenses as a percent to net sales would have shown additional improvement of seven basis points in fiscal 2004. For fiscal 2004, warehouse and central operating costs positively impacted SG&A comparisons year-over-year by approximately 21 basis points, primarily due to increased expense leverage of warehouse payroll, benefits (primarily health care), utility and workers’ compensation costs. During the latter half of fiscal 2004, the Company implemented changes to its employee healthcare plans that reduced its overall healthcare costs, primarily in the fourth quarter. This improvement was partially offset by the seven basis point increase resulting from the adoption of EITF 03-10, a two basis point increase in expense related to the establishment of additional insurance liabilities resulting from financial difficulties being experienced by one of the Company’s third-party insurance providers, and an increase in stock-based compensation costs following the Company’s prospective adoption of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 123, “Accounting for Stock Based Compensation,” at the beginning of fiscal 2003, of four basis points. Preopening Expenses Preopening expenses totaled $30,451, or 0.07% of net sales, during fiscal 2004 compared to $36,643, or 0.09% of net sales, during fiscal 2003. This reduction was due to fewer warehouse openings. During fiscal 2004, the Company opened 20 new warehouses compared to 29 new warehouses (including 5 relocations) during fiscal 2003. Pre-opening expenses also include costs related to remodels and expanded ancillary operations at existing warehouses. 18 Table of Contents Item 7—Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) Provision for Impaired Assets and Closing Costs, net The net provision for impaired assets and closing costs was $1,000 in fiscal 2004, compared to $19,500 in fiscal 2003. The provision includes costs related to impairment of long-lived assets, future lease obligations of warehouses that have been relocated to new facilities, and losses or gains resulting from the sale of real property. The provision for fiscal 2004 included charges of $16,548 for warehouse closing expenses that were offset by gains of $15,548 on the sale of real property. The provision for fiscal 2003 included charges of $11,836 for warehouse closing expenses, $4,697 for impairment of long-lived assets and $2,967 for net losses on the sale of real property. At August 29, 2004, the reserve for warehouse closing costs was $10,367, of which $9,184 related to future lease obligations. This compares to a reserve for warehouse closing costs of $8,609 at August 31, 2003, of which $7,833 related to future lease obligations. Interest Expense Interest expense totaled $36,651 in fiscal 2004, compared to $36,920 in fiscal 2003. Interest expense in both fiscal 2004 and 2003 includes interest on the 3 1/2% Zero Coupon Notes, 7 1/8% and 5 1/2% Senior Notes and on balances outstanding under the Company’s bank credit facilities and promissory notes. The decrease was primarily a result of the Company’s reduction in short-term borrowings, principally related to its foreign subsidiaries. This decrease was substantially offset by increases in interest rates on the Senior Notes due to interest rate swap agreements converting the interest rate from fixed to floating. Interest Income and Other Interest income and other totaled $51,627 in fiscal 2004, compared to $38,525 in fiscal 2003. The increase primarily reflects greater interest earned on higher cash and cash equivalents balances and short-term investments. In addition, a reduction in the expense to record minority interest in the earnings of foreign subsidiaries was reported in fiscal 2004 as the Company increased its ownership in Costco Wholesale UK Limited to 100%. Provision for Income Taxes The effective income tax rate on earnings was 37% in fiscal 2004 and 37.75% in fiscal 2003. The decrease in the effective income tax rate is primarily attributable to lower statutory income tax rates for foreign operations and one-time benefits associated with certain tax planning strategies. Liquidity and Capital Resources (dollars in thousands, except per share amounts) Cash Flows The Company’s primary sources of liquidity are cash flows generated from warehouse operations and our existing cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments balances, which were $3,459,857 and $3,129,882 at August 28, 2005 and August 29, 2004, respectively. Net cash provided by operating activities totaled $1,783,177 in fiscal 2005 compared to $2,098,783 in fiscal 2004, a decrease of $315,606. Higher net income and a decrease in net merchandise inventories (merchandise inventory less accounts payable) year-over-year increased cash flow from operating activities by $391,571. This increase was offset by decreases in cash flow from operating assets and liabilities of $706,855, primarily relating to the timing in the collection of certain receivables and in payments of income taxes in fiscal 2005 as compared to fiscal 2004. A significant component of net cash used in investing activities continues to be the purchase of property and equipment related to the Company’s warehouse expansion and remodel projects. Net cash used in investing activities totaled $2,058,729 in fiscal 2005 compared to $1,048,481 in fiscal 2004, an increase of $1,010,248. The increase in investing activities primarily relates to an increase in the net investment in short-term investments of $768,596 and an increase in additions to property and equipment of $289,811 in fiscal 2005 over fiscal 2004. 19 Table of Contents Item 7—Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) Net cash used in financing activities totaled $518,651 in fiscal 2005 compared to $209,569 provided by financing activities in fiscal 2004. The decrease of $728,220 primarily resulted from an increase in the repayment of debt of $297,275 primarily relating to the repayment of the 7 1/8% Senior Notes, which matured on June 15, 2005, and repurchases of common stock of $413,252 under the Company’s $500,000 share repurchase program. Dividends Costco’s Board of Directors declared four quarterly cash dividends during fiscal year 2005. The first two dividends of $0.10 per share were paid November 26, 2004 and February 25, 2005, to shareholders of record at the close of business on November 5, 2004 and February 8, 2005, respectively. The third and fourth dividends of $0.115 per share were paid May 27, 2005 and August 26, 2005 to shareholders of record at the close of business on May 6, 2005 and August 5, 2005, respectively. In fiscal 2004 the Company paid dividends of $0.10 per share in the third and fourth quarters. Contractual Obligations The Company’s commitment to make future payments under contractual obligations was as follows, as of August 28, 2005. Payments Due by Period Contractual obligations Total Less than1 year 1 to 3years 4 to 5years After5 years Long-term debt(1)(2) $ 879,520 $ 18,064 $ 379,466 $ 65,437 $ 416,553 Capital lease obligations 6,591 3,225 1,305 927 1,134 Operating leases(3) 1,562,267 114,682 219,402 189,188 1,038,995 Purchase obligations (merchandise)(4) 3,049,398 3,048,785 613 — — Purchase obligations (building, equipment, services and other)(5) 242,361 230,086 12,275 — — Other(6) 8,591 1,354 1,692 1,362 4,183 Total $ 5,748,728 $ 3,416,196 $ 614,753 $ 256,914 $ 1,460,865 (1) Amounts include contractual interest payments.

(6) Consists of asset retirement and deferred compensation obligations. Expansion Plans Costco’s primary requirement for capital is the financing of the land, building and equipment costs for new warehouses plus the costs of initial warehouse operations and working capital requirements, as well as additional capital for international expansion. 20 Table of Contents Item 7—Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) While there can be no assurance that current expectations will be realized, and plans are subject to change upon further review, it is management’s current intention to spend approximately $1,100,000 to $1,250,000 during fiscal 2006 in the United States and Canada for real estate, construction, remodeling and equipment for warehouse clubs and related operations; and approximately $100,000 to $150,000 for international expansion, including the United Kingdom, Asia, Mexico and other potential ventures. These expenditures are expected to be financed with a combination of cash provided from operations and the use of cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments. Expansion plans for the United States and Canada during fiscal 2006 are to open approximately 28-30 new warehouse clubs on a net basis, inclusive of two to three relocations to larger and better-located warehouses. The Company expects to continue its review of expansion plans in its international operations, including the United Kingdom and Asia, along with other international markets. At present, the Company is planning to open three additional warehouses in the U.K during fiscal 2006. Costco Mexico plans to open two to three new warehouse clubs during fiscal 2006. Additional Equity Investments in Subsidiaries and Joint Ventures On June 30, 2005, the Company acquired the remaining 4% interest in CWC Travel Inc for $3,961, bringing Costco’s ownership in this entity to 100%. In addition, during fiscal 2005 the Company contributed an additional $15,000 to its investment in Costco Mexico (a 50%-owned joint venture), which did not impact its percentage ownership of this entity as the joint venture partner contributed a like amount. On October 3, 2003, the Company acquired from Carrefour Nederland B.V. its 20% equity interest in Costco Wholesale UK Limited for cash of $95,153, bringing Costco’s ownership in Costco Wholesale UK Limited to 100%. Bank Credit Facilities and Commercial Paper Programs (all amounts stated in thousands of US dollars) The Company has a $500,000 commercial paper program supported by a $150,000 bank credit facility ($300,000 at August 29, 2004) with a group of nine banks, which expires on November 15, 2005, and is not expected to be renewed. At August 28, 2005 and August 29, 2004, no amounts were outstanding under the commercial paper program and no amounts were outstanding under the credit facility. Applicable interest rates on the credit facility at August 28, 2005 and August 29, 2004, were 3.92% and 1.90%, respectively. A wholly-owned Canadian subsidiary has a $167,000 commercial paper program ($152,000 at August 29, 2004) supported by a $50,000 bank credit facility ($46,000 at August 29, 2004) with a Canadian bank, which is guaranteed by the Company and expires in March 2006. At August 28, 2005 and August 29, 2004, no amounts were outstanding under the Canadian commercial paper program or the bank credit facility. Applicable interest rates on the credit facility at August 28, 2005 and August 29, 2004, were 4.25% and 3.75%, respectively. At August 28, 2005, standby letters of credit totaling $23,000 issued under the bank credit facility left $27,000 available for commercial paper support. At August 29, 2004, standby letters of credit totaling $21,000 issued under the bank credit facility left $25,000 available for commercial paper support. The Company has agreed to limit the combined amount outstanding under the U.S. and Canadian commercial paper programs to the combined amounts of the supporting bank credit facilities, which are $177,000 at August 28, 2005, decreasing to $27,000 on November 15, 2005. At August 29, 2004, the combined amount of supporting bank credit facilities was $325,000. The Company’s wholly-owned Japanese subsidiary has a short-term $13,694 bank line of credit that expires in February 2006. At August 28, 2005 and August 29, 2004, $5,477 and $0, respectively, were borrowed under the line of credit, and $3,652 and $2,576, respectively, were used to support standby letters of credit. A second 21 Table of Contents Item 7—Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) $13,694 bank line of credit was entered into in February 2005 that expires in February 2006. At August 28, 2005, $9,129 was borrowed under the second facility; this bank line was not in place at August 29, 2004. Applicable interest rates on the credit facilities at both August 28, 2005 and August 29, 2004, were .84%. The Company’s Korean subsidiary has a short-term $11,665 bank line of credit, which expires in January 2006. At August 28, 2005 and August 29, 2004, no amounts were borrowed under the line of credit and $1,668 and $0, respectively, were used to support standby letters of credit. Applicable interest rates on the credit facility at August 28, 2005 and August 29, 2004, were 4.51% and 4.52%, respectively. The Company’s Taiwan subsidiary has a $7,439 bank revolving credit facility that expires in January 2006. At August 28, 2005 and August 29, 2004, no amounts were borrowed under the credit facility and $2,495 and $1,165, respectively, were used to support standby letters of credit. A second $15,499 bank revolving credit facility is in place, which expires in July 2006. At August 28, 2005 and August 29, 2004, no amounts were borrowed under the second credit facility and $790 and $738, respectively were used to support standby letters of credit. Applicable interest rates on the credit facilities at August 28, 2005 and August 29, 2004, were 3.75% and 3.50%, respectively. The Company’s wholly-owned United Kingdom subsidiary has a $108,408 bank revolving credit facility expiring in February 2007 and a $63,238 bank overdraft facility renewable on a yearly basis in March 2006. At August 28, 2005, $39,750 was outstanding under the revolving credit facility with an applicable interest rate of 5.30% and no amounts were outstanding under the bank overdraft facility. At August 29, 2004, $21,595 was outstanding under the revolving credit facility with an applicable interest rate of 5.285% and no amounts were outstanding under the bank overdraft facility. Letters of Credit The Company has letter of credit facilities (for commercial and standby letters of credit), totaling approximately $401,933. The outstanding commitments under these facilities at August 28, 2005 and August 29, 2004 totaled approximately $131,169 and $166,800, respectively, including approximately $64,532 and $52,900, respectively, in standby letters of credit. Financing Activities The Company’s 7 1/8% Senior Notes, carried at $304,350 at August 29, 2004, matured and were repaid on June 15, 2005 from its cash and cash equivalents. In April 2003, the Company’s wholly-owned Japanese subsidiary issued promissory notes bearing interest at 0.92% in the aggregate amount of $36,516, through a private placement. Interest is payable semi-annually and principal is due on April 26, 2010. In March 2002, the Company issued $300,000 of 5 1/2% Senior Notes carried at $307,688 due March 15, 2007. Interest is payable semi-annually. Simultaneous with the issuance of the Senior Notes, the Company entered into interest rate swap agreements converting the interest from fixed to floating. In February 1996, the Company filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission a shelf registration statement for $500,000 of senior debt securities. On October 23, 2001, additional debt securities of $100,000 were registered. The $300,000 of 5 1/2% Senior Notes issued in March 2002 reduced the amount of registered securities available for future issuance to $300,000. During fiscal 2005, $280,811 in principal amount of the Company’s 3 1/2% Zero Coupon Convertible Subordinated Notes were converted by note holders into 9,910,011 shares of common stock. 22 Table of Contents Item 7—Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) Derivatives The Company has limited involvement with derivative financial instruments and uses them only to manage well-defined interest rate and foreign exchange risks. Forward foreign exchange contracts are used to hedge the impact of fluctuations of foreign exchange on inventory purchases and typically have very short terms. The aggregate amount of foreign exchange contracts outstanding at August 28, 2005 and August 29, 2004, was $42,466 and $30,495, respectively. The majority of the forward foreign exchange contracts were entered into by the Company’s wholly-owned United Kingdom subsidiary, primarily to hedge U.S. dollar merchandise inventory purchases. The Company monitors its foreign currency exchange exposures to ensure the overall effectiveness of its foreign currency hedge positions. The only other derivative instruments the Company holds are interest rate swaps, which the Company uses to manage the interest rate risk associated with its borrowings and to manage the Company’s mix of fixed-rate and variable-rate debt. As of August 28, 2005, the Company had “fixed-to-floating” interest rate swaps with an aggregate notional amount of $300,000 and an aggregate fair value of $7,688, which is recorded in other assets on the Company’s consolidated balance sheet. These swaps were entered into effective March 25, 2002, and are designated and qualify as fair value hedges of the Company’s $300,000 5 1/2% Senior Notes. As the terms of the swaps match those of the underlying hedged debt, the changes in the fair value of these swaps are offset by corresponding changes in the carrying amount of the hedged debt and result in no net earnings impact. As of August 29, 2004, the Company had “fixed-to-floating” interest rate swaps with an aggregate notional amount of $600,000 and an aggregate fair value of $25,754. In addition to the Company’s swap on the 5 1/2% Senior Notes noted above, the Company had entered into a swap on its $300,000 7 1/8% Senior Notes effective November 13, 2001, which was designated and qualified as a fair value hedge. The $300,000 7 1/8% Senior Notes matured and were repaid on June 15, 2005. Concurrent to this transaction, the related swap agreement expired. Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements With the exception of its operating leases, the Company has no off-balance sheet arrangements that have had or are reasonably likely to have a material current or future effect on the Company’s financial condition or consolidated financial statements. Stock Repurchase Program On November 30, 2001, the Company’s Board of Directors approved a stock repurchase program, authorizing the repurchase of up to $500,000 of Costco Common Stock through November 30, 2004. Under the program, the Company could repurchase shares at any time in the open market or in private transactions as market conditions warrant. The repurchased shares would be retired. On October 25, 2004, the Board of Directors renewed the program for another three years. On June 7, 2005 the Company began repurchasing shares on the open market. Through August 28, 2005 the Company has repurchased 9,205,100 shares of common stock at an average price of $44.89, totaling approximately $413,252, including commissions. Subsequent to the Company’s fiscal 2005 year end, August 29, 2005, the Board of Directors of Costco authorized an additional stock repurchase program of up to $1,000,000 of Costco common stock. Under the program, which contains no expiration date, the Company may repurchase shares at any time in the open market or in private transactions as market conditions warrant. Critical Accounting Policies The preparation of the Company’s financial statements requires that management make estimates and judgments that affect the financial position and results of operations. Management continues to review its accounting policies and evaluate its estimates, including those related to revenue recognition, merchandise inventory, 23 Table of Contents Item 7—Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) impairment of long-lived assets and warehouse closing costs and insurance/self-insurance liabilities. The Company bases its estimates on historical experience and on other assumptions that management believes to be reasonable under the present circumstances. Revenue Recognition The Company recognizes sales, net of estimated returns, at the time customers take possession of merchandise or receive services. When the Company collects payment from customers prior to the transfer of ownership of merchandise or the performance of services, the amount received is recorded as deferred revenue on the consolidated balance sheets until the sale or service is completed. The Company provides for estimated sales returns based on historical returns levels. The Company evaluates the criteria of the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) Emerging Issues Task Force (EITF) 99-19, “Reporting Revenue Gross as a Principal Versus Net as an Agent,” in determining whether it is appropriate to record the gross amount of merchandise sales and related costs or the net amount earned as commissions. Generally, when Costco is the primary obligor, is subject to inventory risk, has latitude in establishing prices and selecting suppliers, influence product or service specifications, or has several but not all of these indicators, revenue is recorded on a gross basis. If the Company is not the primary obligor and does not possess other indicators of gross reporting as noted above, Costco records the net amounts as commissions earned. Merchandise Inventories Merchandise inventories are valued at the lower of cost or market as determined primarily by the retail method of accounting and are stated using the last-in, first-out (LIFO) method for substantially all U.S. merchandise inventories. Merchandise inventories for all foreign operations are primarily valued by the retail method of accounting and are stated using the first-in, first-out (FIFO) method. The Company believes the LIFO method more fairly presents the results of operations by more closely matching current costs with current revenues. The Company records an adjustment each quarter, if necessary, for the expected annual effect of inflation, and these estimates are adjusted to actual results determined at year-end. At August 28, 2005, merchandise inventories valued at LIFO approximated FIFO after considering the lower of cost or market principle. At August 29, 2004, merchandise inventories valued using LIFO exceeded the comparable FIFO value by approximately $13,410 due to the aggregate effects of deflation. The Company provides for estimated inventory losses between physical inventory counts on the basis of a percentage of sales. The provision is adjusted periodically to reflect the trend of the actual physical inventory count results, which generally occur in the second and fourth fiscal quarters of the Company’s fiscal year. Inventory cost, where appropriate, is reduced by estimates of vendor rebates when earned or as the Company progresses towards earning those rebates provided they are probable and reasonably estimable. Other consideration received from vendors is generally recorded as a reduction of merchandise costs upon completion of contractual milestones, terms of agreement, or other systematic and rational approach. Impairment of long-lived assets and warehouse closing costs The Company periodically evaluates its long-lived assets for indicators of impairment. Management’s judgments are based on market and operational conditions at the present time. Future events could cause management to conclude that impairment factors exist, requiring an adjustment of these assets to their then-current fair market value. 24 Table of Contents Item 7—Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) The Company provides estimates for warehouse closing costs, based on the applicable accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. Future circumstances may result in the Company’s actual future closing costs or the amount recognized upon the sale of the property to differ substantially from the original estimates. Insurance/Self Insurance Liabilities The Company uses a combination of insurance and self-insurance mechanisms to provide for the potential liabilities for workers’ compensation, general liability, property damage, director and officers’ liability, vehicle liability and employee health care benefits. Liabilities associated with the risks that are retained by the Company are not discounted and are estimated, in part, by considering historical claims experience and outside expertise, demographic factors, severity factors and other actuarial assumptions. The estimated accruals for these liabilities could be significantly affected if future occurrences and claims differ from these assumptions and historical trends. Recent Accounting Pronouncements In May 2005, the FASB issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 154, “Accounting Changes and Error Corrections, a Replacement of Accounting Principles Board (APB) Opinion No. 20 and FASB Statement No. 3.” SFAS 154 requires retrospective application to prior periods’ financial statements for changes in accounting principles, unless it is impracticable to determine either the period-specific effects or the cumulative effect of the change. SFAS 154 also requires that retrospective application of a change in accounting principle be limited to the direct effects of the change. Indirect effects of a change in accounting principle, such as a change in non-discretionary profit-sharing payments resulting from an accounting change, should be recognized in the period of the accounting change. SFAS 154 also requires that a change in depreciation, amortization, or depletion method for long-lived, non-financial assets be accounted for as a change in accounting estimate effected by a change in accounting principle. SFAS 154 is effective for accounting changes and corrections of errors made in fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2005. Early adoption is permitted for accounting changes and corrections of errors made in fiscal years beginning after the date this Statement is issued. The Company is required to adopt the provisions of SFAS 154, as applicable, beginning in fiscal 2007. The Company does not believe the adoption of SFAS 154 will have a significant effect on its future consolidated financial statements. In March 2005, the FASB issued FASB Interpretation (FIN) No. 47, “Accounting for Conditional Asset Retirement Obligations, An Interpretation of FASB Statement No. 143,” which requires an entity to recognize a liability for the fair value of a conditional asset retirement obligation when incurred if the liability’s fair value can be reasonably estimated. The Company adopted the provisions of FIN 47 in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2005. The adoption of this Interpretation did not have a material impact on the Company’s consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows. In December 2004, the FASB issued SFAS No. 123R, “Share-based Payments.” SFAS 123R revises SFAS 123, “Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation,” which the Company adopted as of the beginning of its fiscal 2003, and supersedes APB Opinion No. 25, “Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees.” SFAS 123R applies to transactions in which an entity exchanges its equity instruments for goods or services and also applies to liabilities an entity may incur for goods or services that are based on the fair value of those equity instruments. All employee stock option grants made by the Company since the beginning of fiscal 2003 have been expensed over the related option vesting period based on the fair value at the date the options are granted using the Black-Scholes model. Under SFAS 123R, the Company will be required to select a valuation technique or option-pricing model that meets the criteria as stated in the standard. Allowable valuation models include a binomial model and the Black-Scholes model. The Company is required to adopt the provisions of SFAS 123R in the first quarter of its fiscal 2006. The Company is in the process of assessing the impact on the Company’s results of operations from the adoption of SFAS 123R for its effect on prospective option grants. The adoption of SFAS 123R requires the Company to value stock options granted prior to its adoption of SFAS 123 under the fair value 25 Table of Contents Item 7—Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) method and expense these amounts in the income statement over the stock option’s remaining vesting period. This will result in the Company expensing $13,043 in fiscal 2006, which would previously have been presented in a proforma footnote disclosure. In addition, SFAS 123R will require the Company to reflect the tax savings resulting from tax deductions in excess of expense reflected in its financial statements as a financing cash flow, which will impact the Company’s future reported cash flows from operating activities. In November 2004, the FASB issued SFAS No. 151, “Inventory Costs – An Amendment of Accounting Research Bulletin (ARB) No. 43, Chapter 4.” SFAS 151 clarifies that abnormal amounts of idle facility expense, freight, handling costs and spoilage should be expensed as incurred and not included in overhead. Further, SFAS 151 requires that allocation of fixed and production facilities overheads to conversion costs should be based on normal capacity of the production facilities. The provisions in this statement are effective for inventory costs incurred during fiscal periods beginning after June 15, 2005. The Company does not believe that the adoption of SFAS 151 will have a significant effect on its future consolidated financial statements. In November 2004, the FASB issued SFAS No. 153, “Exchanges of Non-monetary Assets – An Amendment of APB No. 29.” The provisions of this statement are effective for non-monetary asset exchanges occurring in fiscal periods beginning after June 15, 2005. This statement eliminates the exception to fair value for exchanges of similar productive assets and replaces it with a general exception for exchange transactions that do not have commercial substance – that is, transactions that are not expected to result in significant changes in the cash flows of the reporting entity. The Company does not believe that the adoption of SFAS 153 will have a significant effect on its future consolidated financial statements. In March 2004, the FASB EITF reached a consensus on EITF Issue No. 03-1, “The Meaning of Other-Than-Temporary Impairment and Its Application to Certain Investments,” (EITF 03-1). The guidance prescribes a three-step model for determining whether an investment is other-than-temporarily impaired and requires disclosures about unrealized losses on investments. The accounting guidance became effective for reporting periods beginning after June 15, 2004, while the disclosure requirements became effective for annual reporting periods ending after June 15, 2004. In September 2004, the FASB issued FASB Staff Position (FSP) EITF 03-1-1, “Effective Date of Paragraphs 10-20 of EITF Issue No. 03-1 ‘The Meaning of Other-Than-Temporary Impairment and Its Application to Certain Investments,” (FSP EITF 03-1-1). FSP EITF 03-1-1 delayed the effective date for the measurement and recognition guidance contained in paragraphs 10-20 of EITF Issue 03-1. In November 2005, the FASB issued FSP FAS 115-1 and FAS 124-1, “The Meaning of Other-Than-Temporary Impairment and its Application to Certain Investments.” This FSP addresses the determination as to when an investment is considered impaired, whether the impairment is other than temporary and the measurement of an impairment loss. This statement specifically nullifies the requirements of paragraph 10-18 of EITF 03-1 and references existing other-than-temporary impairment guidance. The guidance under this FSP is effective for reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2005 and the Company continued to apply relevant “other-than-temporary” guidance as provided for in FSP EITF 03-1-1 during fiscal 2005. The Company does not believe that the adoption of the guidance of FSP FAS 115-1 and FAS 124-1 will have a significant effect on its future consolidated financial statements. In November 2003, the EITF reached consensus on Issue No. 03-10, “Application of Issue No. 02-16 by Resellers to Sales Incentives Offered to Consumers by Manufacturers,” with respect to determining if consideration received by a reseller from a vendor that is reimbursed by the vendor for honoring the vendor’s sale incentives offered directly to consumers should be recorded as a reduction in sales. These rules apply to transactions entered into by consumers in fiscal periods beginning after November 25, 2003 and, therefore, apply to such transactions starting with the Company’s fiscal third quarter of 2004, which began February 16, 2004. The adoption of EITF 03-10 did not affect the Company’s consolidated gross profit or net income, but did result in a reduction of both net sales and merchandise costs by an equal amount. Had the first half of fiscal 2004 and all of fiscal 2003 been reported under EITF 03-10 guidance, the sales and cost of sales would have been reduced by approximately $186,900 and $282,300, respectively. 26 Table of Contents Item 7A—Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk The Company is exposed to financial market risk resulting from changes in interest and foreign currency rates. As a policy, the Company does not engage in speculative or leveraged transactions, nor hold or issue financial instruments for trading purposes. The nature and amount of the Company’s long and short-term debt can be expected to vary as a result of future business requirements, market conditions and other factors. As of August 28, 2005, the Company’s fixed rate long-term debt includes its $415,246 principal amount at maturity Zero Coupon Subordinated Notes carried at $274,071 and additional notes and capital lease obligations totaling $132,141. The Company’s debt also includes $300,000 5 1/2% Senior Notes carried at $307,688. The Company has entered into “fixed-to-floating” interest rate swaps on the Senior Notes, effectively converting these fixed interest rate securities to variable rate securities. As of August 28, 2005 and August 29, 2004, the Company had “fixed-to-floating” interest rate swaps with an aggregate notional amount of $300,000 and $600,000, respectively, and an aggregate fair value of $7,688 and $25,754, respectively. Fluctuations in interest rates may affect the fair value of the fixed rate debt and may affect the interest expense related to the variable rate debt. The Company holds interest-bearing instruments that are classified as cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments. The Company’s investment policy is to manage its total cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments balances to preserve principal and liquidity while maximizing the return on the investment portfolio through the full investment of available funds. The Company diversifies its investment portfolio by investing in multiple types of investment-grade securities and through internal management and the use of third-party investment managers. Short-term investments generally have a maturity of three months to five years from the purchase date. Investments with maturities beyond one year may be classified as short-term based on their highly liquid nature and because such marketable securities represent the investment of cash that is available for current operations. As the majority of these instruments are of a short-term nature, if interest rates were to increase or decrease immediately, there is no material risk of a valuation adjustment related to these instruments. For those instruments that are classified as available for sale, the unrealized gains or losses related to fluctuations in interest rates are reflected in other accumulated comprehensive income or loss. Based on the Company’s cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments balances at August 28, 2005, a 100 basis point increase or decrease in interest rates would result in an increase or decrease of approximately $15,000 to interest income (pre-tax) on an annual basis. Most foreign currency transactions have been conducted in local currencies, limiting the Company’s exposure to changes in currency rates. The Company periodically enters into short-term forward foreign exchange contracts to hedge the impact of fluctuations in foreign currency rates on inventory purchases. The fair value of foreign exchange contracts outstanding at August 28, 2005 was $42,901. 27 Table of Contents Item 8—Financial Statements and Supplementary Data Financial statements of Costco are as follows: Page Reports of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm 36 Consolidated Balance Sheets, as of August 28, 2005 and August 29, 2004 38 Consolidated Statements of Income, for the 52 weeks ended August 28, 2005, August 29, 2004 and August 31, 2003 39 Consolidated Statements of Stockholders’ Equity and Comprehensive Income, for the 52 weeks ended August 28, 2005, August 29, 2004, and August 31, 2003 40 Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows, for the 52 weeks ended August 28, 2005, August 29, 2004, August 31, 2003 41 Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements 42 Management’s Report on the Financial Statements Our management is responsible for the preparation, integrity and objectivity of the accompanying consolidated financial statements and the related financial information. The financial statements have been prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America and necessarily include certain amounts that are based on estimates and informed judgments. Our management also prepared the related financial information included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K and is responsible for its accuracy and consistency with the financial statements. The consolidated financial statements have been audited by KPMG LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, who conducted their audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). The independent registered public accounting firm’s responsibility is to express an opinion as to the fairness with which such financial statements present our financial position, results of operations and cash flows in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. Management’s Annual Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. Our internal control over financial reporting is designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and include those policies and procedures that: (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect our transactions and the dispositions of our assets; (2) provide reasonable assurance that our transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that our receipts and expenditures are being made only in accordance with appropriate authorizations; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of our assets that could have a material effect on our financial statements. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Therefore, even those systems determined to be effective can provide only reasonable assurance with respect to financial statement preparation and presentation. Under the supervision and with the participation of our management, we assessed the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of August 28, 2005, using the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO) in Internal Control—Integrated Framework. Based on its assessment, management has concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of August 28, 2005. 28 Table of Contents Item 8—Financial Statements and Supplementary Data (Continued) KPMG LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, has audited management’s assessment of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of August 28, 2005, as stated in their audit report herein, which appears on page 37.

Exhibits, Financial Statement Schedules 36 2 Table of Contents PART I Item 1—Business Costco Wholesale Corporation (“Costco” or the “Company”) began operations in 1983 in Seattle, Washington. In October 1993, we merged with The Price Company, which had pioneered the membership warehouse concept, to form Price/Costco, Inc., a Delaware corporation. In January 1997, after the spin-off of most of our non-warehouse assets to Price Enterprises, Inc., we changed our name to Costco Companies, Inc. On August 30, 1999, we reincorporated from Delaware to Washington and changed our name to Costco Wholesale Corporation. Our common stock trades on the NASDAQ under the symbol “COST.” General We operate membership warehouses based on the concept that offering our members very low prices on a limited selection of nationally branded and selected private-label products in a wide range of merchandise categories will produce high sales volumes and rapid inventory turnover. This rapid inventory turnover, when combined with the operating efficiencies achieved by volume purchasing, efficient distribution and reduced handling of merchandise in no-frills, self-service warehouse facilities, enables us to operate profitably at significantly lower gross margins than traditional wholesalers, mass merchandisers, supermarkets and supercenters. We buy the majority of our merchandise directly from manufacturers and route it to a cross-docking consolidation point (“depot”) or directly to our warehouses. Our depots receive container-based shipments from manufacturers and reallocate these goods for shipment to our individual warehouses, generally in less than twenty-four hours. This maximizes freight volume and handling efficiencies, thereby lowering our receiving costs by eliminating many of the costs associated with multiple step distribution channels, which include purchasing from distributors as opposed to manufacturers, use of central receiving, storing and distributing warehouses, and storage of merchandise in locations off the sales floor. Because of our high sales volume and rapid inventory turnover, we generally have the opportunity to sell and be paid for inventory before we are required to pay many of our merchandise vendors, even though we take advantage of early payment discounts whenever available to us. As sales increase and inventory turnover becomes more rapid, a greater percentage of inventory is financed through payment terms provided by vendors rather than by our working capital. Our typical warehouse format averages approximately 140,000 square feet; newer units tend to be larger. Floor plans are designed for economy and efficiency in the use of selling space, the handling of merchandise and the control of inventory. Because shoppers are attracted principally by the quality of merchandise and the availability of low prices, our warehouses need not have elaborate facilities. By strictly controlling the entrances and exits of our warehouses and using a membership format, we have limited inventory losses to less than two-tenths of one percent of net sales in each of the last three fiscal years—well below those of typical discount retail operations. We generally limit marketing and promotional activities to new warehouse openings, occasional direct mail marketing to prospective new members and regular direct marketing programs (such as The Costco Connection, a magazine we publish for our members, and coupon mailers) to existing members promoting selected merchandise. These practices result in lower marketing expenses as compared to typical retailers. In connection with new warehouse openings, our marketing teams personally contact businesses in the area that are potential wholesale members. These contacts are supported by direct mailings during the period immediately prior to opening. Potential Gold Star (individual) members 3 Table of Contents Item 1—Business (Continued) are contacted by direct mail or by providing membership offerings to be distributed through employee associations and other entities. After a membership base is established in an area, most new memberships result from word-of-mouth advertising, follow-up messages distributed through regular payroll or other organizational communications to employee groups and ongoing direct solicitations to prospective Business and Gold Star members. Our warehouses generally operate on a seven-day, 69-hour week. Generally, warehouses are open weekdays between 10:00 a.m. and 8:30 p.m., with earlier closing hours on the weekend. Gasoline operations generally have extended hours. Because the hours of operation are shorter than those of traditional retailers, discount retailers and supermarkets and due to other efficiencies inherent in a warehouse-type operation, labor costs are lower relative to the volume of sales. Merchandise is generally stored on racks above the sales floor and displayed on pallets containing large quantities of each item, thereby reducing labor required for handling and stocking. Our merchandising strategy is to provide our members with a broad range of high quality merchandise at prices consistently lower than could be obtained elsewhere. An important element of this strategy is to carry only those products on which we can provide our members significant savings. We seek to limit specific items in each product line to fast-selling models, sizes and colors. Therefore, we carry an average of approximately 4,000 active stockkeeping units (SKUs) per warehouse in our core warehouse business, as opposed to discount retailers and supermarkets that normally stock 40,000 SKUs or more. Many consumable products are offered for sale in case, carton or multiple-pack quantities only. In keeping with our policy of member satisfaction, we generally accept returns of merchandise. In fiscal 2007, we introduced a 90-day return policy in the United States on certain electronic items. Additionally, we now provide, free of charge, technical support service, as well as an extended warranty on certain electronic items. The following table indicates the approximate percentage of net sales accounted for by major category of items: 2007 2006 2005 Sundries (including candy, snack foods, tobacco, alcoholic and nonalcoholic beverages and cleaning and institutional supplies) 23 % 24 % 25 % Hardlines (including major appliances, electronics, health and beauty aids, hardware, office supplies, garden and patio, sporting goods, furniture, and automotive supplies) 21 % 20 % 20 % Food (including dry and institutionally packaged foods) 19 % 19 % 19 % Softlines (including apparel, domestics, jewelry, housewares, media, home furnishings, cameras and small appliances) 11 % 12 % 12 % Fresh Food (including meat, bakery, deli and produce) 12 % 11 % 11 % Ancillary and Other (including gas stations, pharmacy, food court, optical, one-hour photo, hearing aid and travel) 14 % 14 % 13 % 4 Table of Contents Item 1—Business (Continued) Ancillary businesses within or next to our warehouses provide expanded products and services and encourage members to shop more frequently. The following table indicates the number of ancillary businesses in operation at fiscal year end: 2007 2006 2005 Food Court and Hot Dog Stands 482 452 427 One-Hour Photo Centers 480 450 423 Optical Dispensing Centers 472 442 414 Pharmacies 429 401 374 Gas Stations 279 250 225 Hearing-Aid Centers 237 196 168 Print Shops and Copy Centers 8 9 10 Number of warehouses 488 458 433 Warehouses operated by our Mexico joint venture are not included above. At September 2, 2007, our 50% owned joint venture in Mexico operated 30 warehouses. Our electronic commerce businesses, costco.com in the U.S. and costco.ca in Canada, provide our members additional products generally not found in our warehouses, in addition to services such as digital photo processing, pharmacy, travel and membership services. Our warehouses accept cash, checks, certain debit cards, American Express and a private label Costco credit card. Losses associated with dishonored checks have been minimal as members who have issued dishonored checks are identified and prevented from cashing checks at the point of sale until restitution is made. We have direct buying relationships with many producers of national brand name merchandise. No significant portion of merchandise is obtained from any one of these or any other single supplier. We have not experienced any difficulty in obtaining sufficient quantities of merchandise, and believe that if one or more of our current sources of supply became unavailable, we would be able to obtain alternative sources without experiencing a substantial disruption of our business. We also purchase selected private label merchandise, as long as quality and customer demand are comparable and the value to our members is greater. Financial information of our segments and geographic areas is included in Note 12, Segment Reporting, to the accompanying consolidated financial statements. We report on a 52/53-week fiscal year, consisting of thirteen four-week periods and ending on the Sunday nearest the end of August. The first, second and third quarters consist of three periods each, and the fourth quarter consists of four periods (five weeks in the thirteenth period in a 53-week year). There is no material seasonal impact on our operations, except an increased level of net sales and earnings during the winter holiday season. Fiscal years 2007 and 2005 each consisted of 52 weeks, and fiscal year 2006 was a 53-week year. Membership Policy Our membership format is designed to reinforce customer loyalty and provide a continuing source of membership fee revenue, which allows us to offer low prices. Members can utilize their memberships at any Costco warehouse location in any country. We have two primary types of members: Business, and Gold Star (individual). In addition, U.S. and Canadian 5 Table of Contents Item 1—Business (Continued) members can upgrade to an Executive Membership. We continue to experience strong member renewal rates, currently at 87%. Businesses, including individuals with a business license, retail sales license or other evidence of business existence, may become Business members. Business members generally pay an annual membership fee of $50 for the primary and spouse membership card, with add-on membership cards available for an annual fee of $40 (including a free spouse card). A significant number of our business members also shop at Costco for their personal needs. Individual memberships (Gold Star memberships) are available to individuals who do not qualify for a Business membership. Individual members generally pay an annual membership fee of $50, which includes a spouse card. Our membership base was made up of the following (in thousands): September 2,2007 September 3,2006 Gold Star 18,600 17,300 Business 5,400 5,200 Total primary cardholders 24,000 22,500 Add-on cardholders 26,400 25,200 Total cardholders 50,400 47,700 The rates for Business and Gold Star members discussed above reflect the $5 increase that went into effect on May 1, 2006 for new members and July 1, 2006 for existing members. Executive Membership is available to all members in the U.S. and Canada for an annual fee of $100. The Executive Membership program offers members additional savings and benefits on various business and consumer services offered by Costco, such as merchant credit card processing, small business loans, auto and home insurance, business telephone service, check printing, and real estate and mortgage services. The services offered are generally provided by third-party providers and vary by state. In addition, Executive members qualify for a 2% reward (which can be redeemed at Costco warehouses), up to a maximum of $500 per year, on all qualified purchases made at Costco. At the end of fiscal 2007 and 2006, Executive members represented 23% and 20%, respectively, of our primary membership base and the percentage of our net sales attributable to these members continues to increase. Labor Our employee count approximated: September 2,2007 September 3,2006 Full-time employees 70,000 66,000 Part-time employees 57,000 53,000 Total employees 127,000 119,000 These numbers exclude approximately 9,000 and 8,000 individuals who were employed by Costco Mexico (a 50%-owned joint venture) as of September 2, 2007 and September 3, 2006, respectively, which is not consolidated in our financial statements, but is accounted for using the equity method. Approximately 13,900 hourly employees in certain of our locations in California, Maryland, New Jersey, New York and one warehouse in Virginia are represented by the International Brotherhood of Teamsters. All remaining employees are non-union. We consider our employee relations to be very good. 6 Table of Contents Item 1—Business (Continued) Competition Our industry is highly competitive, based on factors such as price, merchandise quality and selection, warehouse location and member service. Over 1,200 warehouse club locations exist across the U.S. and Canada, including our 454 North American warehouses, and every major metropolitan area has one, if not several, club operations. In addition to other membership warehouse operators such as Wal-Mart’s Sam’s Club and BJ’s Wholesale Club, we compete with a wide range of national and regional retailers and wholesalers, including supermarkets, supercenters, general merchandise chains, specialty chains, gasoline stations, as well as electronic commerce businesses. Wal-Mart, Target and Kohl’s are significant general merchandise retail competitors. We also compete with low-cost operators selling a single category or narrow range of merchandise, such as Lowe’s, Home Depot, Office Depot, PetSmart, Staples, Trader Joe’s, Whole Foods, Best Buy and Barnes & Noble. Regulation Certain state laws require that we apply minimum markups to our selling prices for specific goods, such as tobacco products, alcoholic beverages and gasoline. While compliance with such laws may cause us to charge somewhat higher prices than we otherwise would charge, other retailers are also typically governed by the same restrictions, and we believe that compliance with such laws does not have a material adverse effect on our operations. It is our policy to sell at lower than manufacturers’ suggested retail prices. Some manufacturers attempt to maintain the resale price of their products by refusing to sell to us or to other purchasers that do not adhere to suggested retail prices or that otherwise sell at discounted prices. To date, we believe that we have not been materially affected by our inability to purchase directly from such manufacturers. Both federal and state legislation is proposed from time to time which, if enacted, would restrict our ability to purchase goods or extend the application of laws enabling the establishment of minimum prices. We cannot predict the effect on our business of the enactment of such federal or state legislation. Certain states, counties and municipalities have enacted or proposed laws and regulations that would prevent or restrict the operations or expansion plans of certain large retailers and warehouse clubs, including us, within their jurisdictions. We believe that, if enacted, such laws and regulations could have a material adverse affect on our operations. Available Information We maintain an internet website at www.costco.com. We make available through the Investor Relations section of our website, free of charge, our Annual Reports on Form 10-K, Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q, Current Reports on Form 8-K, Proxy Statements and Forms 3, 4 and 5, and any amendments to those reports, as soon as reasonably practicable after filing such material with, or furnishing such documents to, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). The information found on our website is not part of this or any other report filed with or furnished to the SEC. Item 1A—Risk Factors Certain statements contained in this document constitute forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. They include statements that address activities, events, conditions or developments that we expect or anticipate may occur in the future. Such forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties that may cause actual events, results or performance to differ materially from those indicated by such statements. 7 Table of Contents Item 1A—Risk Factors (Continued) The risks described below could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations. They could cause our actual results to differ materially from our historical experience and from results predicted by our forward-looking statements. Those statements may relate to such matters as sales growth, increases in comparable store sales, impact of cannibalization, price changes, earnings performance, earnings per share, stock-based compensation expense, warehouse openings and closures, the effect of adopting certain accounting standards, future financial reporting, financing, margins, return on invested capital, strategic direction and the demand for our products and services. You should read these risk factors in conjunction with Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations in Item 7 of this Report and our consolidated financial statements and related notes in Item 8 of this Report. There also may be other factors that we cannot anticipate or that are not described in this report, generally because we do not perceive them to be material, that could cause results to differ materially from our expectations. Forward-looking statements speak only as of the date they are made, and we do not undertake to update these forward-looking statements. You are advised, however, to review any further disclosures we make on related subjects in our periodic filings with the SEC. We face strong competition from other retailers and wholesale club operators, which could negatively affect our financial performance. The retail business is highly competitive. We compete for members, employees, warehouse sites, products and services and in other important respects with many other local, regional and national retailers, both in the United States and in foreign countries. We compete with other wholesale club operators, discount retailers, retail and wholesale grocers and general merchandise wholesalers and distributors, as well as electronic commerce retailers, wholesalers and catalog businesses. Internationally, we compete with retailers who operate department, drug, variety and specialty stores, supermarkets, supercenter stores, wholesale clubs, internet-based retailers and catalog businesses. Such retailers and wholesale club operators compete in a variety of ways, including merchandise selection and availability, services offered to members, location, store hours and price. Our ability to respond effectively to competitive pressures and changes in the retail markets could negatively affect our financial performance. Some competitors may have greater financial resources, better access to merchandise, and greater market penetration than we do. General economic factors, domestically and internationally, may adversely affect our financial performance. Higher interest rates, energy costs, inflation, levels of unemployment, healthcare costs, fluctuations of certain commodity prices, consumer debt levels, and other economic factors could adversely affect demand for our products and services or require a change in the mix of products we sell. These factors can also increase our cost of sales and/or operating, selling, general and administrative expenses, and otherwise adversely affect our operations and results. General economic conditions can also be affected by the outbreak of war, acts of terrorism or other significant national or international events. Our growth strategy includes expanding our business, both in existing markets and by opening warehouses in new markets. Our future growth is dependent, in part, on our ability to build or lease new warehouses. We compete with other retailers and businesses for suitable locations. Local land use and other regulations restricting the construction of our warehouses, as well as local community actions opposed to the location of our warehouses at specific sites and the adoption of certain local laws restricting our operations and environmental regulations may impact our ability to find suitable locations, and increase the cost of constructing, leasing and operating our warehouses. We also may have difficulty negotiating leases or 8 Table of Contents Item 1A—Risk Factors (Continued) real estate purchase agreements on acceptable terms. Failure to manage these and other similar factors effectively will affect our ability to build or lease new warehouses, which may have a material adverse affect on our future profitability. We seek to expand our business in existing markets in order to attain a greater overall market share. Because our warehouses typically draw members from their local areas, a new warehouse may draw members away from our nearby existing warehouses and may cause comparable warehouse sales performance and member traffic at those existing warehouses to slow or decline. We also intend to open warehouses in new markets. The risks associated with entering a new market include difficulties in attracting members due to a lack of familiarity with us, our lack of familiarity with local member preferences and seasonal differences in the market. In addition, entry into new markets may bring us into competition with new competitors or with existing competitors with a large, established market presence. While we have a track record of profitable growth, in new markets we cannot ensure that our new warehouses will be profitably deployed; as a result, our future profitability may be delayed or otherwise materially adversely affected. Any inability to open new warehouses on schedule could hurt our financial performance. We expect to increase our presence in existing markets and enter new markets. Our opening of new warehouses, domestically and internationally, will depend on our ability to: identify and secure suitable locations; negotiate leases or real estate purchase agreements on acceptable terms; attract and train qualified employees; and manage preopening expenses, including construction costs. We compete with other retailers and businesses for suitable locations for our warehouses. Our ability to open new warehouses also is affected by environmental regulations, local zoning issues and other laws related to land use. Failure to effectively manage these and other similar factors will affect our ability to open warehouses on schedule, which could adversely affect our financial performance. We are highly dependent on the financial performance of our United States and Canada operations. Our financial performance is highly dependent on our United States and Canada operations, which comprised 94% of consolidated net sales in both fiscal 2007 and 2006, and 93% and 94% of operating income in fiscal 2007 and 2006, respectively. Furthermore, we are highly dependent on our California operations, which comprised 28% and 31% of consolidated net sales in fiscal 2007 and 2006, respectively. Any substantial slowing or sustained decline in these operations could materially adversely affect our business and financial results. Declines in financial performance of our United States and Canada operations could arise from, among other things: failing to meet targets for warehouse openings; declines in actual or estimated comparable warehouse sales growth rates and expectations; negative trends in operating expenses, including increased labor and healthcare costs; cannibalizing existing locations with new warehouses; shifts in sales mix toward lower gross margin products; changes or uncertainties in economic conditions in our markets; and failing consistently to provide high quality products and innovative new products to retain our existing member base and attract new members. We depend on vendors to supply us with quality merchandise at the right time and at the right price. We depend heavily on our ability to purchase merchandise in sufficient quantities at competitive prices. We have no assurances of continued supply, pricing or access to new products, and any vendor could at any time change the terms upon which it sells to us or discontinue selling to us. Sales demands may lead to insufficient in-stock positions of our merchandise. 9 Table of Contents Item 1A—Risk Factors (Continued) We purchase our merchandise from numerous domestic and foreign manufacturers and importers. We have thousands of vendor relationships. Our inability to acquire suitable merchandise on acceptable terms or the loss of key vendors could negatively affect us. We may not be able to develop relationships with new vendors, and products from alternative sources, if any, may be of a lesser quality and/or more expensive than those from existing vendors. Our vendors are subject to risks, including labor disputes, union organizing activities, financial liquidity, inclement weather, natural disasters, supply constraints, and general economic and political conditions, that could limit their ability to timely provide us with acceptable merchandise. For these or other reasons, one or more of our vendors might not adhere to our quality control or legal or regulatory standards. These deficiencies may delay or preclude delivery of merchandise to us and might not be identified before we sell to our members. This failure could lead to litigation and recalls, which could damage our reputation and our private label brand, increase our costs, and otherwise hurt our business. In addition, the United States’ foreign trade policies, tariffs and other impositions on imported goods, trade sanctions imposed on certain countries, the limitation on the importation of certain types of goods or of goods containing certain materials from other countries and other factors relating to foreign trade are beyond our control. We may not timely identify or effectively respond to consumer trends, which could negatively affect our relationship with our members, the demand for our products and services, and our market share. It is difficult to consistently and successfully predict the products and services our members will demand. The success of our business depends in part on our ability to identify and respond to evolving trends in demographics and consumer preferences. Failure to timely identify or effectively respond to changing consumer tastes, preferences and spending patterns could negatively affect our relationship with our members, the demand for our products and services and our market share. Changes in accounting standards and subjective assumptions, estimates and judgments by management related to complex accounting matters could significantly affect our financial results. Generally accepted accounting principles and related accounting pronouncements, implementation guidelines and interpretations with regard to a wide range of matters that are relevant to our business, such as revenue recognition, sales returns reserve, impairment of long-lived assets and warehouse closing costs, inventories, self insurance, stock-based compensation, income taxes, unclaimed property laws and litigation, are highly complex and involve many subjective assumptions, estimates and judgments by our management. Changes in these rules or their interpretation or changes in underlying assumptions, estimates or judgments by our management could significantly change our reported or expected financial performance. Our international operations subject us to risks associated with the legislative, judicial, accounting, regulatory, political and economic factors specific to the countries or regions in which we operate, which could adversely affect our financial performance. Our international operations could form a larger portion of our business in future years. Future operating results internationally could be negatively affected by a variety of factors, many beyond our control. These factors include political conditions, economic conditions, regulatory constraints, currency regulations and exchange rates, and other matters in any of the countries or regions in which we operate, 10 Table of Contents Item 1A—Risk Factors (Continued) now or in the future. Other factors that may impact international operations include foreign trade, monetary and fiscal policies both of the United States and of other countries, laws and regulations of foreign governments, agencies and similar organizations, and risks associated with having major facilities located in countries which have been historically less stable than the United States. Implementation of technology initiatives could disrupt our operations in the near term and fail to provide the anticipated benefits. We have made and will continue to make significant technology investments both in our operations and in our administrative functions. The costs, potential problems and interruptions associated with the implementation of technology initiatives could disrupt or reduce the efficiency of our operations in the near term. In addition, new or upgraded technology might not provide the anticipated benefits; it might take longer than expected to realize the anticipated benefits or the technology might fail. Market expectations for our financial performance is high. We believe that the price of our stock reflects high market expectations for our future operating results. Any failure to meet these expectations for our comparable warehouse sales growth rates, earnings and earnings per share or new warehouse openings could cause the market price of our stock to drop. Cost related to natural disasters could unfavorably affect our financial performance. The occurrence of one or more natural disasters, such as hurricanes or earthquakes (particularly in California) could unfavorably affect our operations and financial performance. Such events could result in physical damage to one or more of our properties, the temporary closure of one or more warehouses or depots, the temporary lack of an adequate work force in a market, the temporary or long-term disruption in the supply of products from some local and overseas suppliers, the temporary disruption in the transport of goods from overseas, delays in the delivery of goods to our depots or warehouses within a country in which we operate and the temporary reduction in the availability of products in our warehouses. We are subject to a wide variety of federal, state, regional, local and international laws and regulations relating to the use, storage, discharge, and disposal of hazardous materials and hazardous and non-hazardous wastes, and other environmental matters. Any failure to comply with these laws could result in costs to satisfy environmental compliance, remediation requirements, or the imposition of severe penalties or restrictions on operations by governmental agencies or courts that could adversely affect our operations. We are involved in a number of legal proceedings, and while we cannot predict the outcomes of such proceedings and other contingencies with certainty, some of these outcomes may unfavorably affect our operations or increase our costs. We are involved in a number of legal proceedings, including grand jury investigations, consumer, employment, tort and other litigation. We cannot predict with certainty the outcomes of these legal proceedings and other contingencies, including environmental remediation and other proceedings commenced by governmental authorities. The outcome of some of these legal proceedings and other contingencies could require us to take or refrain from taking actions which could unfavorably affect our operations or could require us to pay substantial amounts of money. Additionally, defending against these lawsuits and proceedings may involve significant expense and diversion of management’s attention and resources. Our business requires compliance with a great variety of laws and regulations. Failure to achieve compliance could subject us to lawsuits and other proceedings, and lead to damage awards, fines and penalties. 11 Table of Contents Item 1A—Risk Factors (Continued) Failure of our internal control over financial reporting could harm our business and financial results. Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting. Internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting for external purposes in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. Internal control over financial reporting includes: maintaining records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect our transactions; providing reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary for preparation of the financial statements; providing reasonable assurance that our receipts and expenditures of our assets are made in accordance with management authorization; and providing reasonable assurance that unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of our assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements would be prevented or detected on a timely basis. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting is not intended to provide absolute assurance that a misstatement of our financial statements would be prevented or detected. Any failure to maintain an effective system of internal control over financial reporting could limit our ability to report our financial results accurately and timely or to detect and prevent fraud. Our success depends upon our ability to attract, train and retain highly qualified employees. To be successful, we must attract, train and retain a large and growing number of highly qualified associates, while controlling related labor costs. Our ability to control labor costs is subject to numerous external factors, including prevailing wage rates and healthcare and other insurance costs. We compete with other retail and non-retail businesses for these employees and invest significant resources in training and motivating them. We also depend on our executives and other key employees for our success. There is no assurance that we will be able to attract or retain highly qualified employees in the future. If we do not maintain the security of member-related information, we could damage our reputation with members, incur substantial additional costs and become subject to litigation. As do most retailers and wholesale club operators, we receive certain personal information about our members. In addition, our online operations at www.costco.com and www.costco.ca depend upon the secure transmission of confidential information over public networks, including information permitting cashless payments. A compromise of our security systems or those of some of our suppliers, or other business partners that results in our member’s personal information being obtained by unauthorized persons could adversely affect our reputation with our members and others, as well as our operations, results of operations, financial condition and liquidity, and could result in litigation against us or the imposition of penalties. In addition, a security breach could require that we expend significant additional resources related to the security of information systems and could result in a disruption of our operations, particularly our online sales operations. Privacy and Information Security The use of individually identifiable data by our business and our business associates is regulated at the international, federal and state levels. Privacy and information security laws and regulations change, and compliance with them may result in cost increases due to necessary systems changes and the development of new administrative processes. If we or our business associates fail to comply with these laws and regulations or experience a data security breach, our reputation could be damaged, possibly resulting in lost future business, and we could be subjected to additional legal risk as a result of non-compliance.

Exhibits, Financial Statement Schedules 40 2 Table of Contents PART I Item 1—Business Costco Wholesale Corporation and its subsidiaries (“Costco” or the “Company”) began operations in 1983 in Seattle, Washington. In October 1993, we merged with The Price Company, which had pioneered the membership warehouse concept, to form Price/Costco, Inc., a Delaware corporation. In January 1997, after the spin-off of most of our non-warehouse assets to Price Enterprises, Inc., we changed our name to Costco Companies, Inc. On August 30, 1999, we reincorporated from Delaware to Washington and changed our name to Costco Wholesale Corporation. Our common stock trades on the NASDAQ under the symbol “COST.” General We operate membership warehouses based on the concept that offering our members low prices on a limited selection of nationally branded and selected private-label products in a wide range of merchandise categories will produce high sales volumes and rapid inventory turnover. This rapid inventory turnover, when combined with the operating efficiencies achieved by volume purchasing, efficient distribution and reduced handling of merchandise in no-frills, self-service warehouse facilities, enables us to operate profitably at significantly lower gross margins than traditional wholesalers, mass merchandisers, supermarkets and supercenters. We buy the majority of our merchandise directly from manufacturers and route it to a cross-docking consolidation point (“depot”) or directly to our warehouses. Our depots receive container-based shipments from manufacturers and reallocate these goods for shipment to our individual warehouses, generally in less than twenty-four hours. This maximizes freight volume and handling efficiencies, lowering our receiving costs by eliminating many of the costs associated with multiple step distribution channels. Such traditional steps include purchasing from distributors as opposed to manufacturers, use of central receiving, storing and distributing warehouses, and storage of merchandise in locations off the sales floor. Because of our high sales volume and rapid inventory turnover, we generally have the opportunity to sell and be paid for inventory before we are required to pay many of our merchandise vendors, even though we take advantage of early payment discounts whenever available to us. As sales increase and inventory turnover becomes more rapid, a greater percentage of inventory is financed through payment terms provided by suppliers rather than by our working capital. Our typical warehouse format averages approximately 142,000 square feet; newer units tend to be larger. Floor plans are designed for economy and efficiency in the use of selling space, the handling of merchandise and the control of inventory. Because shoppers are attracted principally by the quality of merchandise and the availability of low prices, our warehouses need not have elaborate facilities. By strictly controlling the entrances and exits of our warehouses and using a membership format, we have limited inventory losses (shrinkage) to less than two-tenths of one percent of net sales in the last several fiscal years—well below those of typical discount retail operations. We generally limit marketing and promotional activities to new warehouse openings, occasional direct mail to prospective new members and regular direct marketing programs (such as The Costco Connection, a magazine we publish for our members, coupon mailers and handouts) to existing members promoting selected merchandise. These practices result in lower marketing expenses as compared to typical retailers. In connection with new warehouse openings, our marketing teams personally contact businesses in the area that are potential wholesale members. These contacts are supported by direct mailings during the period immediately prior to opening. Potential Gold Star (individual) members are 3 Table of Contents Item 1—Business (Continued) contacted by direct mail or by membership offerings distributed through employee associations and other entities. After a membership base is established in an area, most new memberships result from word-of-mouth advertising, follow-up messages distributed through employee groups and ongoing direct solicitations to prospective members. Our warehouses generally operate on a seven-day, 69-hour week, open weekdays between 10:00 a.m. and 8:30 p.m., with earlier closing hours on the weekend. Gasoline operations generally have extended hours. Because the hours of operation are shorter than those of traditional retailers, discount retailers and supermarkets, and due to other efficiencies inherent in a warehouse-type operation, labor costs are lower relative to the volume of sales. Merchandise is generally stored on racks above the sales floor and displayed on pallets containing large quantities of each item, thereby reducing labor required for handling and stocking. Our merchandising strategy is to provide our members with a broad range of high quality merchandise at prices consistently lower than they can obtain elsewhere. It is important to carry only those products on which we can provide our members significant savings. We seek to limit specific items in each product line to fast-selling models, sizes and colors. Therefore, we carry an average of approximately 4,000 active stock keeping units (SKUs) per warehouse in our core warehouse business, as opposed to 40,000 to 140,000 SKUs or more at discount retailers, supermarkets, and supercenters. Many consumable products are offered for sale in case, carton or multiple-pack quantities only. In keeping with our policy of member satisfaction, we generally accept returns of merchandise. In fiscal 2007, we introduced a 90-day return policy in the United States on certain electronic items. In fiscal 2008, the program was expanded to Canada and the United Kingdom. Additionally, we provide, free of charge, technical support services, as well as an extended warranty on certain electronic items. The following table indicates the approximate percentage of net sales accounted for by major category of items: 2008 2007 2006 Sundries (including candy, snack foods, tobacco, alcoholic and nonalcoholic beverages and cleaning and institutional supplies) 22 % 23 % 24 % Hardlines (including major appliances, electronics, health and beauty aids, hardware, office supplies, garden and patio, sporting goods, furniture, and automotive supplies) 19 % 21 % 20 % Food (including dry and institutionally packaged foods) 20 % 19 % 19 % Softlines (including apparel, domestics, jewelry, housewares, media, home furnishings, cameras and small appliances) 10 % 11 % 12 % Fresh Food (including meat, bakery, deli and produce) 12 % 12 % 11 % Ancillary and Other (including gas stations, pharmacy, food court, optical, one-hour photo, hearing aid and travel) 17 % 14 % 14 % 4 Table of Contents Item 1—Business (Continued) Ancillary businesses within or next to our warehouses provide expanded products and services and encourage members to shop more frequently. The following table indicates the number of ancillary businesses in operation at fiscal year end: 2008 2007 2006 Food Court and Hot Dog Stands 506 482 452 One-Hour Photo Centers 504 480 450 Optical Dispensing Centers 496 472 442 Pharmacies 451 429 401 Gas Stations 307 279 250 Hearing-Aid Centers 274 237 196 Print Shops and Copy Centers 7 8 9 Number of warehouses 512 488 458 Costco Mexico, our 50%-owned joint venture, operated 31 warehouses, under our oversight, at August 31, 2008. The Costco Mexico warehouses are not included in the table above as Costco Mexico is not consolidated and is accounted for using the equity method of accounting for investments. Our electronic commerce businesses, costco.com in the U.S. and costco.ca in Canada, provide our members additional products generally not found in our warehouses, in addition to services such as digital photo processing, pharmacy, travel and membership services. Our warehouses accept cash, checks, certain debit cards, American Express and a private label Costco credit card. Losses associated with dishonored checks have been minimal, as members who have issued dishonored checks are identified and prevented from making payments at the point of sale until restitution is made. We have direct buying relationships with many producers of national brand name merchandise. No significant portion of merchandise is obtained from any one of these or any other single supplier. We have not experienced any difficulty in obtaining sufficient quantities of merchandise, and believe that if one or more of our current sources of supply became unavailable, we would be able to obtain alternative sources without experiencing a substantial disruption of our business. We also purchase selected private label merchandise, as long as quality and customer demand are comparable and the value to our members is greater as compared to name brand items. Financial information of our segments and geographic areas is included in Note 12, Segment Reporting, to the accompanying consolidated financial statements. We report on a 52/53-week fiscal year, consisting of thirteen four-week periods and ending on the Sunday nearest the end of August. The first three quarters consist of three periods each, and the fourth quarter consists of four periods (five weeks in the thirteenth period in a 53-week year). There is no material seasonal impact on our operations, except an increased level of net sales and earnings during the winter holiday season. References to 2008 and 2007 relate to the 52-week fiscal years ended August 31, 2008 and September 2, 2007, respectively. References to 2006 relate to the 53-week fiscal year ended September 3, 2006. Membership Policy Our membership format is designed to reinforce customer loyalty and provide a continuing source of membership fee revenue, which allows us to offer lower prices. 5 Table of Contents Item 1—Business (Continued) Members can utilize their memberships at any Costco warehouse location in any country. We have two primary types of members: Business and Gold Star (individual). We continue to experience strong member renewal rates, currently at 87%. Businesses, including individuals with a business license, retail sales license or other evidence of business existence, may become Business members. Business members generally pay an annual membership fee of $50 for the primary and spouse membership card, with add-on membership cards available for an annual fee of $40 (including a free spouse card). A significant number of our business members also shop at Costco for their personal needs. Individual memberships (Gold Star memberships) are available to individuals who do not qualify for a Business membership, for an annual fee of $50, which includes a spouse card. Our membership base was made up of the following (in thousands): 2008 2007 2006 Gold Star 20,200 18,600 17,300 Business 5,600 5,400 5,200 Total primary cardholders 25,800 24,000 22,500 Add-on cardholders 27,700 26,400 25,200 Total cardholders 53,500 50,400 47,700 These numbers exclude approximately 2,800, 2,700 and 2,600 cardholders of Costco Mexico at the end of 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively. Executive membership is available to all members in the U.S. and Canada for an annual fee of $100. The Executive Membership program offers members additional savings and benefits on various business and consumer services offered by Costco, such as merchant credit-card processing, auto and home insurance, business telephone service, check printing, and real estate and mortgage services. The services are generally provided by third-parties and vary by state. In addition, Executive members qualify for a 2% annual reward (which can be redeemed at Costco warehouses), up to a maximum of $500 per year, on all qualified purchases made at Costco. At the end of 2008, 2007 and 2006, Executive members represented 26%, 23% and 20%, respectively of our primary membership base, and the percentage of our net sales attributable to these members continues to increase. In 2008, Costco Mexico launched an Executive Membership program similar to the program in the U.S. and Canada. Labor Our employee count approximated: 2008 2007 2006 Full-time employees 75,000 70,000 66,000 Part-time employees 62,000 57,000 53,000 Total employees 137,000 127,000 119,000 These numbers exclude approximately 9,000 individuals who were employed by Costco Mexico at the end of 2008 and 2007 and approximately 8,000 at the end of 2006. Approximately 14,000 hourly employees in certain of our locations (all former Price Company locations) in five states are represented by the International Brotherhood of Teamsters. All remaining employees are non-union. We consider our employee relations to be very good. 6 Table of Contents Item 1—Business (Continued) Competition Our industry is highly competitive, based on factors such as price, merchandise quality and selection, warehouse location and member service. Over 1,200 warehouse club locations exist across the U.S. and Canada, including our 473 North American warehouses, and every major metropolitan area has one, if not several, club operations. In addition to other membership warehouse operators such as Wal-Mart’s Sam’s Club and BJ’s Wholesale Club, we compete with a wide range of national and regional retailers and wholesalers, including supermarkets, supercenters, general merchandise chains, specialty chains, gasoline stations, as well as electronic commerce businesses. Wal-Mart, Target and Kohl’s are significant general merchandise retail competitors. We also compete with low-cost operators selling a single category or narrow range of merchandise, such as Lowe’s, Home Depot, Office Depot, PetSmart, Staples, Trader Joe’s, Whole Foods, Best Buy and Barnes & Noble. Our international operations face similar competitors. Regulation Certain state laws require that we apply minimum markups to our selling prices for specific goods, such as tobacco products, alcoholic beverages and gasoline. While compliance with such laws may cause us to charge somewhat higher prices, other retailers are also typically governed by the same restrictions, and we believe that compliance with such laws does not have a material adverse effect on our operations. It is our policy to sell at lower than manufacturers’ suggested retail prices. Some manufacturers attempt to maintain the resale price of their products by refusing to sell to us or to other purchasers that do not adhere to suggested retail prices or that otherwise sell at discounted prices. To date, we believe that we have not been materially affected by our inability to purchase directly from such manufacturers. Both federal and state legislation is proposed from time to time which, if enacted, would restrict our ability to purchase goods or extend the application of laws enabling the establishment of minimum prices. We cannot predict the effect on our business of the enactment of such legislation. Certain states, counties and municipalities have enacted or proposed laws and regulations that would prevent or restrict the operations or expansion plans of certain large retailers and warehouse clubs, including us, within their jurisdictions. We believe that, if enacted, such laws and regulations could have a material adverse affect on our operations. Available Information We maintain an internet website at www.costco.com. We make available through the Investor Relations section of our website, free of charge, our Annual Reports on Form 10-K, Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q, Current Reports on Form 8-K, Proxy Statements and Forms 3, 4 and 5, and any amendments to those reports, as soon as reasonably practicable after filing such material with, or furnishing such documents to, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). The information found on our website is not part of this or any other report filed with or furnished to the SEC. Item 1A—Risk Factors Certain statements contained in this document constitute forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. They include statements that address activities, events, conditions or developments that we expect or anticipate may occur in the future. Such forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties that may cause actual events, results or performance to differ materially from those indicated by such statements. 7 Table of Contents Item 1A—Risk Factors (Continued) The risks described below could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and/or results of operations. These risks could cause our actual results to differ materially from our historical experience and from results predicted by our forward-looking statements. Those statements may relate to such matters as sales growth, increases in comparable store sales, impact of cannibalization, price changes, earnings performance, earnings per share, stock–based compensation expense, warehouse openings and closures, the effect of adopting certain accounting standards, future financial reporting, financing, margins, return on invested capital, strategic direction, expense control, membership renewal rates, shopping frequency, litigation impact and the demand for our products and services. You should read these risk factors in conjunction with Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations in Item 7 of this Report and our consolidated financial statements and related notes in Item 8 of this Report. There may be other factors that we cannot anticipate or that are not described in this report, generally because we do not presently perceive them to be material, that could cause results to differ materially from our expectations. Forward-looking statements speak only as of the date they are made, and we do not undertake to update these forward-looking statements. You are advised, however, to review any further disclosures we make on related subjects in our periodic filings with the SEC. We face strong competition from other retailers and warehouse club operators, which could negatively affect our financial performance. The retail business is highly competitive. We compete for members, employees, warehouse sites, products and services and in other important respects with many other local, regional and national retailers, both in the United States and in foreign countries. We compete with other warehouse club operators, discount retailers, retail and wholesale grocers and general merchandise wholesalers and distributors, as well as electronic commerce retailers, wholesalers and catalog businesses. Internationally, we compete with retailers who operate department, drug, variety and specialty stores, supermarkets, supercenter stores, warehouse clubs, internet-based retailers and catalog businesses. Such retailers and warehouse club operators compete in a variety of ways, including merchandise pricing, selection and availability, services offered to members, location, store hours and price. Our inability to respond effectively to competitive pressures and changes in the retail markets could negatively affect our financial performance. Some competitors may have greater financial resources, better access to merchandise, and/or greater market penetration than we do. General economic factors, domestically and internationally, may adversely affect our financial performance. Higher interest rates, energy costs, inflation, levels of unemployment, healthcare costs, consumer debt levels, unsettled financial markets, and other economic factors could adversely affect demand for our products and services or require a change in the mix of products we sell. Prices of certain commodity products, including gasoline and other food products, are historically volatile and are subject to fluctuations arising from changes in domestic and international supply and demand, labor costs, competition, market speculation, government regulations and periodic delays in delivery. Rapid and significant changes in commodity prices may affect our sales and profit margins. These factors can also increase our merchandise costs and/or selling, general and administrative expenses, and otherwise adversely affect our operations and results. General economic conditions can also be affected by the outbreak of war, acts of terrorism or other significant national or international events. 8 Table of Contents Item 1A—Risk Factors (Continued) Our growth strategy includes expanding our business, both in existing markets and in new markets. Our future growth is dependent, in part, on our ability to build or lease new warehouses. We compete with other retailers and businesses for suitable locations. Local land use and other regulations restricting the construction and operation of our warehouses, as well as local community actions opposed to the location of our warehouses at specific sites and the adoption of local laws restricting our operations and environmental regulations may impact our ability to find suitable locations, and increase the cost of constructing, leasing and operating our warehouses. We also may have difficulty negotiating leases or real estate purchase agreements on acceptable terms. Failure to manage these and other similar factors effectively will affect our ability to timely build or lease new warehouses, which may have a material adverse affect on our future growth and profitability. We seek to expand our business in existing markets in order to attain a greater overall market share. Because our warehouses typically draw members from their local areas, a new warehouse may draw members away from our nearby existing warehouses and may adversely affect comparable warehouse sales performance and member traffic at those existing warehouses. We also intend to open warehouses in new markets. The risks associated with entering a new market include difficulties in attracting members due to a lack of familiarity with us, our lack of familiarity with local member preferences and seasonal differences in the market. In addition, entry into new markets may bring us into competition with new competitors or with existing competitors with a large, established market presence. While we have a track record of profitable growth, in new markets we cannot ensure that our new warehouses will be profitably deployed; as a result, our future profitability may be delayed or otherwise materially adversely affected. We are highly dependent on the financial performance of our United States and Canada operations. Our financial and operational performance is highly dependent on our United States and Canada operations, which comprised 93% and 94% of consolidated net sales in fiscal 2008 and 2007, respectively, and 92% and 93% of operating income in 2008 and 2007, respectively. Within the United States, we are highly dependent on our California operations, which comprised 27% and 28% of consolidated net sales in 2008 and 2007, respectively. Our California market in general, has a larger percentage of higher volume warehouses as compared to our other markets. As a result, the operating income from our California operations is generally higher as a percentage of total operating income than other regions. Any substantial slowing or sustained decline in these operations could materially adversely affect our business and financial results. Declines in financial performance of our United States operations, particularly in California, and our Canada operations could arise from, among other things: failing to meet targets for warehouse openings; declines in actual or estimated comparable warehouse sales growth rates and expectations; negative trends in operating expenses, including increased labor, healthcare and energy costs; cannibalizing existing locations with new warehouses; shifts in sales mix toward lower gross margin products; changes or uncertainties in economic conditions in our markets; and failing consistently to provide high quality products and innovative new products to retain our existing member base and attract new members. We depend on vendors to timely supply us with quality merchandise at the right prices. We depend heavily on our ability to purchase merchandise in sufficient quantities at competitive prices. We have no assurances of continued supply, pricing or access to new products, and any vendor could at any time change the terms upon which it sells to us or discontinue selling to us. Member demands may lead to insufficient in-stock positions of our merchandise, leading to loss of sales. 9 Table of Contents Item 1A—Risk Factors (Continued) We purchase our merchandise from numerous domestic and foreign manufacturers and importers and have thousands of vendor relationships. Our inability to acquire suitable merchandise on acceptable terms or the loss of key vendors could negatively affect us. We may not be able to develop relationships with new vendors, and products from alternative sources, if any, may be of a lesser quality or more expensive than those from existing vendors. Our suppliers are subject to risks, including labor disputes, union organizing activities, financial liquidity, inclement weather, natural disasters, supply constraints, and general economic and political conditions, that could limit their ability to timely provide us with acceptable merchandise. For these or other reasons, one or more of our suppliers might not adhere to our quality control, legal or regulatory standards. These deficiencies may delay or preclude delivery of merchandise to us and might not be identified before we sell such merchandise to our members. This failure could lead to litigation and recalls, which could damage our reputation and our brands, increase our costs, and otherwise hurt our business. In addition, the United States’ foreign trade policies, tariffs and other impositions on imported goods, security and safety regulations, trade sanctions imposed on certain countries, the limitation on the importation of certain types of goods or of goods containing certain materials from other countries and other factors relating to foreign trade are beyond our control. We depend on our depot operations to effectively and efficiently supply product to our warehouses. We depend on the orderly operation of the receiving and distribution process, primarily through our depots. Although we believe that our receiving and distribution process is efficient, unforeseen disruptions in operations due to fires, hurricanes or other catastrophic events, labor disagreements or shipping problems, may result in delays in the delivery of merchandise to our warehouses. We may not timely identify or effectively respond to consumer trends, which could negatively affect our relationship with our members, the demand for our products and services, and our market share. It is difficult to consistently and successfully predict the products and services our members will demand. The success of our business depends in part on our ability to identify and respond to evolving trends in demographics and consumer preferences. Failure to timely identify or effectively respond to changing consumer tastes, preferences and spending patterns could negatively affect our relationship with our members, the demand for our products and services and our market share. If we are not successful at predicting our sales trends and adjusting our purchases accordingly, we may have excess inventory, which could result in additional markdowns and reduce our operating performance. This could have an adverse effect on margins and operating income. Our failure to maintain positive membership loyalty and brand recognition could adversely affect our financial results. Damage to our brands or reputation may negatively impact comparable warehouse sales, lower employee morale and productivity, and diminish member trust, resulting in a reduction in shareholder value. 10 Table of Contents Item 1A—Risk Factors (Continued) Changes in accounting standards and subjective assumptions, estimates and judgments by management related to complex accounting matters could significantly affect our financial results. Generally accepted accounting principles and related accounting pronouncements, implementation guidelines and interpretations with regard to a wide range of matters that are relevant to our business, including but not limited to, revenue recognition, sales returns reserves, impairment of long-lived assets and warehouse closing costs, inventories, self-insurance, income taxes, unclaimed property laws and litigation, are highly complex and involve many subjective assumptions, estimates and judgments by our management. Changes in these rules or their interpretation or changes in underlying assumptions, estimates or judgments by our management could significantly change our reported or expected financial performance. Failure of our internal control over financial reporting could limit our ability to report our financial results accurately and timely. Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting. Internal control over financial reporting is designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting for external purposes in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. Internal control over financial reporting includes: maintaining records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect our transactions; providing reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary for preparation of the financial statements; providing reasonable assurance that our receipts and expenditures of our assets are made in accordance with management authorization; and providing reasonable assurance that unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of our assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements would be prevented or detected on a timely basis. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting is not intended to provide absolute assurance that a misstatement of our financial statements would be prevented or detected. Any failure to maintain an effective system of internal control over financial reporting could limit our ability to report our financial results accurately and timely or to detect and prevent fraud. Our international operations subject us to risks associated with the legislative, judicial, accounting, regulatory, political and economic factors specific to the countries or regions in which we operate, which could adversely affect our financial performance. Our international operations could form a larger portion of our business in future years. Future operating results internationally could be negatively affected by a variety of factors, many beyond our control. These factors include political conditions, economic conditions, regulatory constraints, currency regulations and exchange rates, and other matters in any of the countries or regions in which we operate, now or in the future. Other factors that may impact international operations include foreign trade, monetary and fiscal policies both of the United States and of other countries, laws and regulations of foreign governments, agencies and similar organizations, and risks associated with having major facilities located in countries which have been historically less stable than the United States. Risks inherent in international operations also include, among others, the costs and difficulties of managing international operations, adverse tax consequences and greater difficulty in enforcing intellectual property rights. Additionally, foreign currency exchange rates and fluctuations may have an impact on our future costs or on future cash flows from our international operations. Market expectations for our financial performance is high. We believe that the price of our stock reflects high market expectations for our future operating results. Any failure to meet these expectations, including our comparable warehouse sales growth rates, earn- 11 Table of Contents Item 1A—Risk Factors (Continued) ings and earnings per share or new warehouse openings, could cause the market price of our stock to decline. We rely extensively on computer systems to process transactions, summarize results and manage our business. Disruptions in both our primary and secondary (back-up) systems could harm our ability to run our business. Although we have independent, redundant, and primary and secondary computer systems, given the number of individual transactions we have each year, it is critical that we maintain uninterrupted operation of our business-critical computer systems. Our computer systems, including our back-up systems, are subject to damage or interruption from power outages, computer and telecommunications failures, computer viruses, internal or external security breaches, catastrophic events such as fires, earthquakes, tornadoes and hurricanes, and/or errors by our employees. If our computer systems and our back-up systems are damaged or cease to function properly, we may have to make significant investment to fix or replace them, and we may suffer interruptions in our operations in the interim. Any material interruption in both of our computer systems and back-up systems may have a material adverse effect on our business or results of operations. Natural disasters could unfavorably affect our financial performance. The occurrence of natural disasters, such as hurricanes or earthquakes, particularly in California, or in Washington state, where our centralized operating systems and administrative personnel are located, could unfavorably affect our operations and financial performance. Such events could result in physical damage to one or more of our properties, the temporary closure of one or more warehouses or depots, the temporary lack of an adequate work force in a market, the temporary or long-term disruption in the supply of products from some local and overseas suppliers, the temporary disruption in the transport of goods from overseas, delays in the delivery of goods to our depots or warehouses within a country in which we operate and the temporary reduction in the availability of products in our warehouses. We are subject to a wide variety of federal, state, regional, local and international laws and regulations relating to the use, storage, discharge, and disposal of hazardous materials and hazardous and non-hazardous wastes, and other environmental matters. Any failure to comply with these laws could result in costs to satisfy environmental compliance, remediation or compensatory requirements, or the imposition of severe penalties or restrictions on operations by governmental agencies or courts that could adversely affect our operations. We are involved in a number of legal proceedings and audits, and while we cannot predict the outcomes of such proceedings and other contingencies with certainty, some of these outcomes may unfavorably affect our operations or increase our costs. We are involved in a number of legal proceedings and audits, including grand jury investigations, other government investigations, consumer, employment, tort and other litigation. We cannot predict with certainty the outcomes of these legal proceedings and other contingencies, including environmental remediation and other proceedings commenced by governmental authorities. The outcome of some of these legal proceedings and other contingencies could require us to take or refrain from taking actions which could unfavorably affect our operations or could require us to pay substantial amounts of money. Additionally, defending against these lawsuits and proceedings may involve significant expense and diversion of management’s attention and resources. Our business requires compliance with a great variety of laws and regulations. Failure to achieve compliance could subject us to lawsuits and other proceedings, and lead to damage awards, fines and penalties. 12 Table of Contents Item 1A—Risk Factors (Continued) We are subject to the risk of product liability claims, including claims concerning food and prepared food products. The sale of food and prepared food products for human consumption involves the risk of injury to our members. Such injuries may result from tampering by unauthorized third parties, product contamination or spoilage, including the presence of foreign objects, substances, chemicals, other agents, or residues introduced during the growing, storage, handling and transportation phases. While we are subject to governmental inspection and regulations and believe our facilities comply in all material respects with all applicable laws and regulations, we cannot be sure that consumption of our products will not cause a health-related illness in the future or that we will not be subject to claims or lawsuits relating to such matters. Even if a product liability claim is unsuccessful or is not fully pursued, the negative publicity surrounding any assertion that our products caused illness or injury could adversely affect our reputation with existing and potential members and our corporate and brand image. Our success depends, in part on the continued contributions of management and on our ability to attract, train and retain highly qualified employees. Our success depends to a significant degree on the continued contributions of members of our senior management and other key operations, merchandising and administrative personnel, and the loss of any such person(s) could have a material adverse effect. Other than an annual agreement with our President and CEO, Mr. Sinegal, we have no employment agreements with our officers. We must attract, train and retain a large and growing number of highly qualified employees, while controlling related labor costs. Our ability to control labor costs is subject to numerous external factors, including prevailing wage rates and healthcare and other insurance costs. We compete with other retail and non-retail businesses for these employees and invest significant resources in training and motivating them. There is no assurance that we will be able to attract or retain highly qualified employees in the future, which could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s business, results of operations and financial condition. The Company does not maintain key man insurance. If we do not maintain the privacy and security of member-related information, we could damage our reputation with members, incur substantial additional costs and become subject to litigation. We receive and retain certain personal information about our members. In addition, our online operations at www.costco.com and www.costco.ca depend upon the secure transmission of confidential information over public networks, including information permitting cashless payments. A compromise of our security systems or those of other business partners that results in our member’s personal information being obtained by unauthorized persons could adversely affect our reputation with our members and others, as well as our operations, results of operations, financial condition and liquidity, and could result in litigation against us or the imposition of penalties. In addition, a security breach could require that we expend significant additional resources related to the security of information systems and could result in a disruption of our operations, particularly our online sales operations. Additionally, the use of individually identifiable data by our business and our business associates is regulated at the international, federal and state levels. Privacy and information security laws and regulations change, and compliance with them may result in cost increases due to necessary systems changes and the development of new administrative processes. If we or those with whom we share information fail to comply with these laws and regulations or experience a data security breach, our reputation could be damaged, possibly resulting in lost future business, and we could be subjected to additional legal risk as a result of non-compliance.

They include statements that address activities, events, conditions or developments that we expect or anticipate may occur in the future. Such forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties that may cause actual events, results, or performance to differ materially from those indicated by such statements. See Item 1A—Risk Factors for a discussion of risks and uncertainties that may affect our business. PART I Item 1—Business Costco Wholesale Corporation and its subsidiaries (“Costco” or the “Company”) began operations in 1983 in Seattle, Washington. In October 1993, we merged with The Price Company, which had pioneered the membership warehouse concept, to form Price/Costco, Inc., a Delaware corporation. In January 1997, after the spin-off of most of our non-warehouse assets to Price Enterprises, Inc., we changed our name to Costco Companies, Inc. On August 30, 1999, we reincorporated from Delaware to Washington and changed our name to Costco Wholesale Corporation. Our common stock trades on The NASDAQ Global Select Market under the symbol “COST.” General We operate membership warehouses based on the concept that offering our members low prices on a limited selection of nationally branded and selected private-label products in a wide range of merchandise categories will produce high sales volumes and rapid inventory turnover. This rapid inventory turnover, when combined with the operating efficiencies achieved by volume purchasing, efficient distribution and reduced handling of merchandise in no-frills, self-service warehouse facilities, enables us to operate profitably at significantly lower gross margins than traditional wholesalers, mass merchandisers, supermarkets, and supercenters. We buy the majority of our merchandise directly from manufacturers and route it to a cross-docking consolidation point (“depot”) or directly to our warehouses. Our depots receive container-based shipments from manufacturers and reallocate these goods for shipment to our individual warehouses, generally in less than twenty-four hours. This maximizes freight volume and handling efficiencies, lowering our receiving costs by eliminating many of the costs associated with multiple-step distribution channels. Such traditional steps include purchasing from distributors as opposed to manufacturers, use of central receiving, storing and distributing warehouses, and storage of merchandise in locations off the sales floor. Because of our high sales volume and rapid inventory turnover, we generally have the opportunity to sell and be paid for inventory before we are required to pay many of our merchandise vendors, even though we take advantage of early payment discounts whenever available to us. To the extent that sales increase and inventory turnover becomes more rapid, a greater percentage of inventory is financed through payment terms provided by suppliers rather than by our working capital. Our typical warehouse format averages approximately 143,000 square feet; newer units tend to be larger. Floor plans are designed for economy and efficiency in the use of selling space, the handling of merchandise, and the control of inventory. Because shoppers are attracted principally by the quality of merchandise and the availability of low prices, our warehouses need not have elaborate facilities. By strictly controlling the entrances and exits of our warehouses and using a membership format, we have limited inventory losses (shrinkage) to less than two-tenths of one percent of net sales in the last several fiscal years—well below those of typical discount retail operations. 3 Table of Contents Item 1—Business (Continued) We generally limit marketing and promotional activities to new warehouse openings, occasional direct mail to prospective new members and regular direct marketing programs (such as The Costco Connection, a magazine we publish for our members, coupon mailers, weekly email blasts from costco.com, and handouts) to existing members promoting selected merchandise. These practices result in lower marketing expenses as compared to typical retailers. In connection with new warehouse openings, our marketing teams personally contact businesses in the area that are potential wholesale members. These contacts are supported by direct mailings during the period immediately prior to opening. Potential Gold Star (individual) members are contacted by direct mail or by membership offerings distributed through employee associations and other entities. After a membership base is established in an area, most new memberships result from word-of-mouth advertising, follow-up messages distributed through employee groups and ongoing direct solicitations to prospective members. Our warehouses generally operate on a seven-day, 69-hour week, open weekdays between 10:00 a.m. and 8:30 p.m., with earlier closing hours on the weekend. Gasoline operations generally have extended hours. Because the hours of operation are shorter than those of traditional retailers, discount retailers and supermarkets, and due to other efficiencies inherent in a warehouse-type operation, labor costs are lower relative to the volume of sales. Merchandise is generally stored on racks above the sales floor and displayed on pallets containing large quantities of each item, thereby reducing labor required for handling and stocking. Our merchandising strategy is to provide our members with a broad range of high quality merchandise at prices consistently lower than they can obtain elsewhere. We seek to limit specific items in each product line to fast-selling models, sizes and colors. Therefore, we carry an average of approximately 3,800 active stock keeping units (SKUs) per warehouse in our core warehouse business, as opposed to 45,000 to 140,000 SKUs or more at discount retailers, supermarkets, and supercenters. Many consumable products are offered for sale in case, carton, or multiple-pack quantities only. In keeping with our policy of member satisfaction, we generally accept returns of merchandise. On certain electronic items, we have a 90-day return policy in the United States, Canada and the United Kingdom and provide, free of charge, technical support services, as well as an extended warranty. The following table indicates the approximate percentage of net sales accounted for by major category of items: 2009 2008 2007 Sundries (including candy, snack foods, tobacco, alcoholic and nonalcoholic beverages and cleaning and institutional supplies) 23 % 22 % 23 % Hardlines (including major appliances, electronics, health and beauty aids, hardware, office supplies, garden and patio, sporting goods, furniture, and automotive supplies) 19 % 19 % 21 % Food (including dry and institutionally packaged foods) 21 % 20 % 19 % Softlines (including apparel, domestics, jewelry, housewares, media, home furnishings, cameras and small appliances) 10 % 10 % 11 % Fresh Food (including meat, bakery, deli and produce) 12 % 12 % 12 % Ancillary and Other (including gas stations, pharmacy, food court, optical, one-hour photo, hearing aid and travel) 15 % 17 % 14 % 4 Table of Contents Item 1—Business (Continued) Ancillary businesses within or next to our warehouses provide expanded products and services and encourage members to shop more frequently. The following table indicates the number of ancillary businesses in operation at fiscal year end: 2009 2008 2007 Food Court and Hot Dog Stands 521 506 482 One-Hour Photo Centers 518 504 480 Optical Dispensing Centers 509 496 472 Pharmacies 464 451 429 Gas Stations 323 307 279 Hearing-Aid Centers 303 274 237 Print Shops and Copy Centers 10 7 8 Car Washes 2 2 1 Number of warehouses 527 512 488 Costco Mexico, our 50%-owned joint venture, operated 32 warehouses, under our oversight, at August 30, 2009. The Costco Mexico warehouses are not included in the table above as Costco Mexico is accounted for using the equity method of accounting for investments. Our electronic commerce businesses, costco.com in the U.S. and costco.ca in Canada, provide our members additional products generally not found in our warehouses, in addition to services such as digital photo processing, pharmacy, travel, and membership services. Our warehouses accept cash, checks, certain debit cards, American Express and a private label Costco credit card. Losses associated with dishonored checks have been minimal, as members who have issued dishonored checks are identified and prevented from making payments at the point of sale until restitution is made. We have direct buying relationships with many producers of national brand-name merchandise. We do not obtain a significant portion of merchandise from any one supplier. We have not experienced any difficulty in obtaining sufficient quantities of merchandise, and believe that if one or more of our current sources of supply became unavailable, we would be able to obtain alternative sources without substantial disruption of our business. We also purchase selected private label merchandise, as long as quality and customer demand are comparable and the value to our members is greater as compared to name brand items. Certain financial information for our segments and geographic areas is included in Note 12 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this Report. We report on a 52/53-week fiscal year, consisting of thirteen four-week periods and ending on the Sunday nearest the end of August. The first three quarters consist of three periods each, and the fourth quarter consists of four periods (five weeks in the thirteenth period in a 53-week year). There is no material seasonal impact on our operations, except an increased level of net sales and earnings during the winter holiday season. References to 2009, 2008, and 2007 relate to the 52-week fiscal years ended August 30, 2009, August 31, 2008, and September 2, 2007, respectively. Membership Policy Our membership format is designed to reinforce customer loyalty and provide a continuing source of membership fee revenue, which allows us to offer lower prices. Members can utilize their memberships 5 Table of Contents Item 1—Business (Continued) at any Costco warehouse location in any country. We have two primary types of members: Business and Gold Star (individual). We continue to experience strong member renewal rates, currently at 87%. Businesses, including individuals with a business license, retail sales license or other evidence of business existence, may become Business members. Business members generally pay an annual membership fee of $50 for the primary and spouse membership card, with add-on membership cards available for an annual fee of $40 (including a free spouse card). Many of our business members also shop at Costco for their personal needs. Individual memberships (Gold Star memberships) are available to individuals who do not qualify for a Business membership, for an annual fee of $50, which includes a spouse card. Our membership base was made up of the following (in thousands): 2009 2008 2007 Gold Star 21,500 20,200 18,600 Business 5,700 5,600 5,400 Business, Add-on Primary 3,400 3,400 3,500 Total primary cardholders 30,600 29,200 27,500 Additional cardholders 25,400 24,300 22,900 Total cardholders 56,000 53,500 50,400 These numbers exclude approximately 2,800, 2,800, and 2,700 cardholders of Costco Mexico at the end of 2009, 2008, and 2007, respectively. Executive membership is available to all members in the U.S., Canada, and United Kingdom for an annual fee of approximately $100. The program offers additional savings and benefits on various business and consumer services offered by Costco, such as merchant credit-card processing, auto and home insurance, business telephone service, and check printing services. The services are generally provided by third-parties and vary by country and state. In addition, Executive members qualify for a 2% annual reward (which can be redeemed at Costco warehouses), up to a maximum of approximately $500 per year, on all qualified purchases made at Costco. At the end of 2009, 2008, and 2007, Executive members represented 29%, 26%, and 23%, respectively of our primary membership base. Executive members spend more than other members, and the percentage of our net sales attributable to these members continues to increase. In 2008, Costco Mexico launched an Executive Membership program similar to the program in the U.S. and Canada. Labor Our employee count approximated: 2009 2008 2007 Full-time employees 79,000 75,000 70,000 Part-time employees 63,000 62,000 57,000 Total employees 142,000 137,000 127,000 These numbers exclude approximately 9,000 individuals who were employed by Costco Mexico at the end of 2009, 2008 and 2007. Approximately 13,500 hourly employees in certain of our locations (all former Price Company locations) in five states are represented by the International Brotherhood of Teamsters. All remaining employees are non-union. We consider our employee relations to be very good. 6 Table of Contents Item 1—Business (Continued) Competition Our industry is highly competitive, based on factors such as price, merchandise quality and selection, warehouse location and member service. Over 1,200 warehouse club locations exist across the U.S. and Canada, including our 483 North American warehouses, and every major metropolitan area has several club operations. In addition to other membership warehouse operators such as Wal-Mart’s Sam’s Club and BJ’s Wholesale Club, we compete with a wide range of national and regional retailers and wholesalers, including supermarkets, supercenters, general merchandise chains, specialty chains, gasoline stations, as well as electronic commerce businesses, such as Amazon. Wal-Mart, Target and Kohl’s are significant general merchandise retail competitors. We also compete with low-cost operators selling a single category or narrow range of merchandise, such as Lowe’s, Home Depot, Office Depot, PetSmart, Staples, Trader Joe’s, Whole Foods, Best Buy and Barnes & Noble. Our international operations face similar competitors. Regulation Certain state laws require that we apply minimum markups to our selling prices for specific goods, such as tobacco products, alcoholic beverages, and gasoline. While compliance with such laws may cause us to charge higher prices, other retailers are also typically governed by the same restrictions, and we believe that compliance with such laws does not have a material adverse effect on our operations. Certain states, counties, and municipalities have enacted or proposed laws and regulations that would prevent or restrict the operations or expansion plans of certain large retailers and warehouse clubs, including us, within their jurisdictions. We believe that, if enacted, such laws and regulations could have a material adverse affect on our operations. Intellectual Property We believe that our trademarks, trade names, copyrights, proprietary processes, trade secrets, patents, trade dress and similar intellectual property add significant value to our business and are important factors in our success. We have invested significantly in the development and protection of our well-recognized brands including Costco Wholesale and our premium private label brand, Kirkland Signature®. Kirkland Signature products are premium products offered to our members at prices that are generally lower than those for national brand products. Kirkland Signature products allow us to ensure our quality standards are met, while minimizing costs and differentiating our merchandise offerings from other retailers, and we generally earn higher margins on sales of Kirkland products. We expect that our private label items will increase their share of our sales in the future. We rely on trademark and copyright law, trade secret protection, and confidentiality and/or license agreements with our employees and others to protect our proprietary rights. Effective intellectual property protection may not be available in every country in which we operate. Available Information Our internet website is www.costco.com. We make available through the Investor Relations section of that site, free of charge, our Annual Reports on Form 10-K, Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q, Current Reports on Form 8-K, Proxy Statements and Forms 3, 4 and 5, and any amendments to those reports, as soon as reasonably practicable after filing such materials with, or furnishing such documents to, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).

Item 1A—Risk Factors The risks described below could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, and/or results of operations. These risks could cause our actual results to differ materially from our historical experience and from results predicted by our forward-looking statements. Those statements may relate to such matters as sales growth, increases in comparable store sales, impact of cannibalization, price changes, earnings performance, earnings per share, stock-based compensation expense, warehouse openings and closures, the effect of adopting certain accounting standards, future financial reporting, financing, margins, return on invested capital, strategic direction, expense control, membership renewal rates, shopping frequency, litigation impact and the demand for our products and services. You should read these risk factors in conjunction with Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations in Item 7 of this Report and our consolidated financial statements and related notes in Item 8 of this Report. There may be other factors that we cannot anticipate or that are not described in this report, generally because we do not presently perceive them to be material, that could cause results to differ materially from our expectations. Forward-looking statements speak only as of the date they are made, and we do not undertake to update these forward-looking statements. You are advised to review any further disclosures we make on related subjects in our periodic filings with the SEC. We face strong competition from other retailers and warehouse club operators, which could negatively affect our financial performance. The retail business is highly competitive. We compete for members, employees, warehouse sites, products and services and in other important respects with many other local, regional and national retailers, both in the United States and in foreign countries. We compete with other warehouse club operators, discount retailers, supermarkets, supercenter stores, retail and wholesale grocers, department, drug, variety and specialty stores and general merchandise wholesalers and distributors, as well as internet-based retailers, wholesalers and catalog businesses. Such retailers and warehouse club operators compete in a variety of ways, including merchandise pricing, selection and availability, services, location, convenience, store hours, and price. Our inability to respond effectively to competitive pressures and changes in the retail markets could negatively affect our financial performance. Some competitors may have greater financial resources, better access to merchandise, and/or greater market penetration than we do. General economic factors, domestically and internationally, may adversely affect our financial performance. Higher interest rates, energy costs, inflation, levels of unemployment, healthcare costs, consumer debt levels, unsettled financial markets, weaknesses in housing and real estate markets, reduced consumer confidence, changes related to government fiscal and tax policies and other economic factors could adversely affect demand for our products and services or require a change in the mix of products we sell. Prices of certain commodity products, including gasoline and other food products, are historically volatile and are subject to fluctuations arising from changes in domestic and international supply and demand, labor costs, competition, market speculation, government regulations and periodic delays in delivery. Rapid and significant changes in commodity prices may affect our sales and profit margins. These factors can also increase our merchandise costs and/or selling, general and administrative expenses, and otherwise adversely affect our operations and results. General economic conditions can also be affected by the outbreak of war, acts of terrorism, or other significant national or international events. 9 Table of Contents Item 1A—Risk Factors (Continued) Our growth strategy includes expanding our business, both in existing markets and in new markets. Our future growth is dependent, in part, on our ability to acquire property, and build or lease new warehouses. We compete with other retailers and businesses for suitable locations. Local land use and other regulations restricting the construction and operation of our warehouses, as well as local community actions opposed to the location of our warehouses at specific sites and the adoption of local laws restricting our operations and environmental regulations may impact our ability to find suitable locations, and increase the cost of constructing, leasing and operating our warehouses. We also may have difficulty negotiating leases or real estate purchase agreements on acceptable terms. Failure to manage these and other similar factors effectively will affect our ability to timely build or lease new warehouses, which may have a material adverse affect on our future growth and profitability. We seek to expand our business in existing markets in order to attain a greater overall market share. Because our warehouses typically draw members from their local areas, a new warehouse may draw members away from our nearby existing warehouses and may adversely affect comparable warehouse sales performance and member traffic at those existing warehouses. We also intend to open warehouses in new markets. The risks associated with entering a new market include difficulties in attracting members due to a lack of familiarity with us, attracting members of other wholesale club operators currently operating in the new market, our lack of familiarity with local member preferences, and seasonal differences in the market. In addition, entry into new markets may bring us into competition with new competitors or with existing competitors with a large, established market presence. In new markets, we cannot ensure that our new warehouses will be profitably deployed; as a result, our future profitability may be delayed or otherwise materially adversely affected. We are highly dependent on the financial performance of our United States and Canada operations. Our financial and operational performance is highly dependent on our United States and Canada operations, which comprised 93% of consolidated net sales in 2009 and 2008, and 92% of operating income in 2009 and 2008. Within the United States, we are highly dependent on our California operations, which comprised 27% of consolidated net sales in 2009 and 2008. Our California market in general, has a larger percentage of higher volume warehouses as compared to our other markets. As a result, the operating income from our California operations is generally higher as a percentage of total operating income than other regions. Any substantial slowing or sustained decline in these operations could materially adversely affect our business and financial results. Declines in financial performance of our United States operations, particularly in California, and our Canada operations could arise from, among other things: failing to meet targets for warehouse openings; declines in actual or estimated comparable warehouse sales growth rates and expectations; negative trends in operating expenses, including increased labor, healthcare and energy costs; cannibalizing existing locations with new warehouses; shifts in sales mix toward lower gross margin products; changes or uncertainties in economic conditions in our markets; and failing consistently to provide high quality products and innovative new products to retain our existing member base and attract new members. We depend on vendors to supply us with quality merchandise at the right prices in a timely manner. We depend heavily on our ability to purchase merchandise in sufficient quantities at competitive prices. We have no assurances of continued supply, pricing or access to new products, and any vendor could at any time change the terms upon which it sells to us or discontinue selling to us. Member demands may lead to out-of-stock positions of our merchandise, leading to loss of sales and profits. 10 Table of Contents Item 1A—Risk Factors (Continued) We purchase our merchandise from numerous domestic and foreign manufacturers and importers and have thousands of vendor relationships. Our inability to acquire suitable merchandise on acceptable terms or the loss of key vendors could negatively affect us. We may not be able to develop relationships with new vendors, and products from alternative sources, if any, may be of a lesser quality or more expensive than those from existing vendors. Our suppliers are subject to risks, including labor disputes, union organizing activities, financial liquidity, inclement weather, natural disasters, supply constraints, and general economic and political conditions, that could limit their ability to timely provide us with acceptable merchandise. For these or other reasons, one or more of our suppliers might not adhere to our quality control, legal or regulatory standards. These deficiencies may delay or preclude delivery of merchandise to us and might not be identified before we sell such merchandise to our members. This failure could lead to litigation and recalls, which could damage our reputation and our brands, increase our costs, and otherwise hurt our business. In addition, the United States’ foreign trade policies, tariffs and other impositions on imported goods, security and safety regulations, trade sanctions imposed on certain countries, the limitation on the importation of certain types of goods or of goods containing certain materials from other countries and other factors relating to foreign trade are beyond our control. We depend on our depot operations to effectively and efficiently supply product to our warehouses. We depend on the orderly operation of the receiving and distribution process, primarily through our depots. Although we believe that our receiving and distribution process is efficient, unforeseen disruptions in operations due to fires, hurricanes or other catastrophic events, labor disagreements or shipping problems, may result in delays in the delivery of merchandise to our warehouses, which could adversely affect sales and the satisfaction of our members. We may not timely identify or effectively respond to consumer trends, which could negatively affect our relationship with our members, the demand for our products and services, and our market share. It is difficult to consistently and successfully predict the products and services our members will demand. The success of our business depends in part on our ability to identify and respond to trends in demographics and consumer preferences. Failure to timely identify or effectively respond to changing consumer tastes, preferences and spending patterns could negatively affect our relationship with our members, the demand for our products and services and our market share. If we are not successful at predicting our sales trends and adjusting our purchases accordingly, we may have excess inventory, which could result in additional markdowns and reduce our operating performance. This could have an adverse effect on margins and operating income. Our failure to maintain positive membership loyalty and brand recognition could adversely affect our financial results. Damage to our brands or reputation may negatively impact comparable warehouse sales, lower employee morale and productivity, diminish member trust, and reduce member renewal rates and, accordingly, membership fee revenues, resulting in a reduction in shareholder value. 11 Table of Contents Item 1A—Risk Factors (Continued) Changes in accounting standards and subjective assumptions, estimates and judgments by management related to complex accounting matters could significantly affect our financial results. Generally accepted accounting principles and related accounting pronouncements, implementation guidelines and interpretations with regard to a wide range of matters that are relevant to our business, including, but not limited to, revenue recognition, sales returns reserves, impairment of long-lived assets and warehouse closing costs, inventories, self-insurance, income taxes, unclaimed property laws and litigation, are highly complex and involve many subjective assumptions, estimates and judgments by our management. Changes in these rules or their interpretation or changes in underlying assumptions, estimates or judgments by our management could significantly change our reported or expected financial performance. Provisions for losses related to self-insured risks are generally based upon independent actuarially determined estimates. The assumptions underlying the ultimate costs of existing claim losses can be highly unpredictable, which can affect the liability recorded for such claims. For example, variability in inflation rates of health care costs inherent in these claims can affect the amounts realized. Similarly, changes in legal trends and interpretations, as well as a change in the nature and method of how claims are settled can impact ultimate costs. Although our estimates of liabilities incurred do not anticipate significant changes in historical trends for these variables, any changes could have a considerable effect upon future claim costs and currently recorded liabilities and could materially impact our consolidated financial statements. Changes in Tax Rates We compute our income tax provision based on enacted tax rates in the countries in which we operate. As the tax rates vary among countries, a change in earnings attributable to the various jurisdictions in which we operate could result in an unfavorable change in our overall tax provision. Additionally, any change in the enacted tax rates, any adverse outcome in connection with any income tax audits in any jurisdiction, or any change in the pronouncements relating to accounting for income taxes may have a material adverse affect on our financial condition, results of operation, or cash flows. Failure of our internal control over financial reporting could limit our ability to report our financial results accurately and timely. Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting. Internal control over financial reporting is designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting for external purposes in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. Internal control over financial reporting includes: maintaining records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect our transactions; providing reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary for preparation of the financial statements; providing reasonable assurance that our receipts and expenditures of our assets are made in accordance with management authorization; and providing reasonable assurance that unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of our assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements would be prevented or detected on a timely basis. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting is not intended to and cannot provide absolute assurance that a misstatement of our financial statements would be prevented or detected. Any failure to maintain an effective system of internal control over financial reporting could limit our ability to report our financial results accurately and timely or to detect and prevent fraud. 12 Table of Contents Item 1A—Risk Factors (Continued) Our international operations subject us to risks associated with the legislative, judicial, accounting, regulatory, political and economic factors specific to the countries or regions in which we operate, which could adversely affect our financial performance. Our international operations could form a larger portion of our business in future years. Future operating results internationally could be negatively affected by a variety of factors, many beyond our control. These factors include political conditions, economic conditions, regulatory constraints, currency regulations and exchange rates, and other matters in any of the countries or regions in which we operate, now or in the future. Other factors that may impact international operations include foreign trade, monetary and fiscal policies both of the United States and of other countries, laws and regulations of foreign governments and the United States (such as the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act), agencies and similar organizations, and risks associated with having major facilities located in countries which have been historically less stable than the United States. Risks inherent in international operations also include, among others, the costs and difficulties of managing international operations, adverse tax consequences and greater difficulty in enforcing intellectual property rights. Additionally, foreign currency exchange rates and fluctuations may have an impact on our future costs or on future cash flows from our international operations. Market expectations for our financial performance is high. We believe that the price of our stock generally reflects high market expectations for our future operating results. Any failure to meet or delay in meeting these expectations, including our comparable warehouse sales growth rates, earnings and earnings per share or new warehouse openings, could cause the market price of our stock to decline, as could changes in our dividend or share repurchase policies. We rely extensively on computer systems to process transactions, summarize results and manage our business. Disruptions in both our primary and back-up systems could harm our business. Although we have independent, redundant, and primary and secondary computer systems, given the number of individual transactions we have each year, it is important that we maintain uninterrupted operation of our business-critical computer systems. Our computer systems, including our back-up systems, are subject to damage or interruption from power outages, computer and telecommunications failures, computer viruses, internal or external security breaches, catastrophic events such as fires, earthquakes, tornadoes and hurricanes, and errors by our employees. If our computer systems and our back-up systems are damaged or cease to function properly, we may have to make significant investment to fix or replace them, and we may suffer interruptions in our operations in the interim. Any material interruption in our computer systems may have a material adverse effect on our business or results of operations. The costs, potential problems, and interruptions associated with implementing technology initiatives could disrupt or reduce the efficiency of our operations in the short term. These initiatives might not provide the anticipated benefits or provide them in a delayed or more costly manner. Natural disasters or other catastrophic events could unfavorably affect our financial performance. Natural disasters, such as hurricanes or earthquakes, particularly in California or in Washington state, where our centralized operating systems and administrative personnel are located, could unfavorably affect our operations and financial performance. Such events could result in physical damage to one or more of our properties, the temporary closure of one or more warehouses or depots, the temporary lack of an adequate work force in a market, the temporary or long-term disruption in the supply of products from some local and overseas suppliers, the temporary disruption in the transport of goods 13 Table of Contents Item 1A—Risk Factors (Continued) from overseas, delays in the delivery of goods to our depots or warehouses within a country in which we operate and the temporary reduction in the availability of products in our warehouses. Public health issues, such as a potential H1N1 flu pandemic (Swine flu), whether occurring in the United States or abroad, could disrupt our operations, disrupt the operations of suppliers or customers, or have an adverse impact on consumer spending and confidence levels. We may be required to suspend operations in some or all of our locations, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations. These events could also reduce demand for our products or make it difficult or impossible to receive products from suppliers. We are subject to a wide variety of federal, state, regional, local and international laws, and regulations relating to the use, storage, discharge, and disposal of hazardous materials and hazardous and non-hazardous wastes, and other environmental matters. Any failure to comply with these laws could result in costs to satisfy environmental compliance, remediation or compensatory requirements, or the imposition of severe penalties or restrictions on operations by governmental agencies or courts that could adversely affect our operations. We are involved in a number of legal proceedings and audits, and while we cannot predict the outcomes of such proceedings and other contingencies with certainty, some of these outcomes may unfavorably affect our operations or increase our costs. We are involved in a number of legal proceedings and audits, including grand jury investigations, other government investigations, consumer, employment, tort and other litigation (see discussion of Legal Proceedings in Note 11 to the consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this Report). We cannot predict with certainty the outcomes of these legal proceedings and other contingencies, including environmental remediation and other proceedings commenced by governmental authorities. The outcome of some of these legal proceedings and other contingencies could require us to take or refrain from taking actions which could unfavorably affect our operations or could require us to pay substantial amounts of money. Additionally, defending against these lawsuits and proceedings may involve significant expense and diversion of management’s attention and resources. Our business requires compliance with a great variety of laws and regulations. Failure to achieve compliance could subject us to lawsuits and other proceedings, and lead to damage awards, fines and penalties. We are subject to the risk of product liability claims. If our merchandise offerings, including food and prepared food products for human consumption, drugs and childrens’ products, do not meet applicable safely standards or our members’ expectations regarding safety, we could experience lost sales, increased costs and be exposed to legal and reputational risk. The sale of these items involves the risk of injury to our members. Such injuries may result from tampering by unauthorized third parties, product contamination or spoilage, including the presence of foreign objects, substances, chemicals, other agents, or residues introduced during the growing, manufacturing, storage, handling and transportation phases. All of our vendors must comply with applicable product safety laws, and we are dependent on them to ensure that the products we buy comply with all safety standards. While we are subject to governmental inspection and regulations and work to comply in all material respects with applicable laws and regulations, we cannot be sure that consumption of our products will not cause a health-related illness in the future or that we will not be subject to claims, lawsuits, or government investigations relating to such matters, resulting in costly product recalls and other liabilities. Even if a product liability claim is unsuccessful or is not fully pursued, the negative publicity surrounding any assertion that our products caused illness or injury could adversely affect our reputation with existing and potential members and our corporate and brand image and these effects could be long term. 14 Table of Contents Item 1A—Risk Factors (Continued) Our success depends, in part on the continued contributions of management and on our ability to attract, train and retain highly qualified employees. Our success depends to a significant degree on the continued contributions of members of our senior management and other key operations, merchandising and administrative personnel, and the loss of any such person(s) could have a material adverse effect. Other than an annual agreement with our President and CEO, Mr. Sinegal, we have no employment agreements with our officers. We must attract, train and retain a large and growing number of highly qualified employees, while controlling related labor costs. Our ability to control labor costs is subject to numerous external factors, including prevailing wage rates and healthcare and other insurance costs. We compete with other retail and non-retail businesses for these employees and invest significant resources in training and motivating them. There is no assurance that we will be able to attract or retain highly qualified employees in the future, which could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s business, results of operations and financial condition. The Company does not maintain key man insurance. If we do not maintain the privacy and security of member-related information, we could damage our reputation with members, incur substantial additional costs and become subject to litigation. We receive, retain, and transmit certain personal information about our members. In addition, our online operations at www.costco.com and www.costco.ca depend upon the secure transmission of confidential information over public networks, including information permitting cashless payments. A compromise of our security systems or those of other business partners that results in our members’ personal information being obtained by unauthorized persons could adversely affect our reputation with our members and others, as well as our operations, results of operations, financial condition and liquidity, and could result in litigation against us or the imposition of penalties. In addition, a security breach could require that we expend significant additional resources related to the security of information systems and could result in a disruption of our operations, particularly our online sales operations. Additionally, the use of individually identifiable data by our business and our business associates is regulated at the international, federal and state levels. Privacy and information security laws and regulations change, and compliance with them may result in cost increases due to necessary systems changes and the development of new administrative processes. If we or those with whom we share information fail to comply with these laws and regulations or experience a data security breach, our reputation could be damaged, possibly resulting in lost future business, and we could be subjected to additional legal risk as a result of non-compliance.

Our executive offices are located in Issaquah, Washington and occupy approximately 445,000 square feet. We operated eight regional offices in the United States, two regional offices in Canada and five regional offices internationally at the end of 2009, containing approximately 334,000 square feet. Additionally, we operate regional cross-docking facilities (depots) for the consolidation and distribution of most shipments to the warehouses, and various processing, packaging, and other facilities to support ancillary and other businesses. At the end of 2009, we operated eleven depots in the United States, four in Canada and three internationally, excluding Mexico, consisting of approximately 7.3 million square feet.

They include statements that address activities, events, conditions or developments that we expect or anticipate may occur in the future. Such forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties that may cause actual events, results, or performance to differ materially from those indicated by such statements. See Item 1A—Risk Factors for a discussion of risks and uncertainties that may affect our business. PART I Item 1—Business Costco Wholesale Corporation and its subsidiaries (“Costco” or the “Company”) began operations in 1983 in Seattle, Washington. In October 1993, we merged with The Price Company, which had pioneered the membership warehouse concept, to form Price/Costco, Inc., a Delaware corporation. In January 1997, after the spin-off of most of our non-warehouse assets to Price Enterprises, Inc., we changed our name to Costco Companies, Inc. On August 30, 1999, we reincorporated from Delaware to Washington and changed our name to Costco Wholesale Corporation. Our common stock trades on The NASDAQ Global Select Market under the symbol “COST.” General We operate membership warehouses based on the concept that offering our members low prices on a limited selection of nationally branded and selected private-label products in a wide range of merchandise categories will produce high sales volumes and rapid inventory turnover. This turnover, when combined with the operating efficiencies achieved by volume purchasing, efficient distribution and reduced handling of merchandise in no-frills, self-service warehouse facilities, enables us to operate profitably at significantly lower gross margins than traditional wholesalers, mass merchandisers, supermarkets, and supercenters. We buy the majority of our merchandise directly from manufacturers and route it to a cross-docking consolidation point (“depot”) or directly to our warehouses. Our depots receive container-based shipments from manufacturers and reallocate these goods for shipment to our individual warehouses, generally in less than twenty-four hours. This maximizes freight volume and handling efficiencies, eliminating many of the costs associated with traditional multiple-step distribution channels. Such traditional steps include purchasing from distributors as opposed to manufacturers, use of central receiving, storing and distributing warehouses, and storage of merchandise in locations off the sales floor. Because of our high sales volume and rapid inventory turnover, we generally sell inventory before we are required to pay many of our merchandise vendors, even though we take advantage of early payment discounts when available. To the extent that sales increase and inventory turnover becomes more rapid, a greater percentage of inventory is financed through payment terms provided by suppliers rather than by our working capital. Our typical warehouse format averages approximately 143,000 square feet; newer units tend to be larger. Floor plans are designed for economy and efficiency in the use of selling space, the handling of merchandise, and the control of inventory. Because shoppers are attracted principally by the quality of merchandise and the availability of low prices, our warehouses need not have elaborate facilities. By strictly controlling the entrances and exits of our warehouses and using a membership format, we have limited inventory losses (shrinkage) to less than two-tenths of one percent of net sales in the last several fiscal years—well below those of typical discount retail operations. 3 Table of Contents Item 1—Business (Continued) We generally limit marketing and promotional activities to new warehouse openings, occasional direct mail to prospective new members, and regular direct marketing programs (such as The Costco Connection, a magazine we publish for our members, coupon mailers, weekly email blasts from costco.com, and handouts) to existing members promoting selected merchandise. These practices result in lower marketing expenses as compared to typical retailers. In connection with new warehouse openings, our marketing teams personally contact businesses in the area that are potential business members. These contacts are supported by direct mailings during the period immediately prior to opening. Potential Gold Star (individual) members are contacted by direct mail or by membership offerings distributed through employee associations and other entities. After a membership base is established in an area, most new memberships result from word-of-mouth advertising, follow-up messages distributed through employee groups, and ongoing direct solicitations to prospective members. Our warehouses generally operate on a seven-day, 69-hour week, open weekdays between 10:00 a.m. and 8:30 p.m., with earlier closing hours on the weekend. Gasoline operations generally have extended hours. Because the hours of operation are shorter than those of traditional retailers, discount retailers and supermarkets, and due to other efficiencies inherent in a warehouse-type operation, labor costs are lower relative to the volume of sales. Merchandise is generally stored on racks above the sales floor and displayed on pallets containing large quantities, thereby reducing labor required for handling and stocking. Our strategy is to provide our members with a broad range of high quality merchandise at prices consistently lower than they can obtain elsewhere. We seek to limit specific items in each product line to fast-selling models, sizes and colors. Therefore, we carry an average of approximately 3,900 active stock keeping units (SKUs) per warehouse in our core warehouse business, as opposed to 45,000 to 140,000 SKUs or more at discount retailers, supermarkets, and supercenters. Many consumable products are offered for sale only in case, carton, or multiple-pack quantities only. In keeping with our policy of member satisfaction, we generally accept returns of merchandise. On certain electronic items, we have a 90-day return policy in the United States, Canada and the United Kingdom and provide, free of charge, technical support services, as well as an extended warranty. The following table indicates the approximate percentage of net sales accounted for by major category of items: 2010 2009 2008 Sundries (including candy, snack foods, tobacco, alcoholic and nonalcoholic beverages and cleaning and institutional supplies) 23 % 23 % 22 % Hardlines (including major appliances, electronics, health and beauty aids, hardware, office supplies, garden and patio, sporting goods, toys, seasonal items and automotive supplies) 18 % 19 % 19 % Food (including dry and institutionally packaged foods) 21 % 21 % 20 % Softlines (including apparel, domestics, jewelry, housewares, media, home furnishings, cameras and small appliances) 10 % 10 % 10 % Fresh Food (including meat, bakery, deli and produce) 12 % 12 % 12 % Ancillary and Other (including gas stations, pharmacy, food court, optical, one-hour photo, hearing aid and travel) 16 % 15 % 17 % 4 Table of Contents Item 1—Business (Continued) Ancillary businesses within or next to our warehouses provide expanded products and services and encourage members to shop more frequently. The following table indicates the number of ancillary businesses in operation at fiscal year end: 2010 2009 2008 Food Court 534 521 506 One-Hour Photo Centers 530 518 504 Optical Dispensing Centers 523 509 496 Pharmacies 480 464 451 Gas Stations 343 323 307 Hearing-Aid Centers 357 303 274 Print Shops and Copy Centers 10 10 7 Car Washes 7 2 2 Number of warehouses 540 527 512 Costco Mexico, our 50%-owned joint venture, operated 32 warehouses at August 29, 2010. We have contractual responsibility for executive, management and functional duties and operations of Costco Mexico. The Costco Mexico warehouses are not included in the table above as Costco Mexico is accounted for using the equity method of accounting for investments. Our electronic commerce businesses, costco.com in the U.S. and costco.ca in Canada, provide our members additional products generally not found in our warehouses, in addition to services such as digital photo processing, pharmacy, travel, and membership services. Our warehouses accept cash, checks, certain debit cards, American Express and a private label Costco credit card. Losses associated with dishonored checks have been minimal, as members who have issued dishonored checks are identified and prevented from making further purchases until restitution is made. We have direct buying relationships with many producers of national brand-name merchandise. We do not obtain a significant portion of merchandise from any one supplier. We have not experienced any difficulty in obtaining sufficient quantities of merchandise, and believe that if one or more of our current sources of supply became unavailable, we would be able to obtain alternative sources without substantial disruption of our business. We also purchase selected private label merchandise, as long as quality and customer demand are comparable and the value to our members is greater as compared to name brand items. Certain financial information for our segments and geographic areas is included in Note 12 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this Report. We report on a 52/53-week fiscal year, consisting of thirteen four-week periods and ending on the Sunday nearest the end of August. The first three quarters consist of three periods each, and the fourth quarter consists of four periods (five weeks in the thirteenth period in a 53-week year). The material seasonal impact in our operations is an increased level of net sales and earnings during the winter holiday season. References to 2010, 2009, and 2008 relate to the 52-week fiscal years ended August 29, 2010, August 30, 2009, and August 31, 2008, respectively. Membership Policy Our membership format is designed to reinforce customer loyalty and provide a continuing source of membership fee revenue. Members can utilize their memberships at any Costco warehouse location in 5 Table of Contents Item 1—Business (Continued) any country. We have two primary types of members: Business and Gold Star (individual). Our member renewal rate, currently at 88% in the U.S. and Canada, is consistent with recent years. Businesses, including individuals with a business license, retail sales license or other evidence of business existence, may become Business members. Business members generally pay an annual membership fee of $50 for the primary and household membership card, with add-on membership cards available for an annual fee of $40 (including a free household card). Many of our business members also shop at Costco for their personal needs. Individual memberships (Gold Star memberships) are available to individuals who do not qualify for a Business membership, for an annual fee of $50, which includes a household card. Our membership base was made up of the following (in thousands): 2010 2009 2008 Gold Star 22,500 21,500 20,200 Business 5,800 5,700 5,600 Business, Add-on Primary 3,300 3,400 3,400 Total primary cardholders 31,600 30,600 29,200 Additional cardholders 26,400 25,400 24,300 Total cardholders 58,000 56,000 53,500 These numbers exclude approximately 2,900 cardholders of Costco Mexico at the end of 2010, and 2,800 cardholders at the end of 2009 and 2008. Executive membership is available to all members, with the exception of Business Add-on members, in the U.S., Canada, Mexico, and the United Kingdom for an annual fee of approximately $100. The program, in the U.S. and Canada, offers additional savings and benefits on various business and consumer services, such as merchant credit-card processing, auto and home insurance, the Costco auto purchase program, and check printing services. The services are generally provided by third-parties and vary by country and state. In addition, Executive members qualify for a 2% annual reward (which can be redeemed at Costco warehouses), up to a maximum of approximately $500 per year, on qualified purchases made at Costco. At the end of 2010, 2009, and 2008, Executive members represented 36%, 33%, and 30%, respectively, of our primary membership base that was eligible for the program. Executive members generally spend more than other members, and the percentage of our net sales attributable to these members continues to increase. Labor Our employee count approximated: 2010 2009 2008 Full-time employees 82,000 79,000 75,000 Part-time employees 65,000 63,000 62,000 Total employees 147,000 142,000 137,000 These numbers exclude approximately 9,000 individuals who were employed by Costco Mexico at the end of 2010, 2009, and 2008. Approximately 13,200 hourly employees in certain of our locations (all former Price Company locations) in five states are represented by the International Brotherhood of Teamsters. All remaining employees are non-union. We consider our employee relations to be very good. 6 Table of Contents Item 1—Business (Continued) Competition Our industry is highly competitive, based on factors such as price, merchandise quality and selection, warehouse location and member service. We compete with 800 warehouse club locations across the U.S. and Canada (Wal-Mart’s Sam’s Club and BJ’s Wholesale Club), and every major metropolitan area has multiple club operations. In addition, we compete with a wide range of national and regional retailers and wholesalers, including supermarkets, supercenters, general merchandise chains, specialty chains, and gasoline stations, as well as electronic commerce businesses. Competitors such as Wal-Mart, Target, Kohl’s and Amazon are among our significant general merchandise retail competitors. We also compete with low-cost operators selling a single category or narrow range of merchandise, such as Lowe’s, Home Depot, Office Depot, PetSmart, Staples, Trader Joe’s, Whole Foods, Best Buy and Barnes & Noble. Our international operations face similar competitors. Regulation Certain state laws require that we apply minimum markups to our selling prices for specific goods, such as tobacco products, alcoholic beverages, and gasoline. While compliance with such laws may cause us to charge higher prices, other retailers are also typically governed by the same restrictions, and we believe that compliance with such laws currently in effect do not have a material adverse effect on our operations. Certain states, counties, and municipalities have enacted or proposed laws and regulations that would prevent or restrict the operations or expansion plans of certain large retailers and warehouse clubs, including us, within their jurisdictions. If enacted, such laws and regulations could have a material adverse affect on our operations. Intellectual Property We believe that our trademarks, trade names, copyrights, proprietary processes, trade secrets, patents, trade dress and similar intellectual property add significant value to our business and are important factors in our success. We have invested significantly in the development and protection of our well-recognized brands, including the Costco Wholesale® series of trademarks and our private label brand, Kirkland Signature®. Kirkland Signature products are premium products offered to our members at prices that are generally lower than those for national brand products. Kirkland Signature products allow us to ensure our quality standards are met, while minimizing costs and differentiating our merchandise offerings from other retailers, and to generally earn higher margins. We expect that our private label items will increase their share of our sales in the future. We rely on trademark and copyright law, trade secret protection, and confidentiality and license agreements with our employees and others to protect our proprietary rights. Effective intellectual property protection may not be available in every country in which we operate. Available Information Our internet website is www.costco.com.

These risks could cause our actual results to differ materially from our historical experience and from results or events predicted by our forward-looking statements. Those statements may relate to such matters as sales growth, increases in comparable store sales, cannibalization of existing locations by new openings, price changes, earnings performance, earnings per share, stock-based compensation expense, warehouse openings and closures, the effect of adopting certain accounting standards, future financial reporting, financing, margins, return on invested capital, strategic direction, expense control, membership renewal rates, shopping frequency, litigation impact and the demand for our products and services. You should read these risk factors in conjunction with Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations in Item 7 of this Report and our consolidated financial statements and related notes in Item 8 of this Report. There may be other factors that we cannot anticipate or that are not described in this report, generally because we do not presently perceive them to be material, that could cause results to differ materially from our expectations or statements. Forward-looking statements speak only as of the date they are made, and we do not undertake to update these forward-looking statements. You are advised to review any further disclosures we make on related subjects in our periodic filings with the SEC. We face strong competition from other retailers and warehouse club operators, which could negatively affect our financial performance. The retail business is highly competitive. We compete for members, employees, sites, products and services and in other important respects with many other local, regional and national retailers, both in the United States and in foreign countries. We compete with other warehouse club operators, discount retailers, supermarkets, supercenter stores, retail and wholesale grocers, department, drug, variety and specialty stores and general merchandise wholesalers and distributors, as well as internet-based retailers, wholesalers and catalog businesses. Such retailers and warehouse club operators compete in a variety of ways, including merchandise pricing, selection and availability, services, location, convenience, store hours, and price. Our inability to respond effectively to competitive pressures and changes in the retail markets could negatively affect our financial performance. Some competitors may have greater financial resources, better access to merchandise, and greater market penetration than we do. General economic factors, domestically and internationally, may adversely affect our financial performance. Higher interest rates, energy costs, inflation, levels of unemployment, healthcare costs, consumer debt levels, unsettled financial markets, weaknesses in housing and real estate markets, reduced consumer confidence, changes related to government fiscal and tax policies and other economic factors could adversely affect demand for our products and services or require a change in the mix of products we sell. Prices of certain commodity products, including gasoline and other food products, are historically volatile and are subject to fluctuations arising from changes in domestic and international supply and demand, labor costs, competition, market speculation, government regulations and periodic delays in delivery. Rapid and significant changes in commodity prices may affect our sales and profit margins. These factors can also increase our merchandise costs and/or selling, general and administrative expenses, and otherwise adversely affect our operations and results. General economic conditions can also be affected by the outbreak of war, acts of terrorism, or other significant national or international events. 9 Table of Contents Item 1A—Risk Factors (Continued) Our growth strategy includes expanding our business, both in existing markets and in new markets. Our future growth is dependent, in part, on our ability to acquire property, and build or lease new warehouses. We compete with other retailers and businesses for suitable locations. Local land use and other regulations restricting the construction and operation of our warehouses, as well as local community actions opposed to the location of our warehouses at specific sites and the adoption of local laws restricting our operations and environmental regulations may impact our ability to find suitable locations, and increase the cost of constructing, leasing and operating our warehouses. We also may have difficulty negotiating leases or real estate purchase agreements on acceptable terms. Failure to manage these and other similar factors effectively will affect our ability to timely build or lease new warehouses, which may have a material adverse affect on our future growth and profitability. We seek to expand our business in existing markets in order to attain a greater overall market share. Because our warehouses typically draw members from their local areas, a new warehouse may draw members away from our existing warehouses and adversely affect comparable warehouse sales performance and member traffic at those existing warehouses. We also intend to open warehouses in new markets. The risks associated with entering a new market include difficulties in attracting members due to a lack of familiarity with us, attracting members of other wholesale club operators currently operating in the new market, our lack of familiarity with local member preferences, and seasonal differences in the market. In addition, entry into new markets may bring us into competition with new competitors or with existing competitors with a large, established market presence. In new markets, we cannot ensure that our new warehouses will be profitably deployed; as a result, our future profitability may be delayed or otherwise materially adversely affected. We are highly dependent on the financial performance of our United States and Canada operations. Our financial and operational performance is highly dependent on our United States and Canada operations, which comprised 92% of consolidated net sales in 2010 and 93% in 2009, and 89% of operating income in 2010 and 92% in 2009. Within the United States, we are highly dependent on our California operations, which comprised 26% and 27% of consolidated net sales in 2010 and 2009, respectively. Our California market in general, has a larger percentage of higher volume warehouses as compared to our other markets. Any substantial slowing or sustained decline in these operations could materially adversely affect our business and financial results. Declines in financial performance of our United States operations, particularly in California, and our Canada operations could arise from, among other things: failing to meet targets for warehouse openings; declines in actual or estimated comparable warehouse sales growth rates and expectations; negative trends in operating expenses, including increased labor, healthcare and energy costs; cannibalizing existing locations with new warehouses; shifts in sales mix toward lower gross margin products; changes or uncertainties in economic conditions in our markets; and failing consistently to provide high quality products and innovative new products to retain our existing member base and attract new members. We depend on vendors to supply us with quality merchandise at the right prices in a timely manner. We depend heavily on our ability to purchase merchandise in sufficient quantities at competitive prices. We have no assurances of continued supply, pricing or access to new products, and any vendor could at any time change the terms upon which it sells to us or discontinue selling to us. Member demands may lead to out-of-stock positions of our merchandise, leading to loss of sales and profits. 10 Table of Contents Item 1A—Risk Factors (Continued) We purchase our merchandise from numerous domestic and foreign manufacturers and importers and have thousands of vendor relationships. Our inability to acquire suitable merchandise on acceptable terms or the loss of key vendors could negatively affect us. We may not be able to develop relationships with new vendors, and products from alternative sources, if any, may be of a lesser quality or more expensive than those from existing vendors. Because of our efforts to adhere to high quality standards for which available supply may be limited, particularly for certain food items, the large volume we demand may not be consistently available. Our suppliers are subject to risks, including labor disputes, union organizing activities, financial liquidity, inclement weather, natural disasters, supply constraints, and general economic and political conditions, that could limit their ability to timely provide us with acceptable merchandise. For these or other reasons, one or more of our suppliers might not adhere to our quality control, legal or regulatory standards. These deficiencies may delay or preclude delivery of merchandise to us and might not be identified before we sell such merchandise to our members. This failure could lead to litigation and recalls, which could damage our reputation and our brands, increase our costs, and otherwise hurt our business. In addition, the United States’ foreign trade policies, tariffs and other impositions on imported goods, security and safety regulations, trade sanctions imposed on certain countries, the limitation on the importation of certain types of goods or of goods containing certain materials from other countries and other factors relating to foreign trade are beyond our control and could adversely impact our sourcing of goods. We depend on our depot operations to effectively and efficiently supply product to our warehouses. We depend on the orderly operation of the receiving and distribution process, primarily through our depots. Although we believe that our receiving and distribution process is efficient, unforeseen disruptions in operations due to fires, hurricanes, earthquakes or other catastrophic events, labor shortages and disagreements or shipping problems, may result in delays in the delivery of merchandise to our warehouses, which could adversely affect sales and the satisfaction of our members. We may not timely identify or effectively respond to consumer trends, which could negatively affect our relationship with our members, the demand for our products and services, and our market share. It is difficult to consistently and successfully predict the products and services our members will demand. Our success depends, in part, on our ability to identify and respond to trends in demographics and consumer preferences. Failure to timely identify or effectively respond to changing consumer tastes, preferences (including those relating to sustainability of product sources) and spending patterns could negatively affect our relationship with our members, the demand for our products and services and our market share. If we are not successful at predicting our sales trends and adjusting our purchases accordingly, we may have excess inventory, which could result in additional markdowns and reduce our operating performance. This could have an adverse effect on margins and operating income. Our failure to maintain positive membership loyalty and brand recognition could adversely affect our financial results. Damage to our brands or reputation may negatively impact comparable warehouse sales, lower employee morale and productivity, diminish member trust, and reduce member renewal rates and, accordingly, membership fee revenues, resulting in a reduction in shareholder value. 11 Table of Contents Item 1A—Risk Factors (Continued) Changes in accounting standards and subjective assumptions, estimates and judgments by management related to complex accounting matters could significantly affect our financial results. Generally accepted accounting principles and related accounting pronouncements, implementation guidelines and interpretations with regard to a wide range of matters that are relevant to our business, including, but not limited to, revenue recognition, sales returns reserves, impairment of long-lived assets and warehouse closing costs, inventories, self-insurance, income taxes, unclaimed property laws and litigation, and other contingent liabilities are highly complex and involve many subjective assumptions, estimates and judgments by our management. Changes in these rules or their interpretation or changes in underlying assumptions, estimates or judgments by our management could significantly change our reported or expected financial performance. Provisions for losses related to self-insured risks are generally based upon independent actuarially determined estimates. The assumptions underlying the ultimate costs of existing claim losses can be highly unpredictable, which can affect the liability recorded for such claims. For example, variability in inflation rates of health care costs inherent in these claims can affect the amounts realized. In March 2010, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act and the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010 were enacted. This legislation expands health care coverage to many uninsured individuals and expands coverage to those already insured. We expect our healthcare costs to increase, but not materially, as a result of this legislation. Similarly, changes in legal trends and interpretations, as well as a change in the nature and method of how claims are settled can impact ultimate costs. Although our estimates of liabilities incurred do not anticipate significant changes in historical trends for these variables, any changes could have a considerable effect upon future claim costs and currently recorded liabilities and could materially impact our consolidated financial statements. Changes in Tax Rates We compute our income tax provision based on enacted tax rates in the countries in which we operate. As the tax rates vary among countries, a change in earnings attributable to the various jurisdictions in which we operate could result in an unfavorable change in our overall tax provision. Additionally, any change in the enacted tax rates, any adverse outcome in connection with any income tax audits in any jurisdiction, including transfer pricing disputes, or any change in the pronouncements relating to accounting for income taxes may have a material adverse affect on our financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows. Failure of our internal control over financial reporting could make our financial results inaccurate or untimely. Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting. Internal control over financial reporting is designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting for external purposes in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. Internal control over financial reporting includes: maintaining records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect our transactions; providing reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary for preparation of the financial statements; providing reasonable assurance that our receipts and expenditures of our assets are made in accordance with management authorization; and providing reasonable assurance that unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of our assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements would be prevented or detected on a timely basis. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting is not intended to and cannot provide absolute assurance that a misstatement of our financial statements would be prevented or detected. Any failure to maintain an effective system of internal control over financial reporting could limit our ability to report our financial results accurately and timely or to detect and prevent fraud. 12 Table of Contents Item 1A—Risk Factors (Continued) Our international operations subject us to risks associated with the legislative, judicial, accounting, regulatory, political and economic factors specific to the countries or regions in which we operate, which could adversely affect our financial performance. Our international operations are growing. Future operating results internationally could be negatively affected by a variety of factors, many beyond our control and similar to those we face in the United States. These factors include political conditions, economic conditions, regulatory constraints, currency regulations and exchange rates, and other matters in any of the countries or regions in which we operate, now or in the future. Other factors that may impact international operations include foreign trade, monetary and fiscal policies both of the United States and of other countries, laws and regulations of foreign governments and the United States (such as the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act), agencies and similar organizations, and risks associated with having major facilities located in countries which have been historically less stable than the United States. Risks inherent in international operations also include, among others, the costs and difficulties of managing international operations, adverse tax consequences and greater difficulty in enforcing intellectual property rights. Additionally, foreign currency exchange rates and fluctuations may have an impact on our future costs or on future cash flows from our international operations. Market expectations for our financial performance is high. We believe that the price of our stock generally reflects high market expectations for our future operating results. Any failure to meet or delay in meeting these expectations, including our comparable warehouse sales growth rates, margins, earnings and earnings per share or new warehouse openings, could cause the market price of our stock to decline, as could changes in our dividend or stock repurchase policies. We rely extensively on computer systems to process transactions, summarize results and manage our business. Disruptions in both our primary and back-up systems could harm our business. Although we believe that we have independent, redundant, and primary and secondary computer systems, given the number of individual transactions we have each year, it is important that we maintain uninterrupted operation of our business-critical computer systems. Our computer systems, including our back-up systems, are subject to damage or interruption from power outages, computer and telecommunications failures, computer viruses, internal or external security breaches, catastrophic events such as fires, earthquakes, tornadoes and hurricanes, and errors by our employees. If our computer systems and our back-up systems are damaged or cease to function properly, we may have to make significant investments to fix or replace them, and we may suffer interruptions in our operations in the interim. Any material interruption in our computer systems may have a material adverse effect on our business or results of operations. The costs, potential problems, and interruptions associated with implementing technology initiatives could disrupt or reduce the efficiency of our operations in the short term. These initiatives might not provide the anticipated benefits or provide them in a delayed or more costly manner. Natural disasters or other catastrophic events could unfavorably affect our financial performance. Natural disasters, such as hurricanes or earthquakes, particularly in California or in Washington state, where our centralized operating systems and administrative personnel are located, could unfavorably affect our operations and financial performance. Such events could result in physical damage to one or more of our properties, the temporary closure of one or more warehouses or depots, the temporary 13 Table of Contents Item 1A—Risk Factors (Continued) lack of an adequate work force in a market, the temporary or long-term disruption in the supply of products from some local and overseas suppliers, the temporary disruption in the transport of goods from overseas, delays in the delivery of goods to our depots or warehouses within a country in which we operate and the temporary reduction in the availability of products in our warehouses. Public health issues, such as a potential H1N1 flu pandemic (swine flu), whether occurring in the United States or abroad, could disrupt our operations, disrupt the operations of suppliers or customers, or have an adverse impact on consumer spending and confidence levels. We may be required to suspend operations in some or all of our locations, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations. These events could also reduce demand for our products or make it difficult or impossible to receive products from suppliers. We are subject to a wide variety of federal, state, regional, local and international laws and regulations relating to the use, storage, discharge, and disposal of hazardous materials and hazardous and non-hazardous wastes, and other environmental matters. Any failure to comply with these laws could result in costs to satisfy environmental compliance, remediation or compensatory requirements, or the imposition of severe penalties or restrictions on operations by governmental agencies or courts that could adversely affect our operations. Factors associated with climate change could adversely affect our business. We use natural gas, diesel fuel, gasoline, and electricity in our distribution and sale operations. Increased government regulations to limit carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gas emissions may result in increased compliance costs and legislation or regulation affecting energy inputs could materially affect our profitability. In addition, climate change could affect our ability to procure needed commodities at costs and in quantities we currently experience. We also sell a substantial amount of gasoline, the demand for which could be impacted by concerns about climate change and which also could face increased regulation. Climate change may be associated with extreme weather conditions, such as more intense hurricanes, thunderstorms, tornados and snow or ice storms, as well as rising sea levels. Extreme weather conditions increase our costs, and damage resulting from extreme weather may not be fully insured. We are involved in a number of legal proceedings and audits, and while we cannot predict the outcomes of such proceedings and other contingencies with certainty, some of these outcomes may unfavorably affect our operations or increase our costs. We are or may become involved in a number of legal proceedings and audits, including grand jury investigations, other government investigations, consumer, employment, tort and other litigation (see discussion of Legal Proceedings in Note 11 to the consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this Report). We cannot predict with certainty the outcomes of these legal proceedings and other contingencies, including environmental remediation and other proceedings commenced by governmental authorities. The outcome of some of these legal proceedings and other contingencies could require us to take or refrain from taking actions which could unfavorably affect our operations or could require us to pay substantial amounts of money. Additionally, defending against these lawsuits and proceedings may involve significant expense and diversion of management’s attention and resources. Our business requires compliance with a great variety of laws and regulations. Failure to achieve compliance could subject us to lawsuits and other proceedings, and lead to damage awards, fines and penalties. 14 Table of Contents Item 1A—Risk Factors (Continued) We are subject to the risks of selling unsafe products. If our merchandise offerings, including food and prepared food products for human consumption, drugs and childrens’ products, do not meet or are perceived not to meet applicable safely standards or our members’ expectations regarding safety, we could experience lost sales, increased costs and be exposed to legal and reputational risk. The sale of these items involves the risk of injury to our members. Such injuries may result from tampering by unauthorized third parties, product contamination or spoilage, including the presence of foreign objects, substances, chemicals, other agents, or residues introduced during the growing, manufacturing, storage, handling and transportation phases. Our vendors are generally contractually required to comply with applicable product safety laws, and we are dependent on them to ensure that the products we buy comply with all safety standards. While we are subject to governmental inspection and regulations and work to comply in all material respects with applicable laws and regulations, we cannot be sure that consumption of our products will not cause a health-related illness in the future or that we will not be subject to claims, lawsuits, or government investigations relating to such matters, resulting in costly product recalls and other liabilities. Even if a product liability claim is unsuccessful or is not fully pursued, the negative publicity surrounding any assertion that our products caused illness or injury could adversely affect our reputation with existing and potential members and our corporate and brand image and these effects could be long term. Our success depends on the continued contributions of management and on our ability to attract, train and retain highly qualified employees. Our success depends to a significant degree on the continued contributions of members of our senior management and other key operations, merchandising and administrative personnel, and the loss of any such person(s) could have a material adverse effect. Other than an annual agreement with our CEO, Mr. Sinegal, we have no employment agreements with our officers. We must attract, train and retain a large and growing number of highly qualified employees, while controlling related labor costs. Our ability to control labor costs is subject to numerous external factors, including prevailing wage rates and healthcare and other insurance costs. We compete with other retail and non-retail businesses for these employees and invest significant resources in training and motivating them. There is no assurance that we will be able to attract or retain highly qualified employees in the future, which could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s business, results of operations and financial condition. The Company does not maintain key man insurance. If we do not maintain the privacy and security of member-related information, we could damage our reputation with members, incur substantial additional costs and become subject to litigation. We receive, retain, and transmit certain personal information about our members. In addition, our online operations at www.costco.com and www.costco.ca depend upon the secure transmission of confidential information over public networks, including information permitting cashless payments. A compromise of our security systems or those of other business partners that results in our members’ personal information being obtained by unauthorized persons could adversely affect our reputation with our members and others, as well as our operations, results of operations, financial condition and liquidity, and could result in litigation against us or the imposition of penalties. In addition, a security breach could require that we expend significant additional resources related to the security of information systems and could result in a disruption of our operations, particularly our online sales operations. Additionally, the use of individually identifiable data by our business and our business associates is regulated at the international, federal and state levels. Privacy and information security laws and regulations change, and compliance with them may result in cost increases due to necessary systems 15 Table of Contents Item 1A—Risk Factors (Continued) changes and the development of new administrative processes. If we or those with whom we share information fail to comply with these laws and regulations or experience a data security breach, our reputation could be damaged, possibly resulting in lost future business, and we could be subjected to additional legal risk as a result of non-compliance.

Our executive offices are located in Issaquah, Washington and occupy approximately 581,000 square feet. We operated eight regional offices in the United States, two regional offices in Canada and five regional offices internationally at the end of 2010, containing approximately 334,000 square feet. Additionally, we operate regional cross-docking facilities (depots) for the consolidation and distribution of most shipments to the warehouses, and various processing, packaging, and other facilities to support ancillary and other businesses. At the end of 2010, we operated 12 depots in the United States, four in Canada and three internationally, excluding Mexico, consisting of approximately 7.6 million square feet.

In October 1993, we merged with The Price Company, which had pioneered the membership warehouse concept, to form Price/Costco, Inc., a Delaware corporation. In January 1997, after the spin-off of most of our non-warehouse assets to Price Enterprises, Inc., we changed our name to Costco Companies, Inc. On August 30, 1999, we reincorporated from Delaware to Washington and changed our name to Costco Wholesale Corporation. Our common stock trades on the NASDAQ Global Select Market under the symbol “COST.” We report on a 52/53-week fiscal year, consisting of thirteen four-week periods and ending on the Sunday nearest the end of August. The first three quarters consist of three periods each, and the fourth quarter consists of four periods (five weeks in the thirteenth period in a 53-week year). The material seasonal impact in our operations is an increased level of net sales and earnings during the winter holiday season. References to 2011, 2010, and 2009 relate to the 52-week fiscal years ended August 28, 2011, August 29, 2010, and August 30, 2009, respectively. The Company and its subsidiaries are principally engaged in the operation of membership warehouses in the United States, Canada, the United Kingdom, Japan, Australia, through majority-owned subsidiaries in Taiwan and Korea, and a 50% owned joint venture in Mexico (Mexico). At the beginning of fiscal 2011, we began consolidating our Mexico joint venture due to the adoption of a new accounting standard. Mexico’s results previously were accounted for under the equity method and our 50% share was included in “interest income and other, net” in the consolidated statements of income. In the current year, the financial position and results of Mexico’s operations are fully consolidated and the joint venture partner’s 50% share is included in “net income attributable to noncontrolling interests” in the consolidated statements of income. The initial consolidation of Mexico increased total assets, liabilities, and revenue by approximately 3%, with no impact on net income or net income per common share attributable to Costco. See discussion in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this Report. General We operate membership warehouses based on the concept that offering our members low prices on a limited selection of nationally branded and private-label products in a wide range of merchandise categories will produce high sales volumes and rapid inventory turnover. This turnover, when combined with the operating efficiencies achieved by volume purchasing, efficient distribution and reduced handling of merchandise in no-frills, self-service warehouse facilities, enables us to operate profitably at significantly lower gross margins than traditional wholesalers, mass merchandisers, supermarkets, and supercenters. We buy the majority of our merchandise directly from manufacturers and route it to a cross-docking consolidation point (depot) or directly to our warehouses. Our depots receive container-based shipments from manufacturers and reallocate these goods for shipment to our individual warehouses, generally in less than twenty-four hours. This maximizes freight volume and handling efficiencies, eliminating many of the costs associated with traditional multiple-step distribution channels. Such traditional steps include purchasing from distributors as opposed to manufacturers, use of central receiving, storing and distributing warehouses, and storage of merchandise in locations off the sales floor. Because of our high sales volume and rapid inventory turnover, we generally sell inventory before we are required to pay many of our merchandise vendors, even though we take advantage of early payment discounts when available. To the extent that sales increase and inventory turnover becomes more rapid, a greater percentage of inventory is financed through payment terms provided by suppliers rather than by our working capital. 4 Table of Contents Item 1—Business (Continued) Our typical warehouse format averages approximately 143,000 square feet; newer units tend to be slightly larger. Floor plans are designed for economy and efficiency in the use of selling space, the handling of merchandise, and the control of inventory. Because shoppers are attracted principally by the quality of merchandise and the availability of low prices, our warehouses need not have elaborate facilities. By strictly controlling the entrances and exits of our warehouses and using a membership format, we have limited inventory losses (shrinkage) to less than two-tenths of one percent of net sales in the last several fiscal years—well below those of typical discount retail operations. We generally limit marketing and promotional activities to new warehouse openings, occasional direct mail to prospective new members, and regular direct marketing programs (such as The Costco Connection, a magazine we publish for our members, coupon mailers, weekly email blasts from costco.com, and handouts) to existing members promoting selected merchandise. These practices result in lower marketing expenses as compared to typical retailers. Our warehouses generally operate on a seven-day, 69-hour week, open weekdays between 10:00 a.m. and 8:30 p.m., with earlier weekend closing hours. Gasoline operations generally have extended hours. Because the hours of operation are shorter than those of traditional retailers, discount retailers and supermarkets, and due to other efficiencies inherent in a warehouse-type operation, labor costs are lower relative to the volume of sales. Merchandise is generally stored on racks above the sales floor and displayed on pallets containing large quantities, thereby reducing labor required for handling and stocking. Our strategy is to provide our members with a broad range of high quality merchandise at prices consistently lower than they can obtain elsewhere. We seek to limit specific items in each product line to fast-selling models, sizes, and colors. Therefore, we carry an average of approximately 3,600 active stock keeping units (SKUs) per warehouse in our core warehouse business, as opposed to 45,000 to 140,000 SKUs or more at discount retailers, supermarkets, and supercenters. Many consumable products are offered for sale in case, carton, or multiple-pack quantities only. In keeping with our policy of member satisfaction, we generally accept returns of merchandise. On certain electronic items, we generally have a 90-day return policy and provide, free of charge, technical support services, as well as an extended warranty. Only the 2011 data in the accompanying tables includes Mexico. The following table indicates the approximate percentage of net sales accounted for by major category of items: 2011 2010 2009 Sundries (including candy, snack foods, tobacco, alcoholic and nonalcoholic beverages and cleaning and institutional supplies) 22 % 23 % 23 % Hardlines (including major appliances, electronics, health and beauty aids, hardware, office supplies, cameras, garden and patio, sporting goods, toys, seasonal items and automotive supplies) 17 % 18 % 19 % Food (including dry and institutionally packaged foods) 21 % 21 % 21 % Softlines (including apparel, domestics, jewelry, housewares, media, home furnishings and small appliances) 10 % 10 % 10 % Fresh Food (including meat, bakery, deli and produce) 12 % 12 % 12 % Ancillary and Other (including gas stations, pharmacy, food court, optical, one-hour photo, hearing aid and travel) 18 % 16 % 15 % 5 Table of Contents Item 1—Business (Continued) Ancillary businesses within or next to our warehouses provide expanded products and services and encourage members to shop more frequently. The following table indicates the number of ancillary businesses in operation at fiscal year-end: 2011 2010 2009 Food Court 586 534 521 One-Hour Photo Centers 581 530 518 Optical Dispensing Centers 574 523 509 Pharmacies 529 480 464 Gas Stations 368 343 323 Hearing-Aid Centers 427 357 303 Print Shops and Copy Centers 10 10 10 Car Washes 7 7 2 Number of warehouses 592 540 527 The 2010 and 2009 numbers exclude the 32 warehouses operated in Mexico. Our electronic commerce businesses, costco.com in the U.S. and costco.ca in Canada, provide our members additional products generally not found in our warehouses, in addition to services such as digital photo processing, pharmacy, travel, and membership services. Our warehouses accept cash, checks, certain debit cards, American Express and a private label Costco credit card. Losses associated with dishonored checks have been minimal, as members who have issued dishonored checks are identified and prevented from making further purchases until restitution is made. We have direct buying relationships with many producers of national brand-name merchandise. We do not obtain a significant portion of merchandise from any one supplier. We have not experienced any difficulty in obtaining sufficient quantities of merchandise, and believe that if one or more of our current sources of supply became unavailable, we would be able to obtain alternative sources without substantial disruption of our business. We also purchase private label merchandise, as long as quality and customer demand are comparable and the value to our members is greater as compared to name brand items. Certain financial information for our segments and geographic areas is included in Note 12 to the consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this Report. Membership Policy Our membership format is designed to reinforce customer loyalty and provide a continuing source of membership fee revenue. Members can utilize their memberships at any Costco warehouse location in any country. We have two primary types of members: Business and Gold Star (individual). Our member renewal rate was 89% in the U.S. and Canada, and approximately 86% on a worldwide basis, consistent with recent years. The renewal rate is a trailing calculation that captures renewals during the period seven to eighteen months prior to the reporting date. Businesses, including individuals with a business license, retail sales license or other evidence of business existence, may become Business members. Business members generally pay an annual membership fee of approximately $50 for the primary and household membership card, with add-on membership cards available for an annual fee of approximately $50 (including a free household card). Many of our business members also shop at Costco for their personal needs. Individual (Gold Star) memberships are available to individuals who do not qualify for a Business membership, for an annual fee of approximately $50, which includes a household card. 6 Table of Contents Item 1—Business (Continued) Our membership was made up of the following (in thousands): 2011 2010 2009 Gold Star 25,000 22,500 21,500 Business 6,300 5,800 5,700 Business, Add-on Primary 4,000 3,300 3,400 Total primary cardholders 35,300 31,600 30,600 Additional cardholders 28,700 26,400 25,400 Total cardholders 64,000 58,000 56,000 The numbers for 2010 and 2009 exclude approximately 2,900 and 2,800 cardholders of Mexico at the end of those years. Executive membership is available to all members, with the exception of Business Add-on members, in the U.S., Canada, Mexico, and the United Kingdom for an annual fee of approximately $100. This program, excluding Mexico, offers additional savings and benefits on various business and consumer services, such as merchant credit-card processing, auto and home insurance, the Costco auto purchase program, check printing services and a high yield savings program. The services are generally provided by third-parties and vary by country and state. In addition, Executive members qualify for a 2% annual reward (which can be redeemed at Costco warehouses), up to a maximum of approximately $500 per year, on qualified purchases made at Costco. At the end of 2011, 2010, and 2009, Executive members represented 38%, 36%, and 33%, respectively, of our primary membership. Executive members generally spend more than other members, and the percentage of our net sales attributable to these members continues to increase. Labor Our employee count approximated: 2011 2010 2009 Full-time employees 92,000 82,000 79,000 Part-time employees 72,000 65,000 63,000 Total employees 164,000 147,000 142,000 The numbers for 2010 and 2009 exclude approximately 9,000 individuals who were employed by Mexico at the end of those years. Approximately 13,600 hourly employees in certain of our locations (all former Price Company locations) in five states are represented by the International Brotherhood of Teamsters. All remaining employees are non-union. We consider our employee relations to be very good. Competition Our industry is highly competitive, based on factors such as price, merchandise quality and selection, warehouse location and member service. We compete with over 800 warehouse club locations across the U.S. and Canada (Wal-Mart’s Sam’s Club and BJ’s Wholesale Club), and every major metropolitan area has multiple club operations. In addition, we compete with a wide range of global, national and regional wholesalers and retailers, including supermarkets, supercenter stores, department and specialty stores, gasoline stations, and internet-based retailers. Competitors such as Wal-Mart, Target, Kohl’s and Amazon.com are among our significant general merchandise retail competitors. We also compete with low-cost operators selling a single category or narrow range of merchandise, such as Lowe’s, Home Depot, Office Depot, PetSmart, Staples, Trader Joe’s, Whole Foods, Best Buy and Barnes & Noble. Our international operations face similar types of competitors. 7 Table of Contents Item 1—Business (Continued) Regulation Certain state laws require that we apply minimum markups to our selling prices for specific goods, such as tobacco products, alcoholic beverages, and gasoline. While compliance with such laws may cause us to charge higher prices, other retailers are also typically governed by the same restrictions, and we believe that compliance with such laws currently in effect do not have a material adverse effect on our operations. Certain jurisdictions have enacted or proposed laws and regulations that would prevent or restrict the operations or expansion plans of certain large retailers and warehouse clubs, including us, within their jurisdictions. If enacted, such laws and regulations could have a material adverse affect on our operations. Intellectual Property We believe that, to varying degrees, our trademarks, trade names, copyrights, proprietary processes, trade secrets, patents, trade dress and similar intellectual property add significant value to our business and are important factors in our success. Our failure to continue to develop, maintain, and protect these properties would adversely affect our business and financial results. We have invested significantly in the development and protection of our well-recognized brands, including the Costco Wholesale® series of trademarks and our private label brand, Kirkland Signature®. We believe that Kirkland Signature products are premium products offered to our members at prices that are generally lower than those for national brand products and that they help lower costs, differentiate our merchandise offerings from other retailers, and generally earn higher margins. We expect to increase the sales penetration of our private label items in the future. We rely on trademark and copyright law, trade secret protection, and confidentiality and license agreements with our employees and others to protect our proprietary rights. Effective intellectual property protection may not be available in every country in which we operate. Available Information Our internet website is www.costco.com. We make available through the Investor Relations section of that site, free of charge, our Annual Reports on Form 10-K, Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q, Current Reports on Form 8-K, Proxy Statements and Forms 3, 4 and 5, and any amendments to those reports, as soon as reasonably practicable after filing such materials with, or furnishing such documents to, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). The information found on our website is not part of this or any other report filed with or furnished to the SEC. The Company has adopted a code of ethics for senior financial officers pursuant to section 406 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. Copies of the code are available free of charge by writing to Secretary, Costco Wholesale Corporation, 999 Lake Drive, Issaquah, WA 98027.

These risks are not the only risks that we face. Our business operations could also be affected by additional factors that apply to all companies operating in the United States and globally, as well as other risks that are not presently known to us or that we currently consider to be immaterial. We face strong competition from other retailers and warehouse club operators, which could negatively affect our financial performance. The retail business is highly competitive. We compete for members, employees, sites, products and services and in other important respects with many other local, regional and national retailers, both in the United States and in foreign countries. We compete with a wide range of global, national and regional wholesalers and retailers, including supermarkets, supercenter stores, department and specialty stores, gasoline stations, and internet-based retailers. Such retailers and warehouse club operators compete in a variety of ways, including merchandise pricing, selection and availability, services, location, convenience, and store hours. Our inability to respond effectively to competitive pressures and changes in the retail markets could negatively affect our financial performance. Some competitors may have greater financial resources, better access to merchandise, and greater market penetration than we do. General economic factors, domestically and internationally, may adversely affect our financial performance. Higher interest rates, energy costs, inflation, levels of unemployment, healthcare costs, consumer debt levels, unsettled financial markets, weaknesses in housing and real estate markets, reduced consumer confidence, changes related to government fiscal and tax policies and other economic factors could adversely affect demand for our products and services or require a change in the mix of products we sell. Prices of certain commodity products, including gasoline and other food products, are historically volatile and are subject to fluctuations arising from changes in domestic and international supply and demand, labor costs, competition, market speculation, government regulations and periodic delays in delivery. Rapid and significant changes in commodity prices may affect our sales and profit margins. These factors can also increase our merchandise costs and/or selling, general and administrative expenses, and otherwise adversely affect our operations and financial results. General economic conditions can also be affected by the outbreak of war, acts of terrorism, or other significant national or international events. Our growth strategy includes expanding our business, both in existing markets and in new markets. Our future growth is dependent, in part, on our ability to acquire property, and build or lease new warehouses. We compete with other retailers and businesses for suitable locations. Local land use and other regulations restricting the construction and operation of our warehouses, as well as local community actions opposed to the location of our warehouses at specific sites and the adoption of local laws restricting our operations and environmental regulations may impact our ability to find suitable locations, and increase the cost of constructing, leasing and operating our warehouses. We also may have difficulty negotiating leases or real estate purchase agreements on acceptable terms. Failure to manage these and other similar factors effectively will affect our ability to timely build or lease new warehouses, which may have a material adverse affect on our future growth and profitability. 10 Table of Contents Item 1A—Risk Factors (Continued) We seek to expand our business in existing markets in order to attain a greater overall market share. Because our warehouses typically draw members from their local areas, a new warehouse may draw members away from our existing warehouses and adversely affect comparable warehouse sales performance and member traffic at those existing warehouses. We also intend to open warehouses in new markets. The risks associated with entering a new market include difficulties in attracting members due to a lack of familiarity with us, attracting members of other wholesale club operators currently operating in the new market, our lack of familiarity with local member preferences, and seasonal differences in the market. In addition, entry into new markets may bring us into competition with new competitors or with existing competitors with a large, established market presence. In new markets, we cannot ensure that our new warehouses will be profitably deployed; as a result, our future profitability may be delayed or otherwise materially adversely affected. We are highly dependent on the financial performance of our United States and Canada operations. Our financial and operational performance is highly dependent on our United States and Canada operations, which comprised 89% and 83% of consolidated net sales and operating income in 2011, respectively. Within the United States, we are highly dependent on our California operations, which comprised 24% of consolidated net sales in 2011. Our California market, in general, has a larger percentage of higher volume warehouses as compared to our other markets. Any substantial slowing or sustained decline in these operations could materially adversely affect our business and financial results. Declines in financial performance of our United States operations, particularly in California, and our Canada operations could arise from, among other things: failing to meet targets for warehouse openings; declines in actual or estimated comparable warehouse sales growth rates and expectations; negative trends in operating expenses, including increased labor, healthcare and energy costs; cannibalizing existing locations with new warehouses; shifts in sales mix toward lower gross margin products; changes or uncertainties in economic conditions in our markets, including higher levels of unemployment and depressed home values; and failing to consistently provide high quality products and innovative new products to retain our existing member base and attract new members. We depend on vendors to supply us with quality merchandise at the right prices in a timely manner. We depend heavily on our ability to purchase merchandise in sufficient quantities at competitive prices. We have no assurances of continued supply, pricing or access to new products, and any vendor could at any time change the terms upon which it sells to us or discontinue selling to us. Member demands may lead to out-of-stock positions of our merchandise, leading to loss of sales and profits. We purchase our merchandise from numerous domestic and foreign manufacturers and importers and have thousands of vendor relationships. Our inability to acquire suitable merchandise on acceptable terms or the loss of key vendors could negatively affect us. We may not be able to develop relationships with new vendors, and products from alternative sources, if any, may be of a lesser quality or more expensive than those from existing vendors. Because of our efforts to adhere to high quality standards for which available supply may be limited, particularly for certain food items, the large volume we demand may not be consistently available. Our suppliers are subject to risks, including labor disputes, union organizing activities, financial liquidity, inclement weather, natural disasters, supply constraints, and general economic and political conditions, that could limit their ability to timely provide us with acceptable merchandise. For these or other reasons, one or more of our suppliers might not adhere to our quality control, legal or regulatory stan 11 Table of Contents Item 1A—Risk Factors (Continued) dards. These deficiencies may delay or preclude delivery of merchandise to us and might not be identified before we sell such merchandise to our members. This failure could lead to litigation and recalls, which could damage our reputation and our brands, increase our costs, and otherwise hurt our business. Disruptions in our depot operations could adversely affect sales and member satisfaction. We depend on the orderly operation of the receiving and distribution process, primarily through our depots. Although we believe that our receiving and distribution process is efficient, unforeseen disruptions in operations due to fires, hurricanes, earthquakes or other catastrophic events, labor shortages and disagreements or shipping problems, may result in delays in the delivery of merchandise to our warehouses, which could adversely affect sales and the satisfaction of our members. We may not timely identify or effectively respond to consumer trends, which could negatively affect our relationship with our members, the demand for our products and services, and our market share. It is difficult to consistently and successfully predict the products and services our members will demand. Our success depends, in part, on our ability to identify and respond to trends in demographics and consumer preferences. Failure to timely identify or effectively respond to changing consumer tastes, preferences (including those relating to sustainability of product sources) and spending patterns could negatively affect our relationship with our members, the demand for our products and services and our market share. If we are not successful at predicting our sales trends and adjusting our purchases accordingly, we may have excess inventory, which could result in additional markdowns and reduce our operating performance. This could have an adverse effect on margins and operating income. Our failure to maintain positive membership loyalty and brand recognition could adversely affect our financial results. Membership loyalty is essential to our business model. Damage to our brands or reputation may negatively impact comparable warehouse sales, lower employee morale and productivity, diminish member trust, and reduce member renewal rates and, accordingly, membership fee revenues, resulting in a reduction in shareholder value. In addition, we sell many products under our owned and exclusive Kirkland Signature brand. Maintaining consistent product quality, competitive pricing, and availability of our Kirkland Signature products for our customers is essential to developing and maintaining customer loyalty. These products also generally carry higher margins than national brand products and represent a growing portion of our overall sales. If the Kirkland Signature brand experiences a loss of consumer acceptance or confidence, our sales and gross margin results could be adversely affected. Changes in accounting standards and subjective assumptions, estimates and judgments by management related to complex accounting matters could significantly affect our financial results. Generally accepted accounting principles and related accounting pronouncements, implementation guidelines and interpretations with regard to a wide range of matters that are relevant to our business, including, but not limited to, revenue recognition, sales returns reserves, impairment of long-lived assets and warehouse closing costs, inventories, vendor rebates and other consideration, self-insurance liabilities, income taxes, unclaimed property laws and litigation, and other contingent liabilities are highly complex and involve many subjective assumptions, estimates and judgments by our management. Changes 12 Table of Contents Item 1A—Risk Factors (Continued) in these rules or their interpretation or changes in underlying assumptions, estimates or judgments by our management could significantly change our reported or expected financial performance. Provisions for losses related to self-insured risks are generally based upon independent actuarially determined estimates. The assumptions underlying the ultimate costs of existing claim losses can be highly unpredictable, which can affect the liability recorded for such claims. For example, variability in inflation rates of health care costs inherent in these claims can affect the amounts realized. In March 2010, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act and the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010 were enacted. This legislation expands health care coverage to many uninsured individuals and expands coverage to those already insured. We expect our healthcare costs to increase, but not materially, as a result of this legislation. Similarly, changes in legal trends and interpretations, as well as a change in the nature and method of how claims are settled can impact ultimate costs. Although our estimates of liabilities incurred do not anticipate significant changes in historical trends for these variables, any changes could have a considerable effect upon future claim costs and currently recorded liabilities and could materially impact our consolidated financial statements. Unfavorable changes in tax rates could adversely affect our operations, financial conditions or cash flows. We compute our income tax provision based on enacted tax rates in the countries in which we operate. As the tax rates vary among countries, a change in earnings attributable to the various jurisdictions in which we operate could result in an unfavorable change in our overall tax provision. Additionally, any change in the enacted tax rates, any adverse outcome in connection with any income tax audits in any jurisdiction, including transfer pricing disputes, or any change in the pronouncements relating to accounting for income taxes may have a material adverse affect on our financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows. Failure of our internal control over financial reporting could make our financial results inaccurate or untimely. Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting. Internal control over financial reporting is designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting for external purposes in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. Internal control over financial reporting includes: maintaining records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect our transactions; providing reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary for preparation of the financial statements; providing reasonable assurance that our receipts and expenditures of our assets are made in accordance with management authorization; and providing reasonable assurance that unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of our assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements would be prevented or detected on a timely basis. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting is not intended to and cannot provide absolute assurance that a misstatement of our financial statements would be prevented or detected. Any failure to maintain an effective system of internal control over financial reporting could limit our ability to report our financial results accurately and timely or to detect and prevent fraud. We rely extensively on computer systems to process transactions, summarize results and manage our business. Disruptions in both our primary and back-up systems could harm our business. Although we believe that we have independent, redundant, and primary and secondary computer systems, given the number of individual transactions we have each year it is important that we maintain 13 Table of Contents Item 1A—Risk Factors (Continued) uninterrupted operation of our business-critical computer systems. Our computer systems, including our back-up systems, are subject to damage or interruption from power outages, computer and telecommunications failures, computer viruses, internal or external security breaches, catastrophic events such as fires, earthquakes, tornadoes and hurricanes, and errors by our employees. If our computer systems and our back-up systems are damaged or cease to function properly, we may have to make significant investments to fix or replace them, and we may suffer interruptions in our operations in the interim. Any material interruption in our computer systems may have a material adverse effect on our business or results of operations. We expect to make significant technology investments in the coming years, which are key to managing our business. We must monitor and choose the right investments and implement them at the right pace. Excessive technological change could impact the effectiveness of adoption, and could make it more difficult for us to realize benefits from the technology. Targeting the wrong opportunities, failing to make the best investments or making an investment commitment significantly above or below our needs may result in the loss of our competitive position or underlying financial data. Additionally, the costs, potential problems, and interruptions associated with implementing technology initiatives could disrupt or reduce the efficiency of our operations in the short term. These initiatives might not provide the anticipated benefits or provide them in a delayed or more costly manner. Our international operations subject us to risks associated with the legislative, judicial, accounting, regulatory, political and economic factors specific to the countries or regions in which we operate, which could adversely affect our financial performance. During 2011, our international operations, including Canada, generated 27% of our consolidated net sales. We plan to continue expanding our international operations. As a result of these expansion activities in countries outside the United States, we expect that our international operations could account for a larger portion of our net sales in future years. Future operating results internationally could be negatively affected by a variety of factors, many beyond our control and similar to those we face in the United States. These factors include political conditions, economic conditions, regulatory constraints, currency regulations and exchange rates, and other matters in any of the countries or regions in which we operate, now or in the future. Other factors that may impact international operations include foreign trade, monetary and fiscal policies both of the United States and of other countries, laws and regulations of foreign governments and the United States (such as the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act), agencies and similar organizations, and risks associated with having major facilities located in countries which have been historically less stable than the United States. Risks inherent in international operations also include, among others, the costs and difficulties of managing international operations, adverse tax consequences and greater difficulty in enforcing intellectual property rights. Additionally, foreign currency exchange rates and fluctuations may have an adverse impact on our future costs or on future cash flows from our international operations. Market expectations for our financial performance is high. We believe that the price of our stock generally reflects high market expectations for our future operating results. Any failure to meet or delay in meeting these expectations, including our comparable warehouse sales growth rates, margins, earnings and earnings per share or new warehouse openings, could cause the market price of our stock to decline, as could changes in our dividend or stock repurchase policies. 14 Table of Contents Item 1A—Risk Factors (Continued) Natural disasters or other catastrophic events could unfavorably affect our financial performance. Natural disasters, such as hurricanes or earthquakes, particularly in California or in Washington state, where our centralized operating systems and administrative personnel are located, could unfavorably affect our operations and financial performance. Such events could result in physical damage to one or more of our properties, the temporary closure of one or more warehouses or depots, the temporary lack of an adequate work force in a market, the temporary or long-term disruption in the supply of products from some local and overseas suppliers, the temporary disruption in the transport of goods from overseas, delays in the delivery of goods to our depots or warehouses within a country in which we operate and the temporary reduction in the availability of products in our warehouses. Public health issues, such as a potential H1N1 flu (swine flu) pandemic, whether occurring in the United States or abroad, could disrupt our operations, disrupt the operations of suppliers or customers, or have an adverse impact on consumer spending and confidence levels. We may be required to suspend operations in some or all of our locations, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations. These events could also reduce demand for our products or make it difficult or impossible to receive products from suppliers. Factors associated with climate change could adversely affect our business. We use natural gas, diesel fuel, gasoline, and electricity in our distribution and warehouse operations. Increased government regulations to limit carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gas emissions may result in increased compliance costs and legislation or regulation affecting energy inputs could materially affect our profitability. In addition, climate change could affect our ability to procure needed commodities at costs and in quantities we currently experience. We also sell a substantial amount of gasoline, the demand for which could be impacted by concerns about climate change and which also could face increased regulation. Climate change may be associated with extreme weather conditions, such as more intense hurricanes, thunderstorms, tornados and snow or ice storms, as well as rising sea levels. Extreme weather conditions increase our costs, and damage resulting from extreme weather may not be fully insured. We are subject to a wide variety of federal, state, regional, local and international laws and regulations relating to the use, storage, discharge, and disposal of hazardous materials and hazardous and non-hazardous wastes, and other environmental matters. Any failure to comply with these laws could result in costs to satisfy environmental compliance, remediation or compensatory requirements, or the imposition of severe penalties or restrictions on operations by governmental agencies or courts that could adversely affect our operations. We are involved in a number of legal proceedings and audits, and while we cannot predict the outcomes of such proceedings and other contingencies with certainty, some of these outcomes may unfavorably affect our operations or increase our costs. We are or may become involved in a number of legal proceedings and audits, including grand jury investigations, other government investigations, consumer, employment, tort and other litigation (see discussion of Legal Proceedings in Note 11 to the consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this Report). We cannot predict with certainty the outcomes of these legal proceedings and other contingencies, including environmental remediation and other proceedings commenced by governmental authorities. The outcome of some of these legal proceedings and other contingencies could require us to take or refrain from taking actions which could unfavorably affect our operations or could require us to pay substantial amounts of money. Additionally, defending against these lawsuits and 15 Table of Contents Item 1A—Risk Factors (Continued) proceedings may involve significant expense and diversion of management’s attention and resources. Our business requires compliance with a great variety of laws and regulations. Failure to achieve compliance could subject us to lawsuits and other proceedings, and lead to damage awards, fines and penalties. We are subject to the risks of selling unsafe products. If our merchandise offerings, including food and prepared food products for human consumption, drugs and childrens’ products, do not meet or are perceived not to meet applicable safely standards or our members’ expectations regarding safety, we could experience lost sales, increased costs and be exposed to legal and reputational risk. The sale of these items involves the risk of injury to our members. Such injuries may result from tampering by unauthorized third parties, product contamination or spoilage, including the presence of foreign objects, substances, chemicals, other agents, or residues introduced during the growing, manufacturing, storage, handling and transportation phases. Our vendors are generally contractually required to comply with applicable product safety laws, and we are dependent on them to ensure that the products we buy comply with all safety standards. While we are subject to governmental inspection and regulations and work to comply in all material respects with applicable laws and regulations, we cannot be sure that consumption of our products will not cause a health-related illness in the future or that we will not be subject to claims, lawsuits, or government investigations relating to such matters, resulting in costly product recalls and other liabilities. Even if a product liability claim is unsuccessful or is not fully pursued, the negative publicity surrounding any assertion that our products caused illness or injury could adversely affect our reputation with existing and potential members and our corporate and brand image and these effects could be long term. Our success depends on the continued contributions of management and on our ability to attract, train and retain highly qualified employees. Our success depends to a significant degree on the continued contributions of members of our senior management and other key operations, merchandising and administrative personnel, and the loss of any such person(s) could have a material adverse effect on our business. Other than an annual agreement with our CEO, Mr. Sinegal, we have no employment agreements with our officers. We must attract, train and retain a large and growing number of highly qualified employees, while controlling related labor costs and maintaining our core values. Our ability to control labor costs is subject to numerous external factors, including prevailing wage rates and healthcare and other insurance costs. We compete with other retail and non-retail businesses for these employees and invest significant resources in training and motivating them. There is no assurance that we will be able to attract or retain highly qualified employees in the future, which could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s business, results of operations and financial condition. The Company does not maintain key man insurance. If we do not maintain the privacy and security of member-related and business information, we could damage our reputation with members, incur substantial additional costs and become subject to litigation. We receive, retain, and transmit certain personal information about our members. In addition, our online operations at www.costco.com and www.costco.ca depend upon the secure transmission of confidential information over public networks, including information permitting cashless payments. A compromise of our security systems or those of other business partners that results in our members’ personal information being obtained by unauthorized persons could adversely affect our reputation with our members and others, as well as our operations, results of operations, financial condition and liquid- 16 Table of Contents Item 1A—Risk Factors (Continued) ity, and could result in litigation against us or the imposition of penalties. In addition, a security breach could require that we expend significant additional resources related to the security of information systems and could result in a disruption of our operations, particularly our online sales operations. Additionally, the use of individually identifiable data by our business and our business associates is regulated at the international, federal and state levels. Privacy and information security laws and regulations change, and compliance with them may result in cost increases due to necessary systems changes and the development of new administrative processes. If we or those with whom we share information fail to comply with these laws and regulations or experience a data security breach, our reputation could be damaged, possibly resulting in lost future business, and we could be subjected to additional legal risk as a result of non-compliance. Our security measures may be undermined due to the actions of outside parties, employee error, malfeasance, or otherwise, and, as a result, an unauthorized party may obtain access to our data systems and misappropriate business and personal information. Because the techniques used to obtain unauthorized access, disable or degrade service, or sabotage systems change frequently and may not immediately produce signs of intrusion, we may be unable to anticipate these techniques or to implement adequate preventative measures. Any such breach or unauthorized access could result in significant legal and financial exposure, damage to our reputation, and potentially have an adverse effect on our business.

Our executive offices are located in Issaquah, Washington and occupy approximately 581,000 square feet. We operated eight regional offices in the United States, two regional offices in Canada and six regional offices internationally at the end of 2011, containing approximately 422,000 square feet. Additionally, we operated regional cross-docking facilities (depots) for the consolidation and distribution of most shipments to the warehouses, and various processing, packaging, and other facilities to support ancillary and other businesses. At the end of 2011, we operated 12 depots in the United States, four in Canada and four internationally, consisting of approximately 8.3 million square feet.
