4962,AXP,AMERICAN EXPRESS CO,2018,"ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (MD&A) EXECUTIVE OVERVIEW BUSINESS INTRODUCTION We are a global services company with four reportable operating segments: U.S. Consumer Services (USCS), International Consumer and Network Services (ICNS), Global Commercial Services (GCS) and Global Merchant Services (GMS). Corporate functions and certain other businesses and operations are included in Corporate & Other. The following types of revenue are generated from our various products and services: • Discount revenue, our largest revenue source, represents fees generally charged to merchants for accepting our cards as payment for goods or services sold. The fees charged, or merchant discount, which is generally expressed as a percentage of the charge amount, varies with, among other factors, the industry in which the merchant does business, the charge amount and the merchant’s overall charge volume, the method of submission of charges, the timing and method of payment to the merchant and, in certain instances, the geographic scope for the related card acceptance agreement (e.g., domestic or global). In some instances, an additional flat transaction fee is assessed as part of the merchant discount, and additional fees may be charged such as a variable fee for “non-swiped” card transactions or for transactions using cards issued outside the United States at merchants located in the United States; • Interest on loans, principally represents interest income earned on outstanding balances; • Net card fees, represent revenue earned from annual card membership fees, which varies based on the type of card and the number of cards for each account; • Other fees and commissions, represent Card Member delinquency fees, foreign currency conversion fees charged to Card Members, loyalty coalition-related fees, travel commissions and fees, service fees and fees related to our Membership Rewards program; and • Other revenue, represents revenues arising from contracts with partners of our Global Network Services (GNS) business (including commissions and signing fees), cross-border Card Member spending, insurance premiums, ancillary merchant-related fees, prepaid card and Travelers Cheque-related revenue, revenues related to the American Express Global Business Travel Joint Venture (the GBT JV) transition services agreement and earnings from equity method investments (including the GBT JV). TAX CUTS AND JOBS ACT On December 22, 2017, the U.S. government enacted comprehensive tax legislation commonly referred to as the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the Tax Act). The Tax Act makes broad and complex changes to the U.S. federal corporate income tax rules that, beginning in 2018, will significantly decrease our income tax expense and reduce our effective tax rate to the low 20s, before discrete items. Most notably, effective January 1, 2018, the Tax Act reduces the U.S. federal statutory corporate income tax rate from 35 percent to 21 percent, introduces a territorial tax system in which future dividends paid from earnings outside the United States to a U.S. corporation are not subject to U.S. federal taxation and imposes new U.S. federal corporate income taxes on certain foreign operations. While the Tax Act will positively impact our earnings in future periods, two provisions of the Tax Act drove a 2017 charge of $2.6 billion, which impacted our earnings in the fourth quarter. In particular, the Tax Act imposes a one-time deemed repatriation tax on previously undistributed earnings of certain non-U.S. subsidiaries. In addition, the reduction of the federal statutory tax rate from 35 percent to 21 percent required us to remeasure our U.S. federal deferred tax assets and liabilities. The 2017 charge for these provisions reflects our best estimate based on information currently available and our current interpretation of the Tax Act. Refer to Note 21 to the “Consolidated Financial Statements” for additional information. 36 Table of Contents FINANCIAL HIGHLIGHTS For 2017, we reported net income of $2.7 billion and diluted earnings per share of $2.97. This compared to $5.4 billion of net income and $5.65 diluted earnings per share for 2016, and $5.2 billion of net income and $5.05 diluted earnings per share for 2015. 2017 results included: • A $2.6 billion tax charge related to the Tax Act. 2016 results included: • A $1.1 billion ($677 million after tax) gain on the sale of Card Member loans and receivables related to our cobrand partnership with Costco in the second quarter; • $410 million ($266 million after tax) of net restructuring charges; and • A $127 million ($79 million after tax) gain on the sale of Card Member loans and receivables related to our cobrand partnership with JetBlue in the first quarter. 2015 results included: • A $419 million ($335 million after tax) charge related to the Prepaid Services business, which was driven primarily by the impairment of goodwill and technology, and certain restructuring costs. NON-GAAP MEASURES We prepare our Consolidated Financial Statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (GAAP). However, certain information included within this report constitutes non-GAAP financial measures. Our calculations of non-GAAP financial measures may differ from the calculations of similarly titled measures by other companies. BUSINESS ENVIRONMENT Our results for 2017 reflect a strong finish to our two-year game plan as we successfully executed against our key priorities of accelerating revenue growth, optimizing our investments and resetting our cost base. Billings and revenue performance were strong across our business segments and accelerated during the fourth quarter. We continued to invest in new products and benefits, new card acquisitions and expanding our merchant network, and we returned a significant amount of capital to shareholders through share repurchases and dividends. In addition, our results reflect a tax charge related to the Tax Act. Our worldwide billed business increased 5 percent over the prior year, reflecting growth across our diverse customer segments and geographies. U.S. proprietary consumer billings growth increased sequentially during the year and international proprietary consumer billings growth rates remained strong. We also saw strong performance from middle market and small business customers, while large and global commercial customers grew at a more modest pace. Global Network Services billed business grew at a slower rate over the year than our proprietary business as a result of the impact of the evolving regulatory environment in Europe and Australia. Revenues net of interest expense grew year-over-year primarily due to growth in billed business, net interest income and net card fees, partially offset by an expected decline in the average discount rate. Our net interest yield increased year-over-year primarily related to a shift in mix over time towards non-cobrand lending products that generally attract more revolving loan balances, a lower percentage of total loans at introductory interest rates, specific pricing actions and a benefit from increases in benchmark interest rates. During the fourth quarter, we saw net interest yield begin to stabilize sequentially. Card Member loan and receivables growth was strong year-over-year, as we continue to expand our relationships with existing customers and acquired new Card Members. We continue to see opportunities to increase our share of our customers’ borrowings. As expected, provisions for losses increased as a result of higher Card Member loans and receivables and increases in lending delinquencies and net write-off rates. The increases in the delinquencies and net write-off rates were primarily due to the seasoning of recent loan vintages and a shift in mix over time towards non-cobrand lending products, which have higher write-off rates but also drive higher net interest yields. We expect these trends to continue, resulting in continued increases in lending write-off rates, delinquencies and provisions for losses. Spending on Card Member engagement (the aggregate of rewards, Card Member services and marketing and promotion expenses) increased year-over-year and primarily reflected the recent enhancements to rewards on our U.S. Platinum products, continued strong growth in our Delta cobrand portfolio and higher levels of engagement in many of our premium services. Marketing and promotion expense decreased due to elevated spending on growth initiatives during the prior year and as we realized efficiencies in our marketing spend. Operating expense increased year-over-year, driven by the prior year gains on the sales of certain cobrand portfolios, which were recognized as a reduction in other expenses. Excluding these gains, operating expense decreased year-over-year reflecting the benefits from our cost reduction initiatives during the past two years. 37 Table of Contents In the fourth quarter of 2017, we recognized a tax charge of $2.6 billion related to the Tax Act, which drove a decline in net income versus 2016. This charge represents our current estimate of taxes on deemed repatriations of certain overseas earnings and the remeasurement of U.S. net deferred tax assets. Our effective tax rate for 2017 was up substantially from 33 percent in 2016. Excluding the impacts of the Tax Act, our effective tax rate for the year would have decreased compared to 2016, primarily due to the realization of certain foreign tax credits in the current year and a continuing shift in the geographic mix of earnings. We continue to analyze and interpret the Tax Act, and its impact on our earnings; however, for 2018, we currently estimate our tax rate will be approximately 22 percent, before discrete tax items. The upfront charge triggered by the Tax Act reduced our capital ratios and, as a result, while we will be continuing our quarterly dividends at the current level, we suspended our share buyback program for the first half of 2018 in order to rebuild our capital. Our strong performance in 2017 reflects benefits from the investments we have made in a variety of growth opportunities over the last several years. Although we continue to see some headwinds from regulation in markets around the world and intense competition, we remain focused on delivering differentiated value to our merchants, customers and business partners, while delivering appropriate returns to our shareholders. With Stephen J. Squeri as our new Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, effective February 1, 2018 as previously announced, we will be focused on strengthening our leadership position with premium consumers, extending our strong position in the commercial payments space, making American Express an essential part of our customers’ digital lives and strengthening our global, integrated network to provide unique value. See “Supervision and Regulation” in “Business” for information on legislative and regulatory changes that could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition and “Legal, Regulatory and Compliance Risk” in “Risk Factors” for information on the potential impacts of an adverse decision in the Department of Justice case and related merchant litigations on our business. 38 Table of Contents CONSOLIDATED RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Effective December 1, 2015, we transferred the Card Member loans and receivables related to our HFS portfolios to Card Member loans and receivables HFS on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. On March 18, 2016 and June 17, 2016, we completed the sales of the JetBlue and Costco cobrand card portfolios, respectively. For the periods from December 1, 2015, through the sale completion dates, the primary impacts beyond the HFS classification on the Consolidated Balance Sheets were to provisions for losses and credit metrics, which did not reflect amounts related to these HFS loans and receivables, as credit costs were reported in Other expenses through a valuation allowance adjustment. Other, non-credit related metrics (i.e., billed business, cards-in-force, net interest yield) reflected amounts related to the HFS portfolios through the sale completion dates. Additionally, for periods after the sale completion dates, activities associated with these cobrand partnerships and the HFS portfolios were no longer included in our Consolidated Results of Operations. Specifically, these impacts included: Discount revenue from Costco in the United States for spend on all American Express cards and from other merchants for spend on the Costco cobrand card; Other fees and commissions and Interest income from Costco cobrand Card Members; and Card Member rewards expense related to the Costco cobrand card, resulting in a lack of comparability between the periods presented. The relationship of the U.S. dollar to various foreign currencies over the periods of comparison has had an impact on our results of operations. Where meaningful in describing our performance, foreign currency-adjusted amounts, which exclude the impact of changes in the foreign exchange (FX) rates, have been provided. TABLE 1: SUMMARY OF FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE Years Ended December 31, Change Change (Millions, except percentages and per share amounts) 2017 2016 2015 2017 vs. 2016 2016 vs. 2015 Total revenues net of interest expense $ 33,471 $ 32,119 $ 32,818 $ 1,352 4 % $ (699 ) (2 )% Provisions for losses 2,759 2,026 1,988 733 36 38 2 Expenses 23,298 21,997 22,892 1,301 6 (895 ) (4 ) Pretax income 7,414 8,096 7,938 (682 ) (8 ) 158 2 Income tax provision 4,678 2,688 2,775 1,990 74 (87 ) (3 ) Net income 2,736 5,408 5,163 (2,672 ) (49 ) 245 5 Earnings per common share — diluted(a) $ 2.97 $ 5.65 $ 5.05 $ (2.68 ) (47 )% $ 0.60 12 % Return on average equity(b) 13.1 % 26.0 % 24.0 % Effective tax rate (ETR) 63.1 % 33.2 % 35.0 % Impact of Tax Act charge on ETR 34.7 % ETR, excluding the Tax Act charge(c) 28.4 % (a) Earnings per common share — diluted was reduced by the impact of (i) earnings allocated to participating share awards and other items of $21 million, $43 million and $38 million for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively, and (ii) dividends on preferred shares of $81 million, $80 million and $62 million for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015. (b) Return on average equity (ROE) is computed by dividing (i) one-year period net income ($2.7 billion, $5.4 billion and $5.2 billion for 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively) by (ii) one-year average total shareholders’ equity ($20.8 billion, $20.8 billion and $21.5 billion for 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively). (c) The effective tax rate for 2017 excluding the $2.6 billion charge related to the Tax Act is a non-GAAP measure. Management believes the effective tax rate excluding the impacts of the Tax Act is useful in evaluating the company’s tax rate in comparison with the prior-year periods. Refer to Note 21 of the “Consolidated Financial Statements” for additional information. TABLE 2: TOTAL REVENUES NET OF INTEREST EXPENSE SUMMARY Years Ended December 31, Change Change (Millions, except percentages) 2017 2016 2015 2017 vs. 2016 2016 vs. 2015 Discount revenue $ 19,186 $ 18,680 $ 19,297 $ 506 3 % $ (617 ) (3 )% Net card fees 3,090 2,886 2,700 204 7 186 7 Other fees and commissions 3,022 2,753 2,866 269 10 (113 ) (4 ) Other 1,732 2,029 2,033 (297 ) (15 ) (4 ) ― Total non-interest revenues 27,030 26,348 26,896 682 3 (548 ) (2 ) Total interest income 8,553 7,475 7,545 1,078 14 (70 ) (1 ) Total interest expense 2,112 1,704 1,623 408 24 81 5 Net interest income 6,441 5,771 5,922 670 12 (151 ) (3 ) Total revenues net of interest expense $ 33,471 $ 32,119 $ 32,818 $ 1,352 4 % $ (699 ) (2 )% TOTAL REVENUES NET OF INTEREST EXPENSE Discount revenue increased in 2017 compared to 2016, primarily due to growth in billed business, and decreased in 2016 compared to 2015 primarily due to lower Costco-related revenues. Both periods of comparison also reflected decreases in the average discount rate and increases in contra-discount revenues. The increase in contra-discount revenue in 2017 compared to 2016 was primarily due to higher corporate client incentives and cobrand partner payments, both driven by higher volumes; the increase in 2016 compared to 2015 was primarily due to an increase in cash rebate rewards. Overall, billed business increased in 2017 compared to 2016. U.S. billed business increased 1 percent and non-U.S. billed business increased 12 percent. See Tables 5 and 6 for more details on billed business performance. 39 Table of Contents The average discount rate was 2.43 percent, 2.45 percent and 2.46 percent for 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively. The decrease in the average discount rate in 2017 compared to 2016 primarily reflected rate pressure from merchant negotiations, including those resulting from the recent regulatory changes affecting competitor pricing in certain international markets, the continued growth of the OptBlue program, and changes in industry and geographic mix. We expect the average discount rate will continue to decline over time due to a greater shift of existing merchants into OptBlue, merchant negotiations and competition, volume related pricing discounts, certain pricing initiatives mainly driven by pricing regulation (including regulation of competitors’ interchange rates) and other factors. Net card fees increased in both periods. The increase in 2017 was primarily driven by growth in the Platinum and Delta portfolios and growth in key international markets. The increase in 2016 was primarily driven by growth in the Platinum, Gold and Delta portfolios. Other fees and commissions increased in 2017 compared to 2016, and decreased in 2016 compared to 2015. The increase in 2017 was primarily driven by an increase in delinquency fees due to a change in the late fee assessment date for certain U.S. charge cards and an increase in foreign exchange conversion revenue. The decrease in 2016 was primarily due to lower Costco-related fees, partially offset by an increase in delinquency and loyalty coalition-related fees. Other revenues decreased in 2017 compared to 2016, and were relatively flat in 2016 compared to 2015. The decrease in 2017 was primarily driven by prior-year revenues related to the Loyalty Edge business, which was sold in the fourth quarter of 2016, and a contractual payment from a GNS partner also in the prior year. 2016 included the previously-mentioned contractual payment from a GNS partner and higher revenues from our Prepaid Services business compared to 2015, offset by lower revenues related to Costco, Loyalty Edge and the GBT JV transition services agreement. Interest income increased in 2017 compared to 2016 and decreased in 2016 compared to 2015. The increase in 2017 primarily reflected higher average Card Member loans and higher yields. The growth in average Card Member loans was primarily driven by a mix shift over time towards non-cobrand lending products, where Card Members tend to revolve more of their loan balances. The increase in yields was primarily driven by a greater percentage of loans at higher rate buckets, specific pricing actions, and increases in benchmark interest rates. The decrease in 2016 was primarily driven by lower Costco cobrand loans and the associated interest income, partially offset by modestly higher yields and an increase in average Card Member loans across other lending products. Interest expense increased in both periods. The increase in 2017 was primarily driven by higher interest rates and higher average long-term debt. The increase in 2016 was primarily driven by higher average customer deposit balances, partially offset by lower average long-term debt. TABLE 3: PROVISIONS FOR LOSSES SUMMARY Years Ended December 31, Change Change (Millions, except percentages) 2017 2016 2015 2017 vs. 2016 2016 vs. 2015 Charge card $ 795 $ 696 $ 737 $ 99 14 % $ (41 ) (6 )% Card Member loans 1,868 1,235 1,190 633 51 45 4 Other 96 95 61 1 1 34 56 Total provisions for losses(a) $ 2,759 $ 2,026 $ 1,988 $ 733 36 % $ 38 2 % (a) Beginning December 1, 2015 through to the sale completion dates, did not reflect the HFS portfolios. PROVISIONS FOR LOSSES Charge card provision for losses increased in 2017 compared to 2016 and decreased in 2016 compared to 2015. The increase in 2017 was primarily driven by growth in receivables due to charge volume and higher net write-offs. The decrease in 2016 was driven by lower net write-offs and improved delinquencies. Card Member loans provision for losses increased in both periods. The increases were primarily driven by strong loan growth, as well as increases in net write-off rates and delinquencies, primarily due to the seasoning of recent loan vintages and a shift in mix over time towards non-cobrand lending products, which tend to have higher write-off rates. The increase in 2016 was partially offset by the impact of the HFS portfolios, as 2016 did not reflect the associated credit costs, as previously mentioned. Other provision for losses was relatively flat in 2017 compared to 2016 and increased in 2016 compared to 2015. 2017 compared to 2016 reflected growth in the non-card lending portfolio, which was offset by improving credit performance in the commercial financing portfolio. The increase in 2016 was primarily driven by growth in the commercial financing portfolio, which resulted in higher net write-offs. 40 Table of Contents TABLE 4: EXPENSES SUMMARY Years Ended December 31, Change Change (Millions, except percentages) 2017 2016 2015 2017 vs. 2016 2016 vs. 2015 Marketing and promotion $ 3,217 $ 3,650 $ 3,109 $ (433 ) (12 )% $ 541 17 % Card Member rewards 7,608 6,793 6,996 815 12 (203 ) (3 ) Card Member services and other 1,439 1,133 1,018 306 27 115 11 Total marketing, promotion, rewards and Card Member services and other 12,264 11,576 11,123 688 6 453 4 Salaries and employee benefits 5,258 5,259 4,976 (1 ) ― 283 6 Other, net(a) 5,776 5,162 6,793 614 12 (1,631 ) (24 ) Total expenses $ 23,298 $ 21,997 $ 22,892 $ 1,301 6 % $ (895 ) (4 )% (a) Beginning December 1, 2015 through to the sale completion dates, included the valuation allowance adjustment associated with the HFS portfolios. EXPENSES Marketing and promotion expense decreased in 2017 compared to 2016 and increased in 2016 compared to 2015. The variances for both periods were primarily driven by higher levels of spending on growth initiatives in 2016 compared to the preceding and subsequent years. Card Member rewards expense increased in 2017 compared to 2016 and decreased in 2016 compared to 2015. The increase in 2017 was primarily driven by increases in Membership Rewards expense of $750 million and cobrand rewards expense of $65 million. The increase in Membership Rewards expense was primarily driven by enhancements to U.S. Consumer and Small Business Platinum rewards and higher spending volumes. The increase in cobrand rewards expense reflected growth in spending volumes across certain cobrand card products, which more than offset the absence of Costco-related expense in 2017. The decrease in 2016 was primarily driven by lower cobrand rewards expense of $518 million, primarily reflecting lower Costco-related expense and a shift in volumes to cash rebate cards for which the rewards costs are classified as contra-discount revenue, partially offset by increased spending volumes across other cobrand card products. The lower cobrand rewards expense in 2016 was partially offset by higher Membership Rewards expense of $315 million, primarily driven by an increase in new points earned as a result of higher spending volumes, enhancements to U.S. Consumer and Small Business Platinum rewards and less of a decline in the weighted average cost (WAC) per point. The Membership Rewards Ultimate Redemption Rate (URR) for current program participants was 95 percent (rounded down) at December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015. Card Member services and other expense increased for both periods of comparison, primarily driven by higher usage of travel-related benefits in both periods, and additionally in 2017 by the enhanced Platinum card benefits. Salaries and employee benefits expense was flat for 2017 compared to 2016 and increased in 2016 compared to 2015. Salaries and employee benefits expenses for 2017 reflected higher performance-related employee compensation offset by lower restructuring charges compared to the prior year. The increase in 2016 was primarily driven by higher restructuring charges compared to 2015. Other expense increased in 2017 compared to 2016 and decreased in 2016 compared to 2015. The increase in 2017 was primarily driven by the prior-year gains on the sales of the HFS portfolios, which were recognized as an expense reduction, partially offset by lower technology-related costs in 2017 and Loyalty Edge-related costs in the prior year. The decrease in 2016 was primarily driven by the previously-mentioned gains on the sales of the HFS portfolios, as well as goodwill and technology impairment charges in 2015. INCOME TAXES The effective tax rate for 2017 was 63.1 percent and reflects a substantial charge of $2.6 billion related to the income tax effects of the Tax Act, which are required to be recorded in the period of enactment. The $2.6 billion charge represents our current estimate of taxes primarily on the deemed repatriation of certain overseas earnings and the remeasurement of U.S. federal net deferred tax assets to the lower federal tax rate. Our accounting for the impacts of the Tax Act is provisional and amounts may be revised in future periods as described in the SEC Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 118, which was issued on December 22, 2017 to provide guidance on the accounting for the effects of the Tax Act. Refer to Note 21 to the “Consolidated Financial Statements” for additional information. Excluding the impacts of the Tax Act, the effective tax rate for 2017 would have been 28.4 percent compared to 33.2 percent in 2016 and 35.0 percent in 2015. See Table 1 for a reconciliation of the effective tax rate for 2017 on a GAAP basis. The tax rate for 2017 includes discrete tax benefits of $156 million related to the realization of certain foreign tax credits. The tax rates for 2017, 2016, and 2015 include benefits of $76 million, $60 million and $33 million respectively, related to the resolution of certain prior years’ items. The tax rate for 2015 also includes an expense of $75 million related to the impact of the nondeductible portion of a goodwill impairment charge. In addition, the decrease in tax rates in each period reflects the level of pretax income in relation to recurring permanent tax benefits and the geographic mix of business. 41 Table of Contents TABLE 5: SELECTED CARD-RELATED STATISTICAL INFORMATION Change Change Years Ended December 31, 2017 2016 2015 2017 vs. 2016 2016 vs. 2015 Card billed business: (billions) United States $ 708.3 $ 700.4 $ 721.8 1 % (3 )% Outside the United States 376.9 337.1 317.9 12 6 Worldwide $ 1,085.2 $ 1,037.5 $ 1,039.7 5 ― Proprietary $ 900.6 $ 863.8 $ 875.3 4 % (1 )% Global Network Services 184.6 173.7 164.4 6 6 Worldwide $ 1,085.2 $ 1,037.5 $ 1,039.7 5 ― Total cards-in-force: (millions) United States 50.0 47.5 57.6 5 (18 ) Outside the United States 62.8 62.4 60.2 1 4 Worldwide 112.8 109.9 117.8 3 (7 ) Proprietary 64.6 61.3 70.4 5 (13 ) Global Network Services 48.2 48.6 47.4 (1 ) 3 Worldwide 112.8 109.9 117.8 3 (7 ) Basic cards-in-force: (millions) United States 39.4 37.4 44.8 5 (17 ) Outside the United States 52.2 51.7 49.5 1 4 Worldwide 91.6 89.1 94.3 3 (6 ) Average basic Card Member spending: (dollars)(a) United States $ 20,317 $ 18,808 $ 18,066 8 4 Outside the United States $ 14,277 $ 13,073 $ 12,971 9 1 Worldwide Average $ 18,519 $ 17,216 $ 16,743 8 3 Card Member loans: (billions) United States $ 64.5 $ 58.3 $ 51.5 11 13 Outside the United States 8.9 7.0 7.1 27 (1 ) Worldwide $ 73.4 $ 65.3 $ 58.6 12 11 Average discount rate 2.43 % 2.45 % 2.46 % Average fee per card (dollars)(a) $ 49 $ 44 $ 39 11 % 13 % (a) Average basic Card Member spending and average fee per card are computed from proprietary card activities only.

(d) 2016 included reserves associated with Card Member loans reclassified from HFS to held for investment. Refer to Changes in Card Member loans reserve for losses under Note 4 to the “Consolidated Financial Statements” for additional information. (e) We present a net write-off rate based on principal losses only (i.e., excluding interest and/or fees) to be consistent with industry convention. In addition, because we consider uncollectible interest and/or fees in our reserves for credit losses, a net write-off rate including principal, interest and/or fees is also presented. The net write-off rates and 30+ days past due as a percentage of total for Card Member receivables relate to USCS, ICNS and Global Small Business Services (GSBS) Card Member receivables. The twelve months ended December 31, 2015 reflect the impact of a change in the timing of charge-offs for Card Member loans and receivables in certain modification programs from 180 days past due to 120 days past due. (f) 2015 included the impact of the transfer of the HFS receivables portfolio, which was not significant. 44 Table of Contents TABLE 8: NET INTEREST YIELD ON AVERAGE CARD MEMBER LOANS Years Ended December 31, (Millions, except percentages and where indicated) 2017 2016 2015 Net interest income $ 6,441 $ 5,771 $ 5,922 Exclude: Interest expense not attributable to our Card Member loan portfolio (a) 1,170 984 952 Interest income not attributable to our Card Member loan portfolio (b) (636 ) (403 ) (357 ) Adjusted net interest income (c) $ 6,975 $ 6,352 $ 6,517 Average Card Member loans including HFS loan portfolios (billions)(d) $ 66.7 $ 65.8 $ 69.0 Net interest income divided by average Card Member loans 9.7 % 8.8 % 8.6 % Net interest yield on average Card Member loans (c) 10.5 % 9.6 % 9.4 % (a) Primarily represents interest expense attributable to maintaining our corporate liquidity pool and funding Card Member receivables. (b) Primarily represents interest income attributable to Other loans, interest-bearing deposits and our Travelers Cheque and other stored-value investment portfolio. (c) Adjusted net interest income and net interest yield on average Card Member loans are non-GAAP measures. Refer to “Glossary of Selected Terminology” for the definitions of these terms. We believe adjusted net interest income is useful to investors because it represents the interest expense and interest income attributable to our Card Member loan portfolio and is a component of net interest yield on average Card Member loans, which provides a measure of profitability of our Card Member loan portfolio. Net interest yield on average Card Member loans reflects adjusted net interest income divided by average Card Member loans, computed on an annualized basis. Net interest income divided by average Card Member loans, computed on an annualized basis, a GAAP measure, includes elements of total interest income and total interest expense that are not attributable to the Card Member loan portfolio, and thus is not representative of net interest yield on average Card Member loans. (d) Beginning December 1, 2015 through to the sale completion dates, for the purposes of the calculation of net interest yield on average Card Member loans, average Card Member loans included the HFS loan portfolios. 45 Table of Contents BUSINESS SEGMENT RESULTS We consider a combination of factors when evaluating the composition of our reportable operating segments, including the results reviewed by the chief operating decision maker, economic characteristics, products and services offered, classes of customers, product distribution channels, geographic considerations (primarily United States versus outside the United States) and regulatory considerations. Effective for the first quarter of 2016, we realigned our segment presentation to reflect the organizational changes announced during the fourth quarter of 2015. Prior periods have been restated to conform to the new reportable operating segments. Refer to Note 25 to the “Consolidated Financial Statements” for additional discussion of products and services that comprise each segment. Results of the business segments generally treat each segment as a stand-alone business. The management reporting process that derives these results allocates revenue and expense using various methodologies as described below. TOTAL REVENUES NET OF INTEREST EXPENSE We allocate discount revenue and certain other revenues among segments using a transfer pricing methodology. Within the USCS, ICNS and GCS segments, discount revenue generally reflects the issuer component of the overall discount revenue generated by each segment’s Card Members; within the GMS segment, discount revenue generally reflects the network and acquirer component of the overall discount revenue. Net card fees and other fees and commissions are directly attributable to the segment in which they are reported. Interest and fees on loans and certain investment income is directly attributable to the segment in which it is reported. Interest expense represents an allocated funding cost based on a combination of segment funding requirements and internal funding rates. PROVISIONS FOR LOSSES The provisions for losses are directly attributable to the segment in which they are reported. EXPENSES Marketing and promotion expense is included in each segment based on the actual expenses incurred. Global brand advertising is primarily reflected in Corporate & Other and may be allocated to the segments based on the actual expense incurred. Rewards and Card Member services expense is included in each segment based on the actual expenses incurred within the segment. Salaries and employee benefits and other operating expense reflects expenses such as professional services, occupancy and equipment and communications incurred directly within each segment. In addition, expenses related to support services, such as technology costs, are allocated to each segment primarily based on support service activities directly attributable to the segment. Other overhead expenses, such as staff group support functions, are allocated from Corporate & Other to the other segments based on a mix of each segment’s direct consumption of services and relative level of pretax income. INCOME TAXES An income tax provision (benefit) is allocated to each business segment based on the effective tax rates applicable to the various businesses that comprise the segment. The previously-mentioned $2.6 billion charge related to the Tax Act has been allocated in full to Corporate & Other. 46 Table of Contents U.S. CONSUMER SERVICES TABLE 9: USCS SELECTED INCOME STATEMENT DATA Years Ended December 31, Change Change (Millions, except percentages) 2017 2016 2015 2017 vs. 2016 2016 vs. 2015 Revenues Non-interest revenues $ 7,923 $ 7,874 $ 8,479 $ 49 1 % $ (605 ) (7 )% Interest income 5,755 5,082 5,198 673 13 (116 ) (2 ) Interest expense 742 536 488 206 38 48 10 Net interest income 5,013 4,546 4,710 467 10 (164 ) (3 ) Total revenues net of interest expense 12,936 12,420 13,189 516 4 (769 ) (6 ) Provisions for losses 1,630 1,065 1,064 565 53 1 ― Total revenues net of interest expense after provisions for losses 11,306 11,355 12,125 (49 ) ― (770 ) (6 ) Expenses Marketing, promotion, rewards, Card Member services and other 5,695 5,416 5,382 279 5 34 1 Salaries and employee benefits and other operating expenses 2,808 2,058 3,066 750 36 (1,008 ) (33 ) Total expenses 8,503 7,474 8,448 1,029 14 (974 ) (12 ) Pretax segment income 2,803 3,881 3,677 (1,078 ) (28 ) 204 6 Income tax provision 912 1,368 1,322 (456 ) (33 ) 46 3 Segment income $ 1,891 $ 2,513 $ 2,355 $ (622 ) (25 )% $ 158 7 % Effective tax rate 32.5 % 35.2 % 36.0 % USCS issues a wide range of proprietary consumer cards and provides services to consumers in the United States, including travel services. TOTAL REVENUES NET OF INTEREST EXPENSE Non-interest revenues was relatively flat in 2017 compared to 2016, primarily driven by a decrease in discount revenue, offset by increases in net card fees and other fees and commissions. Discount revenue decreased $133 million, reflecting a decrease in billed business of 2 percent due to Costco-related volumes included in the prior year. Net card fees and other fees and commissions increased driven by growth in the Platinum and Delta portfolios and higher delinquency fees, respectively. Net interest income increased in 2017 compared to 2016, primarily driven by growth in average Card Member loans and higher yields, partially offset by higher interest expense, primarily driven by marginally higher cost of funds. The growth in average Card Member loans was primarily driven by a mix shift over time towards non-cobrand lending products, where Card Members tend to revolve more of their loan balances. The increase in yields was primarily driven by a greater percentage of loans at higher rate buckets, specific pricing actions, and increases in benchmark interest rates. Total revenues net of interest expense decreased in 2016 compared to 2015, primarily driven by lower discount revenue, reflecting a decrease in billed business of 7 percent primarily driven by lower Costco-related volumes and increases in contra-discount revenues, such as cash rebate rewards. The decrease also reflected lower net interest income, primarily driven by lower Costco cobrand loans and higher interest expense, partially offset by modestly higher average rates and an increase in average Card Member loans across other lending products. PROVISIONS FOR LOSSES Provisions for losses increased in 2017 compared to 2016, primarily driven by Card Member loans provision, which increased $514 million due to strong loan growth, as well as increases in delinquencies and higher net write-off rates primarily due to the seasoning of recent loan vintages and a shift in mix over time towards non-cobrand lending products, which tend to have higher write-off rates. Provisions for losses was relatively flat in 2016 compared to 2015. Card Member loans provision increased $16 million primarily driven by higher loan balances, increased net write-offs and a slight increase in delinquencies, partially offset by the impact of the HFS portfolios as 2016 did not reflect the associated credit costs. Refer to Table 10 for the charge card and lending write-off rates for 2017, 2016 and 2015. 47 Table of Contents EXPENSES Marketing, promotion, rewards, Card Member services and other expenses increased in 2017 compared to 2016, reflecting higher Card Member rewards and Card Member services and other expenses, partially offset by lower marketing and promotion expenses. Card Member rewards expense increased $218 million, primarily driven by enhancements to Platinum rewards and increased spending volumes, partially offset by Costco-related expenses in the prior year. Card Member services and other expense increased $173 million driven by higher usage of travel-related benefits and enhanced Platinum card benefits. Marketing and promotion expenses decreased $112 million due to lower spending on growth initiatives. Salaries and employee benefits and other operating expense increased in 2017 compared to 2016, primarily reflecting the gains on the sales of the HFS portfolios in the prior year, which were recognized as an expense reduction in other expenses, partially offset by lower technology and other servicing-related costs in the current year and restructuring charges in the prior year. Total expenses decreased in 2016 compared to 2015, primarily driven by lower salaries and employee benefits and other operating expenses, largely reflecting the gains on the sales of the HFS portfolios as previously mentioned. Income tax provision decreased in 2017 compared to 2016, primarily reflecting the impact of recurring permanent tax benefits on the lower level of pretax income.

It also provides travel services outside the United States. TOTAL REVENUES NET OF INTEREST EXPENSE Non-interest revenues increased in 2017 compared to 2016, primarily driven by higher discount revenue due to an increase in both proprietary and non-proprietary (i.e., GNS) billed business, as well as higher net card fees, partially offset by a prior-year contractual payment from a GNS partner. Total billed business increased in 2017 compared to 2016, reflecting higher average proprietary spend per card. Refer to Tables 6 and 12 for additional information on billed business. Net interest income increased in 2017 compared to 2016, primarily driven by an increase in interest income, reflecting higher average loan balances and higher yields, partially offset by an increase in interest expense driven by higher average debt. Total revenues net of interest expense increased in 2016 compared to 2015, primarily driven by higher discount revenue due to an increase in both proprietary and non-proprietary billed business, a contractual payment from a GNS partner, as previously mentioned, and higher net card fees. PROVISIONS FOR LOSSES Provisions for losses increased in 2017 compared to 2016, due to strong growth in both Card Member receivables and loans, as well as a slight increase in net write-off rates. Provisions for losses increased in 2016 compared to 2015, driven primarily by higher net write-off rates. Refer to Table 12 for Card Member loans and receivables write-off rates for 2017, 2016 and 2015. EXPENSES Marketing, promotion, rewards, Card Member services and other expenses increased in 2017 compared to 2016, primarily driven by higher Card Member rewards expense due to higher spending volumes, partially offset by lower marketing and promotion expenses in part due to lower spending on growth initiatives. Salaries and employee benefits and other operating expense decreased in 2017 compared to 2016, primarily driven by lower salaries and employee benefits costs, and restructuring charges in the prior year. Total expenses increased in 2016 compared to 2015, primarily driven by higher levels of spending on growth initiatives. Income tax provision increased in 2017 compared to 2016 and decreased in 2016 compared to 2015. The effective tax rate in all periods reflects the impact of recurring permanent tax benefits both in relation to the segment's ongoing funding activities outside the United States, which is allocated to ICNS under our internal tax allocation process, and on varying levels of pretax income. In addition, the effective tax rates for all periods reflect the allocated share of tax benefits related to the resolution of certain prior-years’ items. 49 Table of Contents TABLE 12: ICNS SELECTED STATISTICAL INFORMATION As of or for the Years Ended December 31, Change Change (Millions, except percentages and where indicated) 2017 2016 2015 2017 vs. 2016 2016 vs. 2015 Card billed business (billions) Proprietary $ 119.7 $ 105.9 $ 102.1 13 % 4 % GNS 184.6 173.7 164.4 6 6 Total $ 304.3 $ 279.6 $ 266.5 9 5 Total cards-in-force Proprietary 15.7 15.0 14.6 5 3 GNS 48.2 48.6 47.4 (1 ) 3 Total 63.9 63.6 62.0 ― 3 Proprietary basic cards-in-force 10.8 10.3 9.9 5 4 Average proprietary basic Card Member spending (dollars) $ 11,225 $ 10,386 $ 10,308 8 1 Total segment assets (billions) $ 38.9 $ 35.7 $ 35.1 9 2 Card Member loans:(a) Total loans (billions) $ 8.7 $ 7.0 $ 7.1 24 (1 ) Average loans (billions) $ 7.4 $ 6.8 $ 7.0 9 % (3 )% Net write-off rate ― principal only (b) 2.1 % 2.0 % 1.9 % Net write-off rate ― principal, interest and fees (b) 2.5 % 2.5 % 2.4 % 30+ days past due loans as a % of total 1.4 % 1.6 % 1.6 % Calculation of Net Interest Yield on Average Card Member Loans: Net interest income $ 778 $ 703 $ 710 Exclude: Interest expense not attributable to our Card Member loan portfolio(c) 61 44 56 Interest income not attributable to our Card Member loan portfolio(d) (13 ) (7 ) (18 ) Adjusted net interest income (e) $ 826 $ 740 $ 748 Average Card Member loans (billions) $ 7.4 $ 6.8 $ 7.0 Net interest income divided by average Card Member loans 10.5 % 10.3 % 10.1 % Net interest yield on average Card Member loans (e) 11.1 % 10.9 % 10.6 % Card Member receivables:(a) Total receivables (billions) $ 7.8 $ 6.0 $ 5.6 30 % 7 % Net write-off rate ― principal only (b) 2.0 % 2.0 % 2.1 % Net write-off rate ― principal and fees (b) 2.1 % 2.2 % 2.3 % 30+ days past due as a % of total 1.3 % 1.3 % 1.5 % (a) Refer to Table 7 footnote (a).

TOTAL REVENUES NET OF INTEREST EXPENSE Non-interest revenues increased in 2017 compared to 2016, primarily driven by higher discount revenue due to increases in billed business, partially offset by increased contra-discount revenue driven by higher client incentives due to higher volumes. The increase in non-interest revenues was also driven by higher net card fees and higher other fees and commissions, primarily due to growth in the U.S. small business Platinum portfolio and higher delinquency fees, respectively. Net interest income increased in 2017 compared to 2016, primarily driven by an increase in average Card Member loans and higher yields, partially offset by higher interest expense, reflecting an increase in the cost of funds. Total revenues net of interest expense were relatively flat in 2016 compared to 2015, reflecting lower Costco-related revenues. PROVISIONS FOR LOSSES Provisions for losses increased in both periods. The increase in 2017 compared to 2016 was primarily due to growth in both Card Member receivables and loans, as well as increases in net write-off and delinquency rates, all of which were partially offset by improving credit performance in the commercial financing portfolio. The increase in 2016 compared to 2015 was primarily driven by growth in the commercial financing portfolio, resulting in higher net write-offs. EXPENSES Marketing, promotion, rewards, Card Member services and other expenses increased in 2017 compared to 2016, primarily driven by higher Card Member rewards expenses, which increased $420 million, partially offset by lower marketing and promotion expenses as a result of reduced levels of spending on growth initiatives. The higher Card Member rewards expenses were primarily driven by enhancements to Platinum rewards and higher spending volumes, partially offset by Costco-related expenses in the prior year. Salaries and employee benefits and other operating expense decreased in 2017 compared to 2016, primarily driven by lower technology and other servicing-related costs in the current year and the prior-year HFS valuation allowance adjustment and restructuring charges, all of which were partially offset by the prior-year gains on the sales of the HFS portfolios. Total expenses increased in 2016 compared to 2015, primarily driven by increased marketing and promotion expense as a result of higher levels of spending on growth initiatives, higher Card Member rewards expenses resulting from higher spending volumes and the gains on the sales of the HFS portfolios, partially offset by lower Costco-related rewards expenses and restructuring charges. Income tax provision decreased in 2017 compared to 2016, primarily reflecting the geographic mix of business and the allocated share of tax benefits related to the realization of certain foreign tax credits. 51 Table of Contents TABLE 14: GCS SELECTED STATISTICAL INFORMATION As of or for the Years Ended December 31, Change Change (Millions, except percentages and where indicated) 2017 2016 2015 2017 vs. 2016 2016 vs. 2015 Card billed business (billions) $ 438.1 $ 408.0 $ 398.6 7 % 2 % Total cards-in-force 14.0 13.6 15.1 3 (10 ) Basic cards-in-force 14.0 13.6 15.1 3 (10 ) Average basic Card Member spending (dollars) $ 31,729 $ 28,515 $ 26,860 11 6 Total segment assets (billions) $ 52.6 $ 46.5 $ 45.1 13 3 Card Member loans (billions) $ 11.1 $ 9.5 $ 8.0 17 19 Card Member receivables (billions) $ 33.1 $ 29.0 $ 26.7 14 9 Card Member loans:(a) Total loans - GSBS (billions) $ 11.0 $ 9.5 $ 8.0 16 19 Average loans - GSBS (billions) $ 10.3 $ 8.6 $ 9.7 20 % (11 )% Net write-off rate (principal only) - GSBS(b) 1.6 % 1.4 % 1.3 % Net write-off rate (principal, interest and fees) - GSBS(b) 1.9 % 1.7 % 1.5 % 30+ days past due as a % of total - GSBS 1.2 % 1.1 % 1.1 % Calculation of Net Interest Yield on Average Card Member Loans: Net interest income $ 821 $ 809 $ 810 Exclude: Interest expense not attributable to our Card Member loan portfolio(c) 409 312 286 Interest income not attributable to our Card Member loan portfolio (d) (113 ) (111 ) (94 ) Adjusted net interest income(e) $ 1,117 $ 1,010 $ 1,002 Average Card Member loans including HFS loan portfolios (billions)(f) $ 10.3 $ 9.7 $ 9.9 Net interest income divided by average Card Member loans 8.0 % 8.3 % 8.2 % Net interest yield on average Card Member loans(e) 10.8 % 10.4 % 10.1 % Card Member receivables:(a) Total receivables - GCP (billions) $ 17.0 $ 14.8 $ 13.8 15 % 7 % 90 days past billing as a % of total - GCP(g) 0.9 % 0.9 % 0.9 % Net loss ratio (as a % of charge volume) - GCP 0.10 % 0.09 % 0.09 % Total receivables - GSBS (billions) $ 16.1 $ 14.3 $ 12.9 13 % 11 % Net write-off rate (principal only) - GSBS(b) 1.6 % 1.5 % 1.8 % Net write-off rate (principal, interest and fees) - GSBS(b) 1.8 % 1.7 % 2.1 % 30+ days past due as a % of total - GSBS 1.6 % 1.6 % 1.7 % (a) Refer to Table 7 footnote (a).

GMS acquires merchants and provides multi-channel marketing programs and capabilities, services and data analytics, leveraging our global integrated network. GMS also operates loyalty coalition businesses in certain countries around the world. TOTAL REVENUES NET OF INTEREST EXPENSE Non-interest revenues increased in 2017 compared to 2016, primarily driven by an increase in discount revenue, which reflected growth in billed business, and an increase in loyalty coalition revenues, partially offset by Costco-related revenues in the prior year. Net interest income increased in 2017 compared to 2016, reflecting a higher interest expense credit relating to internal transfer pricing and funding rates, which resulted in a net benefit for GMS due to its merchant payables. Total revenues net of interest expense decreased in 2016 compared to 2015, primarily due to a decrease in non-interest revenues as a result of lower Costco-related revenues. PROVISIONS FOR LOSSES Provisions for losses decreased in both periods of comparison, primarily driven by lower net write-offs. EXPENSES Marketing, promotion, rewards, Card Member services and other expenses decreased in 2017 compared to 2016, reflecting lower levels of spending on growth initiatives. Salaries and employee benefits and other operating expense increased in 2017 compared to 2016, primarily driven by charges related to the U.S. loyalty coalition business, partially offset by a benefit from a change in the liability related to non-delivery of goods and services by merchants and continued growth of the OptBlue program, which does not entail merchant acquirer payments. Total expenses decreased in 2016 compared to 2015, primarily driven by lower marketing and promotion expenses and lower operating expenses driven by the growth of the OptBlue program as described above. Income tax provision decreased in 2017 compared to 2016, primarily reflecting the allocated share of tax benefits related to the realization of certain foreign tax credits.

Corporate & Other net expense was $3.7 billion, $1.1 billion and $1.4 billion in 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively. The increase in 2017 compared to 2016 was primarily driven by the previously-mentioned Tax Act charge, partially offset by higher restructuring charges in the prior year. The decrease in 2016 compared to 2015 was primarily driven by impairment charges in 2015 and higher income from our Prepaid Services business in 2016, all partially offset by restructuring charges in 2016 and a benefit in 2015 from the reassessment of the functional currency of certain UK legal entities and other FX-related activity. Results for all periods included net interest expense related to maintaining the liquidity requirements discussed in “Consolidated Capital Resources and Liquidity – Liquidity Management,” as well as interest expense related to other corporate indebtedness. 54 Table of Contents CONSOLIDATED CAPITAL RESOURCES AND LIQUIDITY Our balance sheet management objectives are to maintain: • A solid and flexible equity capital profile; • A broad, deep and diverse set of funding sources to finance our assets and meet operating requirements; and • Liquidity programs that enable us to continuously meet expected future financing obligations and business requirements for at least a twelve-month period, even in the event we are unable to continue to raise new funds under our traditional funding programs during a substantial weakening in economic conditions. CAPITAL STRATEGY Our objective is to retain sufficient levels of capital generated through earnings and other sources to maintain a solid equity capital base and to provide flexibility to support future business growth. We believe capital allocated to growing businesses with a return on risk-adjusted equity in excess of our costs will generate shareholder value. The level and composition of our consolidated capital position are determined through our Internal Capital Adequacy Assessment Process, which takes into account our business activities, as well as marketplace conditions and requirements or expectations of credit rating agencies, regulators and shareholders, among others. Our consolidated capital position is also influenced by subsidiary capital requirements. As a bank holding company, we are also subject to regulatory requirements administered by the U.S. federal banking agencies. The Federal Reserve has established specific capital adequacy guidelines that involve quantitative measures of assets, liabilities and certain off-balance sheet items. We report our capital ratios using the Basel III capital definitions, inclusive of transition provisions, and the Basel III standardized approach for calculating risk-weighted assets (see section on Transitional Basel III). The Basel III standards will be fully phased in by January 1, 2019 (see section on Fully Phased-in Basel III). We also report capital adequacy standards on a parallel basis to regulators under Basel requirements for advanced approaches institutions. The parallel period will continue until we receive regulatory approval to exit parallel reporting, at which point we will begin publicly disclosing regulatory risk-based capital ratios using both the standardized and advanced approaches, and will be required to use the lower of the regulatory risk-based capital ratios based on the standardized or advanced approaches to determine whether we are in compliance with minimum capital requirements. 55 Table of Contents The following table presents our regulatory risk-based capital ratios and leverage ratios and those of our significant bank subsidiaries, American Express Centurion Bank (Centurion Bank) and American Express Bank, FSB (American Express Bank), as of December 31, 2017.

TABLE 18: REGULATORY RISK-BASED CAPITAL COMPONENTS AND RISK-WEIGHTED ASSETS American Express Company ($ in Billions) December 31, 2017 Risk-Based Capital Common Equity Tier 1 $ 13.2 Tier 1 Capital 14.7 Tier 2 Capital(a) 2.4 Total Capital 17.1 Risk-Weighted Assets 145.9 Average Total Assets to calculate the Tier 1 Leverage Ratio 171.2 Total Leverage Exposure to calculate SLR $ 198.8 (a) Tier 2 capital is the sum of the allowance for loan and receivable losses (limited to 1.25 percent of risk-weighted assets) and $600 million of subordinated notes adjusted for capital held by insurance subsidiaries. We seek to maintain capital levels and ratios in excess of the minimum regulatory requirements and finance such capital in a cost efficient manner; failure to maintain minimum capital levels could affect our status as a financial holding company and cause the regulatory agencies with oversight of American Express, Centurion Bank and American Express Bank to take actions that could limit our business operations. Due to the Tax Act impact of $2.6 billion, we reported a net loss in the fourth quarter. The net loss, combined with growth in the balance sheet and continued capital return in the quarter, resulted in a decline in our Common Equity Tier 1 Risk-Based Capital ratio to 9.0 percent, which is below the level we had projected in the 2017 CCAR process. As a result, we have suspended our share repurchase program for the first half of 2018 in order to rebuild our capital levels. Our primary source of equity capital has been the generation of net income. Capital generated through net income and other sources, such as the exercise of stock options by employees, is used to maintain a strong balance sheet, support asset growth and engage in acquisitions, with excess available for distribution to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. We currently expect that the portion of generated capital we allocate to support asset growth will be greater going forward than it has been historically due to projected asset growth. 56 Table of Contents We maintain certain flexibility to shift capital across our businesses as appropriate. For example, we may infuse additional capital into subsidiaries to maintain capital at targeted levels in consideration of debt ratings and regulatory requirements. These infused amounts can affect the capital profile and liquidity levels at the American Express parent company level. The following are definitions for our regulatory risk-based capital ratios and leverage ratio, which are calculated as per standard regulatory guidance: Risk-Weighted Assets — Assets are weighted for risk according to a formula used by the Federal Reserve to conform to capital adequacy guidelines. On- and off-balance sheet items are weighted for risk, with off-balance sheet items converted to balance sheet equivalents, using risk conversion factors, before being allocated a risk-adjusted weight. Off-balance sheet exposures comprise a minimal part of the total risk-weighted assets. Common Equity Tier 1 Risk-Based Capital Ratio — Calculated as Common Equity Tier 1 capital (CET1), divided by risk-weighted assets. CET1 is the sum of common shareholders’ equity, adjusted for ineligible goodwill and intangible assets, certain deferred tax assets, as well as certain other comprehensive income items as follows: net unrealized gains/losses on securities and derivatives, and net unrealized pension and other postretirement benefit/losses, all net of tax and subject to transition provisions. Tier 1 Risk-Based Capital Ratio — Calculated as Tier 1 capital divided by risk-weighted assets. Tier 1 capital is the sum of CET1, our perpetual preferred stock and third-party non-controlling interests in consolidated subsidiaries adjusted for capital held by insurance subsidiaries and deferred tax assets from net operating losses not deducted from CET1. The minimum requirement for the Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio is 1.5 percent higher than the minimum for the CET1 risk-based capital ratio. We have $1.6 billion of preferred shares outstanding to help address a portion of the Tier 1 capital requirements in excess of common equity requirements. Total Risk-Based Capital Ratio — Calculated as the sum of Tier 1 capital and Tier 2 capital, divided by risk-weighted assets. Tier 2 capital is the sum of the allowance for loan and receivable losses (limited to 1.25 percent of risk-weighted assets), a portion of the unrealized gains on equity securities and $600 million of subordinated notes, adjusted for capital held by insurance subsidiaries. Tier 1 Leverage Ratio — Calculated by dividing Tier 1 capital by our average total consolidated assets for the most recent quarter. Supplementary Leverage Ratio — Calculated by dividing Tier 1 capital by total leverage exposure under Basel III. Leverage exposure, which reflects average total consolidated assets with adjustments for Tier 1 capital deductions, average off-balance sheet derivatives exposures, securities purchased under agreements to resell and credit equivalents of undrawn commitments that are both conditionally and unconditionally cancellable. FULLY PHASED-IN BASEL III Basel III, when fully phased in, will require bank holding companies and their bank subsidiaries to maintain more capital than prior requirements, with a greater emphasis on common equity. The following table presents our estimates for our regulatory risk-based capital ratios and leverage ratios had Basel III been fully phased in as of December 31, 2017. These ratios are calculated using the standardized approach for determining risk-weighted assets. As noted previously, we are currently taking steps toward Basel III advanced approaches implementation in the United States. We believe the presentation of these ratios is helpful to investors by showing the impact of future regulatory capital standards on our capital and leverage ratios.

Refer to Table 20 for a reconciliation of Common Equity Tier 1 and Tier 1 capital under Fully Phased-in Basel III rules to Common Equity Tier 1 and Tier 1 capital under Transitional Basel III rules. (b) The Fully Phased-in Basel III Tier 1 and SLRs, non-GAAP measures, are calculated by dividing Fully Phased-in Basel III Tier 1 capital by our average total assets and Fully Phased-in total leverage exposure for SLR purposes under Fully Phased-in Basel III, respectively. (c) Estimated Fully Phased-in Basel III risk-weighted assets, a non-GAAP measure, reflect our Basel III risk-weighted assets, with all transition provisions fully phased in. This includes incremental risk weighting applied to deferred tax assets and significant investments in unconsolidated financial institutions, as well as exposures to past due accounts, equities and sovereigns. (d) Estimated Fully Phased-in Basel III Leverage Exposure, a non-GAAP measure, reflects average total consolidated assets with adjustments for Tier 1 capital deductions on a fully phased-in basis, off-balance sheet derivatives, undrawn conditionally and unconditionally cancellable commitments and other off-balance sheet liabilities. 57 Table of Contents The following table presents a comparison of our CET1 and Tier 1 risk-based capital under Transitional Basel III rules to our estimated CET1 and Tier 1 risk-based capital under Fully Phased-in Basel III rules as of December 31, 2017.

Fully Phased-in Basel III SLR — Calculated by dividing Fully Phased-in Basel III Tier 1 capital by our Fully Phased-in total leverage exposure for SLR purposes under Fully Phased-in Basel III. SHARE REPURCHASES AND DIVIDENDS We return capital to common shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. The share repurchases reduce common shares outstanding and more than offset the issuance of new shares as part of employee compensation plans. During the year ended December 31, 2017, we returned $5.5 billion to our shareholders in the form of common stock dividends of $1.2 billion and share repurchases of $4.3 billion. We repurchased 50 million common shares at an average price of $85.56 in 2017. These dividend and share repurchase amounts collectively represent approximately 190 percent of total capital generated during the year. As previously mentioned, we decided to suspend our share buyback program for the first half of 2018 in order to rebuild our capital levels and ratios. We intend to continue our quarterly dividends during the first half of 2018 at the current level. Authorization for share repurchases beginning in the second half of 2018 must be submitted as part of our capital plan within the CCAR 2018 process. In addition, during the year ended December 31, 2017, we had $750 million of non-cumulative perpetual preferred shares (the Series B Preferred Shares) and $850 million of non-cumulative perpetual preferred shares (the Series C Preferred Shares) outstanding. Dividends declared and paid on Series B and Series C Preferred Shares during 2017 were $39 million and $42 million, respectively. For additional information on our preferred shares, refer to Note 17 “Common and Preferred Shares” and Note 22 “Earnings per Common Share (EPS); Preferred Shares” to the “Consolidated Financial Statements.” FUNDING STRATEGY Our principal funding objective is to maintain broad and well-diversified funding sources to allow us to meet our maturing obligations, cost-effectively finance current and future asset growth in our global businesses as well as to maintain a strong liquidity profile. The diversity of funding sources by type of instrument, by maturity and by investor base, among other factors, provides additional insulation from the impact of disruptions in any one type of instrument, maturity or investor. The mix of our funding in any period will seek to achieve cost efficiency consistent with both maintaining diversified sources and achieving our liquidity objectives. Our funding strategy and activities are integrated into our asset-liability management activities. We have in place a funding policy covering American Express Company and all of our subsidiaries. Our proprietary card businesses are the primary asset-generating businesses, with significant assets in both domestic and international Card Member lending and receivable activities. Our financing needs are in large part a consequence of our proprietary card-issuing businesses, and the maintenance of a liquidity position to support all of our business activities, such as merchant payments. We generally pay merchants for card transactions prior to reimbursement by Card Members and therefore fund the merchant payments during the period Card Member loans and receivables are outstanding. We also have additional financing needs associated with general corporate purposes. FUNDING PROGRAMS AND ACTIVITIES We meet our funding needs through a variety of sources, including direct and third-party distributed deposits and debt instruments, such as senior unsecured debentures, asset securitizations, borrowings through secured borrowing facilities and a long-term committed bank borrowing facility. 58 Table of Contents We had the following consolidated debt and customer deposits outstanding as of December 31: TABLE 21: SUMMARY OF CONSOLIDATED DEBT AND CUSTOMER DEPOSITS (Billions) 2017 2016 Short-term borrowings $ 3.3 $ 5.6 Long-term debt 55.8 47.0 Total debt 59.1 52.6 Customer deposits 64.5 53.0 Total debt and customer deposits $ 123.6 $ 105.6 Our funding plan for the full year 2018 includes, among other sources, approximately $6 billion to $13 billion of unsecured term debt issuance and approximately $5 billion to $12 billion of secured term debt issuance. Our funding plans are subject to various risks and uncertainties, such as future business growth, the impact of global economic, political and other events on market capacity, demand for securities offered by us, regulatory changes, ability to securitize and sell receivables, and the performance of receivables previously sold in securitization transactions. Many of these risks and uncertainties are beyond our control. Our equity capital and funding strategies are designed, among other things, to maintain appropriate and stable unsecured debt ratings from the major credit rating agencies: Moody’s Investor Services (Moody’s), Standard & Poor’s (S&P), Fitch Ratings (Fitch) and Dominion Bond Rating Services (DBRS). Such ratings help support our access to cost-effective unsecured funding as part of our overall funding strategy. Our asset securitization activities are rated separately. TABLE 22: UNSECURED DEBT RATINGS Credit Agency American Express Entity Short-Term Ratings Long-Term Ratings Outlook DBRS All rated entities R-1 (middle) A (high) Stable Fitch All rated entities F1 A Stable Moody’s TRS and rated operating subsidiaries(a) Prime 1 A2 Stable Moody's American Express Company Prime 2 A3 Stable S&P TRS(a) N/A A- Stable S&P Other rated operating subsidiaries A-2 A- Stable S&P American Express Company A-2 BBB+ Stable (a) American Express Travel Related Services Company, Inc. Downgrades in the ratings of our unsecured debt or asset securitization program securities could result in higher funding costs, as well as higher fees related to borrowings under our unused lines of credit. Declines in credit ratings could also reduce our borrowing capacity in the unsecured debt and asset securitization capital markets. We believe our funding mix, including the proportion of U.S. retail deposits insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC), should reduce the impact that credit rating downgrades would have on our funding capacity and costs. SHORT-TERM FUNDING PROGRAMS Short-term borrowings, such as commercial paper, are defined as any debt with an original maturity of twelve months or less, as well as interest-bearing overdrafts with banks. Our short-term funding programs are used primarily to meet working capital needs, such as managing seasonal variations in receivables balances. The amount of short-term borrowings issued in the future will depend on our funding strategy, our needs and market conditions. As of December 31, 2017, we had $1.2 billion in commercial paper outstanding and we had an average of $1.1 billion in commercial paper outstanding during 2017. Refer to Note 9 to the “Consolidated Financial Statements” for a further description of these borrowings. DEPOSIT PROGRAMS We offer deposits within our Centurion Bank and American Express Bank subsidiaries. These funds are currently insured up to $250,000 per account holder through the FDIC. Our ability to obtain deposit funding and offer competitive interest rates is dependent on the capital levels of Centurion Bank and American Express Bank. We, through American Express Bank, have a direct retail deposit program, Personal Savings from American Express, which is our primary deposit product channel. The direct retail program makes FDIC-insured certificates of deposit (CDs) and high-yield savings account products available directly to consumers. We also source deposits through third-party distribution channels as needed to meet our overall funding objectives. As of December 31, 2017 we had $64.5 billion in customer deposits. Refer to Note 8 to the “Consolidated Financial Statements” for a further description of these deposits. LONG-TERM DEBT PROGRAMS As of December 31, 2017 we had $55.8 billion in long-term debt outstanding. During 2017, we and our subsidiaries issued $24.5 billion of unsecured debt and asset-backed securities with maturities ranging from 2 to 10 years. Refer to Note 9 to the “Consolidated Financial Statements” for a further description of these borrowings. 59 Table of Contents ASSET SECURITIZATION PROGRAMS We periodically securitize Card Member loans and receivables arising from our card business, as the securitization market provides us with cost-effective funding. Securitization of Card Member loans and receivables is accomplished through the transfer of those assets to a trust, which in turn issues securities collateralized by the transferred assets to third-party investors. The proceeds from issuance are distributed to us, through our wholly-owned subsidiaries, as consideration for the transferred assets. Refer to Note 6 to the “Consolidated Financial Statements” for a further description of these borrowings. Our 2017 long-term debt and asset securitization issuances were as follows: TABLE 23: DEBT ISSUANCES (Billions) 2017 American Express Company: Fixed Rate Senior Notes (weighted-average coupon of 2.58%) $ 5.0 Floating Rate Senior Notes (3-month LIBOR plus 45 basis points) 0.9 American Express Credit Corporation: Fixed Rate Senior Notes (weighted-average coupon of 2.56%) 7.3 Floating Rate Senior Notes (3-month LIBOR plus 45 basis points) 1.2 American Express Credit Account Master Trust: Fixed Rate Class A Certificates (weighted-average coupon of 1.90%) 8.1 Fixed Rate Class B Certificates (weighted-average coupon of 2.21%) 0.2 Floating Rate Class A Certificates (1-month LIBOR plus 33 basis points) 1.8 Floating Rate Class B Certificates (1-month LIBOR plus 41 basis points) - Total $ 24.5 LIQUIDITY MANAGEMENT We incur liquidity risk that arises in the course of offering our products and services. Our liquidity objective is to maintain access to a diverse set of on- and off-balance sheet liquidity sources. We seek to maintain liquidity sources, even in the event we are unable to raise new funds under our regular funding programs during a substantial weakening in economic conditions, in amounts sufficient to meet our expected future financial obligations and business requirements for liquidity for a period of at least twelve months. Our liquidity risk policy sets out our objectives and approach to managing liquidity risk. The liquidity risks that we are exposed to could arise from a wide variety of scenarios. Our liquidity management strategy thus includes a number of elements, including, but not limited to:  Maintaining diversified funding sources (refer to the “Funding Strategy” section for more details);  Maintaining unencumbered liquid assets and off-balance sheet liquidity sources;  Projecting cash inflows and outflows under a variety of economic and market scenarios;  Establishing clear objectives for liquidity risk management, including compliance with regulatory requirements; and  Incorporating liquidity risk management as appropriate into our capital adequacy framework. We seek to maintain access to a diverse set of on-balance sheet and off-balance sheet liquidity sources, including cash and other liquid assets, committed bank credit facilities and asset securitization conduit facilities. Through our U.S. bank subsidiaries, Centurion Bank and American Express Bank, we also hold collateral eligible for use at the Federal Reserve’s discount window. The amount and type of liquidity resources we maintain can vary over time, based upon the results of stress scenarios required under the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act and other various regulatory liquidity requirements, such as the Liquidity Coverage Ratio (LCR), as well as additional stress scenarios required under our liquidity risk policy. These stress scenarios possess distinct characteristics, varying by cash flow assumptions, time horizon and qualifying liquidity sources, among other factors. Scenarios under our liquidity risk policy include market-wide, firm-specific and combined liquidity stresses. The LCR rule prescribes cash flow assumptions over a 30-day period and establishes qualifying criteria for high-quality liquid assets. We consider other factors in determining the amount and type of liquidity we maintain, such as economic and financial market conditions, seasonality in business operations, growth in our businesses, potential acquisitions or dispositions, the cost and availability of alternative liquidity sources and credit rating agency guidelines and requirements. 60 Table of Contents The investment income we receive on liquidity resources, such as cash, is less than the interest expense on the sources of funding for these balances. The net interest costs to maintain these resources have been substantial. The level of future net interest costs depends on the amount of liquidity resources we maintain and the difference between our cost of funding these amounts and their investment yields. Securitized Borrowing Capacity As of December 31, 2017, we maintained our committed, revolving, secured borrowing facility, with a maturity date of July 15, 2020, which gives us the right to sell up to $3.0 billion face amount of eligible AAA notes from the American Express Issuance Trust II (the Charge Trust). We also maintained our committed, revolving, secured borrowing facility, with a maturity date of September 15, 2020, which gives us the right to sell up to $2.0 billion face amount of eligible AAA certificates from the American Express Credit Account Master Trust (the Lending Trust). Both facilities are used in the ordinary course of business to fund seasonal working capital needs, as well as to further enhance our contingent funding resources. As of December 31, 2017, $3.0 billion was drawn on the Charge Trust facility, which was subsequently repaid on January 16, 2018. No amounts were drawn on the Lending Trust facility. Federal Reserve Discount Window As insured depository institutions, Centurion Bank and American Express Bank may borrow from the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco, subject to the amount of qualifying collateral that they may pledge. The Federal Reserve has indicated that both credit and charge card receivables are a form of qualifying collateral for secured borrowings made through the discount window. Whether specific assets will be considered qualifying collateral and the amount that may be borrowed against the collateral, remain at the discretion of the Federal Reserve. We had approximately $68.0 billion as of December 31, 2017 in U.S. credit card loans and charge card receivables that could be sold over time through our securitization trusts or pledged in return for secured borrowings to provide further liquidity, subject in each case to applicable market conditions and eligibility criteria. Committed Bank Credit Facility In addition to the secured borrowing facilities described earlier in this section, we maintained a committed syndicated bank credit facility as of December 31, 2017 of $3.5 billion, which expires on October 16, 2020. The availability of this credit line is subject to our compliance with certain financial covenants, principally the maintenance by American Express Credit Corporation (Credco) of a certain ratio of combined earnings and fixed charges to fixed charges. As of December 31, 2017, we were in compliance with each of our covenants. As of December 31, 2017, no amounts were drawn on the committed credit facility. The capacity of the facility mainly served to further enhance our contingent funding resources. Our committed bank credit facility does not contain a material adverse change clause, which might otherwise preclude borrowing under the credit facility, nor is it dependent on our credit rating. CASH FLOWS The following table summarizes our cash flow activity, followed by a discussion of the major drivers impacting operating, investing and financing cash flows. TABLE 24: CASH FLOWS (Billions) 2017 2016 2015 Total cash provided by (used in): Operating activities $ 13.5 $ 8.3 $ 10.7 Investing activities (18.2 ) 1.9 (8.2 ) Financing activities 12.2 (7.6 ) (1.8 ) Effect of foreign currency exchange rates on cash and cash equivalents 0.2 (0.2 ) (0.2 ) Net increase in cash and cash equivalents $ 7.7 $ 2.4 $ 0.5 Cash Flows from Operating Activities Our cash flows from operating activities primarily include net income adjusted for (i) non-cash items included in net income and (ii) changes in the balances of operating assets and liabilities, which can vary significantly in the normal course of business due to the amount and timing of payments. 61 Table of Contents The increase in net cash provided by operating activities in the current period was driven by net income adjusted for non-cash items, including changes in provisions for losses, depreciation and amortization, deferred taxes and stock-based compensation, and changes in operating assets and liabilities, primarily accounts payable and other liabilities as a result of normal business operations. Cash Flows from Investing Activities Our cash flows from investing activities primarily include changes in Card Member loans and receivables as well as changes in our available-for-sale investment securities portfolio. The increase in net cash used in investing activities in the current period primarily reflects growth in Card Member loans and receivables as well as the sales of the HFS portfolios in the prior period. Cash Flows from Financing Activities Our cash flows from financing activities primarily include changes in long-term debt, short-term borrowings and customer deposits as well as our regular common share dividend and share repurchase program. The increase in net cash provided by financing activities in the current period was primarily driven by an increase in customer deposits during the current period, versus a decrease in the prior period, and a net increase in long-term debt during the current period, versus a net decrease in the prior period. 62 Table of Contents OFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS AND CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS We have identified both on- and off-balance sheet transactions, arrangements, obligations and other relationships that may have a material current or future effect on our financial condition, changes in financial condition, results of operations, or liquidity and capital resources. CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS The table below identifies transactions that represent our contractually committed future obligations. Purchase obligations include our agreements to purchase goods and services that are enforceable and legally binding and that specify significant terms, including: fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased; fixed, minimum or variable price provisions; and the approximate timing of the transaction. TABLE 25: COMMITTED FUTURE OBLIGATIONS BY YEAR Payments due by year(a) (Millions) 2018 2019-2020 2021-2022 2023 and thereafter Total Long-term debt $ 11,934 $ 28,926 $ 10,527 $ 5,535 $ 56,922 Interest payments on long-term debt(b) 1,195 1,532 691 1,545 4,963 Certificates of deposit 5,256 8,278 3,460 ― 16,994 Other long-term liabilities(c) (d) 340 112 13 21 486 Operating lease obligations 131 222 129 831 1,313 Purchase obligations(e) 454 294 141 7 896 Deemed repatriation tax(f) 8 286 268 1,141 1,703 Total $ 19,318 $ 39,650 $ 15,229 $ 9,080 $ 83,277 (a) The table above excludes approximately $0.8 billion of tax liabilities related to the uncertainty in income taxes as inherent complexities and the number of tax years currently open for examination in multiple jurisdictions do not permit reasonable estimates of payments, if any, to be made over a range of years. Refer to Note 21 to the “Consolidated Financial Statements” for additional information. (b) Estimated interest payments were calculated using the effective interest rates as of December 31, 2017, and includes the effect of existing interest rate swaps. Actual cash flows may differ from estimated payments. (c) As of December 31, 2017, there were no minimum required contributions, and no contributions are currently planned, for the U.S. American Express Retirement Plan. For the U.S. American Express Retirement Restoration Plan and non-U.S. defined benefit pension and postretirement benefit plans, contributions in 2017 are anticipated to be approximately $48 million, and this amount has been included within other long-term liabilities. Remaining obligations under defined benefit pension and postretirement benefit plans aggregating $578 million have not been included in the table above as the timing of such obligations is not determinable. Additionally, other long-term liabilities do not include $7.8 billion of Membership Rewards liabilities, which are not considered long-term liabilities as Card Members in good standing can redeem points immediately, without restrictions, and because the timing of point redemption is not determinable. (d) As of December 31, 2017, we had committed to provide funding related to certain tax credit investments resulting in a $373 million unfunded commitment included in other long-term liabilities. In addition to this amount, there was a further $66 million of contractual off-balance sheet obligations that have not been included in the table above as the timing of such obligations is not determinable. Refer to Note 7 to the “Consolidated Financial Statements” for additional information. (e) The purchase obligation amounts represent either the early termination fees or non-cancelable minimum contractual obligations, as applicable, by period under contracts that were in effect as of December 31, 2017. (f) Represents our estimated obligation under the Tax Act to pay the deemed repatriation tax on certain non-US earnings over eight years, which has been calculated on a provisional basis. Refer to Note 21 to the “Consolidated Financial Statements” for additional information. In addition to the contractual obligations noted in Table 25, as of December 31, 2017, we had $5.6 billion in commitments related to agreements with certain cobrand partners under which we make payments based primarily on the amount of Card Member spending and corresponding rewards earned on such spending and, under certain arrangements, on the number of accounts acquired and retained, all of which we expect will fully satisfy these commitments. Such cobrand agreements generally range from five to eight years. We also have off-balance sheet arrangements that include guarantees, indemnifications and certain other off-balance sheet arrangements. GUARANTEES As of December 31, 2017, we had guarantees and indemnifications totaling approximately $1 billion related primarily to real estate and business dispositions in the ordinary course of business. Refer to Note 16 to the “Consolidated Financial Statements” for further discussion regarding our guarantees. 63 Table of Contents CERTAIN OTHER OFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS As of December 31, 2017, we had approximately $273 billion of unused credit outstanding as part of established lending product agreements. Total unused credit does not represent potential future cash requirements, as a significant portion of this unused credit will likely not be drawn. Our charge card products generally have no pre-set limit, and therefore are not reflected in unused credit available to Card Members. We provide Card Member protection plans that cover losses associated with purchased products. The maximum potential liability related to these plans is the portion of annual billed business for which timely and valid disputes may be raised under applicable law and relevant customer agreements. However, based on historical experience, we believe that this total amount is not representative of our actual potential loss exposure. The actual amount of the potential exposure cannot be quantified as the billed business volumes which may include or result in claims under these plans are not sufficiently estimable. Losses related to these protection plans were immaterial for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015. To mitigate counterparty credit risk related to derivatives, we accepted non-cash collateral in the form of security interests in U.S. Treasury securities from our derivatives counterparties with a fair value of $18 million as of December 31, 2016, none of which was sold or repledged. There was no non-cash collateral held as of December 31, 2017. Refer to Notes 7 and 13 to the “Consolidated Financial Statements” for discussion regarding our other off-balance sheet arrangements. 64 Table of Contents RISK MANAGEMENT GOVERNANCE We use our comprehensive Enterprise-wide Risk Management (ERM) program to identify, aggregate, monitor, and manage risks. The program also defines our risk appetite, governance, culture and capabilities. The implementation and execution of the ERM program is headed by our Chief Risk Officer. Risk management is overseen by our Board of Directors through three Board committees: the Risk Committee, the Audit and Compliance Committee, and the Compensation and Benefits Committee. Each committee consists entirely of independent directors and provides regular reports to the full Board regarding matters reviewed at their committee. The committees meet regularly in private sessions with our Chief Risk Officer, the Chief Compliance & Ethics Officer, the Chief Audit Executive and other senior management with regard to our risk management processes, controls, talent and capabilities. The Board monitors the “tone at the top,” our risk culture, and oversees emerging and strategic risks. The Risk Committee of our Board of Directors provides oversight of our enterprise-wide risk management framework, processes and methodologies. The Risk Committee approves our ERM policy. The ERM policy governs risk governance, risk oversight and risk appetite for risks, including individual credit risk, institutional credit risk, market risk, liquidity risk, operational risk, reputational risk, compliance risk, model risk, asset/liability risk and strategic and business risk. Risk appetite defines the authorized risk limits to control exposures within our risk capacity and risk tolerance, including stressed forward-looking scenarios. In addition, it establishes principles for risk taking in the aggregate and for each risk type, and is supported by a comprehensive system for monitoring limits, escalation triggers and assessing control programs. The Risk Committee reviews and concurs in the appointment, replacement, performance and compensation of our Chief Risk Officer and receives regular updates from the Chief Risk Officer on key risks, transactions and exposures. The Risk Committee reviews our risk profile against the tolerances specified in the Risk Appetite Framework, including significant risk exposures, risk trends in our portfolios and major risk concentrations. The Risk Committee also provides oversight of our compliance with Basel capital and liquidity standards, our Internal Capital Adequacy Assessment Process, including its Comprehensive Capital Analysis and Review (CCAR) submissions, and resolution planning. The Audit and Compliance Committee of our Board of Directors reviews and approves compliance policies, which include our Compliance Risk Tolerance Statement. In addition, the Audit and Compliance Committee reviews the effectiveness of our Corporate-wide Compliance Risk Management Program. More broadly, this committee is responsible for assisting the Board in its oversight responsibilities relating to the integrity of our financial statements and financial reporting process, internal and external auditing, including the qualifications and independence of the independent registered public accounting firm and the performance of our internal audit services function, and the integrity of our systems of internal accounting and financial controls. The Audit and Compliance Committee provides oversight of our Internal Audit Group. The Audit and Compliance Committee reviews and concurs in the appointment, replacement, performance and compensation of our Chief Audit Executive and approves Internal Audit’s annual audit plan, charter, policies and budget. The Audit and Compliance Committee also receives regular updates on the audit plan’s status and results including significant reports issued by Internal Audit and the status of our corrective actions. The Compensation and Benefits Committee of our Board of Directors works with the Chief Risk Officer to ensure our overall compensation programs, as well as those covering our business units and risk-taking employees, appropriately balance risk with business incentives and how business performance is achieved without taking imprudent or excessive risk. Our Chief Risk Officer is actively involved in setting goals, including for our business units. Our Chief Risk Officer also reviews the current and forward-looking risk profiles of each business unit, and provides input into performance evaluation. The Chief Risk Officer meets with the Compensation and Benefits Committee and attests whether performance goals and results have been achieved without taking imprudent risks. The Compensation and Benefits Committee uses a risk-balanced incentive compensation framework to decide on our bonus pools and the compensation of senior executives. There are several internal management committees, including the Enterprise-wide Risk Management Committee (ERMC), chaired by our Chief Risk Officer. The ERMC is the highest-level management committee to oversee all firm-wide risks and is responsible for risk governance, risk oversight and risk appetite. It maintains the enterprise-wide risk appetite framework and monitors compliance with limits and escalations defined in it. The ERMC oversees implementation of risk policies company-wide. The ERMC reviews key risk exposures, trends and concentrations, significant compliance matters, and provides guidance on the steps to monitor, control and report major risks. 65 Table of Contents As defined in the ERM policy, we follow the “three lines of defense” approach to risk management. The first line of defense comprises functions and management committees directly initiating risk taking. Business unit presidents, our Chief Credit Officer, Chief Market Risk Officer and Functional Risk Officer are part of the first line of defense. The second line comprises independent functions overseeing risk-taking activities of the first line. The Chief Risk Officer, the Chief Compliance & Ethics Officer, the Chief Operational Risk Officer and certain control groups, both at the enterprise level and within regulated entities, are part of the second line of defense. The global risk oversight team oversees the policies, strategies, frameworks, models, processes and capabilities deployed by the first line teams and provides challenges and independent assessments on how the first line of defense is managing risks. Our Internal Audit Group constitutes the third line of defense, and provides independent assessments and effective challenge of the first and second lines of defense. In addition, the Asset Liability Committee, chaired by our Chief Financial Officer, is responsible for managing market, liquidity, asset/liability risk, capital and resolution planning. CREDIT RISK MANAGEMENT PROCESS Credit risk is defined as loss due to obligor or counterparty default or changes in the credit quality of a security. Our credit risks are divided into two broad categories: individual and institutional. Each has distinct risk management capabilities, strategies, and tools. Business units that create individual or institutional credit risk exposures of significant importance are supported by dedicated risk management teams, each led by a Chief Credit Officer. INDIVIDUAL CREDIT RISK Individual credit risk arises principally from consumer and small business charge cards, credit cards, lines of credit, and loans. These portfolios consist of millions of customers across multiple geographies, industries and levels of net worth. We benefit from the high-quality profile of our customers, which is driven by our brand, premium customer servicing, product features and risk management capabilities, which span underwriting, customer management and collections. Externally, the risk in these portfolios is correlated to broad economic trends, such as unemployment rates and gross domestic product (GDP) growth, which can affect customer liquidity. The business unit leaders and their Chief Credit Officers take the lead in managing the individual credit risk process. These Chief Credit Officers are guided by the Individual Credit Risk Committee, which is responsible for implementation and enforcement of the Individual Credit Risk Management Policy. This policy is further supported by subordinate policies and operating manuals covering decision logic and processes of credit extension, including prospecting, new account approvals, point-of-sale authorizations, credit line management and collections. The subordinate risk policies and operating manuals are designed to ensure consistent application of risk management principles and standardized reporting of asset quality and loss recognition. Individual credit risk management is supported by sophisticated proprietary scoring and decision-making models that use the most up-to-date information on prospects and customers, such as spending and payment history and data feeds from credit bureaus. Additional data, such as commercial variables, are integrated to further mitigate small business risk. We have developed data-driven economic decision logic for customer interactions to better serve our customers. INSTITUTIONAL CREDIT RISK Institutional credit risk arises principally within our Global Commercial Services, Global Merchant Services, GNS, Prepaid Services and Foreign Exchange Services businesses, as well as investment and liquidity management activities. Unlike individual credit risk, institutional credit risk is characterized by a lower loss frequency but higher severity. It is affected both by general economic conditions and by client-specific events. The absence of large losses in any given year or over several years is not necessarily representative of the level of risk of institutional portfolios, given the infrequency of loss events in such portfolios. Similar to Individual Credit Risk, business units taking institutional credit risks are supported by Chief Credit Officers. These officers are guided by the Institutional Risk Management Committee (IRMC), which is responsible for implementation and enforcement of the Institutional Credit Risk Management Policy and for providing guidance to the credit officers of each business unit with substantial institutional credit risk exposures. The committee, along with the business unit Chief Credit Officers, makes investment decisions in core risk capabilities, ensures proper implementation of the underwriting standards and contractual rights of risk mitigation, monitors risk exposures, and determines risk mitigation actions. The IRMC formally reviews large institutional risk exposures to ensure compliance with ERMC guidelines and procedures and escalates them to the ERMC as appropriate. At the same time, the IRMC provides guidance to the business unit risk management teams to optimize risk-adjusted returns on capital. A centralized risk rating unit and a specialized airline risk group provide risk assessment of our institutional obligors. 66 Table of Contents Exposure to the Airline Industry We have multiple important cobrand, rewards, merchant acceptance and corporate payments arrangements with airlines. The ERM program evaluates the risks posed by our airline partners and the overall airline strategy companywide through comprehensive business analysis of global airlines. Our largest airline partner is Delta, and this relationship includes exclusive cobrand credit card partnerships and other arrangements including Membership Rewards redemption, merchant acceptance, travel and corporate payments. See “Risk Factors.” Debt Exposure As part of our ongoing risk management process, we monitor our financial exposure to both sovereign and non-sovereign customers and counterparties, and measure and manage concentrations of risk by geographic regions, as well as by economic sectors and industries. A primary focus area for monitoring is credit deterioration due to weaknesses in economic and fiscal profiles. We evaluate countries based on the market assessment of the riskiness of their sovereign debt and our assessment of the economic and financial outlook and closely monitor those deemed high risk. As of December 31, 2017, we considered our gross credit exposures to government entities, financial institutions and corporations in those countries deemed high risk to be individually and collectively not material. OPERATIONAL RISK MANAGEMENT PROCESS We define operational risk as the risk of not achieving business objectives due to inadequate or failed processes, people, or information systems, or the external environment, including failures to comply with laws and regulations. Operational risk is inherent in all business activities and can impact an organization through direct or indirect financial loss, brand damage, customer dissatisfaction, or legal and regulatory penalties. To appropriately measure and manage operational risk, we have implemented a comprehensive operational risk framework that is defined in the Operational Risk Management Policy approved by the Risk Committee. The Operational Risk Management Committee (ORMC), chaired by the Chief Operational Risk Officer, coordinates with all control groups on effective risk assessments and controls and oversees the preventive, responsive and mitigation efforts by Operational Excellence teams in the business units and staff groups. We use the operational risk framework to identify, measure, monitor and report inherent and emerging operational risks. This framework, supervised by the ORMC, consists of (a) operational risk event capture, (b) a project office to coordinate issue management and control enhancements, (c) key risk indicators such as customer complaints or pre-implementation test metrics, and (d) process and entity-level risk assessments. The framework requires the assessment of operational risk events to determine root causes, impact to customers and/or us, and resolution plan accountability to correct any defect, remediate customers, and enhance controls and testing to mitigate future issues. The impact is assessed from an operational, financial, brand, regulatory compliance and legal perspective. INFORMATION AND CYBER SECURITY We have implemented an Information Security Program and Operating Model that is designed to protect the confidentiality, integrity and availability of information and information systems from unauthorized access, use, disclosure, disruption, modification or destruction. Our Information Security Program and Operating Model are based on the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) Cybersecurity Common Standards Framework, which consist of controls designed to identify, protect, detect, respond and recover from information and cyber security incidents. The framework defines risks and associated controls which are embedded in our processes and technology. Those controls are measured and monitored by a combination of subject matter experts and a security operations center with our integrated cyber detection, response and recovery capabilities. Chaired by the Chief Information Security Officer, our Information Security Risk Management Committee, a sub-committee of the ORMC, provides governance for our information security risk management program. In addition, the committee is responsible for establishing cyber risk tolerances and in managing cyber crisis preparedness. The Information Security and Technology Oversight team provides independent challenge and assessment of the information, cyber security and technology risk management programs. See “A significant operating disruption, a major information or cyber security incident or an increase in fraudulent activity could lead to reputational damage to our brand and significant legal, regulatory and financial exposure, and could reduce the use and acceptance of our charge and credit cards” under “Risk Factors” for additional information. 67 Table of Contents PRIVACY AND DATA GOVERNANCE Our Privacy Framework and Operating Model follow a similar structure. Chaired by the Chief Privacy Officer, our Privacy Risk Management Committee, a sub-committee of the ORMC, provides oversight and governance for our privacy program. The committee is responsible for the governance over the collection, notice, use, sharing, transfer, confidentiality and retention of personal data. Our Enterprise Data Governance Framework and Policy defines governance requirements for data used in critical processes. COMPLIANCE RISK MANAGEMENT PROCESS We define compliance risk as the risk of legal or reputational harm, fines, monetary penalties and payment of damages or other forms of sanction as a result of non-compliance with applicable laws, regulations, rules or standards of conduct. We view our ability to effectively mitigate compliance risk as an important aspect of our business model. Our Global Compliance and Ethics organization is responsible for establishing and maintaining our corporate-wide Compliance Risk Management Program. Pursuant to this program, we seek to manage and mitigate compliance risk by assessing, controlling, monitoring, measuring and reporting the legal and regulatory risks to which we are exposed. We have a comprehensive Anti-Money Laundering program that monitors and reports suspicious activity to the appropriate government authorities. As part of that program, the Global Risk Oversight team provides independent risk assessment of the models and rules used by the Anti-Money Laundering team. In addition, the Internal Audit Group reviews the processes for practices consistent with regulatory guidance. REPUTATIONAL RISK MANAGEMENT PROCESS We define reputational risk as the risk that negative stakeholder reaction to our products, services, client and partner relationships, business activities and policies, management and workplace culture, or our response to unexpected events, could cause sustained, critical media coverage, a decline in revenue or investment, talent attrition, litigation, or government or regulatory scrutiny. We view protecting our reputation for excellent customer service, trust, security and high integrity as core to our vision of providing the world’s best customer experience and fundamental to our long-term success. Our business leaders are responsible for considering the reputational risk implications of business activities and strategies and ensuring the relevant subject matter experts are engaged as needed. The ERMC is responsible for ensuring reputational risk considerations are included in the scope of appropriate subordinate risk policies and committees and properly reflected in all decisions escalated to the ERMC. MARKET RISK MANAGEMENT PROCESS Market risk is the risk to earnings or asset and liability values resulting from movements in market prices. Our market risk exposures include:  Interest rate risk due to changes in the relationship between interest rates on our assets (such as loans, receivables and investment securities) and our interest rates on our liabilities (such as debt and deposits); and  Foreign exchange risk related to transactions, funding, investments and earnings in currencies other than the U.S. dollar. Our Asset-Liability Management (ALM) and Market Risk policies establish the framework that guides and governs market risk management, including quantitative limits and escalation triggers. These policies are approved by the Risk Committee of the Board of Directors or Market Risk Management Committee. Market risk is managed by the Market Risk Management Committee. The Market Risk Oversight Officer provides an independent risk assessment and oversight over the policies and exposure management for market risk and ALM activities, as well as overseeing compliance with the Volcker Rule and other regulatory requirements. Market risk management is also guided and governed by policies covering the use of derivative financial instruments, funding, liquidity and investments. We analyze a variety of interest rate scenarios to inform us of the potential impacts from interest rate changes on earnings and the value of assets, liabilities and the economic value of equity. Our interest rate exposure can vary over time as a result of, among other things, the proportion of our total funding provided by variable-and fixed-rate debt and deposits compared to our Card Member loans and receivables. Interest rate swaps are used from time to time to effectively convert debt issuances to (or from) variable-rate, from (or to) fixed-rate. We do not engage in derivative financial instruments for trading purposes other than with respect to our Foreign Exchange International Payments business activities. Refer to Note 14 to the “Consolidated Financial Statements” for further discussion of our derivative financial instruments. 68 Table of Contents As of December 31, 2017, a hypothetical, immediate 100 basis point increase in market interest rates would have a detrimental effect on our annual net interest income of approximately $167 million. This measure first projects net interest income over the following twelve-month time horizon considering forecasted business growth and anticipated future market interest rates. The detrimental impact from a rate increase is then measured by instantaneously increasing the anticipated future interest rates by 100 basis points. It is further assumed that our interest-rate sensitive assets and the majority of our liabilities that reprice within the twelve-month horizon generally reprice by 100 basis points. Our estimated repricing risk assumes that certain deposit liabilities reprice at a lower magnitude than benchmark rate movements consistent with historical deposit repricing experience in the industry and within our own portfolio. Actual changes in our net interest income will depend on many factors, and therefore may differ from our estimated risk to changes in market interest rates. In addition to parallel rate changes, our net interest income is subject to changes in the relationship between market benchmark rates. For example, movements in Prime rate change the yield on a large portion of our variable-rate U.S. lending receivables and loans, while LIBOR rates determine the effective interest rate on a significant portion of our outstanding funding. Differences in the rate of change of these two benchmark indices, commonly referred to as basis risk, would thus impact our net interest income. The detrimental effect on our net interest income of a hypothetical 10 basis point decrease in the spread between Prime and one-month LIBOR over the next twelve months is estimated to be $33 million. We currently have approximately $44 billion of Prime-based, variable-rate U.S. lending receivables and loans and $33 billion of LIBOR-indexed debt, including asset securitizations. The replacement of LIBOR as a benchmark rate can have a further detrimental impact on our LIBOR-indexed debt if rates suddenly rise as new market activity transfers to other benchmark curves, such as the Secured Overnight Financing Rate. Foreign exchange exposures arise in four principal ways: 1) Card Member spending in currencies that are not the billing currency, 2) cross-currency transactions and balances from our funding activities, 3) cross-currency investing activities, such as in the equity of foreign subsidiaries, and 4) revenues generated and expenses incurred in foreign currencies, which impact earnings. These foreign exchange risks are managed primarily by entering into foreign exchange spot transactions or hedged with foreign exchange forward contracts when the hedge costs are economically justified and in notional amounts designed to offset pretax impacts from currency movements in the period in which they occur. As of December 31, 2017 and 2016, foreign currency derivative instruments with total notional amounts of approximately $30 billion and $28 billion were outstanding, respectively. With respect to Card Member spending and cross-currency transactions, including related foreign exchange forward contracts outstanding, a hypothetical 10 percent strengthening of the U.S. dollar would result in an immaterial impact to projected earnings as of December 31, 2017. With respect to translation exposure of foreign subsidiary equity balances, including related foreign exchange forward contracts outstanding, a hypothetical 10 percent strengthening of the U.S. dollar would result in an immaterial reduction in other comprehensive income and equity as of December 31, 2017. With respect to earnings denominated in foreign currencies, the adverse impact on pretax income of a hypothetical 10 percent strengthening of the U.S. dollar related to anticipated overseas operating results for the next twelve months would be approximately $198 million as of December 31, 2017. To a much lesser extent, we are also subject to market risk arising from activities conducted by our Foreign Exchange International Payments business. We aim to minimize market risk from these activities through hedging, where appropriate, and the establishment of limits to define and protect the company from excessive exposure. The actual impact of interest rate and foreign exchange rate changes will depend on, among other factors, the timing of rate changes, the extent to which different rates do not move in the same direction or in the same direction to the same degree, changes in the cost, volume and mix of our hedging activities and changes in the volume and mix of our businesses. FUNDING & LIQUIDITY RISK MANAGEMENT PROCESS Liquidity risk is defined as our inability to meet our ongoing financial and business obligations as they become due at a reasonable cost. Our Board-approved Liquidity Risk Policy establishes the framework that guides and governs liquidity risk management. Liquidity risk is managed by the Funding and Liquidity Committee. In addition, the Market Risk Oversight Officer provides independent oversight of liquidity risk management. We manage liquidity risk by maintaining access to a diverse set of cash, readily-marketable securities and contingent sources of liquidity, such that we can continuously meet our business requirements and expected future financing obligations for at least a twelve-month period, even in the event we are unable to raise new funds under our regular funding programs during a substantial weakening in economic conditions. We consider the trade-offs between maintaining too much liquidity, which can be costly and limit financial flexibility, and having inadequate liquidity, which may result in financial distress during a liquidity event. Liquidity risk is managed at an aggregate consolidated level as well as at certain subsidiaries in order to ensure that sufficient and accessible liquidity resources are maintained. The Funding and Liquidity Committee reviews forecasts of our aggregate and subsidiary cash positions and financing requirements, approves funding plans designed to satisfy those requirements under normal and stressed conditions, establishes guidelines to identify the amount of liquidity resources required and monitors positions and determines any actions to be taken. 69 Table of Contents MODEL RISK MANAGEMENT PROCESS We define model risk as the risk of adverse consequences, such as financial loss, poor business and strategic decision making, or damage to our reputation, from decisions based on incorrect or misused model outputs and reports. We manage model risk through a comprehensive model governance framework, including policies and procedures for model development, independent model validation and change management capabilities that seek to minimize erroneous model methodology, outputs and misuse. We also assess model performance on an ongoing basis. STRATEGIC AND BUSINESS RISK MANAGEMENT PROCESS Strategic and business risk is the risk related to our inability to achieve our business objectives due to poor strategic decisions, including decisions related to mergers, acquisitions, and divestitures, poor implementation of strategic decisions or declining demand for our products and services. Strategic decisions are reviewed and approved by business leaders and various committees and must be aligned with company policies. We seek to manage strategic and business risks through risk controls embedded in these processes as well as overall risk management oversight over business goals. Existing product performance is reviewed periodically by committees and business leaders. Mergers, acquisitions and divestitures can only be approved following Deal Committee due diligence, a comprehensive risk assessment by operational, market, credit and oversight leaders provided to the Chief Risk Officer and approval by either the Chief Risk Officer or appropriate risk committees. All new products and material changes in business processes are reviewed and approved by the New Products Committee and appropriate credit or risk committees. 70 Table of Contents CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES Refer to Note 1 to the “Consolidated Financial Statements” for a summary of our significant accounting policies. Certain of our accounting policies requiring significant management assumptions and judgments are as follows: RESERVES FOR CARD MEMBER LOSSES Reserves for Card Member losses represent our best estimate of the probable losses inherent in our outstanding portfolio of Card Member loans and receivables, as of the balance sheet date. In estimating these losses, we use statistical and analytical models that analyze portfolio performance and reflect our judgment regarding the quantitative components of the reserve. The models take into account several factors, including delinquency-based loss migration rates, loss emergence periods and average losses over an appropriate historical period, as well as expected future recoveries. We also consider whether to adjust the quantitative reserve for certain external and internal qualitative factors that may increase or decrease the reserves for losses on Card Member loans and receivables. The process of estimating these reserves requires a high degree of judgment. To the extent historical credit experience, updated for any external and internal qualitative factors such as environmental trends, is not indicative of future performance, actual losses could differ significantly from our judgments and expectations, resulting in either higher or lower future provisions for Card Member losses in any quarter. As of December 31, 2017, a 10 percent increase in our estimate of losses inherent in the outstanding portfolio of Card Member loans and receivables, evaluated collectively for impairment, would increase reserves for losses with a corresponding change to provisions for losses by approximately $223 million. This sensitivity analysis is provided as a hypothetical scenario to assess the sensitivity of the provisions for losses. It does not represent our expectations for losses in the future, nor does it include how other portfolio factors such as delinquency-based loss migration rates or recoveries, or the amount of outstanding balances, may impact the level of reserves for losses and the corresponding impact on the provisions for losses. LIABILITY FOR MEMBERSHIP REWARDS EXPENSE The Membership Rewards program is our largest card-based rewards program. Card Members can earn points for purchases charged on their enrolled card products. A significant portion of our cards, by their terms, allow Card Members to earn bonus points for purchases at merchants in particular industry categories. Membership Rewards points are redeemable for a broad variety of rewards, including travel, shopping, gift cards, and covering eligible charges. Points typically do not expire, and there is no limit on the number of points a Card Member may earn. Membership Rewards expense is driven by charge volume on enrolled cards, customer participation in the program and contractual arrangements with redemption partners. We record a Membership Rewards liability that represents the estimated cost of points earned that are expected to be redeemed by Card Members in the future. The Membership Rewards liability is impacted over time by enrollment levels, attrition, the volume of points earned and redeemed, and the associated redemption costs. We estimate the Membership Rewards liability by determining the URR and the WAC per point, which are applied to the points of current enrollees. Refer to Note 10 to the “Consolidated Financial Statements” for additional information. The URR assumption is used to estimate the number of points earned by current enrollees that will ultimately be redeemed in future periods. We use statistical and actuarial models to estimate the URR of points earned to date by current Card Members based on redemption trends, card product type, enrollment tenure, card spend levels and credit attributes. The WAC per point assumption is used to estimate future redemption costs and is primarily based on redemption choices made by Card Members, reward offerings by partners, and Membership Rewards program changes. The WAC per point is derived from the previous 12 months of redemptions and is adjusted as appropriate for certain changes in redemption costs that are not representative of future cost expectations. We periodically evaluate our liability estimation process and assumptions based on developments in redemption patterns, cost per point redeemed, partner contract changes and other factors. The process of estimating the Membership Rewards liability includes a high degree of judgment. Actual redemptions and associated redemption costs could differ significantly from our estimates, resulting in either higher or lower Membership Rewards expense. Changes in the Membership Rewards URR and WAC per point have the effect of either increasing or decreasing the liability through the current period Marketing, promotion, rewards and Card Member services expense by an amount estimated to cover the cost of all points previously earned but not yet redeemed by current enrollees as of the end of the reporting period. As of December 31, 2017, an increase in the estimated URR of current enrollees of 25 basis points would increase the Membership Rewards liability and corresponding rewards expense by approximately $103 million. Similarly, an increase in the WAC per point of 1 basis point would increase the Membership Rewards liability and corresponding rewards expense by approximately $98 million. 71 Table of Contents FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENT Our investment securities and derivative instruments are carried at fair value on the Consolidated Balance Sheets, which require management to make assumptions and apply judgments when assessing fair value. The objective of a fair value measurement is to determine the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability by utilizing the three-level hierarchy of inputs to valuation techniques used to measure fair value. When available, we use quoted market prices to determine fair value (Level 1). If quoted market prices are not available, we will measure fair value based on pricing models with significant observable inputs (Level 2). We do not have any financial instruments measured at fair value on a recurring basis using significant unobservable inputs (Level 3). For additional information on our fair value hierarchy, refer to Note 15 to the “Consolidated Financial Statements.” Investment Securities Our investment securities are mostly composed of fixed-income securities issued by states and municipalities in the United States, the U.S. Government and its Agencies and select foreign governments. The fair value of our investment securities, including investments comprising defined benefit pension plan assets, are obtained primarily from third-party pricing services. The fair values provided by the pricing services are estimated using pricing models, where the inputs to those models are based on observable market inputs or recent trades of similar securities. We did not apply any adjustments to prices received from the pricing services used as of December 31, 2017 and 2016. For additional information on our investment securities, refer to Note 5 to the “Consolidated Financial Statements.” Derivative Instruments Our primary derivative instruments are interest rate swaps and foreign currency forward agreements. The fair value of our derivative instruments is estimated internally by using third-party pricing models, where the inputs to those models are readily observable from actively quoted markets. For additional information on our derivatives and hedging activities, refer to Note 14 to the “Consolidated Financial Statements.” In the measurement of fair value for our investment securities and derivative instruments, although the underlying inputs used in the pricing models are based on observable markets inputs, the pricing models do entail a certain amount of subjectivity, and therefore differing judgments in the underlying inputs, or how they are modeled, could result in a different estimate of fair value. While we rely on the third-party pricing model, we reaffirm our understanding of the valuation techniques at least annually and validate the valuation output on a quarterly basis. GOODWILL RECOVERABILITY Goodwill represents the excess of acquisition cost of an acquired business over the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed. Goodwill is not amortized but is tested for impairment at the reporting unit level annually or when events or circumstances arise, such as adverse changes in the business climate, that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of the reporting unit below its carrying value. Our methodology for conducting this goodwill impairment testing contains both a qualitative and quantitative assessment. We have the option to initially perform an assessment of qualitative factors in order to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount. The qualitative factors may include, but are not limited to, economic conditions, industry and market considerations, cost factors, overall financial performance of the reporting unit and other company and reporting unit-specific events. If we determine that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, we then perform the impairment evaluation using a more detailed quantitative assessment. We could also directly perform this quantitative assessment for any reporting unit, bypassing the qualitative assessment. Our methodology for conducting the quantitative goodwill impairment testing is fundamentally based on the measurement of fair value for our reporting units, which inherently entails the use of significant management judgment. For valuation, we use a combination of the income approach (discounted cash flows) and market approach (market multiples) in estimating the fair value of our reporting units. When preparing discounted cash flow models under the income approach, we estimate future cash flows using the reporting unit’s internal multi-year forecast, and a terminal value calculated using a growth rate that we believe is appropriate in light of current and expected future economic conditions. To discount these cash flows we use our expected cost of equity, determined using a capital asset pricing model. When using the market method under the market approach, we apply comparable publicly traded companies’ multiples (e.g., earnings, revenues) to our reporting units’ actual results. The judgment in estimating forecasted cash flows, discount rates and market comparables is significant, and imprecision could materially affect the fair value of our reporting units. We could be exposed to an increased risk of further goodwill impairment if future operating results or macroeconomic conditions differ significantly from management’s current assumptions. 72 Table of Contents INCOME TAXES We are subject to the income tax laws of the United States, its states and municipalities and those of the foreign jurisdictions in which we operate. These tax laws are complex, and the manner in which they apply to the taxpayer’s facts is sometimes open to interpretation. In establishing a provision for income tax expense, we must make judgments about the application of inherently complex tax laws. In particular, the Tax Act is complex and requires interpretation of certain provisions to estimate the impact on our income tax expense. The estimates are based on the information available and our current interpretation of the Tax Act, and may change due to changes in interpretations and assumptions we make and additional guidance or context from the Internal Revenue Service, the U.S. Treasury Department, the Financial Accounting Standards Board or others regarding the Tax Act. Our accounting for the impacts of the Tax Act is provisional and actual income tax expense could differ from our estimates. Refer to Note 21 to the “Consolidated Financial Statements” for additional information. Unrecognized Tax Benefits We establish a liability for unrecognized tax benefits, which are the differences between a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return and the benefit recognized in the financial statements. In establishing a liability for an unrecognized tax benefit, assumptions may be made in determining whether, and the extent to which, a tax position should be sustained. A tax position is recognized only when it is more likely than not to be sustained upon examination by the relevant taxing authority, based on its technical merits. The amount of tax benefit recognized is the largest benefit that we believe is more likely than not to be realized on ultimate settlement. As new information becomes available, we evaluate our tax positions and adjust our unrecognized tax benefits, as appropriate. Tax benefits ultimately realized can differ from amounts previously recognized due to uncertainties, with any such differences generally impacting the provision for income tax. Deferred Tax Asset Realization Deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the differences between the financial statement and tax bases of assets and liabilities using the enacted tax rates expected to be in effect for the years in which the differences are expected to reverse. Since deferred taxes measure the future tax effects of items recognized in the Consolidated Financial Statements, certain estimates and assumptions are required to determine whether it is more likely than not that all or some portion of the benefit of a deferred tax asset will not be realized. In making this assessment, we analyze and estimate the impact of future taxable income, reversing temporary differences and available tax planning strategies. These assessments are performed quarterly, taking into account any new information. Changes in facts or circumstances can lead to changes in the ultimate realization of deferred tax assets due to uncertainties. 73 Table of Contents OTHER MATTERS RECENTLY ISSUED ACCOUNTING STANDARDS Refer to the Recently Issued Accounting Standards section of Note 1 to the “Consolidated Financial Statements.” GLOSSARY OF SELECTED TERMINOLOGY Adjusted net interest income — A non-GAAP measure that represents net interest income attributable to our Card Member loans and loans HFS (which includes, on a GAAP basis, interest that is deemed uncollectible), excluding the impact of interest expense and interest income not attributable to our Card Member loans. We believe adjusted net interest income is useful to investors because it represents the interest expense and interest income attributable to our Card Member loan portfolio and it is a component of net interest yield on average Card Member loans. Asset securitizations — Asset securitization involves the transfer and sale of loans or receivables to a special-purpose entity created for the securitization activity, typically a trust. The trust, in turn, issues securities, commonly referred to as asset-backed securities that are secured by the transferred loans and receivables. The trust uses the proceeds from the sale of such securities to pay the purchase price for the underlying loans or receivables. The loans and receivables of our Lending Trust and Charge Trust (collectively, the Trusts) securitized are reported as assets and the securities issued by the Trusts are reported as liabilities on our “Consolidated Balance Sheets.” Average discount rate — This calculation is generally designed to reflect pricing at merchants accepting general-purpose American Express cards. It represents the percentage of billed business (generated from both proprietary and GNS Card Member spending) retained by us from merchants we acquire, or for merchants acquired by a third party on our behalf, net of amounts retained by such third party. Basic cards-in-force — Proprietary basic consumer cards-in-force includes basic cards issued to the primary account owner, (i.e., not including additional supplemental cards issued on accounts). Proprietary basic small business and corporate cards-in-force includes both basic and supplemental cards issued. Non-proprietary basic cards-in-force includes cards that are issued and outstanding under network partnership agreements, except for supplemental cards and retail cobrand Card Member accounts which have had no out-of-store spending activity during the prior twelve-month period. Billed business — Includes activities (including cash advances) related to proprietary cards, cards issued under network partnership agreements (non-proprietary billed business), corporate payment services and certain insurance fees charged on proprietary cards. In-store spending activity within retail cobrand portfolios in GNS, from which we earn no revenue, is not included in non-proprietary billed business. Card billed business is included in the United States or outside the United States based on where the issuer is located. Capital ratios — Represents the minimum standards established by the regulatory agencies as a measure to determine whether the regulated entity has sufficient capital to absorb on- and off-balance sheet losses beyond current loss accrual estimates. Refer to the Capital Strategy section under “Consolidated Capital Resources and Liquidity” for further related definitions under Transitional Basel III and Fully Phased-in Basel III. Card Member — The individual holder of an issued American Express-branded charge, credit and certain prepaid cards. Card Member loans — Represents the outstanding amount due from Card Members for charges made on their American Express credit cards, as well as any interest charges and card-related fees. Card Member loans also include revolving balances on certain American Express charge card products. Card Member loans and receivables HFS — Beginning as of December 1, 2015 and continuing until the sales were completed, represents Card Member loans and receivables related to our cobrand partnerships with Costco in the United States and JetBlue. The JetBlue and Costco portfolio sales were completed on March 18 and June 17, 2016, respectively. Card Member receivables — Represents the outstanding amount due from Card Members for charges made on their American Express charge cards, as well as any card-related fees. Charge cards — Represents cards that generally carry no pre-set spending limits and are primarily designed as a method of payment and not as a means of financing purchases. Charge Card Members generally must pay the full amount billed each month. No finance charges are assessed on charge cards. Each charge card transaction is authorized based on its likely economics reflecting a Card Member’s most recent credit information and spend patterns. Some charge card accounts have additional Pay Over Time feature(s) that allow revolving of certain charges. 74 Table of Contents Cobrand cards — Cards issued under cobrand agreements with selected commercial firms. Pursuant to the cobrand agreements, we make payments to our cobrand partners, which can be significant, based primarily on the amount of Card Member spending and corresponding rewards earned on such spending and, under certain arrangements, on the number of accounts acquired and retained. In some cases, the partner is liable for providing rewards to the Card Member under the cobrand partner’s own loyalty program. Credit cards — Represents cards that have a range of revolving payment terms, grace periods, and rate and fee structures. Discount revenue — Represents revenue earned from fees generally charged to merchants who have entered into a card acceptance agreement. The discount fee generally is deducted from our payment for Card Member purchases. Discount revenue is reduced by incentive payments made to merchants, payments to third-party card issuing partners, cash-back reward costs and statement credits, corporate incentive payments and other similar items. Interest expense — Includes interest incurred primarily to fund Card Member loans and receivables, general corporate purposes and liquidity needs, and is recognized as incurred. Interest expense is divided principally into two categories: (i) deposits, which primarily relates to interest expense on deposits taken from customers and institutions, and (ii) debt, which primarily relates to interest expense on our long-term financing and short-term borrowings, (e.g., commercial paper, federal funds purchased, bank overdrafts and other short-term borrowings), as well as the realized impact of derivatives hedging interest rate risk on our long-term debt. Interest income — Includes (i) interest on loans, (ii) interest and dividends on investment securities and (iii) interest income on deposits with banks and other. Interest on loans — Assessed using the average daily balance method for Card Member loans and loans HFS. Unless the loan is classified as non-accrual, interest is recognized based upon the principal amount outstanding in accordance with the terms of the applicable account agreement until the outstanding balance is paid or written off. Interest and dividends on investment securities — Primarily relates to our performing fixed-income securities. Interest income is recognized as earned using the effective interest method, which adjusts the yield for security premiums and discounts, fees and other payments, so a constant rate of return is recognized on the outstanding balance of the related investment security throughout its term. Amounts are recognized until securities are in default or when it is likely that future interest payments will not be made as scheduled. Interest income on deposits with banks and other — Recognized as earned, and primarily relates to the placement of cash in excess of near-term funding requirements in interest-bearing time deposits, overnight sweep accounts, and other interest-bearing demand and call accounts. Liquidity Coverage Ratio — Represents the minimum standards established by the regulatory agencies as a measure to determine whether the regulated entity has sufficient liquidity to meet liquidity needs in periods of financial and economic stress. Merchant acquisition — Represents our process of entering into agreements with merchants to accept American Express-branded cards. Net card fees — Represents the card membership fees earned during the period. These fees are recognized as revenue over the covered card membership period (typically one year), net of the provision for projected refunds for Card Membership cancellation and deferred acquisition costs. Net interest yield on average Card Member loans — A non-GAAP measure that is computed by dividing adjusted net interest income by average Card Member loans, computed on an annualized basis. Reserves and net write-offs related to uncollectible interest are recorded through provisions for losses, and are thus not included in the net interest yield calculation. We believe net interest yield on average Card Member loans is useful to investors because it provides a measure of profitability of our Card Member loan portfolio. Net loss ratio — Represents the ratio of GCP charge card write-offs, consisting of principal (resulting from authorized transactions) and fee components, less recoveries, on Card Member receivables expressed as a percentage of gross amounts billed to corporate Card Members. Net write-off rate — principal only — Represents the amount of proprietary consumer or small business Card Member loans or receivables written off, consisting of principal (resulting from authorized transactions), less recoveries, as a percentage of the average loan or receivables balance during the period. Net write-off rate — principal, interest and fees — Includes, in the calculation of the net write-off rate, amounts for interest and fees in addition to principal for Card Member loans and fees in addition to principal for Card Member receivables. Operating expenses — Represents salaries and employee benefits, professional services, occupancy and equipment, and other expenses. 75 Table of Contents Return on average equity — Calculated by dividing one-year period net income by one-year average total shareholders’ equity. Total cards-in-force — Represents the total number of charge and credit cards that are issued and outstanding and accepted on our network. Non-proprietary cards-in-force includes all charge and credit cards that are issued and outstanding under network partnership agreements, except for retail cobrand Card Member accounts which have no out-of-store spending activity during the prior twelve-month period.

We undertake no obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statements. Factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from these forward-looking statements, include, but are not limited to, the following:  our ability to grow in the future, which will depend in part on the following: revenues growing consistently with current expectations, which could be impacted by, among other things, the factors identified in the subsequent bullet; credit performance remaining consistent with current expectations; the impact of any future contingencies, including, but not limited to, litigation-related settlements, judgments or expenses, the imposition of fines or civil money penalties, an increase in Card Member reimbursements, restructurings, impairments and changes in reserves; the ability to continue to realize benefits from restructuring actions and manage operating expense growth; the amount we spend on Card Member engagement and our ability to drive growth from such investments; changes in interest rates beyond current expectations (including the impact of hedge ineffectiveness and deposit rate increases); a greater impact from certain cobrand agreements than expected, which could be affected by volumes and Card Member engagement; the impact of regulation and litigation, which could affect the profitability of our business activities, limit our ability to pursue business opportunities, require changes to business practices or alter our relationships with partners, merchants and Card Members; our tax rate remaining in line with current expectations, which could be impacted by, among other things, changes in interpretations and assumptions we have made and actions we may take as a result of the Tax Act, our geographic mix of income, further changes in tax laws and regulation, unfavorable tax audits and other unanticipated tax items; and the impact of accounting changes and reclassifications;  our ability to grow revenues net of interest expense and maintain billings momentum, which could be impacted by, among other things, weakening economic conditions in the United States or internationally, a decline in consumer confidence impacting the willingness and ability of Card Members to sustain and grow spending, continued growth of Card Member loans, a greater erosion of the average discount rate than expected, the strengthening of the U.S. dollar, more cautious spending by large and global corporate Card Members, the willingness of Card Members to pay higher card fees, lower spending on new cards acquired than estimated; and will depend on factors such as our success in addressing competitive pressures and implementing our strategies and business initiatives, including growing profitable spending from existing and new Card Members, increasing penetration among middle market and small business clients, expanding our international footprint and increasing merchant acceptance;  changes in the substantial and increasing worldwide competition in the payments industry, including competitive pressure that may impact the prices we charge merchants that accept our cards, competition for cobrand relationships, competition from new and non-traditional competitors and the success of marketing, promotion or rewards programs;  the erosion of the average discount rate by a greater amount than anticipated, including as a result of changes in the mix of spending by location and industry, merchant negotiations (including merchant incentives, concessions and volume-related pricing discounts), competition, pricing regulation (including regulation of competitors’ interchange rates in the European Union and elsewhere), a greater shift of existing merchants into the OptBlue program and other factors;  our delinquency and write-off rates and growth of provisions for losses being higher than current expectations, which will depend in part on changes in the level of loan balances and delinquencies, mix of loan balances, loans and receivables related to new Card Members and other borrowers performing as expected, credit performance of new and enhanced lending products, unemployment rates, the volume of bankruptcies and recoveries of previously written-off loans;  our ability to continue to grow loans faster than the industry, which may be affected by increasing competition, brand perceptions and reputation, our ability to manage risk in a growing Card Member loan portfolio, and the behavior of Card Members and their actual spending and borrowing patterns, which in turn may be driven by our ability to issue new and enhanced card products, offer attractive non-card lending products, capture a greater share of existing Card Members’ spending and borrowings, reduce Card Member attrition and attract new customers; 76 Table of Contents  our net interest yield on average Card Member loans not remaining consistent with current levels, which will be influenced by, among other things, interest rates, changes in consumer behavior that affect loan balances, such as paydown rates, Card Member acquisition strategy, product mix, cost of funds, credit actions, including line size and other adjustments to credit availability, potential pricing changes and deposit rates, which could be impacted by, among other things, changes in benchmark interest rates, competitive pressure and regulatory constraints;  rewards expense and cost of Card Member services growing inconsistently from expectations, which will depend in part on Card Member behavior as it relates to their spending patterns, including the level of spend in bonus categories, and the redemption of rewards and offers, as well as the degree of interest of Card Members in the value proposition we offer; increasing competition, which could result in greater rewards offerings; our ability to enhance card products and services to make them attractive to Card Members; and the amount we spend on the promotion of enhanced services and rewards categories and the success of such promotion;  the actual amount to be spent on Card Member engagement, which will be based in part on management’s assessment of competitive opportunities; overall business performance and changes in macroeconomic conditions; the actual amount of advertising and Card Member acquisition costs; our ability to continue to shift Card Member acquisition to digital channels; contractual obligations with business partners and other fixed costs and prior commitments; management’s ability to identify attractive investment opportunities and make such investments, which could be impacted by business, regulatory or legal complexities; and our ability to realize efficiencies, optimize investment spending and control expenses to fund such spending;  our ability to manage operating expense growth, which could be impacted by the need to increase significant categories of operating expenses, such as consulting or professional fees, including as a result of increased litigation, compliance or regulatory-related costs, or fraud costs; continuing to implement and achieve benefits from reengineering plans, which could be impacted by factors such as an inability to mitigate the operational and other risks posed by potential staff reductions and underestimating hiring and other employee needs; higher than expected employee levels; the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates on costs; the payment of civil money penalties, disgorgement, restitution, non-income tax assessments and litigation-related settlements; impairments of goodwill or other assets; management’s decision to increase or decrease spending in such areas as technology, business and product development and sales forces; greater than expected inflation; the impact of accounting changes and reclassifications; and the level of M&A activity and related expenses;  our ability to satisfy our commitments to certain of our cobrand partners as part of the ongoing operations of the business, which will be impacted in part by competition, brand perceptions and reputation, and our ability to develop and market value propositions that appeal to current cobrand Card Members and new customers and offer attractive services and rewards programs, which will depend in part on ongoing investment in marketing and promotion expenses, new product innovation and development, Card Member acquisition efforts and enrollment processes, including through digital channels, and infrastructure to support new products, services and benefits;  changes affecting our plans regarding the return of capital to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases, which will depend on factors such as the pace at which we are able to rebuild our capital levels, including from earnings and a lower effective tax rate; the approval of our capital plans by our primary regulators; the amount we spend on acquisitions of companies; and our results of operations and economic environment in any given period;  implementation of legislation and additional guidance or context from the Internal Revenue Service, the U.S. Treasury Department, state and foreign taxing authorities, the Financial Accounting Standards Board or others regarding the Tax Act, and any future changes or amendments to that legislation;

 legal and regulatory developments, including with regard to broad payment system regulatory regimes, actions by the CFPB and other regulators and the stricter regulation of financial institutions, which could require us to make fundamental changes to many of our business practices, including our ability to continue certain GNS and other partnerships; exert further pressure on the average discount rate and GNS volumes; result in increased costs related to regulatory oversight, litigation-related settlements, judgments or expenses, restitution to Card Members or the imposition of fines or civil money penalties; materially affect our capital or liquidity requirements, results of operations or ability to pay dividends or repurchase our stock; or result in harm to the American Express brand;  uncertainty relating to the ultimate outcome of the antitrust lawsuit filed against us by the U.S. Department of Justice and certain state attorneys general, including the review of the case by the U.S. Supreme Court and the impact on existing private merchant cases and potentially additional litigation and/or arbitrations; 77 Table of Contents  our funding plan being implemented in a manner inconsistent with current expectations, which will depend on various factors such as future business growth, the impact of global economic, political and other events on market capacity, demand for securities we offer, regulatory changes, ability to securitize and sell receivables and the performance of receivables previously sold in securitization transactions;  changes in the financial condition and creditworthiness of our business partners, such as bankruptcies, restructurings or consolidations, including merchants that represent a significant portion of our business, such as the airline industry, or our partners in GNS or financial institutions that we rely on for routine funding and liquidity, which could materially affect our financial condition or results of operations; and  factors beyond our control such as fire, power loss, disruptions in telecommunications, severe weather conditions, natural disasters, health pandemics, terrorism, cyber-attacks or fraud, any of which could significantly affect demand for and spending on American Express cards, delinquency rates, loan balances and other aspects of our business and results of operations or disrupt our global network systems and ability to process transactions.

4962,AXP,AMERICAN EXPRESS CO,2019,"ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (MD&A) EXECUTIVE OVERVIEW BUSINESS INTRODUCTION We are a global services company with three reportable operating segments: Global Consumer Services Group (GCSG), Global Commercial Services (GCS) and Global Merchant and Network Services (GMNS). Corporate functions and certain other businesses and operations are included in Corporate & Other. The following types of revenue are generated from our various products and services: • Discount revenue, our largest revenue source, primarily represents the amount we earn on transactions occurring at merchants that have entered into a card acceptance agreement with us, or a Global Network Services (GNS) partner or other third-party merchant acquirer, for facilitating transactions between the merchants and Card Members. The amount of fees charged for accepting our cards as payment for goods or services, or merchant discount, varies with, among other factors, the industry in which the merchant does business, the merchant’s overall American Express-related transaction volume, the method of payment, the settlement terms with the merchant, the method of submission of transactions and, in certain instances, the geographic scope for the related card acceptance agreement between the merchant and us (e.g., domestic or global) and the transaction amount. In some instances, an additional flat transaction fee is assessed as part of the merchant discount, and additional fees may be charged such as a variable fee for “non-swiped” card transactions or for transactions using cards issued outside the United States at merchants located in the United States; • Interest on loans, principally represents interest income earned on outstanding balances; • Net card fees, represent revenue earned from annual card membership fees, which vary based on the type of card and the number of cards for each account; • Other fees and commissions, primarily represent Card Member delinquency fees, foreign currency conversion fees charged to Card Members, Membership Rewards program fees, loyalty coalition-related fees, travel commissions and fees, and service fees earned from merchants; and • Other revenue, primarily represents revenues arising from contracts with partners of our Global Network Services (GNS) business (including commissions and signing fees less issuer rate payments), cross-border Card Member spending, ancillary merchant-related fees, insurance premiums earned from Card Members, prepaid card and Travelers Cheque-related revenue and earnings from equity method investments (including the American Express Global Business Travel Joint Venture (the GBT JV)). FINANCIAL HIGHLIGHTS For 2018, we reported net income of $6.9 billion and diluted earnings per share of $7.91. This compared to $2.7 billion of net income and $2.99 diluted earnings per share for 2017, and $5.4 billion of net income and $5.61 diluted earnings per share for 2016. 2018 results included: • $496 million of certain discrete tax benefits in the fourth quarter. 2017 results included: • A $2.6 billion tax charge related to the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the Tax Act) in the fourth quarter. 2016 results included: • A $1.1 billion ($677 million after tax) gain on the sale of Card Member loans and receivables related to our cobrand partnership with Costco in the second quarter; • $410 million ($266 million after tax) of net restructuring charges; and • A $127 million ($79 million after tax) gain on the sale of Card Member loans and receivables related to our cobrand partnership with JetBlue in the first quarter. NON-GAAP MEASURES We prepare our Consolidated Financial Statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (GAAP).

Our calculations of non-GAAP financial measures may differ from the calculations of similarly titled measures by other companies. 34 Table of Contents TAX CUTS AND JOBS ACT On December 22, 2017, the U.S. government enacted comprehensive tax legislation commonly referred to as the Tax Act, which made broad and complex changes to the U.S. federal corporate income tax rules. Most notably, effective January 1, 2018, the Tax Act reduced the U.S. federal statutory corporate income tax rate from 35 percent to 21 percent, introduced a territorial tax system in which future dividends paid from earnings outside the United States to a U.S. corporation are not subject to U.S. federal taxation and imposed new U.S. federal corporate income taxes on certain foreign operations. For 2019, we estimate that our tax rate will be approximately 22 percent, before discrete tax items. BUSINESS ENVIRONMENT Our results for 2018 reflect strong performance and our focus on, and investment in, our four strategic imperatives – expand our leadership in the premium consumer space, build on our strong position in commercial payments, strengthen our global, integrated network and make American Express an essential part of our customers’ digital lives. Billings and revenue growth reflected momentum across our businesses. We continued to invest in new services and Card Member benefits, new card acquisitions and expanding our merchant network. During the year, we returned a significant amount of capital to our shareholders through our share buyback program and an increase in our dividend, while increasing our capital ratios. Our results also included the benefit of a lower tax provision due to a reduction in the U.S. corporate income tax rate resulting from the Tax Act, along with several discrete tax benefits. Our worldwide billed business increased 9 percent over the prior year, reflecting strong proprietary billings growth both in the U.S. and internationally, and across customer segments. Proprietary billings growth was driven by increased spending within our premium consumer base, as well as consistent double digit growth throughout the year from our small and medium enterprise business customers. GNS billed business declined due to the ongoing and expected impact of changes in the regulatory environment in the EU and Australia; excluding the billings from those geographies, GNS billed business grew 8 percent year-over-year. Revenues net of interest expense increased 9 percent, reflecting growth in Card Member spending, net interest income and card fees, partially offset by a year-over-year decline in the average discount rate. We continue to be focused on driving discount revenue growth, not the average discount rate. Card fee revenue saw double digit year-over-year growth and reflected increased engagement from both new and existing customers as a result of the benefits that we have added to our card products around the world. Card Member loans grew year-over-year, as we continued to expand our lending relationships with existing customers and acquired new Card Members, including the acquisition of the portion of the Hilton cobrand portfolio that we did not previously own (the acquired Hilton portfolio). Provisions for losses increased, reflecting growth in the loan portfolio and a higher lending write-off rate. Write-off rates continue to modestly increase due to ongoing seasoning of our loan portfolio. Spending on customer engagement (the aggregate of rewards, Card Member services and marketing and business development expenses) increased year-over-year across all categories. Increases in rewards and Card Member services reflected the growth in billings and continued higher levels of investment across many of our premium travel services. Marketing and business development expense increased due to higher spending on growth initiatives, including new card acquisition, our global brand campaign, continued investments in our cobrand partnerships and higher corporate client incentives. While impacted by several discrete items, operating expenses were flat year-over-year and remained well controlled, which allowed for additional investment in customer engagement. We plan to continue making investments in our business to generate and sustain a strong level of revenue growth, which we believe is the foundation for steady and consistent double-digit EPS growth. While we continue to see some headwinds from an uncertain economic environment, regulation in countries around the world and intense competition, we remain focused on delivering differentiated value to our merchants, Card Members and business partners and delivering appropriate returns to our shareholders. See “Supervision and Regulation” in “Business” for information on legislative and regulatory changes that could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition and “Risk Factors” for information on the potential impacts of economic, political and competitive conditions and certain litigation and regulatory matters on our business. 35 Table of Contents CONSOLIDATED RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Effective January 1, 2018, we adopted new revenue recognition guidance using the full retrospective method, which applies the new standard to each prior reporting period presented, starting January 1, 2016. The adoption changed the recognition timing and classification of certain revenues and expenses, including changes to the presentation of certain credit and charge card related costs that were previously netted against discount revenue. The adoption did not have a significant impact on our consolidated financial position, net income, equity or cash flows. Refer to Note 1 to the “Consolidated Financial Statements” for additional information. In addition, we reclassified certain business development expenses, from Other expenses to Marketing and business development expenses, which was not directly attributable to the adoption of the new revenue recognition guidance. During 2018, we changed the methodology used to allocate certain corporate overhead costs and interest income and expense to the operating segments, and made minor changes to the intercompany settlement process. Prior period amounts have been revised to conform to the current period presentation.

(b) Return on average equity (ROE) is computed by dividing (i) one-year period net income ($6.9 billion, $2.7 billion and $5.4 billion for 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively) by (ii) one-year average total shareholders’ equity ($20.7 billion for 2018 and $20.9 billion for both 2017 and 2016). (c) The adjusted ETRs for 2018 and 2017 are non-GAAP measures. The 2018 adjusted ETR excludes a benefit of $496 million relating to changes in the tax method of accounting for certain expenses, the resolution of certain prior years’ tax audits, and a final adjustment to our 2017 provisional tax charge related to the Tax Act. The 2017 adjusted ETR excludes the $2.6 billion charge related to the Tax Act. Management believes the adjusted ETRs are useful in evaluating our tax rates in comparison with the other presented periods.

TABLE 2: TOTAL REVENUES NET OF INTEREST EXPENSE SUMMARY Years Ended December 31, Change Change (Millions, except percentages) 2018 2017 2016 2018 vs. 2017 2017 vs. 2016 Discount revenue $ 24,721 $ 22,890 $ 22,377 $ 1,831 8 % $ 513 2 % Net card fees 3,441 3,090 2,886 351 11 204 7 Other fees and commissions 3,153 2,990 2,718 163 5 272 10 Other 1,360 1,457 1,678 (97 ) (7 ) (221 ) (13 ) Total non-interest revenues 32,675 30,427 29,659 2,248 7 768 3 Total interest income 10,606 8,563 7,484 2,043 24 1,079 14 Total interest expense 2,943 2,112 1,705 831 39 407 24 Net interest income 7,663 6,451 5,779 1,212 19 672 12 Total revenues net of interest expense $ 40,338 $ 36,878 $ 35,438 $ 3,460 9 % $ 1,440 4 % 36 Table of Contents TOTAL REVENUES NET OF INTEREST EXPENSE Discount revenue increased in both periods, primarily due to growth in billed business, partially offset by decreases in the average discount rate. U.S. billed business increased 10 percent in 2018 compared to 2017 and 1 percent in 2017 compared to 2016. Non-U.S. billed business increased 8 percent in 2018 compared to 2017 and 12 percent in 2017 compared to 2016. See Tables 5 and 6 for more details on billed business performance. The average discount rate was 2.37 percent, 2.40 percent and 2.43 percent for 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively. Several factors continued to drive the average discount rate decline, including impacts from decisions we made with respect to certain strategic partners, the impact of regulatory changes in Europe and Australia, and the continued roll out of the OptBlue program, though the impacts began to moderate in the latter half of the year. Net card fees increased in both periods, primarily driven by growth in the Platinum and Delta portfolios, as well as growth in certain key international countries. Other fees and commissions increased in both periods, primarily driven by growth in foreign exchange conversion revenue and increases in delinquency fees. Other revenues decreased in both periods. The decrease in 2018 was partly driven by a modification of one of our GNS arrangements, lower breakage related to our prepaid cards and a decline in revenues related to the GBT JV. The decrease in 2017 was primarily driven by prior-year revenues related to the Loyalty Edge business, which was sold in the fourth quarter of 2016, and a contractual payment from a GNS partner also in the prior year. Interest income increased in both periods, primarily reflecting higher average Card Member loans and higher yields. The growth in average Card Member loans in 2018 was primarily driven by expanding relationships with existing customers, as well as the inclusion of the acquired Hilton portfolio. The growth in average Card Member loans in 2017 was primarily driven by a mix shift towards non-cobrand lending products, where Card Members tend to revolve more of their loan balances. The increase in yields in both periods was primarily driven by a greater percentage of loans at higher rate buckets, specific pricing actions and increases in benchmark interest rates. Interest expense increased in both periods, primarily driven by higher interest rates and higher average long-term debt and, additionally in 2018, by higher average deposits. TABLE 3: PROVISIONS FOR LOSSES SUMMARY Years Ended December 31, Change Change (Millions, except percentages) 2018 2017 2016 2018 vs. 2017 2017 vs. 2016 Charge card $ 937 $ 795 $ 696 $ 142 18 % $ 99 14 % Card Member loans 2,266 1,868 1,235 398 21 633 51 Other 149 97 96 52 54 1 1 Total provisions for losses $ 3,352 $ 2,760 $ 2,027 $ 592 21 % $ 733 36 % PROVISIONS FOR LOSSES Charge card provision for losses increased in both periods, primarily driven by growth in receivables due to increased billed business and higher net write-offs, largely in the corporate and small business portfolios. Card Member loans provision for losses increased in both periods, driven by strong loan growth, higher net write-offs and a modest increase in delinquencies. The increases in write-offs and delinquencies were due in part to the seasoning of recent loan vintages. Other provision for losses increased in 2018 compared to 2017 and was relatively flat in 2017 compared to 2016. The increase in 2018 was primarily due to growth in the non-card lending and commercial financing portfolios. 2017 compared to 2016 also reflected growth in the non-card lending portfolio, which was offset by improving credit performance in the commercial financing portfolio. 37 Table of Contents TABLE 4: EXPENSES SUMMARY Years Ended December 31, Change Change (Millions, except percentages) 2018 2017 2016 2018 vs. 2017 2017 vs. 2016 Marketing and business development(a) $ 6,470 $ 5,722 $ 6,249 $ 748 13 % $ (527 ) (8 )% Card Member rewards 9,696 8,687 7,819 1,009 12 868 11 Card Member services 1,777 1,392 1,100 385 28 292 27 Total marketing, business development, rewards and Card Member services 17,943 15,801 15,168 2,142 14 633 4 Salaries and employee benefits 5,250 5,258 5,259 (8 ) ― (1 ) ― Other, net(a) 5,671 5,634 4,942 37 1 692 14 Total expenses $ 28,864 $ 26,693 $ 25,369 $ 2,171 8 % $ 1,324 5 % (a) Effective January 1, 2018, includes reclassification of certain business development expenses from Other expenses to Marketing and business development that are not directly attributable to the adoption of the new revenue recognition guidance. Prior periods have been conformed to the current period presentation. EXPENSES Marketing and business development expense increased in 2018 compared to 2017 and decreased in 2017 compared to 2016. The variances for both periods were primarily driven by lower levels of spending on growth initiatives in 2017 compared to the preceding and subsequent years. The higher spending on growth initiatives in 2018 included our new global brand campaign, continued investments in partnerships, and increased corporate client incentives driven by higher volumes. Card Member rewards expense increased in both periods. The increase in 2018 was driven by increases in Membership Rewards and cash-back reward expenses of $558 million and cobrand rewards expense of $451 million, both of which were primarily driven by higher spending volumes. The increase in 2017 was primarily driven by higher spending volumes and enhancements to U.S. Consumer and Small Business Platinum rewards during 2017. The Membership Rewards Ultimate Redemption Rate (URR) for current program participants increased to 96 percent (rounded up) at December 31, 2018, compared to 95 percent (rounded down) at December 31, 2017 and 2016. Card Member services expense increased in both periods, primarily driven by higher usage of travel-related benefits and enhanced Platinum card benefits. Salaries and employee benefits expense was flat for both periods, reflecting increases in incentive compensation, offset by lower restructuring charges compared to the respective prior year. Other expense increased in both periods. The increase in 2018 was primarily driven by higher technology expenses, a loss in the current year on a transaction involving the operations of our prepaid reloadable and gift card business, and a foreign exchange loss related to the devaluation of the Argentine peso, which was deemed a highly inflationary currency as of July 1, 2018, all partially offset by current-year unrealized gains on certain equity investments and charges in the prior year related to our U.S. loyalty coalition and prepaid businesses. The increase in 2017 was primarily driven by gains in 2016 on the sales of the HFS portfolios, which were recognized as an expense reduction, partially offset by lower technology-related costs in 2017 and higher Loyalty Edge-related costs in 2016. INCOME TAXES The effective tax rate for 2018 was 14.8 percent and reflects a benefit of $496 million relating to changes in the tax method of accounting for certain expenses, the resolution of certain prior years’ tax audits and an adjustment to the 2017 provisional tax charge related to the Tax Act. The tax rate for 2018 also reflects the reduction in the U.S. federal statutory rate from 35 percent to 21 percent as a result of the Tax Act. The effective tax rate for 2017 was 63.0 percent and reflects the charge of $2.6 billion related to the Tax Act that was accounted for as a provisional estimate under Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 118. Refer to Note 21 to the “Consolidated Financial Statements” for additional information. The tax rates in all periods reflect the level of pretax income in relation to recurring permanent tax benefits and the geographic mix of business. 38 Table of Contents TABLE 5: SELECTED CARD-RELATED STATISTICAL INFORMATION Change Change Years Ended December 31, 2018 2017 2016 2018 vs. 2017 2017 vs. 2016 Billed business: (billions) U.S. $ 777.6 $ 708.3 $ 700.4 10 % 1 % Outside the U.S. 406.4 376.9 337.1 8 12 Total $ 1,184.0 $ 1,085.2 $ 1,037.5 9 5 Proprietary $ 1,002.6 $ 900.6 $ 863.8 11 % 4 % GNS 181.4 184.6 173.7 (2 ) 6 Total $ 1,184.0 $ 1,085.2 $ 1,037.5 9 5 Cards-in-force: (millions) U.S. 53.7 50.0 47.5 7 5 Outside the U.S. 60.3 62.8 62.4 (4 ) 1 Total 114.0 112.8 109.9 1 3 Proprietary 69.1 64.6 61.3 7 5 GNS 44.9 48.2 48.6 (7 ) (1 ) Total 114.0 112.8 109.9 1 3 Basic cards-in-force: (millions) U.S. 42.3 39.4 37.4 7 5 Outside the U.S. 50.3 52.2 51.7 (4 ) 1 Total 92.6 91.6 89.1 1 3 Average proprietary basic Card Member spending: (dollars) U.S. $ 20,840 $ 20,317 $ 18,808 3 8 Outside the U.S. $ 15,756 $ 14,277 $ 13,073 10 9 Worldwide Average $ 19,340 $ 18,519 $ 17,216 4 8 Card Member loans: (billions) U.S. $ 72.0 $ 64.5 $ 58.3 12 11 Outside the U.S. 9.9 8.9 7.0 11 27 Total $ 81.9 $ 73.4 $ 65.3 12 12 Average discount rate(a) 2.37 % 2.40 % 2.43 % Average fee per card (dollars)(b) $ 51 $ 49 $ 44 4 % 11 % (a) Effective January 1, 2018, we began including billed business related to certain business-to-business products in the calculation of the average discount rate to reflect our expanding business-to-business product offerings.

(b) We present a net write-off rate based on principal losses only (i.e., excluding interest and/or fees) to be consistent with industry convention. In addition, as our practice is to include uncollectible interest and/or fees as part of our total provision for losses, a net write-off rate including principal, interest and/or fees is also presented. The net write-off rates and 30+ days past due as a percentage of total for Card Member receivables relate to GCSG and Global Small Business Services (GSBS) Card Member receivables. (c) Global Corporate Payments (GCP) reflects global, large and middle market corporate accounts. For GCP Card Member receivables, delinquency data is tracked based on days past billing status rather than days past due. A Card Member account is considered 90 days past billing if payment has not been received within 90 days of the Card Member’s billing statement date. In addition, if we initiate collection procedures on an account prior to the account becoming 90 days past billing, the associated Card Member receivable balance is classified as 90 days past billing. These amounts are shown above as 90+ Days Past Due for presentation purposes. GCP delinquency data for periods other than 90+ days past billing is not available due to system constraints. 41 Table of Contents TABLE 8: NET INTEREST YIELD ON AVERAGE CARD MEMBER LOANS Years Ended December 31, (Millions, except percentages and where indicated) 2018 2017 2016 Net interest income $ 7,663 $ 6,451 $ 5,779 Exclude: Interest expense not attributable to our Card Member loan portfolio (a) 1,456 1,149 954 Interest income not attributable to our Card Member loan portfolio (b) (1,010 ) (637 ) (405 ) Adjusted net interest income (c) $ 8,109 $ 6,963 $ 6,328 Average Card Member loans including HFS loan portfolios (billions) $ 75.8 $ 66.7 $ 65.8 Net interest income divided by average Card Member loans (c) 10.1 % 9.7 % 8.8 % Net interest yield on average Card Member loans (c) 10.7 % 10.4 % 9.6 % (a) Primarily represents interest expense attributable to maintaining our corporate liquidity pool and funding Card Member receivables. (b) Primarily represents interest income attributable to Other loans, interest-bearing deposits and the fixed income investment portfolios. (c) Adjusted net interest income and net interest yield on average Card Member loans are non-GAAP measures. Refer to “Glossary of Selected Terminology” for the definitions of these terms. We believe adjusted net interest income is useful to investors because it represents the interest expense and interest income attributable to our Card Member loan portfolio and is a component of net interest yield on average Card Member loans, which provides a measure of profitability of our Card Member loan portfolio. Net interest yield on average Card Member loans reflects adjusted net interest income divided by average Card Member loans, computed on an annualized basis. Net interest income divided by average Card Member loans, computed on an annualized basis, a GAAP measure, includes elements of total interest income and total interest expense that are not attributable to the Card Member loan portfolio, and thus is not representative of net interest yield on average Card Member loans. 42 Table of Contents BUSINESS SEGMENT RESULTS We consider a combination of factors when evaluating the composition of our reportable operating segments, including the results reviewed by the chief operating decision maker, economic characteristics, products and services offered, classes of customers, product distribution channels, geographic considerations (primarily United States versus outside the United States) and regulatory considerations. Refer to Note 25 to the “Consolidated Financial Statements” and Part I, Item 1. “Business” for additional discussion of products and services that comprise each segment. Effective for the second quarter of 2018, we realigned our reportable operating segments to reflect the organizational changes announced during the first quarter of 2018. Prior periods have been revised to conform to the new reportable operating segments, which are as follows:  GCSG, including proprietary consumer cards globally, consumer services including travel services and non-card financing products, certain international joint ventures and our partnership agreements in China;  GCS, including the proprietary GCP business, GSBS and commercial financing products; and  GMNS, including the GNS business, the Global Merchant Services business, global loyalty coalition businesses, reloadable prepaid and gift card businesses. Corporate functions and certain other businesses and operations, including the GBT JV, are included in Corporate & Other. Results of the reportable operating segments generally treat each segment as a stand-alone business. The management reporting process that derives these results allocates revenue and expense using various methodologies as described below. TOTAL REVENUES NET OF INTEREST EXPENSE We allocate discount revenue and certain other revenues among segments using a transfer pricing methodology. Within the GCSG and GCS segments, discount revenue generally reflects the issuer component of the overall discount revenue generated by each segment’s Card Members; within the GMNS segment, discount revenue generally reflects the network and acquirer component of the overall discount revenue. Net card fees and other fees and commissions are directly attributable to the segment in which they are reported. Interest and fees on loans and certain investment income is directly attributable to the segment in which it is reported. Interest expense represents an allocated funding cost based on a combination of segment funding requirements and internal funding rates. PROVISIONS FOR LOSSES The provisions for losses are directly attributable to the segment in which they are reported. EXPENSES Marketing and business development expense is included in each segment based on the actual expenses incurred. Global brand advertising is primarily reflected in Corporate & Other and may be allocated to the segments based on the actual expense incurred. Rewards and Card Member services expenses are included in each segment based on the actual expenses incurred within the segment. Salaries and employee benefits and other operating expenses reflect expenses such as professional services, occupancy and equipment and communications incurred directly within each segment. In addition, expenses related to support services, such as technology costs, are allocated to each segment primarily based on support service activities directly attributable to the segment. Certain other overhead expenses are allocated from Corporate & Other to the segments based on the relative levels of revenue and Card Member loans and receivables. INCOME TAXES An income tax provision (benefit) is allocated to each reportable operating segment based on the effective tax rates applicable to the various businesses that comprise the segment. The 2017 $2.6 billion charge related to the Tax Act was allocated in full to Corporate & Other. 43 Table of Contents GLOBAL CONSUMER SERVICES GROUP TABLE 9: GCSG SELECTED INCOME STATEMENT DATA Years Ended December 31, Change Change (Millions, except percentages) 2018 2017 2016 2018 vs. 2017 2017 vs. 2016 Revenues Non-interest revenues $ 14,675 $ 13,378 $ 12,993 $ 1,297 10 % $ 385 3 % Interest income 8,323 6,789 6,005 1,534 23 784 13 Interest expense 1,542 1,047 828 495 47 219 26 Net interest income 6,781 5,742 5,177 1,039 18 565 11 Total revenues net of interest expense 21,456 19,120 18,170 2,336 12 950 5 Provisions for losses 2,430 1,996 1,390 434 22 606 44 Total revenues net of interest expense after provisions for losses 19,026 17,124 16,780 1,902 11 344 2 Expenses Marketing, business development, rewards and Card Member services 10,774 9,233 8,714 1,541 17 519 6 Salaries and employee benefits and other operating expenses 4,538 4,246 3,558 292 7 688 19 Total expenses 15,312 13,479 12,272 1,833 14 1,207 10 Pretax segment income 3,714 3,645 4,508 69 2 (863 ) (19 ) Income tax provision 637 1,053 1,469 (416 ) (40 ) (416 ) (28 ) Segment income $ 3,077 $ 2,592 $ 3,039 $ 485 19 % $ (447 ) (15 )% Effective tax rate 17.2 % 28.9 % 32.6 % GCSG primarily issues a wide range of proprietary consumer cards globally. GCSG also provides services to consumers, including travel services and non-card financing products, and manages certain international joint ventures and our partnership agreements in China. TOTAL REVENUES NET OF INTEREST EXPENSE Non-interest revenues increased in 2018 compared to 2017, primarily driven by discount revenue, which increased 10 percent, reflecting an increase in proprietary consumer billed business of 12 percent, partially offset by a decline in the average discount rate. U.S. proprietary consumer billed business increased 10 percent and non-U.S. proprietary consumer billed business increased 17 percent. The increases in billed business reflected higher cards-in-force and higher average spend per card. The increase in non-interest revenues was also driven by 13 percent growth in net card fees and increased other fees and commissions. The increase in net card fees was driven primarily by growth in the Platinum and Delta portfolios, as well as growth in card fees across certain key international countries. The increase in other fees and commissions was primarily driven by increases in delinquency fees, travel commissions and foreign exchange conversion revenue. Net interest income increased in 2018 compared to 2017, primarily driven by growth in average Card Member loans and higher yields, partially offset by higher interest expense, primarily driven by higher cost of funds. The growth in average Card Member loans was primarily driven by expanding relationships with existing customers, as well as the inclusion of the acquired Hilton portfolio. The increase in yields was primarily driven by a greater percentage of loans at higher rate buckets and specific pricing actions. Total revenues net of interest expense increased in 2017 compared to 2016, primarily driven by higher discount revenue, reflecting billed business growth. The increase also reflected higher net interest income, primarily driven by growth in average Card Member loans and higher yields, partially offset by higher interest expense. PROVISIONS FOR LOSSES Provisions for losses increased in both periods, primarily driven by increased Card Member loans provision, reflecting strong loan growth and higher write-offs, in part due to the seasoning of recent loan vintages. The increase in 2017 was additionally driven by a shift in mix towards non-cobrand lending products, which tend to have higher write-off rates. Refer to Table 10 for the charge card and lending write-off rates for 2018, 2017 and 2016. 44 Table of Contents EXPENSES Marketing, business development, rewards and Card Member services expenses increased in 2018 compared to 2017. Card Member rewards expense increased 13 percent, primarily driven by increased spending volumes. Marketing and business development expense increased 18 percent, primarily due to higher spending on growth initiatives and continued investments in partnerships. Card Member services expense increased 29 percent, primarily driven by higher usage of travel-related benefits and the enhanced Platinum card benefits. Salaries and employee benefits and other operating expense increased in 2018 compared to 2017, primarily driven by increases in payroll costs and higher technology and other servicing-related costs, partially offset by unrealized gains on certain equity investments. Total expenses increased in 2017 compared to 2016, primarily reflecting the gains on the sales of the HFS portfolios in the prior year, which were recognized as an expense reduction in other expenses, higher Card Member rewards expense resulting from higher spending volumes and increased Card Member services expense resulting from higher usage of travel-related benefits. Income tax provision decreased in 2018 compared to 2017, primarily reflecting the resolution of certain prior years’ tax audits and the reduction in the U.S. federal statutory tax rate as a result of the Tax Act.

In addition, GCS provides commercial financing products. TOTAL REVENUES NET OF INTEREST EXPENSE Non-interest revenues increased in 2018 compared to 2017, reflecting a 9 percent increase in discount revenue, primarily driven by growth in billed business from small and medium sized businesses, partially offset by a decline in the average discount rate. Net interest income increased in 2018 compared to 2017, primarily driven by an increase in average Card Member loans and higher yields, partially offset by higher interest expense, reflecting an increase in the cost of funds. Total revenues net of interest expense increased in 2017 compared to 2016, primarily driven by higher discount revenue due to increases in billed business, higher net card fees and higher other fees and commissions, primarily due to growth in the U.S. small business Platinum portfolio and higher delinquency fees, respectively. PROVISIONS FOR LOSSES Provisions for losses increased in both periods. The increase in 2018 compared to 2017 was primarily driven by growth in Card Member loans and receivables and the commercial financing portfolio, as well as higher net write-offs across both corporate and small business portfolios. The increase in 2017 compared to 2016 was primarily due to growth in both Card Member receivables and loans, as well as increases in net write-off and delinquency rates, all of which were partially offset by improving credit performance in the commercial financing portfolio. EXPENSES Marketing, business development, rewards and Card Member services expenses increased in 2018 compared to 2017, primarily driven by Card Member rewards expense, which increased 9 percent reflecting higher spending volumes, and marketing and business development expense, which increased primarily due to an increase in spending on growth initiatives. Salaries and employee benefits and other operating expenses increased in 2018 compared to 2017, primarily driven by higher technology and other servicing-related costs. Total expenses increased in 2017 compared to 2016, primarily driven by increased Card Member rewards expense due to the Platinum rewards enhancements and higher spending volumes, and the prior-year gains on the sales of the HFS portfolios. Income tax provision decreased in 2018 compared to 2017, primarily reflecting the resolution of certain prior years’ tax audits and the reduction in the U.S. federal statutory tax rate as a result of the Tax Act. 48 Table of Contents TABLE 13: GCS SELECTED STATISTICAL INFORMATION As of or for the Years Ended December 31, Change Change (Millions, except percentages and where indicated) 2018 2017 2016 2018 vs. 2017 2017 vs. 2016 Proprietary billed business (billions) $ 486.2 $ 438.1 $ 408.0 11 % 7 % Proprietary cards-in-force 14.5 14.0 13.6 4 3 Average Card Member spending (dollars) $ 34,058 $ 31,729 $ 28,515 7 11 Total segment assets (billions)(a) $ 51.8 $ 49.1 $ 43.3 5 13 Card Member loans (billions) $ 12.4 $ 11.1 $ 9.5 12 17 Card Member receivables (billions) $ 34.4 $ 33.1 $ 29.0 4 14 GSBS Card Member loans:(b) Total loans (billions) $ 12.4 $ 11.0 $ 9.5 13 16 Average loans (billions) $ 11.7 $ 10.3 $ 8.6 14 % 20 % Net write-off rate - principal only(c) 1.7 % 1.6 % 1.4 % Net write-off rate - principal, interest and fees(c) 2.0 % 1.9 % 1.7 % 30+ days past due as a % of total 1.3 % 1.2 % 1.1 % Calculation of Net Interest Yield on Average Card Member Loans: Net interest income $ 794 $ 766 $ 737 Exclude: Interest expense not attributable to our Card Member loan portfolio(d) 609 461 380 Interest income not attributable to our Card Member loan portfolio(e) (161 ) (114 ) (114 ) Adjusted net interest income(f) $ 1,242 $ 1,113 $ 1,003 Average Card Member loans including HFS loan portfolios (billions) $ 11.8 $ 10.3 $ 9.7 Net interest income divided by average Card Member loans(f) 6.7 % 7.4 % 7.6 % Net interest yield on average Card Member loans(f) 10.5 % 10.8 % 10.4 % GCP Card Member receivables: Total receivables (billions) $ 17.7 $ 17.0 $ 14.8 4 % 15 % 90+ days past billing as a % of total(g) 0.7 % 0.9 % 0.9 % Net loss ratio (as a % of charge volume)(h) 0.11 % 0.10 % 0.09 % GSBS Card Member receivables: Total receivables (billions) $ 16.7 $ 16.1 $ 14.3 4 % 13 % Net write-off rate - principal only(c) 1.7 % 1.6 % 1.5 % Net write-off rate - principal and fees(c) 2.0 % 1.8 % 1.7 % 30+ days past due as a % of total 1.6 % 1.6 % 1.6 % (a) During 2018, we changed the methodology used to allocate certain corporate overhead costs and interest income and expense to the operating segments.

Prior period amounts have been revised to conform to the current period presentation. GMNS operates a global payments network that processes and settles card transactions, acquires merchants and provides multi-channel marketing programs and capabilities, services and data analytics, leveraging our global integrated network. GMNS manages our partnership relationships with third-party card issuers, merchant acquirers and a prepaid reloadable and gift card program manager, licensing the American Express brand and extending the reach of the global network. GMNS also manages loyalty coalition businesses in certain countries. TOTAL REVENUES NET OF INTEREST EXPENSE Non-interest revenues increased in 2018 compared to 2017, primarily driven by an increase in discount revenue, which reflected growth in billed business, partially offset by a decline in the average discount rate and a modification of one of our GNS arrangements. Net interest income increased in 2018 compared to 2017, reflecting a higher interest expense credit relating to internal transfer pricing and funding rates, which resulted in a net benefit for GMNS due to its merchant payables. Total revenues net of interest expense was flat in 2017 compared to 2016, primarily driven by a decrease in non-interest revenues reflecting a prior-year contractual payment from a GNS partner, offset by an increase in net interest income reflecting a higher interest expense credit. EXPENSES Marketing, business development, rewards and Card Member services expenses increased in 2018 compared to 2017, primarily driven by payments related to a new partnership agreement with our prepaid reloadable and gift card program manager, partially offset by lower levels of spending on growth initiatives. Salaries and employee benefits and other operating expense decreased in 2018 compared to 2017, primarily driven by prior-year charges related to our U.S. loyalty coalition and prepaid businesses, partially offset by a prior-year benefit from a change in the liability related to non-delivery of goods and services by merchants. Total expenses decreased in 2017 compared to 2016, primarily driven by lower marketing and business development expenses, reflecting lower levels of spending on growth initiatives, partially offset by an increase in operating expenses reflecting charges related to the US. loyalty coalition and prepaid businesses. Income tax provision decreased in 2018 compared to 2017, primarily reflecting the resolution of certain prior years’ tax audits and the reduction in the U.S. federal statutory tax rate as a result of the Tax Act. 50 Table of Contents CORPORATE & OTHER Corporate functions and certain other businesses are included in Corporate & Other. Corporate & Other net expense was $0.6 billion, $3.6 billion and $1.1 billion in 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively. The decrease in 2018 compared to 2017 was primarily driven by the 2017 Tax Act charge and unrealized gains on certain equity investments, partially offset by a loss on a transaction involving the operations of our prepaid reloadable and gift card business and a foreign exchange loss related to the devaluation of the Argentine peso, which was deemed a highly inflationary currency as of July 1, 2018. The increase in 2017 compared to 2016 was primarily driven by the Tax Act charge, partially offset by higher restructuring charges in 2016. 51 Table of Contents CONSOLIDATED CAPITAL RESOURCES AND LIQUIDITY Our balance sheet management objectives are to maintain: • A solid and flexible equity capital profile; • A broad, deep and diverse set of funding sources to finance our assets and meet operating requirements; and • Liquidity programs that enable us to continuously meet expected future financing obligations and business requirements for at least a twelve-month period in the event we are unable to continue to raise new funds under our traditional funding programs during a substantial weakening in economic conditions. CAPITAL STRATEGY Our objective is to retain sufficient levels of capital generated through earnings and other sources to maintain a solid equity capital base and to provide flexibility to support future business growth. We believe capital allocated to growing businesses with a return on risk-adjusted equity in excess of our costs will generate shareholder value. The level and composition of our consolidated capital position are determined through our Internal Capital Adequacy Assessment Process, which takes into account our business activities, as well as marketplace conditions and requirements or expectations of credit rating agencies, regulators and shareholders, among others. Our consolidated capital position is also influenced by subsidiary capital requirements. As a bank holding company, we are also subject to regulatory requirements administered by the U.S. federal banking agencies. The Federal Reserve has established specific capital adequacy guidelines that involve quantitative measures of assets, liabilities and certain off-balance sheet items. We report our capital ratios using the Basel III capital definitions and the Basel III standardized approach for calculating risk-weighted assets. The Basel III minimum requirements were fully phased in as of January 1, 2018 and the Basel III buffers were fully phased in as of January 1, 2019. We also report capital adequacy standards on a parallel basis to regulators under Basel requirements for advanced approaches institutions. The parallel period will continue until we receive regulatory approval to exit parallel reporting, at which point we will begin publicly disclosing regulatory risk-based capital ratios using both the standardized and advanced approaches, and will be required to use the lower of the regulatory risk-based capital ratios based on the standardized or advanced approaches to determine whether we are in compliance with minimum capital requirements. As described in Part I, Item 1. ""Supervision and Regulation,"" the Economic Growth, Regulatory Relief, and Consumer Protection Act and related proposed rules may exempt certain banking organizations, such as us, from the advanced approaches requirements. The following table presents our regulatory risk-based capital ratios and leverage ratios as of December 31, 2018. Effective April 1, 2018, our bank subsidiaries, American Express Centurion Bank and American Express Bank, FSB, were merged to become American Express National Bank (AENB).

We seek to maintain capital levels and ratios in excess of the minimum regulatory requirements and finance such capital in a cost efficient manner; failure to maintain minimum capital levels at American Express or AENB could affect our status as a financial holding company and cause the regulatory agencies with oversight of American Express or AENB to take actions that could limit our business operations. Our primary source of equity capital has been the generation of net income. Capital generated through net income and other sources, such as the exercise of stock options by employees, is used to maintain a strong balance sheet, support asset growth and engage in acquisitions, with excess available for distribution to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. We currently expect that the portion of generated capital we allocate to support asset growth will be greater going forward than it has been historically due to projected asset growth. We maintain certain flexibility to shift capital across our businesses as appropriate. For example, we may infuse additional capital into subsidiaries to maintain capital at targeted levels in consideration of debt ratings and regulatory requirements. These infused amounts can affect the capital profile and liquidity levels at the American Express parent company level. The following are definitions for our regulatory risk-based capital ratios and leverage ratio, which are calculated as per standard regulatory guidance: Risk-Weighted Assets — Assets are weighted for risk according to a formula used by the Federal Reserve to conform to capital adequacy guidelines. On- and off-balance sheet items are weighted for risk, with off-balance sheet items converted to balance sheet equivalents, using risk conversion factors, before being allocated a risk-adjusted weight. Off-balance sheet exposures comprise a minimal part of the total risk-weighted assets. Common Equity Tier 1 Risk-Based Capital Ratio — Calculated as Common Equity Tier 1 capital (CET1), divided by risk-weighted assets. CET1 is the sum of common shareholders’ equity, adjusted for ineligible goodwill and intangible assets, certain deferred tax assets, as well as certain other comprehensive income items as follows: net unrealized gains/losses on securities and derivatives, and net unrealized pension and other postretirement benefit/losses, all net of tax. Tier 1 Risk-Based Capital Ratio — Calculated as Tier 1 capital divided by risk-weighted assets. Tier 1 capital is the sum of CET1, our perpetual preferred stock and third-party non-controlling interests in consolidated subsidiaries adjusted for capital held by insurance subsidiaries and deferred tax assets from net operating losses not deducted from CET1. The minimum requirement for the Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio is 1.5 percent higher than the minimum for the CET1 risk-based capital ratio. We have $1.6 billion of preferred shares outstanding to help address a portion of the Tier 1 capital requirements in excess of common equity requirements. Total Risk-Based Capital Ratio — Calculated as the sum of Tier 1 capital and Tier 2 capital, divided by risk-weighted assets. Tier 2 capital is the sum of the allowance for loan and receivable losses (limited to 1.25 percent of risk-weighted assets), a portion of the unrealized gains on equity securities and $600 million of subordinated notes, adjusted for capital held by insurance subsidiaries. Tier 1 Leverage Ratio — Calculated by dividing Tier 1 capital by our average total consolidated assets for the most recent quarter. Supplementary Leverage Ratio — Calculated by dividing Tier 1 capital by total leverage exposure under Basel III. Total leverage exposure reflects average total consolidated assets with adjustments for Tier 1 capital deductions, average off-balance sheet derivative exposures, average securities purchased under agreements to resell, and average credit equivalents of conditionally and unconditionally cancellable undrawn commitments. 53 Table of Contents In December 2018, federal banking regulators issued a final rule that would provide an optional three-year phase-in period for the day-one adverse regulatory capital effects upon adopting the Current Expected Credit Losses (CECL) model pursuant to new accounting guidance for the recognition of credit losses on financial instruments, effective January 1, 2020. The Federal Reserve also released a statement indicating that it plans to maintain the current framework for calculating credit loss allowances on loans in supervisory stress tests through the 2021 stress test cycle. See Note 1 to our “Consolidated Financial Statements” for further information about CECL. SHARE REPURCHASES AND DIVIDENDS We return capital to common shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. The share repurchases reduce common shares outstanding and more than offset the issuance of new shares as part of employee compensation plans. We suspended our share buyback program for the first half of 2018 in order to rebuild our capital levels and ratios pursuant to the 2018 CCAR capital plan process. During the year ended December 31, 2018, we returned $2.9 billion to our shareholders in the form of common stock dividends of $1.3 billion and share repurchases of $1.6 billion. We repurchased 15 million common shares at an average price of $104.09 in 2018. These dividend and share repurchase amounts collectively represent approximately 41 percent of total capital generated during the year. In addition, during the year ended December 31, 2018, we paid $80 million in dividends on $1.6 billion of non-cumulative perpetual preferred shares outstanding. For additional information on our preferred shares, refer to Note 17 and Note 22 to the “Consolidated Financial Statements.” FUNDING STRATEGY Our principal funding objective is to maintain broad and well-diversified funding sources to allow us to meet our maturing obligations, cost-effectively finance current and future asset growth in our global businesses, as well as to maintain a strong liquidity profile. The diversity of funding sources by type of instrument, by maturity and by investor base, among other factors, provides additional insulation from the impact of disruptions in any one type of instrument, maturity or investor. The mix of our funding in any period will seek to achieve cost efficiency consistent with both maintaining diversified sources and achieving our liquidity objectives. While we diversify our funding sources by maintaining scale and relevance in unsecured debt, asset securitizations and deposits, we currently expect that the Personal Savings High Yield Savings Account program will become a larger proportion of our funding over time. Our funding strategy and activities are integrated into our asset-liability management activities. We have in place a funding policy covering American Express Company and all of our subsidiaries. Our proprietary card businesses are the primary asset-generating businesses, with significant assets in both domestic and international Card Member lending and receivable activities. Our financing needs are in large part a consequence of our proprietary card-issuing businesses, and the maintenance of a liquidity position to support all of our business activities, such as merchant payments. We generally pay merchants for card transactions prior to reimbursement by Card Members and therefore fund the merchant payments during the period Card Member loans and receivables are outstanding. We also have additional financing needs associated with general corporate purposes. FUNDING PROGRAMS AND ACTIVITIES We meet our funding needs through a variety of sources, including direct and third-party distributed deposits and debt instruments, such as senior unsecured debentures, asset securitizations, borrowings through secured borrowing facilities and a long-term committed bank borrowing facility. We had the following consolidated debt and customer deposits outstanding as of December 31: TABLE 17: SUMMARY OF CONSOLIDATED DEBT AND CUSTOMER DEPOSITS (Billions) 2018 2017 Short-term borrowings $ 3.1 $ 3.3 Long-term debt 58.4 55.8 Total debt 61.5 59.1 Customer deposits 70.0 64.5 Total debt and customer deposits $ 131.5 $ 123.6 54 Table of Contents We may redeem from time to time certain debt securities within 31 days prior to the original contractual maturity dates in accordance with the optional redemption provisions of those debt securities. Our funding plan for the full year 2019 includes, among other sources, approximately $6 billion to $13 billion of unsecured term debt issuance and approximately $4 billion to $11 billion of secured term debt issuance. Our funding plans are subject to various risks and uncertainties, such as future business growth, the impact of global economic, political and other events on market capacity, demand for securities offered by us, regulatory changes, ability to securitize and sell receivables, and the performance of receivables previously sold in securitization transactions. Many of these risks and uncertainties are beyond our control. Our equity capital and funding strategies are designed, among other things, to maintain appropriate and stable unsecured debt ratings from the major credit rating agencies: Moody’s Investor Services (Moody’s), Standard & Poor’s (S&P) and Fitch Ratings (Fitch). Such ratings help support our access to cost-effective unsecured funding as part of our overall funding strategy. Our asset securitization activities are rated separately. TABLE 18: UNSECURED DEBT RATINGS Credit Agency American Express Entity Short-Term Ratings Long-Term Ratings Outlook Fitch All rated entities F1 A Stable Moody’s TRS and rated operating subsidiaries(a) Prime-1 A2 Stable Moody's American Express Company Prime-2 A3 Stable S&P TRS(a) N/A A- Stable S&P Other rated operating subsidiaries A-2 A- Stable S&P American Express Company A-2 BBB+ Stable (a) American Express Travel Related Services Company, Inc. Downgrades in the ratings of our unsecured debt or asset securitization program securities could result in higher funding costs, as well as higher fees related to borrowings under our unused lines of credit. Declines in credit ratings could also reduce our borrowing capacity in the unsecured debt and asset securitization capital markets. We believe our funding mix, including the proportion of U.S. retail deposits insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC), should reduce the impact that credit rating downgrades would have on our funding capacity and costs. SHORT-TERM FUNDING PROGRAMS Short-term borrowings, such as commercial paper, are defined as any debt with an original maturity of twelve months or less, as well as interest-bearing overdrafts with banks. Our short-term funding programs are used primarily to meet working capital needs, such as managing seasonal variations in receivables balances. The amount of short-term borrowings issued in the future will depend on our funding strategy, our needs and market conditions. As of December 31, 2018, we had $0.8 billion in commercial paper outstanding and we had an average of $0.23 billion in commercial paper outstanding during 2018. Refer to Note 9 to the “Consolidated Financial Statements” for a further description of these borrowings. DEPOSIT PROGRAMS We offer deposits within our U.S. bank subsidiary, AENB. These funds are currently insured up to $250,000 per account holder through the FDIC. Our ability to obtain deposit funding and offer competitive interest rates is dependent on the capital level of AENB. We, through AENB, have a direct retail deposit program, American Express Personal Savings, which is our primary deposit product channel. The direct retail program makes FDIC-insured certificates of deposit (CDs) and high-yield savings account products available directly to consumers. We also source deposits through third-party distribution channels as needed to meet our overall funding objectives. As of December 31, 2018 we had $70.0 billion in customer deposits. Refer to Note 8 to the “Consolidated Financial Statements” for a further description of these deposits. LONG-TERM DEBT AND ASSET SECURITIZATION PROGRAMS As of December 31, 2018, we had $58.4 billion in long-term debt outstanding. During 2018, we and our subsidiaries issued $15.9 billion of unsecured debt and asset-backed securities with maturities ranging from 2 to 7 years. Refer to Note 9 to the “Consolidated Financial Statements” for a further description of these borrowings. We periodically securitize Card Member loans and receivables arising from our card business, as the securitization market provides us with cost-effective funding. Securitization of Card Member loans and receivables is accomplished through the transfer of those assets to a trust, which in turn issues securities collateralized by the transferred assets to third-party investors. The proceeds from issuance are distributed to us, through our wholly-owned subsidiaries, as consideration for the transferred assets. Refer to Note 6 to the “Consolidated Financial Statements” for a further description of these borrowings. 55 Table of Contents Our 2018 long-term debt and asset securitization issuances were as follows: TABLE 19: DEBT ISSUANCES (Billions) 2018 American Express Company: Fixed Rate Senior Notes (weighted-average coupon of 3.63%) $ 6.6 Floating Rate Senior Notes (3-month LIBOR plus 61 basis points) 2.7 American Express Credit Account Master Trust: Fixed Rate Class A Certificates (weighted-average coupon of 2.97%) 4.4 Fixed Rate Class B Certificates (weighted-average coupon of 3.35%) ― Floating Rate Class A Certificates (1-month LIBOR plus 35 basis points) 2.1 Floating Rate Class B Certificates (1-month LIBOR plus 57 basis points) 0.1 Total $ 15.9 LIQUIDITY MANAGEMENT Our liquidity objective is to maintain access to a diverse set of on- and off-balance sheet liquidity sources. We seek to maintain liquidity sources in amounts sufficient to meet our expected future financial obligations and business requirements for liquidity for a period of at least twelve months in the event we are unable to raise new funds under our regular funding programs during a substantial weakening in economic conditions. Our liquidity management strategy includes a number of elements, including, but not limited to:  Maintaining diversified funding sources (refer to the “Funding Strategy” section for more details);  Maintaining unencumbered liquid assets and off-balance sheet liquidity sources;  Projecting cash inflows and outflows under a variety of economic and market scenarios;  Establishing clear objectives for liquidity risk management, including compliance with regulatory requirements; and  Incorporating liquidity risk management as appropriate into our capital adequacy framework. We seek to maintain access to a diverse set of on-balance sheet and off-balance sheet liquidity sources, including cash and other liquid assets, committed bank credit facilities and asset securitization conduit facilities. Through our U.S. bank subsidiary, AENB, we also hold collateral eligible for use at the Federal Reserve’s discount window. The amount and type of liquidity resources we maintain can vary over time, based upon the results of stress scenarios required under Dodd Frank and other various regulatory liquidity requirements, such as the Liquidity Coverage Ratio, as well as additional stress scenarios required under our liquidity risk policy. These stress scenarios possess distinct characteristics, varying by cash flow assumptions, time horizon and qualifying liquidity sources, among other factors. Scenarios under our liquidity risk policy include market-wide, firm-specific and combined liquidity stresses. The LCR rule prescribes cash flow assumptions over a 30-day period and establishes qualifying criteria for high-quality liquid assets. We consider other factors in determining the amount and type of liquidity we maintain, such as economic and financial market conditions, seasonality in business operations, growth in our businesses, potential acquisitions or dispositions, the cost and availability of alternative liquidity sources and credit rating agency guidelines and requirements. The investment income we receive on liquidity resources is less than the interest expense on the sources of funding for these balances. The net interest costs to maintain these resources have been substantial. The level of future net interest costs depends on the amount of liquidity resources we maintain and the difference between our cost of funding these amounts and their investment yields. Securitized Borrowing Capacity As of December 31, 2018, we maintained our committed, revolving, secured borrowing facility, with a maturity date of July 15, 2020, which gives us the right to sell up to $3.0 billion face amount of eligible AAA notes from the American Express Issuance Trust II (the Charge Trust). We also maintained our committed, revolving, secured borrowing facility, with a maturity date of September 15, 2020, which gives us the right to sell up to $2.0 billion face amount of eligible AAA certificates from the American Express Credit Account Master Trust (the Lending Trust). Both facilities are used in the ordinary course of business to fund seasonal working capital needs, as well as to further enhance our contingent funding resources. As of December 31, 2018, $1.5 billion was drawn on the Charge Trust facility, which was subsequently repaid on January 15, 2019. No amounts were drawn on the Lending Trust facility. 56 Table of Contents Federal Reserve Discount Window As an insured depository institution, AENB may borrow from the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco, subject to the amount of qualifying collateral that it may pledge. The Federal Reserve has indicated that both credit and charge card receivables are a form of qualifying collateral for secured borrowings made through the discount window. Whether specific assets will be considered qualifying collateral and the amount that may be borrowed against the collateral, remain at the discretion of the Federal Reserve. We had approximately $70.5 billion as of December 31, 2018 in U.S. credit card loans and charge card receivables that could be sold over time through our securitization trusts or pledged in return for secured borrowings to provide further liquidity, subject in each case to applicable market conditions and eligibility criteria. Committed Bank Credit Facility In addition to the secured borrowing facilities described above, we maintained a committed syndicated bank credit facility as of December 31, 2018 of $3.5 billion, with a maturity date of October 16, 2020. The availability of this credit line is subject to our compliance with certain financial covenants, principally the maintenance by American Express Credit Corporation (Credco) of a certain ratio of combined earnings and fixed charges to fixed charges. As of December 31, 2018, we were in compliance with each of our covenants. As of December 31, 2018, no amounts were drawn on the committed credit facility. The capacity of the facility mainly served to further enhance our contingent funding resources. Our committed bank credit facility does not contain a material adverse change clause, which might otherwise preclude borrowing under the credit facility, nor is it dependent on our credit rating. CASH FLOWS The following table summarizes our cash flow activity, followed by a discussion of the major drivers impacting operating, investing and financing cash flows. TABLE 20: CASH FLOWS (Billions) 2018 2017 2016 Total cash provided by (used in): Operating activities $ 8.9 $ 13.5 $ 8.3 Investing activities (19.6 ) (18.2 ) 1.8 Financing activities 5.1 12.2 (7.6 ) Effect of foreign currency exchange rates on cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash 0.1 0.3 (0.2 ) Net (decrease) increase in cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash $ (5.5 ) $ 7.8 $ 2.3 Cash Flows from Operating Activities Our cash flows from operating activities primarily include net income adjusted for (i) non-cash items included in net income, such as provisions for losses, depreciation and amortization, deferred taxes and stock-based compensation and (ii) changes in the balances of operating assets and liabilities, which can vary significantly in the normal course of business due to the amount and timing of payments. The decrease in net cash provided by operating activities was driven by the amount and timing of payments of accounts payable and other liabilities, partially offset by an increase in net income from normal business operations. Cash Flows from Investing Activities Our cash flows from investing activities primarily include changes in Card Member receivables and loans, as well as changes in our available-for-sale investment securities portfolio. The increase in net cash used in investing activities was driven by a larger net increase in the investment securities portfolio, partially offset by less growth in Card Member receivables and loans. Cash Flows from Financing Activities Our cash flows from financing activities primarily include changes in customer deposits, long-term debt and short-term borrowings, as well as dividend payments and share repurchases. The decrease in net cash provided by financing activities was primarily driven by a lower increase in customer deposits and long-term debt, partially offset by a lower level of share repurchases. 57 Table of Contents OFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS AND CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS We have identified both on- and off-balance sheet transactions, arrangements, obligations and other relationships that may have a material current or future effect on our financial condition, changes in financial condition, results of operations, or liquidity and capital resources. CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS The table below identifies transactions that represent our contractually committed future obligations. Purchase obligations include our agreements to purchase goods and services that are enforceable and legally binding and that specify significant terms, including: fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased; fixed, minimum or variable price provisions; and the approximate timing of the transaction. TABLE 21: COMMITTED FUTURE OBLIGATIONS BY YEAR Payments due by year(a) (Millions) 2019 2020-2021 2022-2023 2024 and thereafter Total Long-term debt $ 11,315 $ 27,342 $ 14,611 $ 6,284 $ 59,552 Interest payments on long-term debt(b) 1,661 2,157 1,002 1,450 6,270 Certificates of deposit 4,748 6,159 2,595 ― 13,502 Other long-term liabilities(c) (d) 295 61 6 17 379 Operating lease obligations 140 213 143 832 1,328 Purchase obligations(e) 384 310 26 4 724 Deemed repatriation tax(f) 148 268 268 1,005 1,689 Total $ 18,691 $ 36,510 $ 18,651 $ 9,592 $ 83,444 (a) The table above excludes approximately $0.7 billion of tax liabilities related to the uncertainty in income taxes as inherent complexities and the number of tax years currently open for examination in multiple jurisdictions do not permit reasonable estimates of payments, if any, to be made over a range of years. Refer to Note 21 to the “Consolidated Financial Statements” for additional information. (b) Estimated interest payments were calculated using the effective interest rates as of December 31, 2018, and includes the effect of existing interest rate swaps. Actual cash flows may differ from estimated payments. (c) As of December 31, 2018, there were no minimum required contributions, and no contributions are currently planned, for the U.S. American Express Retirement Plan. For the U.S. American Express Retirement Restoration Plan and non-U.S. defined benefit pension and postretirement benefit plans, contributions in 2019 are anticipated to be approximately $46 million, and this amount has been included within other long-term liabilities. Remaining obligations under defined benefit pension and postretirement benefit plans aggregating $517 million have not been included in the table above as the timing of such obligations is not determinable. Additionally, other long-term liabilities do not include $8.4 billion of Membership Rewards liabilities, which are not considered long-term liabilities as Card Members in good standing can redeem points immediately, without restrictions, and because the timing of point redemption is not determinable. (d) As of December 31, 2018, we had committed to provide funding related to certain tax credit investments resulting in a $237 million unfunded commitment included in other long-term liabilities. In addition to this amount, there was a further $59 million of contractual off-balance sheet obligations that have not been included in the table above as the timing of such obligations is not determinable. Refer to Note 7 to the “Consolidated Financial Statements” for additional information. (e) The purchase obligation amounts represent either the early termination fees or non-cancelable minimum contractual obligations, as applicable, by period under contracts that were in effect as of December 31, 2018. (f) Represents our estimated obligation under the Tax Act to pay the deemed repatriation tax on certain non-US earnings over eight years. Refer to Note 21 to the “Consolidated Financial Statements” for additional information. In addition to the contractual obligations noted in Table 21, we have financial commitments related to agreements with certain cobrand partners under which we are required to make a certain level of minimum payments over the life of the agreement, generally ranging from five to eight years. We make payments to such cobrand partners primarily based on Card Members' spending and earning rewards on their cobrand cards and as we acquire new Card Members. In the event these payments do not fully satisfy the commitment, we will pay the cobrand partner up to the amount of the commitment in exchange for an equivalent value of reward points. As of December 31, 2018, we had $5.0 billion in such commitments outstanding. We also have off-balance sheet arrangements that include guarantees, indemnifications and certain other off-balance sheet arrangements. GUARANTEES As of December 31, 2018, we had guarantees and indemnifications totaling approximately $1 billion related primarily to real estate and business dispositions in the ordinary course of business. Refer to Note 16 to the “Consolidated Financial Statements” for further discussion regarding our guarantees. 58 Table of Contents CERTAIN OTHER OFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS As of December 31, 2018, we had approximately $302 billion of unused credit outstanding as part of established lending product agreements. Total unused credit does not represent potential future cash requirements, as a significant portion of this unused credit will likely not be drawn. Our charge card products generally have no pre-set limit, and therefore are not reflected in unused credit available to Card Members. We provide Card Member protection plans that cover losses associated with purchased products. The maximum potential liability related to these plans is the portion of annual billed business for which timely and valid disputes may be raised under applicable law and relevant customer agreements. However, based on historical experience, we believe that this total amount is not representative of our actual potential loss exposure. The actual amount of the potential exposure cannot be quantified as the billed business volumes which may include or result in claims under these plans are not sufficiently estimable. Losses related to these protection plans were immaterial for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016. Refer to Notes 7 and 13 to the “Consolidated Financial Statements” for discussion regarding our other off-balance sheet arrangements. RISK MANAGEMENT GOVERNANCE We use our comprehensive Enterprise-wide Risk Management (ERM) program to identify, aggregate, monitor, and manage risks. The program also defines our risk appetite, governance, culture and capabilities. The implementation and execution of the ERM program is headed by our Chief Risk Officer. Risk management is overseen by our Board of Directors through three Board committees: the Risk Committee, the Audit and Compliance Committee, and the Compensation and Benefits Committee. Each committee consists entirely of independent directors and provides regular reports to the full Board regarding matters reviewed at their committee. The committees meet regularly in private sessions with our Chief Risk Officer, the Chief Compliance & Ethics Officer, the Chief Audit Executive and other senior management with regard to our risk management processes, controls, talent and capabilities. The Board monitors the “tone at the top,” our risk culture, and oversees emerging and strategic risks. The Risk Committee of our Board of Directors provides oversight of our enterprise-wide risk management framework, processes and methodologies. The Risk Committee approves our ERM policy. The ERM policy governs risk governance, risk oversight and risk appetite for risks, including individual credit risk, institutional credit risk, market risk, liquidity risk, operational risk, reputational risk, compliance risk, model risk, asset/liability risk and strategic and business risk. Risk appetite defines the authorized risk limits to control exposures within our risk capacity and risk tolerance, including stressed forward-looking scenarios. In addition, it establishes principles for risk taking in the aggregate and for each risk type, and is supported by a comprehensive system for monitoring limits, escalation triggers and assessing control programs. The Risk Committee reviews and concurs in the appointment, replacement, performance and compensation of our Chief Risk Officer and receives regular updates from the Chief Risk Officer on key risks, transactions and exposures. The Risk Committee reviews our risk profile against the tolerances specified in the Risk Appetite Framework, including significant risk exposures, risk trends in our portfolios and major risk concentrations. The Risk Committee also provides oversight of our compliance with Basel capital and liquidity standards, our Internal Capital Adequacy Assessment Process, including its Comprehensive Capital Analysis and Review (CCAR) submissions, and resolution planning. The Audit and Compliance Committee of our Board of Directors reviews and approves compliance policies, which include our Compliance Risk Tolerance Statement. In addition, the Audit and Compliance Committee reviews the effectiveness of our Corporate-wide Compliance Risk Management Program. More broadly, this committee is responsible for assisting the Board in its oversight responsibilities relating to the integrity of our financial statements and financial reporting process, internal and external auditing, including the qualifications and independence of the independent registered public accounting firm and the performance of our internal audit services function, and the integrity of our systems of internal controls. The Audit and Compliance Committee provides oversight of our Internal Audit Group. The Audit and Compliance Committee reviews and concurs in the appointment, replacement, performance and compensation of our Chief Audit Executive and approves Internal Audit’s annual audit plan, charter, policies and budget. The Audit and Compliance Committee also receives regular updates on the audit plan’s status and results including significant reports issued by Internal Audit and the status of our corrective actions. 59 Table of Contents The Compensation and Benefits Committee of our Board of Directors works with the Chief Risk Officer to ensure our overall compensation programs, as well as those covering our risk-taking employees, appropriately balance risk with business incentives and how business performance is achieved without taking imprudent or excessive risk. Our Chief Risk Officer is actively involved in setting goals. Our Chief Risk Officer also reviews the current and forward-looking risk profiles of each business unit, and provides input into performance evaluation. The Chief Risk Officer meets with the Compensation and Benefits Committee and attests whether performance goals and results have been achieved without taking imprudent risks. The Compensation and Benefits Committee uses a risk-balanced incentive compensation framework to decide on our bonus pools and the compensation of senior executives. There are several internal management committees, including the Enterprise-wide Risk Management Committee (ERMC), chaired by our Chief Risk Officer. The ERMC is the highest-level management committee to oversee all firm-wide risks and is responsible for risk governance, risk oversight and risk appetite. It maintains the enterprise-wide risk appetite framework and monitors compliance with limits and escalations defined in it. The ERMC oversees implementation of risk policies company-wide. The ERMC reviews key risk exposures, trends and concentrations, significant compliance matters, and provides guidance on the steps to monitor, control and report major risks. As defined in the ERM policy, we follow the “three lines of defense” approach to risk management. The first line of defense comprises functions and management committees directly initiating risk taking. Business unit presidents, our Chief Credit Officer, Chief Market Risk Officer and Functional Risk Officer are part of the first line of defense. The second line comprises independent functions overseeing risk-taking activities of the first line. The Chief Risk Officer, the Chief Compliance & Ethics Officer, the Chief Operational Risk Officer and certain control groups, both at the enterprise level and within regulated entities, are part of the second line of defense. The global risk oversight team oversees the policies, strategies, frameworks, models, processes and capabilities deployed by the first line teams and provides challenges and independent assessments on how the first line of defense is managing risks. In addition, the Asset Liability Committee, chaired by our Chief Financial Officer, is responsible for managing market, liquidity and asset/liability risk, capital and resolution planning. Our Internal Audit Group constitutes the third line of defense, and provides independent assessments and effective challenge of the first and second lines of defense. CREDIT RISK MANAGEMENT PROCESS Credit risk is defined as loss due to obligor or counterparty default or changes in the credit quality of a counterparty or security. Our credit risks are divided into two broad categories: individual and institutional. Each has distinct risk management capabilities, strategies, and tools. Business units that create individual or institutional credit risk exposures of significant importance are supported by dedicated risk management teams, each led by a Chief Credit Officer. INDIVIDUAL CREDIT RISK Individual credit risk arises from consumer and small business charge cards, credit cards, lines of credit, and term loans. These portfolios consist of millions of customers across multiple geographies, industries and levels of net worth. We benefit from the high-quality profile of our customers, which is driven by our brand, premium customer servicing, product features and risk management capabilities, which span underwriting, customer management and collections. Externally, the risk in these portfolios is generally correlated to broad economic trends, such as unemployment rates and gross domestic product (GDP) growth. The business unit leaders and their Chief Credit Officers take the lead in managing the credit risk process. These Chief Credit Officers are guided by the Individual Credit Risk Committee (ICRC), which is responsible for implementation and enforcement of the Individual Credit Risk Management Policy. The ICRC ensures compliance with ERMC guidelines and procedures and escalates to the ERMC as appropriate. The Individual Credit Risk Management Policy is further supported by subordinate policies and operating manuals covering decision logic and processes of credit extension, including prospecting, new account approvals, point-of-sale authorizations, credit line management and collections. The subordinate risk policies and operating manuals are designed to ensure consistent application of risk management principles and standardized reporting of asset quality and loss recognition. Credit risk management is supported by sophisticated proprietary scoring and decision-making models that use up-to-date information on prospects and customers, such as spending and payment history and data feeds from credit bureaus. We have developed data-driven economic decision logic for customer interactions to better serve our customers. INSTITUTIONAL CREDIT RISK Institutional credit risk arises principally within our GCS, GMS, GNS and Foreign Exchange Services businesses, as well as investment and liquidity management activities. Unlike individual credit risk, institutional credit risk is characterized by a lower loss frequency but higher severity. It is affected both by general economic conditions and by client-specific events. The absence of large losses in any given year or over several years is not necessarily representative of the level of risk of institutional portfolios, given the infrequency of loss events in such portfolios. 60 Table of Contents Similar to Individual Credit Risk, business units taking institutional credit risks are supported by Chief Credit Officers. These officers are guided by the Institutional Risk Management Committee (IRMC), which is responsible for implementation and enforcement of the Institutional Credit Risk Management Policy and for providing guidance to the credit officers of each business unit with substantial institutional credit risk exposures. The committee, along with the business unit Chief Credit Officers, makes investment decisions in core risk capabilities, ensures proper implementation of the underwriting standards and contractual rights for risk mitigation, monitors risk exposures, and determines risk mitigation actions. The IRMC formally reviews large institutional risk exposures to ensure compliance with ERMC guidelines and procedures and escalates them to the ERMC as appropriate. At the same time, the IRMC provides guidance to the business unit risk management teams to optimize risk-adjusted returns on capital. A centralized risk rating unit provides risk assessment of our institutional obligors. Exposure to the Airline and Travel Industry We have multiple important cobrand, rewards, merchant acceptance and corporate payments arrangements with airlines. The ERM program evaluates the risks posed by our airline partners and the overall airline strategy companywide through comprehensive business analysis of global airlines, and the travel industry more broadly, including cruise lines, travel agencies and tour operators. Our largest airline partner is Delta, and this relationship includes exclusive cobrand credit card partnerships and other arrangements including Membership Rewards redemption, merchant acceptance, travel and corporate payments. See ""We face intense competition for partner relationships, which could result in a loss or renegotiation of these arrangements that could have a material adverse impact on our business and results of operations"" under “Risk Factors” for additional information. Debt Exposure As part of our ongoing risk management process, we monitor our financial exposure to both sovereign and non-sovereign customers and counterparties, and measure and manage concentrations of risk by geographic regions, as well as by economic sectors and industries. A primary focus area for monitoring is credit deterioration due to weaknesses in economic and fiscal profiles. We evaluate countries based on the market assessment of the riskiness of their sovereign debt and our assessment of the economic and financial outlook and closely monitor those deemed high risk. As of December 31, 2018, we considered our gross credit exposures to government entities, financial institutions and corporations in those countries deemed high risk to be individually and collectively not material. OPERATIONAL RISK MANAGEMENT PROCESS We define operational risk as the risk of not achieving business objectives due to inadequate or failed processes, people, or information systems, or the external environment, including failures to comply with laws and regulations. Operational risk is inherent in all business activities and can impact an organization through direct or indirect financial loss, brand damage, customer dissatisfaction, or legal and regulatory penalties. To appropriately measure and manage operational risk, we have implemented a comprehensive operational risk framework that is defined in the Operational Risk Management Policy approved by the Risk Committee. The Operational Risk Management Committee (ORMC), chaired by the Chief Operational Risk Officer, coordinates with all control groups on effective risk assessments and controls and oversees the preventive, responsive and mitigation efforts by Operational Excellence teams in the business units and staff groups. We use the operational risk framework to identify, measure, monitor and report inherent and emerging operational risks. This framework, supervised by the ORMC, consists of (a) operational risk event capture, (b) a project office to coordinate issue management and control enhancements, (c) key risk indicators, and (d) process and entity-level risk assessments. The framework requires the assessment of operational risk events to determine root causes, impact to customers and/or us, and resolution plan accountability to correct any defect, remediate customers, and enhance controls and testing to mitigate future issues. The impact is assessed from an operational, financial, brand, regulatory compliance and legal perspective. INFORMATION AND CYBER SECURITY We have implemented an Information Security Program and Operating Model that is designed to protect the confidentiality, integrity and availability of information and information systems from unauthorized access, use, disclosure, disruption, modification or destruction. Our Information Security Program and Operating Model are based on the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) Cybersecurity Common Standards Framework, which consist of controls designed to identify, protect, detect, respond and recover from information and cyber security incidents. The framework defines risks and associated controls which are embedded in our processes and technology. Those controls are measured and monitored by a combination of subject matter experts and a security operations center with our integrated cyber detection, response and recovery capabilities. Chaired by the Chief Information Security Officer, our Information Security Risk Management Committee, a sub-committee of the ORMC, provides governance for our information security risk management program. The Information Security and Technology Oversight team provides independent challenge and assessment of the information, cyber security and technology risk management programs. See “A major information or cyber security incident or an increase in fraudulent activity could lead to reputational damage to our brand and significant legal, regulatory and financial exposure, and could reduce the use and acceptance of our charge and credit cards” under “Risk Factors” for additional information. 61 Table of Contents PRIVACY AND DATA GOVERNANCE Our Privacy Framework and Operating Model follow a similar structure. Chaired by the Chief Privacy Officer, our Privacy Risk Management Committee, a sub-committee of the ORMC, provides oversight and governance for our privacy program. The committee is responsible for the governance over the collection, notice, use, sharing, transfer, confidentiality and retention of personal data. Our Enterprise Data Governance Framework and Policy defines governance requirements for data used in critical processes. COMPLIANCE RISK MANAGEMENT PROCESS We define compliance risk as the risk of legal or reputational harm, fines, monetary penalties and payment of damages or other forms of sanction as a result of non-compliance with applicable laws, regulations, rules or standards of conduct. We view our ability to effectively mitigate compliance risk as an important aspect of our business model. Our Global Compliance and Ethics organization is responsible for establishing and maintaining our corporate-wide Compliance Risk Management Program. Pursuant to this program, we seek to manage and mitigate compliance risk by assessing, controlling, monitoring, measuring and reporting the legal and regulatory risks to which we are exposed. The Compliance Risk Management Committee (CRMC), chaired by the Chief Compliance and Ethics Officer, is responsible for identifying, evaluating, managing, and escalating compliance risks. The CRMC has a dual reporting relationship directly to both the ERMC and the Audit and Compliance Committee. We have a comprehensive Anti-Money Laundering program that monitors and reports suspicious activity to the appropriate government authorities. As part of that program, the Global Risk Oversight team provides independent risk assessment of the rules used by the Anti-Money Laundering team. In addition, the Internal Audit Group reviews the processes for practices consistent with regulatory guidance. REPUTATIONAL RISK MANAGEMENT PROCESS We define reputational risk as the risk that negative stakeholder reaction to our products, services, client and partner relationships, business activities and policies, management and workplace culture, or our response to unexpected events, could cause sustained, critical media coverage, a decline in revenue or investment, talent attrition, litigation, or government or regulatory scrutiny. We view protecting our reputation for excellent customer service, trust, security and high integrity as core to our vision of providing the world’s best customer experience and fundamental to our long-term success. Our business leaders are responsible for considering the reputational risk implications of business activities and strategies and ensuring the relevant subject matter experts are engaged as needed. The ERMC is responsible for ensuring reputational risk considerations are included in the scope of appropriate subordinate risk policies and committees and properly reflected in all decisions escalated to the ERMC. MARKET RISK MANAGEMENT PROCESS Market risk is the risk to earnings or asset and liability values resulting from movements in market prices. Our market risk exposures include interest rate risk and foreign exchange risk. Interest rate risk is driven by the relationship between interest rates on assets (such as loans, receivables and investment securities) and interest rates on liabilities (such as debt and deposits). Foreign exchange risk arises from transactions, funding, investments and earnings in currencies other than the U.S. dollar. Our Asset-Liability Management (ALM) and Market Risk policies establish the framework that guides and governs market risk management, including quantitative limits and escalation triggers. These policies are approved by the Risk Committee of the Board of Directors or Market Risk Management Committee. Market risk is managed by the Market Risk Management Committee. The Market Risk Oversight Officer provides an independent risk assessment and oversight over the policies and exposure management for market risk and ALM activities, as well as overseeing compliance with the Volcker Rule and other regulatory requirements. Market risk management is also guided and governed by policies covering the use of derivative financial instruments, funding, liquidity and investments. We analyze a variety of interest rate scenarios to inform us of the potential impacts from interest rate changes on earnings and the value of assets, liabilities and the economic value of equity. Our interest rate exposure can vary over time as a result of, among other things, the proportion of our total funding provided by variable-and fixed-rate debt and deposits compared to our Card Member loans and receivables. Interest rate swaps are used from time to time to effectively convert debt issuances to (or from) variable-rate, from (or to) fixed-rate. We do not engage in derivative financial instruments for trading purposes other than with respect to our Foreign Exchange International Payments business activities. Refer to Note 14 to the “Consolidated Financial Statements” for further discussion of our derivative financial instruments. 62 Table of Contents As of December 31, 2018, a hypothetical, immediate 100 basis point increase in market interest rates would have a detrimental effect on our annual net interest income of approximately $177 million. This measure first projects net interest income over the following twelve-month time horizon considering forecasted business growth and anticipated future market interest rates. The detrimental impact from a rate increase is then measured by instantaneously increasing the anticipated future interest rates by 100 basis points. It is further assumed that our interest-rate sensitive assets and the majority of our liabilities that reprice within the twelve-month horizon generally reprice by 100 basis points. Our estimated repricing risk assumes that certain deposit liabilities reprice at a lower magnitude than benchmark rate movements consistent with historical deposit repricing experience in the industry and within our own portfolio. Actual changes in our net interest income will depend on many factors, and therefore may differ from our estimated risk to changes in market interest rates. In addition to parallel rate changes, our net interest income is subject to changes in the relationship between market benchmark rates. For example, movements in Prime rate change the yield on a large portion of our variable-rate U.S. lending receivables and loans, while LIBOR rates determine the effective interest rate on a significant portion of our outstanding funding. Differences in the rate of change of these two benchmark indices, commonly referred to as basis risk, would thus impact our net interest income. The detrimental effect on our net interest income of a hypothetical 10 basis point decrease in the spread between Prime and LIBOR over the next twelve months is estimated to be $27 million. We currently have approximately $45 billion of Prime-based, variable-rate U.S. lending receivables and loans and $27 billion of LIBOR-indexed debt, including asset securitizations. The replacement of LIBOR as a benchmark rate can have a further detrimental impact on our LIBOR-indexed debt if rates suddenly rise as new market activity transfers to other benchmark curves, such as the Secured Overnight Financing Rate. Foreign exchange exposures arise in four principal ways: 1) Card Member spending in currencies that are not the billing currency, 2) cross-currency transactions and balances from our funding activities, 3) cross-currency investing activities, such as in the equity of foreign subsidiaries, and 4) revenues generated and expenses incurred in foreign currencies, which impact earnings. These foreign exchange risks are managed primarily by entering into foreign exchange spot transactions or hedged with foreign exchange forward contracts when the hedge costs are economically justified and in notional amounts designed to offset pretax impacts from currency movements in the period in which they occur. As of December 31, 2018 and 2017, foreign currency derivative instruments with total notional amounts of approximately $29 billion and $30 billion were outstanding, respectively. With respect to Card Member spending and cross-currency transactions, including related foreign exchange forward contracts outstanding, a hypothetical 10 percent strengthening of the U.S. dollar would result in an immaterial impact to projected earnings as of December 31, 2018. With respect to translation exposure of foreign subsidiary equity balances, including related foreign exchange forward contracts outstanding, a hypothetical 10 percent strengthening of the U.S. dollar would result in an immaterial reduction in other comprehensive income and equity as of December 31, 2018. With respect to earnings denominated in foreign currencies, the adverse impact on pretax income of a hypothetical 10 percent strengthening of the U.S. dollar related to anticipated overseas operating results for the next twelve months would be approximately $140 million as of December 31, 2018. We refined our process to forecast future earnings denominated in foreign currencies that resulted in a reclassification of certain forecasted expenses from U.S. dollar to foreign currencies. The same sensitivity analysis as of December 31, 2017, using the refined process, would have been approximately $154 million. To a much lesser extent, we are also subject to market risk arising from activities conducted by our Foreign Exchange International Payments business. We aim to minimize market risk from these activities through hedging, where appropriate, and the establishment of limits to define and protect the company from excessive exposure. The actual impact of interest rate and foreign exchange rate changes will depend on, among other factors, the timing of rate changes, the extent to which different rates do not move in the same direction or in the same direction to the same degree, changes in the cost, volume and mix of our hedging activities and changes in the volume and mix of our businesses. FUNDING & LIQUIDITY RISK MANAGEMENT PROCESS Liquidity risk is defined as our inability to meet our ongoing financial and business obligations as they become due at a reasonable cost. Our Board-approved Liquidity Risk Policy establishes the framework that guides and governs liquidity risk management. Liquidity risk is managed by the Funding and Liquidity Committee. In addition, the Market Risk Oversight Officer provides independent oversight of liquidity risk management. We manage liquidity risk by maintaining access to a diverse set of cash, readily-marketable securities and contingent sources of liquidity, such that we can continuously meet our business requirements and expected future financing obligations for at least a twelve-month period in the event we are unable to raise new funds under our regular funding programs during a substantial weakening in economic conditions. We consider the trade-offs between maintaining too much liquidity, which can be costly and limit financial flexibility, and having inadequate liquidity, which may result in financial distress during a liquidity event. Liquidity risk is managed at an aggregate consolidated level as well as at certain subsidiaries in order to ensure that sufficient and accessible liquidity resources are maintained. The Funding and Liquidity Committee reviews forecasts of our aggregate and subsidiary cash positions and financing requirements, approves funding plans designed to satisfy those requirements under normal and stressed conditions, establishes guidelines to identify the amount of liquidity resources required and monitors positions and determines any actions to be taken. 63 Table of Contents MODEL RISK MANAGEMENT PROCESS We define model risk as the risk of adverse consequences, such as financial loss, poor business and strategic decision making, or damage to our reputation, from decisions based on incorrect or misused model outputs and reports. We manage model risk through a comprehensive model governance framework, including policies and procedures for model development, independent model validation and change management capabilities that seek to minimize erroneous model methodology, outputs and misuse. We also assess model performance on an ongoing basis. STRATEGIC AND BUSINESS RISK MANAGEMENT PROCESS Strategic and business risk is the risk related to our inability to achieve our business objectives due to poor strategic decisions, including decisions related to mergers, acquisitions, and divestitures, poor implementation of strategic decisions or declining demand for our products and services. Strategic decisions are reviewed and approved by business leaders and various committees and must be aligned with company policies. We seek to manage strategic and business risks through risk controls embedded in these processes as well as overall risk management oversight over business goals. Existing product performance is reviewed periodically by committees and business leaders. Mergers, acquisitions and divestitures can only be approved following Deal Committee due diligence, a comprehensive risk assessment by operational, market, credit and oversight leaders provided to the Chief Risk Officer and approval by either the Chief Risk Officer or appropriate risk committees. All new products and material changes in business processes are reviewed and approved by the New Products Committee and appropriate credit or risk committees. 64 Table of Contents CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES Refer to Note 1 to the “Consolidated Financial Statements” for a summary of our significant accounting policies. Certain of our accounting policies requiring significant management assumptions and judgments are as follows: RESERVES FOR CARD MEMBER LOSSES Reserves for Card Member losses represent our best estimate of the probable losses inherent in our outstanding portfolio of Card Member loans and receivables, as of the balance sheet date. In estimating these losses, we use statistical and analytical models that analyze portfolio performance and reflect our judgment regarding the quantitative components of the reserve. The models take into account several factors, including delinquency-based loss migration rates, loss emergence periods and average losses and recoveries over an appropriate historical period. We also consider whether to adjust the quantitative reserve for certain external and internal qualitative factors that may increase or decrease the reserves for losses on Card Member loans and receivables. Refer to Note 4 to the ""Consolidated Financial Statements"" for additional information. The process of estimating these reserves requires a high degree of judgment. To the extent historical credit experience, updated for any external and internal qualitative factors such as environmental trends, is not indicative of future performance, actual losses could differ significantly from our judgments and expectations, resulting in either higher or lower future provisions for Card Member losses in any quarter. As of December 31, 2018, a 10 percent increase in our estimate of losses inherent in the outstanding portfolio of Card Member loans and receivables, evaluated collectively for impairment, would increase reserves for losses with a corresponding change to provisions for losses by approximately $271 million. This sensitivity analysis is provided as a hypothetical scenario to assess the sensitivity of the provisions for losses. It does not represent our expectations for losses in the future, nor does it include how other portfolio factors such as delinquency-based loss migration rates or recoveries, or the amount of outstanding balances, may impact the level of reserves for losses and the corresponding impact on the provisions for losses. LIABILITY FOR MEMBERSHIP REWARDS The Membership Rewards program is our largest card-based rewards program. Card Members can earn points for purchases charged on their enrolled card products. A significant portion of our cards, by their terms, allow Card Members to earn bonus points for purchases at merchants in particular industry categories. Membership Rewards points are redeemable for a broad variety of rewards, including travel, shopping, gift cards, and covering eligible charges. Points typically do not expire, and there is no limit on the number of points a Card Member may earn. Membership Rewards expense is driven by charge volume on enrolled cards, customer participation in the program and contractual arrangements with redemption partners. We record a Membership Rewards liability that represents the estimated cost of points earned that are expected to be redeemed by Card Members in the future. The Membership Rewards liability is impacted over time by enrollment levels, attrition, the volume of points earned and redeemed, and the associated redemption costs. We estimate the Membership Rewards liability by determining the URR and the WAC per point, which are applied to the points of current enrollees. Refer to Note 10 to the “Consolidated Financial Statements” for additional information. The URR assumption is used to estimate the number of points earned by current enrollees that will ultimately be redeemed in future periods. We use statistical and actuarial models to estimate the URR of points earned to date by current Card Members based on redemption trends, card product type, enrollment tenure, card spend levels and credit attributes. The WAC per point assumption is used to estimate future redemption costs and is primarily based on redemption choices made by Card Members, reward offerings by partners, and Membership Rewards program changes. The WAC per point is derived from the previous 12 months of redemptions and is adjusted as appropriate for certain changes in redemption costs that are not representative of future cost expectations. We periodically evaluate our liability estimation process and assumptions based on developments in redemption patterns, cost per point redeemed, partner contract changes and other factors. The process of estimating the Membership Rewards liability includes a high degree of judgment. Actual redemptions and associated redemption costs could differ significantly from our estimates, resulting in either higher or lower Membership Rewards expense. Changes in the Membership Rewards URR and WAC per point have the effect of either increasing or decreasing the liability through the current period Membership Rewards expense by an amount estimated to cover the cost of all points previously earned but not yet redeemed by current enrollees as of the end of the reporting period. As of December 31, 2018, an increase in the estimated URR of current enrollees of 25 basis points would increase the Membership Rewards liability and corresponding rewards expense by approximately $113 million. Similarly, an increase in the WAC per point of 1 basis point would increase the Membership Rewards liability and corresponding rewards expense by approximately $106 million. 65 Table of Contents GOODWILL RECOVERABILITY Goodwill represents the excess of acquisition cost of an acquired business over the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed. Goodwill is not amortized but is tested for impairment at the reporting unit level annually or when events or circumstances arise, such as adverse changes in the business climate, that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of the reporting unit below its carrying value. Our methodology for conducting this goodwill impairment testing contains both a qualitative and quantitative assessment. We have the option to initially perform an assessment of qualitative factors in order to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount. The qualitative factors may include, but are not limited to, economic conditions, industry and market considerations, cost factors, overall financial performance of the reporting unit and other company and reporting unit-specific events. If we determine that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, we then perform the impairment evaluation using a more detailed quantitative assessment. We could also directly perform this quantitative assessment for any reporting unit, bypassing the qualitative assessment. Our methodology for conducting the quantitative goodwill impairment testing is fundamentally based on the measurement of fair value for our reporting units, which inherently entails the use of significant management judgment. For valuation, we use a combination of the income approach (discounted cash flows) and market approach (market multiples) in estimating the fair value of our reporting units. When preparing discounted cash flow models under the income approach, we estimate future cash flows using the reporting unit’s internal multi-year forecast, and a terminal value calculated using a growth rate that we believe is appropriate in light of current and expected future economic conditions. To discount these cash flows we use our expected cost of equity, determined using a capital asset pricing model. When using the market method under the market approach, we apply comparable publicly traded companies’ multiples (e.g., earnings, revenues) to our reporting units’ actual results. The judgment in estimating forecasted cash flows, discount rates and market comparables is significant, and imprecision could materially affect the fair value of our reporting units. We could be exposed to an increased risk of further goodwill impairment if future operating results or macroeconomic conditions differ significantly from management’s current assumptions. INCOME TAXES We are subject to the income tax laws of the United States, its states and municipalities and those of the foreign jurisdictions in which we operate. These tax laws are complex, and the manner in which they apply to the taxpayer’s facts is sometimes open to interpretation. In establishing a provision for income tax expense, we must make judgments about the application of inherently complex tax laws. In particular, the Tax Act is complex and requires interpretation of certain provisions to estimate the impact on our income tax expense. The estimates are based on the information available and our current interpretation of the Tax Act, and may change due to changes in interpretations and assumptions we make and additional guidance or context from the Internal Revenue Service, the U.S. Treasury Department, the Financial Accounting Standards Board or others regarding the Tax Act. Refer to Note 21 to the ""Consolidated Financial Statements"" for additional information. Unrecognized Tax Benefits We establish a liability for unrecognized tax benefits, which are the differences between a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return and the benefit recognized in the financial statements. In establishing a liability for an unrecognized tax benefit, assumptions may be made in determining whether, and the extent to which, a tax position should be sustained. A tax position is recognized only when it is more likely than not to be sustained upon examination by the relevant taxing authority, based on its technical merits. The amount of tax benefit recognized is the largest benefit that we believe is more likely than not to be realized on ultimate settlement. As new information becomes available, we evaluate our tax positions and adjust our unrecognized tax benefits, as appropriate. Tax benefits ultimately realized can differ from amounts previously recognized due to uncertainties, with any such differences generally impacting the provision for income tax. Deferred Tax Asset Realization Deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the differences between the financial statement and tax bases of assets and liabilities using the enacted tax rates expected to be in effect for the years in which the differences are expected to reverse. Since deferred taxes measure the future tax effects of items recognized in the Consolidated Financial Statements, certain estimates and assumptions are required to determine whether it is more likely than not that all or some portion of the benefit of a deferred tax asset will not be realized. In making this assessment, we analyze and estimate the impact of future taxable income, reversing temporary differences and available tax planning strategies. These assessments are performed quarterly, taking into account any new information. Changes in facts or circumstances can lead to changes in the ultimate realization of deferred tax assets due to uncertainties. 66 Table of Contents OTHER MATTERS RECENTLY ISSUED ACCOUNTING STANDARDS Refer to the Recently Issued Accounting Standards section of Note 1 to the “Consolidated Financial Statements.” GLOSSARY OF SELECTED TERMINOLOGY Adjusted net interest income — A non-GAAP measure that represents net interest income attributable to our Card Member loans and loans HFS (which includes, on a GAAP basis, interest that is deemed uncollectible), excluding the impact of interest expense and interest income not attributable to our Card Member loans. We believe adjusted net interest income is useful to investors because it represents the interest expense and interest income attributable to our Card Member loan portfolio and it is a component of net interest yield on average Card Member loans. Asset securitizations — Asset securitization involves the transfer and sale of loans or receivables to a special-purpose entity created for the securitization activity, typically a trust. The trust, in turn, issues securities, commonly referred to as asset-backed securities that are secured by the transferred loans and receivables. The trust uses the proceeds from the sale of such securities to pay the purchase price for the underlying loans or receivables. The loans and receivables of our Lending Trust and Charge Trust (collectively, the Trusts) securitized are reported as assets and the securities issued by the Trusts are reported as liabilities on our “Consolidated Balance Sheets.” Average discount rate — This calculation is generally designed to reflect the average pricing at all merchants accepting American Express cards and represents the percentage of proprietary and GNS billed business retained by us from merchants we acquire, or from merchants acquired by third parties on our behalf, net of amounts retained by such third parties. Billed business — Represents transaction volumes (including cash advances) on cards and other payment products issued by American Express (proprietary billed business) and cards issued under network partnership agreements with banks and other institutions, including joint ventures (GNS billed business). In-store spending activity within GNS retail cobrand portfolios, from which we earn no revenue, is not included in billed business. Billed business is reported as in the United States or outside the United States based on the location of the issuer. Capital ratios — Represents the minimum standards established by the regulatory agencies as a measure to determine whether the regulated entity has sufficient capital to absorb on- and off-balance sheet losses beyond current loss accrual estimates. Refer to the Capital Strategy section under “Consolidated Capital Resources and Liquidity” for further related definitions under Basel III. Cards-in-force — Represents the number of cards that are issued and outstanding by American Express (proprietary cards-in-force) and cards issued and outstanding under network partnership agreements with banks and other institutions, including joint ventures (GNS cards-in-force), except for GNS retail cobrand cards that had no out-of-store spending activity during the prior twelve months. Basic cards-in-force excludes supplemental cards issued on consumer accounts. Card Member — The individual holder of an issued American Express-branded charge, credit and certain prepaid cards. Card Member loans — Represents the outstanding amount due from Card Members for charges made on their American Express credit cards, as well as any interest charges and card-related fees. Card Member loans also include revolving balances on certain American Express charge card products. Card Member loans and receivables HFS — Beginning as of December 1, 2015 and continuing until the sales were completed, represents Card Member loans and receivables related to our cobrand partnerships with Costco in the United States and JetBlue. The JetBlue and Costco portfolio sales were completed on March 18 and June 17, 2016, respectively. Card Member receivables — Represents the outstanding amount due from Card Members for charges made on their American Express charge cards, as well as any card-related fees, other than revolving balances on certain American Express charge cards with Pay Over Time features. Such revolving balances are included within Card Member loans. Charge cards — Represents cards that generally carry no pre-set spending limits and are primarily designed as a method of payment and not as a means of financing purchases. Charge Card Members generally must pay the full amount billed each month. No finance charges are assessed on charge cards. Each charge card transaction is authorized based on its likely economics reflecting a Card Member’s most recent credit information and spend patterns. Some charge card accounts have additional Pay Over Time feature(s) that allow revolving of certain charges. Cobrand cards — Cards issued under cobrand agreements with selected commercial firms. Pursuant to the cobrand agreements, we make payments to our cobrand partners, which can be significant, based primarily on the amount of Card Member spending and corresponding rewards earned on such spending and, under certain arrangements, on the number of accounts acquired and retained. The partner is then liable for providing rewards to the Card Member under the cobrand partner’s own loyalty program. 67 Table of Contents Credit cards — Represents cards that have a range of revolving payment terms, grace periods, and rate and fee structures. Discount revenue — Primarily represents revenue earned from fees charged to merchants who have entered into a card acceptance agreement. The discount fee is generally deducted from our payment for Card Member purchases. Interest expense — Includes interest incurred primarily to fund Card Member loans and receivables, general corporate purposes and liquidity needs, and is recognized as incurred. Interest expense is divided principally into two categories: (i) deposits, which primarily relates to interest expense on deposits taken from customers and institutions, and (ii) debt, which primarily relates to interest expense on our long-term financing and short-term borrowings, (e.g., commercial paper, federal funds purchased, bank overdrafts and other short-term borrowings), as well as the realized impact of derivatives hedging interest rate risk on our long-term debt. Interest income — Includes (i) interest on loans, (ii) interest and dividends on investment securities and (iii) interest income on deposits with banks and other. Interest on loans — Assessed using the average daily balance method for Card Member loans and loans HFS. Unless the loan is classified as non-accrual, interest is recognized based upon the principal amount outstanding in accordance with the terms of the applicable account agreement until the outstanding balance is paid or written off. Interest and dividends on investment securities — Primarily relates to our performing fixed-income securities. Interest income is recognized as earned using the effective interest method, which adjusts the yield for security premiums and discounts, fees and other payments, so a constant rate of return is recognized on the outstanding balance of the related investment security throughout its term. Amounts are recognized until securities are in default or when it is likely that future interest payments will not be made as scheduled. Interest income on deposits with banks and other — Recognized as earned, and primarily relates to the placement of cash in excess of near-term funding requirements in interest-bearing time deposits, overnight sweep accounts, and other interest-bearing demand and call accounts. Liquidity Coverage Ratio — Represents the minimum standards established by the regulatory agencies as a measure to determine whether the regulated entity has sufficient liquidity to meet liquidity needs in periods of financial and economic stress. Merchant acquisition — Represents our process of entering into agreements with merchants to accept American Express-branded cards. Net card fees — Represents the card membership fees earned during the period. These fees are recognized as revenue over the covered card membership period (typically one year), net of the provision for projected refunds for Card Membership cancellation and deferred acquisition costs. Net interest yield on average Card Member loans — A non-GAAP measure that is computed by dividing adjusted net interest income by average Card Member loans, computed on an annualized basis. Reserves and net write-offs related to uncollectible interest are recorded through provisions for losses, and are thus not included in the net interest yield calculation. We believe net interest yield on average Card Member loans is useful to investors because it provides a measure of profitability of our Card Member loan portfolio. Net loss ratio — Represents the ratio of GCP charge card write-offs, consisting of principal (resulting from authorized transactions) and fee components, less recoveries, on Card Member receivables expressed as a percentage of gross amounts billed to corporate Card Members. Net write-off rate — principal only — Represents the amount of proprietary consumer or small business Card Member loans or receivables written off, consisting of principal (resulting from authorized transactions), less recoveries, as a percentage of the average loan or receivables balance during the period. Net write-off rate — principal, interest and fees — Includes, in the calculation of the net write-off rate, amounts for interest and fees in addition to principal for Card Member loans and fees in addition to principal for Card Member receivables. Operating expenses — Represents salaries and employee benefits, professional services, occupancy and equipment, and other expenses. Return on average equity — Calculated by dividing one-year period net income by one-year average total shareholders’ equity. 68 Table of Contents CAUTIONARY NOTE REGARDING FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS This report includes forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, which are subject to risks and uncertainties. The forward-looking statements, which address our current expectations regarding business and financial performance, among other matters, contain words such as “believe,” “expect,” “anticipate,” “intend,” “plan,” “aim,” “will,” “may,” “should,” “could,” “would,” “likely,” and similar expressions. Readers are cautioned not to place undue reliance on these forward-looking statements, which speak only as of the date on which they are made. We undertake no obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statements. Factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from these forward-looking statements, include, but are not limited to, the following:  our ability to grow earnings per share in the future, which will depend in part on revenue growth, credit performance and the effective tax rate remaining consistent with current expectations, the company’s ability to control operating expense growth and generate operating leverage, and the company’s ability to continue executing its share repurchase program, any of which could be impacted by, among other things, the factors identified in the subsequent paragraphs as well as the following: issues impacting brand perceptions and our reputation; the impact of any future contingencies, including, but not limited to, litigation-related settlements, judgments or expenses, the imposition of fines or civil money penalties, increases in Card Member reimbursements, restructurings, impairments and changes in reserves; the amount we spend on customer engagement and our inability to drive growth from such investments; changes in interest rates beyond current expectations (including the impact of hedge ineffectiveness and deposit rate increases); a greater impact from new or renegotiated cobrand agreements than expected, which could be affected by spending volumes and customer engagement; and the impact of regulation and litigation, which could affect the profitability of our business activities, limit our ability to pursue business opportunities, require changes to business practices or alter our relationships with partners, merchants and Card Members;  our ability to grow revenues net of interest expense, which could be impacted by, among other things, weakening economic conditions in the United States or internationally, a decline in consumer confidence impacting the willingness and ability of Card Members to sustain and grow spending and revolve balances, growth in Card Member loans and the yield on Card Member loans not remaining consistent with current expectations, a greater decline of the average discount rate than expected, the strengthening of the U.S. dollar beyond expectations, the willingness of Card Members to pay higher card fees, lower spending on new cards acquired than estimated, and our inability to address competitive pressures and implement our strategies and business initiatives, including within the premium consumer segment, commercial payments, the global network and digital environment;  changes in the substantial and increasing worldwide competition in the payments industry, including competitive pressure that may impact the prices we charge merchants that accept American Express cards, competition for new and existing cobrand relationships, competition from new and non-traditional competitors and the success of marketing, promotion and rewards programs;  the average discount rate changing by a greater amount than anticipated, including as a result of changes in the mix of spending by location and industry, merchant negotiations (including merchant incentives, concessions and volume-related pricing discounts), pricing initiatives, competition, pricing regulation (including regulation of competitors’ interchange rates in the European Union and elsewhere) and other factors;  our delinquency and write-off rates and growth of provisions for losses being higher or lower than current expectations, which will depend in part on changes in the level of loan and receivable balances and delinquencies generally, as well as macroeconomic factors, the mix of balances, newer vintages and balance transfers, loans and receivables related to new Card Members and other borrowers performing as expected, credit performance of new and enhanced lending products, unemployment rates, the volume of bankruptcies, collections capabilities and recoveries of previously written-off loans and receivables;  our ability to continue to grow loans, which may be affected by increasing competition, brand perceptions and reputation, our ability to manage risk, the behavior of Card Members and their actual spending and borrowing patterns, and our ability to issue new and enhanced card products, offer attractive non-card lending products, capture a greater share of existing Card Members’ spending and borrowings, reduce Card Member attrition and attract new customers;  our net interest yield on average Card Member loans not remaining consistent with current expectations, which will be influenced by, among other things, the difference between the prime rate and our cost of funds, changes in consumer behavior that affect loan balances (such as paydown rates), our Card Member acquisition strategy, product mix, credit actions, including line size and other adjustments to credit availability, changes in the level of loans at promotional rates and other pricing changes, which could be impacted by, among other things, changes in benchmark interest rates, competitive pressure and regulatory constraints;  the actual amount to be spent on customer engagement, which will be based in part on management’s assessment of competitive opportunities; overall business performance and changes in macroeconomic conditions; our ability to cost effectively enhance card products and services to make them attractive to Card Members; Card Member behavior as it relates to their spending patterns (including the level of spend in bonus categories) and the redemption of rewards and offers, as well as the degree of interest of Card Members in the value propositions we offer; the costs related to reward point redemptions, advertising and Card Member acquisition; our ability to continue to shift Card Member acquisition to digital channels; new and renegotiated contractual obligations with business partners; and the pace and cost of the expansion of our global lounge collection; 69 Table of Contents  our ability to control operating expense growth, which could be impacted by the need to increase significant categories of operating expenses, such as consulting or professional fees, including as a result of increased litigation, compliance or regulatory-related costs, or cyber or fraud costs; higher than expected employee levels; an inability to innovate efficient channels of customer interactions, such as chat supported by artificial intelligence, or customer acquisition; the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates on costs; the payment of civil money penalties, disgorgement, restitution, non-income tax assessments and litigation-related settlements; impairments of goodwill or other assets; management’s decision to increase or decrease spending in such areas as technology, business and product development and sales forces; greater -than -expected inflation; and the level of M&A activity and related expenses;  our ability to satisfy our commitments to certain of our cobrand partners as part of the ongoing operations of the business, which will be impacted in part by competition, brand perceptions and reputation, and our ability to develop and market value propositions that appeal to current cobrand Card Members and new customers and offer attractive services and rewards programs, which will depend in part on ongoing investments, new product innovation and development, Card Member acquisition efforts and enrollment processes, including through digital channels, and infrastructure to support new products, services and benefits;  changes affecting our plans regarding the return of capital to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases, which will depend on factors such as our capital levels and regulatory capital ratios; changes in the stress testing and capital planning process and the continued non-objection by our primary regulators to our capital plans; the amount of capital required to support asset growth; the amount we spend on acquisitions of companies; and our results of operations and financial condition; and the economic environment and market conditions in any given period;  our tax rate not remaining consistent with current expectations, which could be impacted by, among other things, the company’s geographic mix of income, further changes in tax laws and regulation, unfavorable tax audits and other unanticipated tax items;  a failure in or breach of our operational or security systems, processes or infrastructure, or those of third parties, including as a result of cyberattacks, which could compromise the confidentiality, integrity, privacy and/or security of data, disrupt our operations, reduce the use and acceptance of American Express cards and lead to regulatory scrutiny, litigation, remediation and response costs, and reputational harm;  our deposit rates increasing faster or slower than current expectations and changes affecting our ability to grow Personal Savings deposits due to market demand, changes in benchmark interest rates, competition or regulatory restrictions on our ability to obtain deposit funding or offer competitive interest rates, which could affect our net interest yield and ability to fund our businesses;  our funding plan being implemented in a manner inconsistent with current expectations, which will depend on various factors such as future business growth, the impact of global economic, political and other events on market capacity, demand for securities we offer, regulatory changes, ability to securitize and sell receivables and the performance of receivables previously sold in securitization transactions;  changes in global economic and business conditions, consumer and business spending generally, the availability and cost of capital, unemployment rates, geopolitical conditions, Brexit, prolonged or recurring government shutdowns, trade policies, foreign currency rates and interest rates, all of which may significantly affect demand for and spending on American Express cards, delinquency rates, loan and receivable balances and other aspects of our business and results of operations;  changes in capital and credit market conditions, which may significantly affect our ability to meet our liquidity needs, expectations regarding capital and liquidity ratios, access to capital and cost of capital, including changes in interest rates; changes in market conditions affecting the valuation of our assets; or any reduction in our credit ratings or those of our subsidiaries, which could materially increase the cost and other terms of our funding or restrict our access to the capital markets;  legal and regulatory developments, which could require us to make fundamental changes to many of our business practices, including our ability to continue certain cobrand and agent relationships in their current form; exert further pressure on the average discount rate and GNS volumes; result in increased costs related to regulatory oversight, litigation-related settlements, judgments or expenses, restitution to Card Members or the imposition of fines or civil money penalties; materially affect our capital or liquidity requirements, results of operations or ability to pay dividends or repurchase stock; or result in harm to the American Express brand;  changes in the financial condition and creditworthiness of our business partners, such as bankruptcies, restructurings or consolidations, including merchants that represent a significant portion of our business, such as the airline industry, or our partners in GNS or financial institutions that we rely on for routine funding and liquidity, which could materially affect our financial condition or results of operations; and  factors beyond our control such as fire, power loss, disruptions in telecommunications, severe weather conditions, natural disasters, health pandemics or terrorism, any of which could significantly affect demand for and spending on American Express cards, delinquency rates, loan and receivable balances and other aspects of our business and results of operations or disrupt our global network systems and ability to process transactions.

The 2018 adjusted ETR excludes a benefit of $496 million relating to changes in the tax method of accounting for certain expenses, the resolution of certain prior years’ tax audits, and a final adjustment to our 2017 provisional tax charge related to the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act enacted on December 22, 2017 (Tax Act). The 2017 adjusted ETR excludes the $2.6 billion charge related to the Tax Act. Management believes the adjusted ETRs are useful in evaluating our tax rates in comparison with the other presented periods.

U.S. billed business increased 6 percent and non-U.S. billed business increased 2 percent. See Tables 5 and 6 for more details on billed business performance. The average discount rate remained flat at 2.37 percent for both 2019 and 2018. Net card fees increased, primarily driven by growth in the Platinum, Delta and Gold portfolios, as well as growth in certain key international countries.Other fees and commissions increased, primarily driven by growth in foreign exchange conversion revenue and delinquency fees. Other revenues increased, primarily due to higher revenues related to the GBT JV and a modification of one of our GNS arrangements, partially offset by lower revenue earned on cross-border Card Member spending.Interest income increased, primarily reflecting higher average Card Member loans and higher yields. Interest expense increased, driven by higher cost of funds, average long-term debt and average deposits.TABLE 3: PROVISIONS FOR LOSSES SUMMARYYears Ended December 31,ChangeChange(Millions, except percentages)2019201820172019 vs. 20182018 vs. 2017Charge card$963 $937 $795 $26 3 %$142 18 %Card Member loans2,462 2,266 1,868 196 9 398 21 Other148 149 97 (1) (1) 52 54 Total provisions for losses$3,573 $3,352 $2,760 $221 7 %$592 21 %PROVISIONS FOR LOSSESCharge card provision for losses increased, primarily due to growth in receivables and higher net write-offs in the consumer and small business portfolios, partially offset by lower net write-offs in the corporate portfolio.Card Member loans provision for losses increased, driven by higher net write-offs, partially offset by a lower reserve build due to slower loan growth.See Note 1 to our ""Consolidated Financial Statements"" for information about the implementation and expected impact of new accounting guidance for the recognition of credit losses on financial instruments, effective January 1, 2020, and the new credit reserving methodology known as the Current Expected Credit Loss (CECL) methodology. Following the adoption, the future effects of CECL on our provisions for losses will ultimately be dependent on a number of internal and external factors. Assuming no change in the growth in Card Member loans, current macroeconomic conditions, and portfolio quality, we estimate our provisions for losses will likely be higher under CECL and may result in more quarter-to-quarter fluctuations relative to the current accounting methodology.TABLE 4: EXPENSES SUMMARYYears Ended December 31,ChangeChange(Millions, except percentages)2019201820172019 vs. 20182018 vs. 2017Marketing and business development$7,114 $6,470 $5,722 $644 10 %$748 13 %Card Member rewards10,439 9,696 8,687 743 8 1,009 12 Card Member services2,222 1,777 1,392 445 25 385 28 Total marketing, business development, rewards and Card Member services19,775 17,943 15,801 1,832 10 2,142 14 Salaries and employee benefits5,911 5,250 5,258 661 13 (8) — Other, net5,868 5,671 5,634 197 3 37 1 Total expenses$31,554 $28,864 $26,693 $2,690 9 %$2,171 8 %EXPENSESMarketing and business development expense increased, primarily due to continued investments in partnerships (including as a result of the recent renewal of our cobrand relationship with Delta Air Lines), increased network partner payments and 40Table of Contentsincreased corporate client incentives driven by higher volumes, partially offset by higher marketing costs in the prior year with the launch of our new global brand campaign.Card Member rewards expense increased, primarily driven by increases in Membership Rewards and cash back rewards expenses of $505 million and cobrand rewards expense of $238 million, both of which were primarily driven by higher spending volumes.The Membership Rewards Ultimate Redemption Rate for current program participants at both December 31, 2019 and 2018 was 96 percent (rounded up).Card Member services expense increased, primarily driven by higher usage of travel-related benefits.Salaries and employee benefits expense increased, reflecting higher payroll costs, higher restructuring charges and higher incentive and deferred compensation.Other expenses increased, primarily driven by lower unrealized gains on certain equity investments, higher technology costs and litigation-related expenses, partially offset by non-income tax-related benefits and a prior-year loss on a transaction involving the operations of our prepaid reloadable and gift card business.INCOME TAXESThe effective tax rate for 2019 was 19.8 percent. The effective tax rate for 2018 was 14.8 percent, and reflects a benefit of $496 million relating to changes in the tax method of accounting for certain expenses, the resolution of certain prior years’ tax audits and an adjustment to the 2017 provisional tax charge related to the Tax Act. The tax rates in both periods reflect the level of pretax income in relation to recurring permanent tax benefits and the geographic mix of business.TABLE 5: SELECTED CARD-RELATED STATISTICAL INFORMATIONChangeChangeYears Ended December 31,2019201820172019 vs. 20182018 vs. 2017Billed business: (billions)U.S.$827.7 $777.6 $708.3 6 %10 %Outside the U.S.413.1 406.4 376.9 2 8 Total$1,240.8 $1,184.0 $1,085.2 5 9 Proprietary$1,070.5 $1,002.6 $900.6 7 11 GNS170.3 181.4 184.6 (6) (2) Total$1,240.8 $1,184.0 $1,085.2 5 9 Cards-in-force: (millions)U.S.54.7 53.7 50.0 2 7 Outside the U.S.59.7 60.3 62.8 (1) (4) Total114.4 114.0 112.8 — 1 Proprietary70.3 69.1 64.6 2 7 GNS44.1 44.9 48.2 (2) (7) Total114.4 114.0 112.8 — 1 Basic cards-in-force: (millions)U.S.43.0 42.3 39.4 2 7 Outside the U.S.50.0 50.3 52.2 (1) (4) Total93.0 92.6 91.6 — 1 Average proprietary basic Card Member spending: (dollars)U.S.$21,515 $20,840 $20,317 3 3 Outside the U.S.$16,351 $15,756 $14,277 4 10 Worldwide Average$19,972 $19,340 $18,519 3 4 Average discount rate2.37 %2.37 %2.40 %Average fee per card (dollars)(a)$58 $51 $49 14 %4 %(a)Average fee per card is computed based on proprietary net card fees divided by average proprietary total cards-in-force.41Table of ContentsTABLE 6: BILLED BUSINESS GROWTH20192018Percentage Increase(Decrease)Percentage Increase (Decrease) Assuming No Changes in FX Rates(a)Percentage Increase(Decrease)Percentage Increase (Decrease)Assuming No Changes in FX Rates(a)WorldwideProprietaryProprietary consumer8 %9 %12 %12 %Proprietary commercial6 6 11 11 Total Proprietary7 8 11 11 GNS(6) (2) (2) (1) Worldwide Total5 6 9 9 Airline-related volume (8% of Worldwide Total for both 2019 and 2018)1 3 8 7 U.S.ProprietaryProprietary consumer7 10 Proprietary commercial5 10 Total Proprietary6 10 U.S. Total6 10 T&E-related volume (25% of U.S. Total for both 2019 and 2018)6 8 Non-T&E-related volume (75% of U.S. Total for both 2019 and 2018)6 10 Airline-related volume (7% of U.S. Total for both 2019 and 2018)4 8 Outside the U.S.ProprietaryProprietary consumer10 14 17 17 Proprietary commercial7 11 16 16 Total Proprietary9 13 17 17 Outside the U.S. Total2 6 8 8 Japan, Asia Pacific & Australia1 5 8 7 Latin America & Canada4 10 4 11 Europe, the Middle East & Africa1 %5 %10 %8 %(a)The foreign currency adjusted information assumes a constant exchange rate between the periods being compared for purposes of currency translation into U.S. dollars (i.e., assumes the foreign exchange rates used to determine results for the current year apply to the corresponding prior-year period against which such results are being compared).42Table of ContentsTABLE 7: SELECTED CREDIT-RELATED STATISTICAL INFORMATIONAs of or for the Years Ended December 31,ChangeChange(Millions, except percentages and where indicated)2019201820172019 vs. 20182018 vs. 2017Worldwide Card Member loansCard Member loans: (billions)U.S. $76.0 $72.0 $64.5 6 %12 %Outside the U.S. 11.4 9.9 8.9 15 11 Total$87.4 $81.9 $73.4 7 12 Loss reserves:Beginning balance$2,134 $1,706 $1,223 25 39 Provisions - principal, interest and fees2,462 2,266 1,868 9 21 Net write-offs — principal less recoveries(1,860) (1,539) (1,181) 21 30 Net write-offs — interest and fees less recoveries(375) (304) (227) 23 34 Other (a)22 5 23 # (78) Ending balance$2,383 $2,134 $1,706 12 25 Ending reserves — principal$2,252 $2,028 $1,622 11 25 Ending reserves — interest and fees$131 $106 $84 24 26 % of loans2.7 %2.6 %2.3 %% of past due177 %182 %177 %Average loans (billions)$82.8 $75.8 $66.7 9 14 Net write-off rate — principal only (b)2.2 %2.0 %1.8 %Net write-off rate — principal, interest and fees (b)2.7 %2.4 %2.1 %30+ days past due as a % of total (b)1.5 %1.4 %1.3 %Worldwide Card Member receivablesCard Member receivables: (billions)U.S.$39.0 $39.0 $37.6 — 4 Outside the U.S.18.4 16.9 16.4 9 3 Total$57.4 $55.9 $54.0 3 4 Loss reserves:Beginning balance$573 $521 $467 10 12 Provisions - principal and fees963 937 795 3 18 Net write-offs - principal and fees less recoveries(900) (859) (736) 5 17 Other (a)(17) (26) (5) (35) # Ending balance$619 $573 $521 8 %10 %% of receivables1.1 %1.0 %1.0 %Net write-off rate — principal only (b)1.8 %1.7 %1.6 %Net write-off rate — principal and fees (b)2.0 %1.8 %1.7 %30+ days past due as a % of total (b)1.4 %1.4 %1.4 %Net loss ratio as a % of charge volume — GCP (c)0.08 %0.11 %0.10 %90+ days past billing as a % of total — GCP (c)0.8 %0.7 %0.9 %# Denotes a variance greater than 100 percent(a)Other includes foreign currency translation adjustments. (b)We present a net write-off rate based on principal losses only (i.e., excluding interest and/or fees) to be consistent with industry convention. In addition, as our practice is to include uncollectible interest and/or fees as part of our total provision for losses, a net write-off rate including principal, interest and/or fees is also presented. The net write-off rates and 30+ days past due as a percentage of total for Card Member receivables relate to GCSG and Global Small Business Services (GSBS) Card Member receivables.(c)Global Corporate Payments (GCP) reflects global, large and middle market corporate accounts. For GCP Card Member receivables, delinquency data is tracked based on days past billing status rather than days past due. A Card Member account is considered 90 days past billing if payment has not been received within 90 days of the Card Member’s billing statement date. In addition, if we initiate collection procedures on an account prior to the account becoming 90 days past billing, the associated Card Member receivable balance is classified as 90 days past billing. These amounts are shown above as 90+ Days Past Due for presentation purposes. GCP delinquency data for periods other than 90+ days past billing is not available due to system constraints. The net loss ratio for GCP represents the ratio of GCP charge card write-offs, consisting of principal (resulting from authorized transactions) and fee components, less recoveries, on Card Member receivables expressed as a percentage of gross amounts billed to corporate Card Members. 43Table of ContentsTABLE 8: NET INTEREST YIELD ON AVERAGE CARD MEMBER LOANSYears Ended December 31,(Millions, except percentages and where indicated)201920182017Net interest income$8,620 $7,663 $6,451 Exclude:Interest expense not attributable to our Card Member loan portfolio (a)1,732 1,456 1,149 Interest income not attributable to our Card Member loan portfolio (b)(1,226) (1,010) (637) Adjusted net interest income (c)$9,126 $8,109 $6,963 Average Card Member loans (billions)$82.8 $75.8 $66.7 Net interest income divided by average Card Member loans (c)10.4 %10.1 %9.7 %Net interest yield on average Card Member loans (c)11.0 %10.7 %10.4 %(a)Primarily represents interest expense attributable to maintaining our corporate liquidity pool and funding Card Member receivables.(b)Primarily represents interest income attributable to Other loans, interest-bearing deposits and the fixed income investment portfolios.(c)Adjusted net interest income and net interest yield on average Card Member loans are non-GAAP measures. Refer to “Glossary of Selected Terminology” for the definitions of these terms. We believe adjusted net interest income is useful to investors because it represents the interest expense and interest income attributable to our Card Member loan portfolio and is a component of net interest yield on average Card Member loans, which provides a measure of profitability of our Card Member loan portfolio. Net interest yield on average Card Member loans reflects adjusted net interest income divided by average Card Member loans, computed on an annualized basis. Net interest income divided by average Card Member loans, computed on an annualized basis, a GAAP measure, includes elements of total interest income and total interest expense that are not attributable to the Card Member loan portfolio, and thus is not representative of net interest yield on average Card Member loans.44Table of ContentsBUSINESS SEGMENT RESULTS OF OPERATIONSWe consider a combination of factors when evaluating the composition of our reportable operating segments, including the results reviewed by the chief operating decision maker, economic characteristics, products and services offered, classes of customers, product distribution channels, geographic considerations (primarily United States versus outside the United States) and regulatory considerations. Refer to Note 24 to the “Consolidated Financial Statements” and Part I, Item 1. “Business” for additional discussion of products and services that comprise each segment.Effective for the first quarter of 2019, we moved intercompany assets and liabilities, previously recorded in the operating segments, to Corporate & Other. Prior period amounts have been revised to conform to the current period presentation.Results of the reportable operating segments generally treat each segment as a stand-alone business. The management reporting process that derives these results allocates revenue and expense using various methodologies as described below.TOTAL REVENUES NET OF INTEREST EXPENSEWe allocate discount revenue and certain other revenues among segments using a transfer pricing methodology. Within the GCSG and GCS segments, discount revenue generally reflects the issuer component of the overall discount revenue generated by each segment’s Card Members; within the GMNS segment, discount revenue generally reflects the network and acquirer component of the overall discount revenue.Net card fees and Other fees and commissions are directly attributable to the segment in which they are reported.Interest and fees on loans and certain investment income is directly attributable to the segment in which it is reported. Interest expense represents an allocated funding cost based on a combination of segment funding requirements and internal funding rates.PROVISIONS FOR LOSSESThe provisions for losses are directly attributable to the segment in which they are reported.EXPENSESMarketing and business development expense is included in each segment based on the actual expenses incurred. Global brand advertising is primarily reflected in Corporate & Other and may be allocated to the segments based on the actual expenses incurred. Rewards and Card Member services expenses are included in each segment based on the actual expenses incurred.Salaries and employee benefits and other operating expenses reflect expenses such as professional services, occupancy and equipment and communications incurred directly within each segment. In addition, expenses related to support services, such as technology costs, are allocated to each segment primarily based on support service activities directly attributable to the segment. Certain other overhead expenses are allocated from Corporate & Other to the segments based on the relative levels of revenue and Card Member loans and receivables.INCOME TAXESAn income tax provision (benefit) is allocated to each reportable operating segment based on the effective tax rates applicable to the various businesses that comprise the segment. 45Table of ContentsGLOBAL CONSUMER SERVICES GROUPTABLE 9: GCSG SELECTED INCOME STATEMENT DATAYears Ended December 31,ChangeChange(Millions, except percentages)2019201820172019 vs. 20182018 vs. 2017RevenuesNon-interest revenues$15,972 $14,675 $13,378 $1,297 9 %$1,297 10 %Interest income9,413 8,323 6,789 1,090 13 1,534 23 Interest expense1,806 1,542 1,047 264 17 495 47 Net interest income7,607 6,781 5,742 826 12 1,039 18 Total revenues net of interest expense23,579 21,456 19,120 2,123 10 2,336 12 Provisions for losses2,636 2,430 1,996 206 8 434 22 Total revenues net of interest expense after provisions for losses20,943 19,026 17,124 1,917 10 1,902 11 ExpensesMarketing, business development, rewards and Card Member services12,023 10,774 9,233 1,249 12 1,541 17 Salaries and employee benefits and other operating expenses4,896 4,538 4,246 358 8 292 7 Total expenses16,919 15,312 13,479 1,607 10 1,833 14 Pretax segment income4,024 3,714 3,645 310 8 69 2 Income tax provision762 637 1,053 125 20 (416) (40) Segment income$3,262 $3,077 $2,592 $185 6 %$485 19 %Effective tax rate18.9 %17.2 %28.9 %GCSG primarily issues a wide range of proprietary consumer cards globally. GCSG also provides services to consumers, including travel and lifestyle services and non-card financing products, and manages certain international joint ventures and our partnership agreements in China.TOTAL REVENUES NET OF INTEREST EXPENSENon-interest revenues increased, primarily driven by discount revenue and net card fees. Discount revenue increased 8 percent reflecting a corresponding increase in proprietary consumer billed business. See Tables 5, 6 and 10 for more details on billed business performance. The increase in proprietary consumer billed business reflected higher average spend per card and higher cards-in-force. Net card fees increased 19 percent, driven primarily by growth in the Delta, Platinum and Gold portfolios, as well as growth in certain key international countries. Net interest income increased, primarily driven by growth in average Card Member loans and higher yields, partially offset by higher cost of funds.PROVISIONS FOR LOSSESProvisions for losses increased, primarily driven by higher net write-offs, partially offset by a lower reserve build in Card Member loans due to slower loan growth.Refer to Table 10 for the Card Member loan and receivable write-off rates for 2019 and 2018.EXPENSESMarketing, business development, rewards and Card Member services expenses increased across all expense categories. The increase in Card Member rewards expense was primarily driven by higher proprietary and cobrand spending volumes. The increase in Card Member services expense was primarily driven by higher usage of travel-related benefits. The increase in marketing and business development expenses was primarily due to higher cobrand partner payments.Salaries and employee benefits and other operating expenses increased, primarily driven by higher technology and other servicing-related costs, and increased payroll costs, partially offset by non-income tax-related benefits.46Table of ContentsTABLE 10: GCSG SELECTED STATISTICAL INFORMATIONAs of or for the Years Ended December 31,ChangeChange(Millions, except percentages and where indicated)2019201820172019 vs. 20182018 vs. 2017Proprietary billed business: (billions)U.S.$398.8 $371.1 $336.9 7 %10 %Outside the U.S.154.0 140.3 119.8 10 17 Total$552.8 $511.4 $456.7 8 12 Proprietary cards-in-force:U.S.37.9 37.7 34.9 1 8 Outside the U.S.17.5 16.8 15.8 4 6 Total55.4 54.5 50.7 2 7 Proprietary basic cards-in-force:U.S.26.9 27.0 25.0 — 8 Outside the U.S.12.1 11.6 10.9 4 6 Total39.0 38.6 35.9 1 8 Average proprietary basic Card Member spending: (dollars)U.S.$14,801 $14,161 $13,950 5 2 Outside the U.S.$12,884 $12,348 $11,225 4 10 Average$14,212 $13,613 $13,115 4 4 Total segment assets (billions)(a)$106.3 $102.4 $94.9 4 8 Card Member loans:Total loans (billions)U.S.$62.4 $59.9 $53.7 4 12 Outside the U.S.10.9 9.6 8.6 14 12 Total$73.3 $69.5 $62.3 5 12 Average loans (billions)U.S.$59.4 $55.1 $49.0 8 12 Outside the U.S.10.0 8.9 7.4 12 20 Total$69.4 $64.0 $56.4 8 %13 %U.S.Net write-off rate — principal only (b)2.3 %2.1 %1.8 %Net write-off rate — principal, interest and fees (b)2.8 %2.5 %2.1 %30+ days past due as a % of total1.6 %1.4 %1.3 %Outside the U.S.Net write-off rate — principal only (b)2.4 %2.1 %2.1 %Net write-off rate — principal, interest and fees (b)2.9 %2.6 %2.5 %30+ days past due as a % of total1.8 %1.6 %1.4 %TotalNet write-off rate — principal only (b)2.3 %2.1 %1.8 %Net write-off rate — principal, interest and fees (b)2.8 %2.5 %2.2 %30+ days past due as a % of total1.6 %1.5 %1.3 %47Table of ContentsChangeChange(Millions, except percentages and where indicated)2019201820172019 vs. 20182018 vs. 2017Card Member receivables: (billions)U.S.$14.2 $13.7 $13.1 4 %5 %Outside the U.S.8.6 7.8 7.8 10 — Total receivables$22.8 $21.5 $20.9 6 %3 %U.S.Net write-off rate — principal only (b)1.4 %1.3 %1.3 %Net write-off rate — principal and fees (b)1.6 %1.5 %1.4 %30+ days past due as a % of total1.2 %1.1 %1.1 %Outside the U.S.Net write-off rate — principal only (b)2.2 %2.1 %2.0 %Net write-off rate — principal and fees (b)2.4 %2.3 %2.1 %30+ days past due as a % of total1.3 %1.3 %1.3 %TotalNet write-off rate — principal only (b)1.7 %1.6 %1.5 %Net write-off rate — principal and fees (b)1.9 %1.8 %1.7 %30+ days past due as a % of total1.2 %1.2 %1.2 %(a) During 2019, we moved intercompany assets and liabilities, previously recorded in the operating segments, to Corporate & Other.

The increase in the net loss in 2019 compared to 2018 was primarily driven by lower discrete tax benefits, lower unrealized gains on certain equity investments and higher restructuring charges. 52Table of ContentsCONSOLIDATED CAPITAL RESOURCES AND LIQUIDITYOur balance sheet management objectives are to maintain:•A solid and flexible equity capital profile;•A broad, deep and diverse set of funding sources to finance our assets and meet operating requirements; and•Liquidity programs that enable us to continuously meet expected future financing obligations and business requirements for at least a twelve-month period in the event we are unable to continue to raise new funds under our traditional funding programs during a substantial weakening in economic conditions.CAPITAL STRATEGYOur objective is to retain sufficient levels of capital generated through earnings and other sources to maintain a solid equity capital base and to provide flexibility to support future business growth. We believe capital allocated to growing businesses with a return on risk-adjusted equity in excess of our costs will generate shareholder value.The level and composition of our consolidated capital position are determined through our Internal Capital Adequacy Assessment Process, which takes into account our business activities, as well as marketplace conditions and requirements or expectations of credit rating agencies, regulators and shareholders, among others. Our consolidated capital position is also influenced by subsidiary capital requirements. As a bank holding company, we are also subject to regulatory requirements administered by the U.S. federal banking agencies. The Federal Reserve has established specific capital adequacy guidelines that involve quantitative measures of assets, liabilities and certain off-balance sheet items.We report our capital ratios using the Basel III capital definitions and the Basel III standardized approach for calculating risk-weighted assets. The Basel III minimum requirements and the capital conservation buffers have been fully phased in as of January 1, 2019. As a Category IV firm, we are no longer subject to the Basel III advanced approaches capital requirements. Refer to ""Financial Regulatory Reform"" under Part I, Item I. ""Business ― Supervision and Regulation"" for additional details.The following table presents our regulatory risk-based capital ratios and leverage ratios and those of our significant bank subsidiary, American Express National Bank (AENB) as of December 31, 2019.

Failure to maintain minimum capital levels at American Express or AENB could affect our status as a financial holding company and cause the regulatory agencies with oversight of American Express or AENB to take actions that could limit our business operations.Our primary source of equity capital has been the generation of net income. Capital generated through net income and other sources, such as the exercise of stock options by employees, is used to maintain a strong balance sheet, support asset growth and engage in acquisitions, with excess available for distribution to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. We maintain certain flexibility to shift capital across our businesses as appropriate. For example, we may infuse additional capital into subsidiaries to maintain capital at targeted levels in consideration of debt ratings and regulatory requirements. These infused amounts can affect the capital profile and liquidity levels at the American Express parent company level.The following are definitions for our regulatory risk-based capital ratios and leverage ratio, which are calculated as per standard regulatory guidance:Risk-Weighted Assets — Assets are weighted for risk according to a formula used by the Federal Reserve to conform to capital adequacy guidelines. On- and off-balance sheet items are weighted for risk, with off-balance sheet items converted to balance sheet equivalents, using risk conversion factors, before being allocated a risk-adjusted weight. Off-balance sheet exposures comprise a minimal part of the total risk-weighted assets.Common Equity Tier 1 Risk-Based Capital Ratio — Calculated as Common Equity Tier 1 capital (CET1), divided by risk-weighted assets. CET1 is the sum of common shareholders’ equity, adjusted for ineligible goodwill and intangible assets, certain deferred tax assets, as well as certain other comprehensive income items as follows: net unrealized gains/losses on securities, foreign currency translation adjustments and net unrealized pension and other postretirement benefit/losses, all net of tax.Tier 1 Risk-Based Capital Ratio — Calculated as Tier 1 capital divided by risk-weighted assets. Tier 1 capital is the sum of CET1, our perpetual preferred stock and third-party non-controlling interests in consolidated subsidiaries, adjusted for capital held by insurance subsidiaries. The minimum requirement for the Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio is 1.5 percent higher than the minimum for the CET1 risk-based capital ratio. We have $1.6 billion of preferred shares outstanding to help address a portion of the Tier 1 capital requirements in excess of common equity requirements.Total Risk-Based Capital Ratio — Calculated as the sum of Tier 1 capital and Tier 2 capital, divided by risk-weighted assets. Tier 2 capital is the sum of the allowance for loan and receivable losses (limited to 1.25 percent of risk-weighted assets), minority interest that is not included in Tier 1 capital and $480 million of eligible subordinated notes, adjusted for capital held by insurance subsidiaries. The $480 million of eligible subordinated notes reflect a 20 percent, or $120 million, reduction of Tier 2 capital credit for the $600 million subordinated debt issued in December 2014. Tier 1 Leverage Ratio — Calculated by dividing Tier 1 capital by our average total consolidated assets for the most recent quarter.Supplementary Leverage Ratio — Calculated by dividing Tier 1 capital by total leverage exposure under Basel III. Total leverage exposure reflects average total consolidated assets with adjustments for Tier 1 capital deductions, average off-balance sheet derivative exposures, average securities purchased under agreements to resell, and average credit equivalents of conditionally and unconditionally cancellable undrawn commitments.54Table of ContentsIn December 2018, federal banking regulators issued a final rule that provides an optional three-year phase-in period for the adverse regulatory capital effects upon adopting the CECL model pursuant to new accounting guidance for the recognition of credit losses on financial instruments, effective January 1, 2020. We plan to elect to phase-in the regulatory capital impact of adopting CECL, at 25 percent per year through January 1, 2023. The Federal Reserve also released a statement indicating that it plans to maintain the current framework for calculating credit loss allowances on loans in supervisory stress tests through the 2021 stress test cycle. Refer to Note 1 to the “Consolidated Financial Statements” for further information about CECL.SHARE REPURCHASES AND DIVIDENDSWe return capital to common shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. The share repurchases reduce common shares outstanding and more than offset the issuance of new shares as part of employee compensation plans.During the year ended December 31, 2019, we returned $5.9 billion to our shareholders in the form of common stock dividends of $1.4 billion and share repurchases of $4.6 billion. We repurchased 40 million common shares at an average price of $115.50 in 2019. These dividend and share repurchase amounts collectively represent approximately 87 percent of total capital generated during the year.In addition, during the year ended December 31, 2019, we paid $81 million in dividends on non-cumulative perpetual preferred shares outstanding. For additional information on our preferred shares, refer to Note 16 to the “Consolidated Financial Statements.”FUNDING STRATEGYOur principal funding objective is to maintain broad and well-diversified funding sources to allow us to meet our maturing obligations, cost-effectively finance current and future asset growth in our global businesses, as well as to maintain a strong liquidity profile. The diversity of funding sources by type of instrument, by maturity and by investor base, among other factors, provides additional insulation from the impact of disruptions in any one type of instrument, maturity or investor. The mix of our funding in any period will seek to achieve cost efficiency consistent with both maintaining diversified sources and achieving our liquidity objectives. While we seek to diversify our funding sources by maintaining scale and relevance in unsecured debt, asset securitizations and deposits, we currently expect that direct deposits, such as the Personal Savings program, will become a larger proportion of our funding over time. Our funding strategy and activities are integrated into our asset-liability management activities. We have in place a funding policy covering American Express Company and all of our subsidiaries.Our global proprietary card-issuing businesses generate significant assets in both domestic and international Card Member lending and receivable activities. Our financing needs are in large part a consequence of our proprietary card-issuing businesses, and the maintenance of a liquidity position to meet regulatory requirements and support all of our business activities, such as merchant payments. We generally pay merchants for card transactions prior to reimbursement by Card Members and therefore fund the merchant payments during the period Card Member loans and receivables are outstanding. We also have additional financing needs associated with general corporate purposes. Our funding plan to meet these financing needs is in turn driven by, among other factors, our liquidity position, size and mix of business asset growth, choice of funding sources, and our maturing obligations.FUNDING PROGRAMS AND ACTIVITIESWe meet our funding needs through a variety of sources, including direct and third-party distributed deposits and debt instruments, such as senior unsecured debt, asset securitizations, borrowings through secured borrowing facilities and a committed bank credit facility. We had the following consolidated debt and customer deposits outstanding as of December 31:TABLE 17: SUMMARY OF CONSOLIDATED DEBT AND CUSTOMER DEPOSITS(Billions)20192018Short-term borrowings$6.4 $3.1 Long-term debt57.8 58.4 Total debt64.2 61.5 Customer deposits73.3 70.0 Total debt and customer deposits$137.5 $131.5 We may redeem from time to time certain debt securities within 31 days prior to the original contractual maturity dates in accordance with the optional redemption provisions of those debt securities.55Table of ContentsOur funding plan for the full year 2020 includes, among other sources, approximately zero to $3 billion of unsecured term debt issuance and approximately $7 billion to $10 billion of secured term debt issuance. Our annual funding plans can vary due to various risks and uncertainties, such as future business growth, the impact of global economic, political and other events on market capacity, demand for securities offered by us, regulatory changes, ability to securitize and sell receivables, and the performance of receivables previously sold in securitization transactions. Many of these risks and uncertainties are beyond our control.Our equity capital and funding strategies are designed, among other things, to maintain appropriate and stable unsecured debt ratings from the major credit rating agencies: Moody’s Investor Services (Moody’s), Standard & Poor’s (S&P) and Fitch Ratings (Fitch). Such ratings help support our access to cost-effective unsecured funding as part of our overall funding strategy. Our asset securitization activities are rated separately.TABLE 18: UNSECURED DEBT RATINGSCredit AgencyAmerican Express EntityShort-Term RatingsLong-Term RatingsOutlookFitchAll rated entitiesF1AStableMoody’sAmerican Express Travel Related Services Company, Inc.N/AA2StableMoody'sAmerican Express Credit CorporationPrime-1A2StableMoody’sAmerican Express National BankPrime-1A3StableMoody'sAmerican Express CompanyN/AA3StableS&PAmerican Express Travel Related Services Company, Inc.N/AA-StableS&PAmerican Express Credit Corporation and American Express National BankA-2A-StableS&PAmerican Express CompanyA-2BBB+StableDowngrades in the ratings of our unsecured debt or asset securitization program securities could result in higher funding costs, as well as higher fees related to borrowings under our unused lines of credit. Declines in credit ratings could also reduce our borrowing capacity in the unsecured debt and asset securitization capital markets. We believe our funding mix, including the proportion of U.S. retail deposits insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) to total funding, should reduce the impact that credit rating downgrades would have on our funding capacity and costs.SHORT-TERM FUNDING PROGRAMSShort-term borrowings, such as commercial paper, are defined as any debt with an original maturity of twelve months or less, as well as interest-bearing overdrafts with banks. Our short-term funding programs are used primarily to fund working capital needs, such as managing seasonal variations in receivables balances. The amount of short-term borrowings issued in the future will depend on our funding strategy, our needs and market conditions. As of December 31, 2019, we had $3.0 billion in commercial paper outstanding and we had an average of $0.3 billion in commercial paper outstanding during 2019. Refer to Note 8 to the “Consolidated Financial Statements” for a further description of these borrowings.DEPOSIT PROGRAMSWe offer deposits within our U.S. bank subsidiary, AENB. These funds are currently insured up to $250,000 per account holder through the FDIC. Our ability to obtain deposit funding and offer competitive interest rates is dependent on the capital level of AENB. We, through AENB, have a Personal Savings program, which is our primary deposit product channel. The direct retail program makes FDIC-insured certificates of deposit (CDs) and high-yield savings account products available directly to consumers. We also source deposits through third-party distribution channels as needed to meet our overall funding objectives. As of December 31, 2019 we had $73.3 billion in customer deposits. Refer to Note 7 to the “Consolidated Financial Statements” for a further description of these deposits.56Table of ContentsLONG-TERM DEBT AND ASSET SECURITIZATION PROGRAMSAs of December 31, 2019, we had $57.8 billion in long-term debt outstanding. During 2019, we and our subsidiaries issued $11.7 billion of unsecured debt and asset-backed securities with maturities ranging from 2 to 7 years. Refer to Note 8 to the “Consolidated Financial Statements” for a further description of these borrowings.We periodically securitize Card Member loans and receivables arising from our card business, as the securitization market provides us with cost-effective funding. Securitization of Card Member loans and receivables is accomplished through the transfer of those assets to a trust, which in turn issues securities collateralized by the transferred assets to third-party investors. The proceeds from issuance are distributed to us, through our wholly-owned subsidiaries, as consideration for the transferred assets. Refer to Note 5 to the “Consolidated Financial Statements” for a further description of our asset securitizations.On February 1, 2020, we removed U.S. consumer and small business Card Member receivables from the American Express Issuance Trust II (the Charge Trust) and substantially replaced them with U.S. corporate Card Member receivables. Our 2019 long-term debt and asset securitization issuances were as follows:TABLE 19: DEBT ISSUANCES(Billions)2019American Express Company:Fixed Rate Senior Notes (weighted-average coupon of 2.92%)$5.6 Floating Rate Senior Notes (3-month LIBOR plus 62 basis points)0.9 American Express Credit Account Master Trust:Fixed Rate Class A Certificates (weighted-average coupon of 2.55%)4.2 Fixed Rate Class B Certificates (weighted-average coupon of 2.75%)0.2 Floating Rate Class A Certificates (1-month LIBOR plus 24 basis points)0.8 Total$11.7 LIQUIDITY MANAGEMENTOur liquidity objective is to maintain access to a diverse set of on- and off-balance sheet liquidity sources. We seek to maintain liquidity sources in amounts sufficient to meet our expected future financial obligations and business requirements for liquidity for a period of at least twelve months in the event we are unable to raise new funds under our regular funding programs during a substantial weakening in economic conditions.Our liquidity management strategy includes a number of elements, including, but not limited to:•Maintaining diversified funding sources (refer to the “Funding Strategy” section for more details);•Maintaining unencumbered liquid assets and off-balance sheet liquidity sources;•Projecting cash inflows and outflows under a variety of economic and market scenarios;•Establishing clear objectives for liquidity risk management, including compliance with regulatory requirements; and•Incorporating liquidity risk management as appropriate into our capital adequacy framework.We seek to maintain access to a diverse set of on-balance sheet and off-balance sheet liquidity sources, including cash and other liquid assets, committed bank credit facilities and secured borrowing facilities. Through our U.S. bank subsidiary, AENB, we also hold collateral eligible for use at the Federal Reserve’s discount window.The amount and type of liquidity resources we maintain can vary over time, based upon the results of stress scenarios required under the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, as well as additional stress scenarios required under our liquidity risk policy. These stress scenarios possess distinct characteristics, varying by cash flow assumptions, time horizon and qualifying liquidity sources, among other factors. Scenarios under our liquidity risk policy include market-wide, firm-specific and combined liquidity stresses. We consider other factors in determining the amount and type of liquidity we maintain, such as economic and financial market conditions, seasonality in business operations, growth in our businesses, potential acquisitions or dispositions, the cost and availability of alternative liquidity sources and credit rating agency guidelines and requirements. The investment income we receive on liquidity resources is less than the interest expense on the sources of funding for these balances. The level of future net interest costs to maintain these resources can be substantial, as it depends on the amount of liquidity resources we maintain and the difference between our cost of funding these amounts and their investment yields.57Table of ContentsSecuritized Borrowing CapacityAs of December 31, 2019, we maintained our committed, revolving, secured borrowing facility, with a maturity date of July 15, 2022, which gives us the right to sell up to $3.0 billion face amount of eligible AAA notes from the Charge Trust. We also maintained our committed, revolving, secured borrowing facility, with a maturity date of September 15, 2022, which gives us the right to sell up to $2.0 billion face amount of eligible AAA certificates from the American Express Credit Account Master Trust (the Lending Trust). Both facilities are used in the ordinary course of business to fund working capital needs, as well as to further enhance our contingent funding resources. As of December 31, 2019, no amounts were drawn on the Charge Trust facility or the Lending Trust facility. Federal Reserve Discount WindowAs an insured depository institution, AENB may borrow from the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco, subject to the amount of qualifying collateral that it may pledge. The Federal Reserve has indicated that both credit and charge card receivables are a form of qualifying collateral for secured borrowings made through the discount window. Whether specific assets will be considered qualifying collateral and the amount that may be borrowed against the collateral, remain at the discretion of the Federal Reserve.We had approximately $76.6 billion as of December 31, 2019 in U.S. credit card loans and charge card receivables that could be sold over time through our securitization trusts or pledged in return for secured borrowings to provide further liquidity, subject in each case to applicable market conditions and eligibility criteria.Committed Bank Credit FacilityIn addition to the secured borrowing facilities described above, we maintained a committed syndicated bank credit facility as of December 31, 2019 of $3.5 billion, with a maturity date of October 15, 2022. The availability of this credit line is subject to our compliance with certain financial covenants, principally the maintenance by American Express Credit Corporation (Credco) of a certain ratio of combined earnings and fixed charges to fixed charges. As of December 31, 2019 and 2018, we were in compliance with each of our covenants. As of December 31, 2019, no amounts were drawn on the committed credit facility. We may, from time to time, use this facility in the ordinary course of business to fund working capital needs. Any undrawn portion of this facility could serve as backstop for the amount of commercial paper outstanding. Our committed bank credit facility does not contain a material adverse change clause, which might otherwise preclude borrowing under the credit facility, nor is it dependent on our credit rating.CASH FLOWSThe following table summarizes our cash flow activity, followed by a discussion of the major drivers impacting operating, investing and financing cash flows.TABLE 20: CASH FLOWS(Billions)201920182017Total cash provided by (used in):Operating activities$13.6 $8.9 $13.5 Investing activities(16.7) (19.6) (18.2) Financing activities(0.5) 5.1 12.2 Effect of foreign currency exchange rates on cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash0.2 0.1 0.3 Net (decrease) increase in cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash$(3.4) $(5.5) $7.8 Cash Flows from Operating ActivitiesOur cash flows from operating activities primarily include net income adjusted for (i) non-cash items included in net income, such as provisions for losses, depreciation and amortization, deferred taxes and stock-based compensation and (ii) changes in the balances of operating assets and liabilities, which can vary significantly in the normal course of business due to the amount and timing of payments.The increase in net cash provided by operating activities was primarily driven by the amount and timing of payments of accounts payable and other liabilities.58Table of ContentsCash Flows from Investing ActivitiesOur cash flows from investing activities primarily include changes in Card Member receivables and loans, as well as changes in our available-for-sale investment securities portfolio.The decrease in net cash used in investing activities was primarily driven by lower growth in Card Member receivables and loans, partially offset by a larger net increase in the investment securities portfolio.Cash Flows from Financing ActivitiesOur cash flows from financing activities primarily include changes in customer deposits, long-term debt and short-term borrowings, as well as dividend payments and share repurchases.The increase in net cash used in financing activities was primarily driven by a higher level of share repurchases and lower growth in customer deposits.OFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS AND CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONSWe have identified both on- and off-balance sheet transactions, arrangements, obligations and other relationships that may have a material current or future effect on our financial condition, changes in financial condition, results of operations, or liquidity and capital resources.CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONSThe table below identifies transactions that represent our contractually committed future obligations. Purchase obligations include our agreements to purchase goods and services that are enforceable and legally binding and that specify significant terms, including: fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased; fixed, minimum or variable price provisions; and the approximate timing of the transaction.TABLE 21: COMMITTED FUTURE OBLIGATIONS BY YEARPayments due by year(a)(Millions)20202021-20222023-20242025 and thereafterTotalLong-term debt$15,615 $25,898 $12,050 $4,883 $58,446 Certificates of deposit4,632 4,687 625 — 9,944 Interest payments on long-term debt(b)1,426 1,844 743 1,246 5,259 Lease obligations134 214 166 842 1,356 Deemed repatriation tax(c)— — 263 749 1,012 Purchase obligations(d)269 188 33 — 490 Other long-term liabilities(e) (f)217 101 3 20 341 Total22,293 32,932 13,883 7,740 76,848 (a)The table above excludes approximately $0.7 billion of tax reserves related to the uncertainty in income taxes as inherent complexities and the number of tax years currently open for examination in multiple jurisdictions do not permit reasonable estimates of payments, if any, to be made over a range of years. Refer to Note 20 to the “Consolidated Financial Statements” for additional information.(b)Estimated interest payments were calculated using the effective interest rates as of December 31, 2019, and includes the effect of existing interest rate swaps. Actual cash flows may differ from estimated payments.(c)Represents the remaining obligation under the Tax Act to pay a one-time transition tax on unrepatriated earnings and profits of certain foreign subsidiaries. In 2019, the Internal Revenue Service applied our prior year U.S. federal income tax return over-payment against a portion of the remaining obligation.(d)The purchase obligation amounts represent either the early termination fees or non-cancelable minimum contractual obligations, as applicable, by period under contracts that were in effect as of December 31, 2019.(e)As of December 31, 2019, there were no minimum required contributions, and no contributions are currently planned, for the U.S. American Express Retirement Plan. For the U.S. American Express Retirement Restoration Plan and non-U.S. defined benefit pension and postretirement benefit plans, contributions in 2020 are anticipated to be approximately $45 million, and this amount has been included within other long-term liabilities. Remaining obligations under defined benefit pension and postretirement benefit plans aggregating $595 million have not been included in the table above as the timing of such obligations is not determinable. Additionally, other long-term liabilities do not include $8.9 billion of Membership Rewards liabilities, which are not considered long-term liabilities as Card Members in good standing can redeem points immediately, without restrictions, and because the timing of point redemption is not determinable.(f)As of December 31, 2019, we had committed to provide funding related to certain tax credit investments resulting in a $211 million unfunded commitment included in other long-term liabilities. In addition to this amount, there was a further $78 million of contractual off-balance sheet obligations that have not been included in the table above as the timing of such obligations is not determinable. Refer to Note 6 to the “Consolidated Financial Statements” for additional information.59Table of ContentsIn addition to the contractual obligations noted in Table 21, we have financial commitments related to agreements with certain cobrand partners under which we are required to make a certain level of minimum payments over the life of the agreement, generally ranging from five to ten years. Such commitments are designed to be satisfied by the payments we make to such cobrand partners primarily based on Card Members' spending and earning rewards on their cobrand cards and as we acquire new Card Members. In the event these payments do not fully satisfy the commitment, we will pay the cobrand partner up to the amount of the commitment in exchange for an equivalent value of reward points. As of December 31, 2019, we had $5 billion in such commitments outstanding and also had certain cobrand arrangements that include commitments based on variables, the values of which are not yet determinable and thus the amount is not quantifiable. We also have off-balance sheet arrangements that include guarantees, indemnifications and certain other off-balance sheet arrangements.GUARANTEESAs of December 31, 2019, we had guarantees and indemnifications totaling approximately $1 billion related primarily to real estate and business dispositions in the ordinary course of business. Refer to Note 15 to the “Consolidated Financial Statements” for further discussion regarding our guarantees.CERTAIN OTHER OFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTSAs of December 31, 2019, we had approximately $306 billion of unused credit available to Card Members as part of established lending product agreements. Total unused credit available to Card Members does not represent potential future cash requirements, as a significant portion of this unused credit will likely not be drawn. Our charge card products generally have no pre-set spending limit, and therefore are not reflected in unused credit available to Card Members.We provide Card Member protection plans that cover losses associated with purchased products. The maximum potential liability related to these plans is the portion of annual billed business for which timely and valid disputes may be raised under applicable law and relevant customer agreements. However, based on historical experience, we believe that this total amount is not representative of our actual potential loss exposure. The actual amount of the potential exposure cannot be quantified as the billed business volumes which may include or result in claims under these plans are not sufficiently estimable. Losses related to these protection plans were immaterial for the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017.Refer to Notes 6 and 12 to the “Consolidated Financial Statements” for discussion regarding our other off-balance sheet arrangements.RISK MANAGEMENTGOVERNANCEWe use our comprehensive Enterprise-wide Risk Management (ERM) program to identify, aggregate, monitor, and manage risks. The program also defines our risk appetite, governance, culture and capabilities. The implementation and execution of the ERM program is headed by our Chief Risk Officer.Risk management is overseen by our Board of Directors through three Board committees: the Risk Committee, the Audit and Compliance Committee, and the Compensation and Benefits Committee. Each committee consists entirely of independent directors and provides regular reports to the full Board regarding matters reviewed at their committee. The committees meet regularly in private sessions with our Chief Risk Officer, the Chief Compliance & Ethics Officer, the Chief Audit Executive and other senior management with regard to our risk management processes, controls, talent and capabilities. The Board monitors the “tone at the top,” our risk culture, and oversees emerging and strategic risks.The Risk Committee of our Board of Directors provides oversight of our enterprise-wide risk management framework, processes and methodologies. The Risk Committee approves our ERM policy. The ERM policy governs risk governance, risk oversight and risk appetite for risks, including individual credit risk, institutional credit risk, market risk, liquidity risk, operational risk, reputational risk, compliance risk, model risk, asset/liability risk, strategic and business risk, and foreign country risk. Risk appetite defines the authorized risk limits to control exposures within our risk capacity and risk tolerance, including stressed forward-looking scenarios. In addition, it establishes principles for risk taking in the aggregate and for each risk type, and is supported by a comprehensive system for monitoring limits, escalation triggers and assessing control programs.The Risk Committee reviews and concurs in the appointment, replacement, performance and compensation of our Chief Risk Officer and receives regular updates from the Chief Risk Officer on key risks, transactions and exposures.60Table of ContentsThe Risk Committee reviews our risk profile against the tolerances specified in the Risk Appetite Framework, including significant risk exposures, risk trends in our portfolios and major risk concentrations.The Risk Committee also provides oversight of our compliance with Basel capital and liquidity standards, our Internal Capital Adequacy Assessment Process, including its Comprehensive Capital Analysis and Review (CCAR) submissions, and resolution planning.The Audit and Compliance Committee of our Board of Directors reviews and approves compliance policies, which include our Compliance Risk Tolerance Statement. In addition, the Audit and Compliance Committee reviews the effectiveness of our Corporate-wide Compliance Risk Management Program. More broadly, this committee is responsible for assisting the Board in its oversight responsibilities relating to the integrity of our financial statements and financial reporting process, internal and external auditing, including the qualifications and independence of the independent registered public accounting firm and the performance of our internal audit services function, and the integrity of our systems of internal controls.The Audit and Compliance Committee provides oversight of our Internal Audit Group. The Audit and Compliance Committee reviews and concurs in the appointment, replacement, performance and compensation of our Chief Audit Executive and approves Internal Audit’s annual audit plan, charter, policies and budget. The Audit and Compliance Committee also receives regular updates on the audit plan’s status and results including significant reports issued by Internal Audit and the status of our corrective actions.The Compensation and Benefits Committee of our Board of Directors works with the Chief Risk Officer to ensure our overall compensation programs, as well as those covering our risk-taking employees, appropriately balance risk with business incentives and how business performance is achieved without taking imprudent or excessive risk. Our Chief Risk Officer is actively involved in setting goals. Our Chief Risk Officer also reviews the current and forward-looking risk profiles of each business unit and provides input into performance evaluation. The Chief Risk Officer meets with the Compensation and Benefits Committee and attests whether performance goals and results have been achieved without taking imprudent risks. The Compensation and Benefits Committee uses a risk-balanced incentive compensation framework to decide on our bonus pools and the compensation of senior executives.There are several internal management committees, including the Enterprise-wide Risk Management Committee (ERMC), chaired by our Chief Risk Officer. The ERMC is the highest-level management committee to oversee all firm-wide risks and is responsible for risk governance, risk oversight and risk appetite. It maintains the enterprise-wide risk appetite framework and monitors compliance with limits and escalations defined in it. The ERMC oversees implementation of risk policies company-wide. The ERMC reviews key risk exposures, trends and concentrations, significant compliance matters, and provides guidance on the steps to monitor, control and report major risks.As defined in the ERM policy, we follow the “three lines of defense” approach to risk management. The first line of defense comprises functions and management committees directly initiating risk taking. Business unit presidents, our Chief Credit Officer, Chief Market Risk Officer and Functional Risk Officer are part of the first line of defense. The second line comprises independent functions overseeing risk-taking activities of the first line. The Chief Risk Officer, the Chief Compliance & Ethics Officer, the Chief Operational Risk Officer and certain control groups, both at the enterprise level and within regulated entities, are part of the second line of defense. The global risk oversight team oversees the policies, strategies, frameworks, models, processes and capabilities deployed by the first line teams and provides challenges and independent assessments on how the first line of defense is managing risks. In addition, the Asset Liability Committee, chaired by our Chief Financial Officer, is responsible for managing market, liquidity and asset/liability risk, capital and resolution planning.Our Internal Audit Group constitutes the third line of defense, and provides independent assessments and effective challenge of the first and second lines of defense.CREDIT RISK MANAGEMENT PROCESSCredit risk is defined as loss due to obligor or counterparty default or changes in the credit quality of a counterparty or security. Our credit risks are divided into two broad categories: individual and institutional. Each has distinct risk management capabilities, strategies, and tools. Business units that create individual or institutional credit risk exposures of significant importance are supported by dedicated risk management teams, each led by a Chief Credit Officer.INDIVIDUAL CREDIT RISKIndividual credit risk arises from consumer and small business charge cards, credit cards, and term loans. These portfolios consist of millions of customers across multiple geographies, industries and levels of net worth. We benefit from the high-61Table of Contentsquality profile of our customers, which is driven by our brand, premium customer servicing, product features and risk management capabilities, which span underwriting, customer management and collections. The risk in these portfolios is generally correlated to broad economic trends, such as unemployment rates and gross domestic product (GDP) growth.The business unit leaders and their Chief Credit Officers take the lead in managing the credit risk process. These Chief Credit Officers are guided by the Individual Credit Risk Committee (ICRC), which is responsible for implementation and enforcement of the Individual Credit Risk Management Policy. The ICRC ensures compliance with ERMC guidelines and procedures and escalates to the ERMC as appropriate. The Individual Credit Risk Management Policy is further supported by subordinate policies and operating manuals covering decision logic and processes of credit extension, including prospecting, new account approvals, point-of-sale authorizations, credit line management and collections. The subordinate risk policies and operating manuals are designed to ensure consistent application of risk management principles and standardized reporting of asset quality and loss recognition.Credit risk management is supported by sophisticated proprietary scoring and decision-making models that use up-to-date information on prospects and customers, such as spending and payment history and data feeds from credit bureaus. We have developed data-driven economic decision logic for customer interactions to better serve our customers.INSTITUTIONAL CREDIT RISKInstitutional credit risk arises principally within our GCS, GMS and GNS businesses, as well as investment and liquidity management activities. Unlike individual credit risk, institutional credit risk is characterized by a lower loss frequency but higher severity. It is affected both by general economic conditions and by client-specific events. The absence of large losses in any given year or over several years is not necessarily representative of the level of risk of institutional portfolios, given the infrequency of loss events in such portfolios.Similar to individual credit risk, business units taking institutional credit risks are supported by Chief Credit Officers. These officers are guided by the Institutional Risk Management Committee (IRMC), which is responsible for implementation and enforcement of the Institutional Credit Risk Management Policy and for providing guidance to the credit officers of each business unit with substantial institutional credit risk exposures. The committee, along with the business unit Chief Credit Officers, makes investment decisions in core risk capabilities, ensures proper implementation of the underwriting standards and contractual rights for risk mitigation, monitors risk exposures, and determines risk mitigation actions. The IRMC formally reviews large institutional risk exposures to ensure compliance with ERMC guidelines and procedures and escalates them to the ERMC as appropriate. At the same time, the IRMC provides guidance to the business unit risk management teams to optimize risk-adjusted returns on capital. A centralized risk rating unit provides risk assessment of our institutional obligors.Exposure to the Airline and Travel IndustryWe have multiple important cobrand, rewards, merchant acceptance and corporate payments arrangements with airlines. The ERM program evaluates the risks posed by our airline partners and the overall airline strategy companywide through comprehensive business analysis of global airlines, and the travel industry more broadly, including cruise lines, travel agencies and tour operators. Our largest airline partner is Delta, and this relationship includes an exclusive cobrand credit card partnership and other arrangements including Membership Rewards redemption, merchant acceptance, travel and corporate payments. See ""We face intense competition for partner relationships, which could result in a loss or renegotiation of these arrangements that could have a material adverse impact on our business and results of operations"" and ""Arrangements with our business partners represent a significant portion of our business. We are exposed to risks associated with our business partners, including reputational issues, business slowdowns, bankruptcies, liquidations, restructurings and consolidations, and the possible obligation to make payments to our partners"" under “Risk Factors” for additional information.Debt ExposureAs part of our ongoing risk management process, we monitor our financial exposure to both sovereign and non-sovereign customers and counterparties, and measure and manage concentrations of risk by geographic regions, as well as by economic sectors and industries. A primary focus area for monitoring is credit deterioration due to weaknesses in economic and fiscal profiles. We evaluate countries based on the market assessment of the riskiness of their sovereign debt and our assessment of the economic and financial outlook and closely monitor those deemed high risk. As of December 31, 2019, we considered our gross credit exposures to government entities, financial institutions and corporations in those countries deemed high risk to be individually and collectively not material.62Table of ContentsOPERATIONAL RISK MANAGEMENT PROCESSWe define operational risk as the risk of not achieving business objectives due to inadequate or failed processes, people, or information systems, or the external environment, including failures to comply with laws and regulations as well as impacts from relationships with third parties. Operational risk is inherent in all business activities and can impact an organization through direct or indirect financial loss, brand damage, customer dissatisfaction, or legal and regulatory penalties.To appropriately measure and manage operational risk, we have implemented a comprehensive operational risk framework that is defined in the Operational Risk Management Policy approved by the Risk Committee. The Operational Risk Management Committee (ORMC), chaired by the Chief Operational Risk Officer, coordinates with all control groups on effective risk assessments and controls and oversees the preventive, responsive and mitigation efforts by Operational Excellence teams in the business units and staff groups.We use the operational risk framework to identify, measure, monitor and report inherent and emerging operational risks. This framework, supervised by the ORMC, consists of (a) operational risk event capture, (b) a project office to coordinate issue management and control enhancements, (c) key risk indicators, and (d) process and entity-level risk assessments.The framework requires the assessment of operational risk events to determine root causes, impact to customers and/or us, and resolution plan accountability to correct any defect, remediate customers, and enhance controls and testing to mitigate future issues. The impact is assessed from an operational, financial, brand, regulatory compliance and legal perspective.INFORMATION AND CYBER SECURITYWe have implemented an Information Security Program and Operating Model that is designed to protect the confidentiality, integrity and availability of information and information systems from unauthorized access, use, disclosure, disruption, modification or destruction.Our Information Security Program and Operating Model are based on the National Institute of Standards and Technology Cybersecurity Common Standards Framework, which consist of controls designed to identify, protect, detect, respond and recover from information and cyber security incidents. The framework defines risks and associated controls which are embedded in our processes and technology. Those controls are measured and monitored by a combination of subject matter experts and a security operations center with our integrated cyber detection, response and recovery capabilities.Chaired by the Chief Information Security Officer, our Information Security Risk Management Committee, a sub-committee of the ORMC, provides governance for our information security risk management program. The Information Security and Technology Oversight team provides independent challenge and assessment of the information, cyber security and technology risk management programs.See “A major information or cyber security incident or an increase in fraudulent activity could lead to reputational damage to our brand and material legal, regulatory and financial exposure, and could reduce the use and acceptance of our charge and credit cards” under “Risk Factors” for additional information.PRIVACY AND DATA GOVERNANCEOur Privacy Framework and Operating Model follow a similar structure. Chaired by the Chief Privacy Officer, our Privacy Risk Management Committee, a sub-committee of the ORMC, provides oversight and governance for our privacy program. The committee is responsible for the governance over the collection, notice, use, sharing, transfer, confidentiality and retention of personal data.Our Enterprise Data Governance Framework and Policy defines governance requirements for data used in critical processes.COMPLIANCE RISK MANAGEMENT PROCESSWe define compliance risk as the risk of legal or reputational harm, fines, monetary penalties and payment of damages or other forms of sanction as a result of non-compliance with applicable laws, regulations, rules or standards of conduct.We view our ability to effectively mitigate compliance risk as an important aspect of our business model. Our Global Compliance and Ethics organization is responsible for establishing and maintaining our corporate-wide Compliance Risk Management Program. Pursuant to this program, we seek to manage and mitigate compliance risk by assessing, controlling, monitoring, measuring and reporting the legal and regulatory risks to which we are exposed. The Compliance Risk Management Committee (CRMC), chaired by the Chief Compliance and Ethics Officer, is responsible for identifying, evaluating, managing, and escalating compliance risks. The CRMC has a dual reporting relationship directly to both the ERMC and the Audit and Compliance Committee.63Table of ContentsWe have a comprehensive Anti-Money Laundering program that monitors and reports suspicious activity to the appropriate government authorities. As part of that program, the Global Risk Oversight team provides independent risk assessment of the rules used by the Anti-Money Laundering team. In addition, the Internal Audit Group reviews the processes for practices consistent with regulatory guidance.REPUTATIONAL RISK MANAGEMENT PROCESSWe define reputational risk as the risk that negative stakeholder reaction to our products, services, client and partner relationships, business activities and policies, management and workplace culture, or our response to unexpected events, could cause sustained, critical media coverage, a decline in revenue or investment, talent attrition, litigation, or government or regulatory scrutiny.We view protecting our reputation for excellent customer service, trust, security and high integrity as core to our vision of providing the world’s best customer experience and fundamental to our long-term success.Our business leaders are responsible for considering the reputational risk implications of business activities and strategies and ensuring the relevant subject matter experts are engaged as needed. The ERMC is responsible for ensuring reputational risk considerations are included in the scope of appropriate subordinate risk policies and committees and properly reflected in all decisions escalated to the ERMC.MARKET RISK MANAGEMENT PROCESSMarket risk is the risk to earnings or asset and liability values resulting from movements in market prices. Our market risk exposures include interest rate risk and foreign exchange risk. Interest rate risk is driven by the relationship between interest rates on assets (such as loans, receivables and investment securities) and interest rates on liabilities (such as debt and deposits). Foreign exchange risk arises from transactions, funding, investments and earnings in currencies other than the U.S. dollar.Our Asset-Liability Management (ALM) and Market Risk policies establish the framework that guides and governs market risk management, including quantitative limits and escalation triggers. These policies are approved by the Asset Liability Committee or Market Risk Management Committee.Market risk is managed by the Market Risk Management Committee. The Market Risk Oversight Officer provides an independent risk assessment and oversight over the policies and exposure management for market risk and ALM activities, as well as overseeing compliance with the Volcker Rule and other regulatory requirements. Market risk management is also guided and governed by policies covering the use of derivative financial instruments, funding, liquidity and investments.Interest Rate RiskWe analyze a variety of interest rate scenarios to inform us of the potential impacts from interest rate changes on earnings and the value of assets, liabilities and the economic value of equity. Our interest rate exposure can vary over time as a result of, among other things, the proportion of our total funding provided by variable-and fixed-rate debt and deposits compared to our Card Member loans and receivables. Interest rate swaps are used from time to time to effectively convert debt issuances to (or from) variable-rate, from (or to) fixed-rate. We do not engage in derivative financial instruments for trading purposes other than with respect to our Foreign Exchange International Payments business activities. Refer to Note 13 to the “Consolidated Financial Statements” for further discussion of our derivative financial instruments.As of December 31, 2019, a hypothetical, immediate 100 basis point increase in market interest rates would have a detrimental effect on our annual net interest income of approximately $141 million. This measure first projects net interest income over the following twelve-month time horizon considering forecasted business growth and anticipated future market interest rates. The detrimental impact from a rate increase is then measured by instantaneously increasing the anticipated future interest rates by 100 basis points. It is further assumed that our interest-rate sensitive assets and the majority of our liabilities that reprice within the twelve-month horizon generally reprice by 100 basis points. Our estimated repricing risk assumes that certain deposit liabilities reprice at a lower magnitude than benchmark rate movements consistent with historical deposit repricing experience in the industry and within our own portfolio. Actual changes in our net interest income will depend on many factors, and therefore may differ from our estimated risk to changes in market interest rates.In addition to parallel rate changes, our net interest income is subject to changes in the relationship between market benchmark rates. For example, movements in Prime rate change the yield on a large portion of our variable-rate U.S. lending receivables and loans, while LIBOR rates determine the effective interest rate on a significant portion of our outstanding funding. Differences in the rate of change of these two benchmark indices, commonly referred to as basis risk, would thus impact our net interest income. The detrimental effect on our net interest income of a hypothetical 10 basis point decrease in the spread 64Table of Contentsbetween Prime and LIBOR over the next twelve months is estimated to be $20 million. We currently have approximately $48 billion of Prime-based, variable-rate U.S. lending receivables and loans and $20 billion of LIBOR-indexed debt, including asset securitizations. LIBOR TransitionDue to uncertainty surrounding the suitability and sustainability of LIBOR, central banks and global regulators have called for financial market participants to prepare for the discontinuance of LIBOR by the end of 2021 and the establishment of alternative reference rates.We have financial instruments and commercial agreements that will be impacted by the discontinuance of LIBOR, including floating rate debt and equity instruments, derivatives, borrowings and other contracts. We have established an enterprise-wide, cross-functional initiative to identify, assess and monitor risks associated with LIBOR, engage with the industry participants and regulators and to transition to new alternative reference rates. As part of this initiative, we are reviewing and updating our operational processes, IT systems and models for a timely transition.See “Uncertainty relating to LIBOR and other reference rates and their potential discontinuance may negatively impact our access to funding and the value of our financial instruments and commercial agreements” under “Risk Factors” for additional information.Foreign Exchange RiskForeign exchange exposures arise in four principal ways: 1) Card Member spending in currencies that are not the billing currency, 2) cross-currency transactions and balances from our funding activities, 3) cross-currency investing activities, such as in the equity of foreign subsidiaries, and 4) revenues generated and expenses incurred in foreign currencies, which impact earnings.These foreign exchange risks are managed primarily by entering into foreign exchange spot transactions or hedged with foreign exchange forward contracts when the hedge costs are economically justified and in notional amounts designed to offset pretax impacts from currency movements in the period in which they occur. As of December 31, 2019, foreign currency derivative instruments with total notional amounts of approximately $36 billion were outstanding.With respect to Card Member spending and cross-currency transactions, including related foreign exchange forward contracts outstanding, a hypothetical 10 percent strengthening of the U.S. dollar would result in an immaterial impact to projected earnings as of December 31, 2019. With respect to translation exposure of foreign subsidiary equity balances, including related foreign exchange forward contracts outstanding, a hypothetical 10 percent strengthening of the U.S. dollar would result in an immaterial reduction in other comprehensive income and equity as of December 31, 2019. With respect to earnings denominated in foreign currencies, the adverse impact on pretax income of a hypothetical 10 percent strengthening of the U.S. dollar related to anticipated overseas operating results for the next twelve months would be approximately $146 million as of December 31, 2019. To a much lesser extent, we are also subject to market risk arising from activities conducted by our Foreign Exchange International Payments business. We aim to minimize market risk from these activities through hedging, where appropriate, and the establishment of limits to define and protect the company from excessive exposure.The actual impact of interest rate and foreign exchange rate changes will depend on, among other factors, the timing of rate changes, the extent to which different rates do not move in the same direction or in the same direction to the same degree, changes in the cost, volume and mix of our hedging activities and changes in the volume and mix of our businesses.FUNDING & LIQUIDITY RISK MANAGEMENT PROCESSLiquidity risk is defined as our inability to meet our ongoing financial and business obligations as they become due at a reasonable cost.Our Board-approved Liquidity Risk Policy establishes the framework that guides and governs liquidity risk management.Liquidity risk is managed by the Funding and Liquidity Committee. In addition, the Market Risk Oversight Officer provides independent oversight of liquidity risk management. We manage liquidity risk by maintaining access to a diverse set of cash, readily-marketable securities and contingent sources of liquidity, such that we can continuously meet our business requirements and expected future financing obligations for at least a twelve-month period in the event we are unable to raise new funds under our regular funding programs during a substantial weakening in economic conditions. We consider the trade-offs between maintaining too much liquidity, which can be costly and limit financial flexibility, and having inadequate liquidity, which may result in financial distress during a liquidity event.65Table of ContentsLiquidity risk is managed at an aggregate consolidated level as well as at certain subsidiaries in order to ensure that sufficient and accessible liquidity resources are maintained. The Funding and Liquidity Committee reviews forecasts of our aggregate and subsidiary cash positions and financing requirements, approves funding plans designed to satisfy those requirements under normal and stressed conditions, establishes guidelines to identify the amount of liquidity resources required and monitors positions and determines any actions to be taken.MODEL RISK MANAGEMENT PROCESSWe define model risk as the risk of adverse consequences, such as financial loss, poor business and strategic decision making, or damage to our reputation, from decisions based on incorrect or misused model outputs and reports.We manage model risk through a comprehensive model governance framework, including policies and procedures for model development, independent model validation and change management capabilities that seek to minimize erroneous model methodology, outputs and misuse. We also assess model performance on an ongoing basis.STRATEGIC AND BUSINESS RISK MANAGEMENT PROCESSStrategic and business risk is the risk related to our inability to achieve our business objectives due to poor strategic decisions, including decisions related to mergers, acquisitions, and divestitures, poor implementation of strategic decisions or declining demand for our products and services.Strategic decisions are reviewed and approved by business leaders and various committees and must be aligned with company policies. We seek to manage strategic and business risks through risk controls embedded in these processes as well as overall risk management oversight over business goals. Existing product performance is reviewed periodically by committees and business leaders. Mergers, acquisitions and divestitures can only be approved following Deal Committee due diligence, a comprehensive risk assessment by operational, market, credit and oversight leaders provided to the Chief Risk Officer and approval by either the Chief Risk Officer or appropriate risk committees. All new products and material changes in business processes are reviewed and approved by the New Products Committee and appropriate credit or risk committees.FOREIGN COUNTRY RISK MANAGEMENT PROCESSForeign country risk is defined as the risk that economic, social, and/or political conditions and events in a foreign country will adversely impact us, primarily as a result of greater credit losses, increased operational risk or the inability to repatriate capital. We manage foreign country risk as part of the normal course of business. Policies and procedures establish foreign country risk escalation thresholds to control and limit exposure, driven by processes that enable the monitoring of foreign country conditions in which we have exposure.CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATESRefer to Note 1 to the “Consolidated Financial Statements” for a summary of our significant accounting policies. Certain of our accounting policies requiring significant management assumptions and judgments are as follows:RESERVES FOR CARD MEMBER LOSSESReserves for Card Member losses represent our best estimate of the probable losses inherent in our outstanding portfolio of Card Member loans and receivables, as of the balance sheet date.In estimating these losses, we use statistical and analytical models that analyze portfolio performance and reflect our judgment regarding the quantitative components of the reserve. The models take into account several factors, including delinquency-based loss migration rates, loss emergence periods and average losses and recoveries over an appropriate historical period. We also consider whether to adjust the quantitative reserve for certain external and internal qualitative factors that may increase or decrease the reserves for losses on Card Member loans and receivables. Refer to Note 3 to the ""Consolidated Financial Statements"" for additional information.The process of estimating these reserves requires a high degree of judgment. To the extent historical credit experience, updated for any external and internal qualitative factors such as environmental trends, is not indicative of future performance, actual losses could differ significantly from our judgments and expectations, resulting in either higher or lower future provisions for Card Member losses in any quarter.66Table of ContentsAs of December 31, 2019, a 10 percent increase in our estimate of losses inherent in the outstanding portfolio of Card Member loans and receivables, evaluated collectively for impairment, would increase reserves for losses with a corresponding change to provisions for losses by approximately $300 million. This sensitivity analysis is provided as a hypothetical scenario to assess the sensitivity of the provisions for losses. It does not represent our expectations for losses in the future, nor does it include how other portfolio factors such as delinquency-based loss migration rates or recoveries, or the amount of outstanding balances, may impact the level of reserves for losses and the corresponding impact on the provisions for losses.Refer to Note 1 to the ""Consolidated Financial Statements"" for information about the implementation and impact of new accounting guidance for the recognition of credit losses on financial instruments, effective January 1, 2020, and the new credit reserving methodology known as the CECL methodology.LIABILITY FOR MEMBERSHIP REWARDSThe Membership Rewards program is our largest card-based rewards program. Card Members can earn points for purchases charged on their enrolled card products. A significant portion of our cards, by their terms, allow Card Members to earn bonus points for purchases at merchants in particular industry categories. Membership Rewards points are redeemable for a broad variety of rewards, including travel, shopping, gift cards, and covering eligible charges. Points typically do not expire, and there is no limit on the number of points a Card Member may earn. Membership Rewards expense is driven by charge volume on enrolled cards, customer participation in the program and contractual arrangements with redemption partners.We record a Membership Rewards liability that represents the estimated cost of points earned that are expected to be redeemed by Card Members in the future. The Membership Rewards liability is impacted over time by enrollment levels, attrition, the volume of points earned and redeemed, and the associated redemption costs. We estimate the Membership Rewards liability by determining the Ultimate Redemption Rate (URR) and the weighted average cost (WAC) per point, which are applied to the points of current enrollees. Refer to Note 9 to the “Consolidated Financial Statements” for additional information.The URR assumption is used to estimate the number of points earned by current enrollees that will ultimately be redeemed in future periods. We use statistical and actuarial models to estimate the URR of points earned to date by current Card Members based on redemption trends, card product type, enrollment tenure, card spend levels and credit attributes. The WAC per point assumption is used to estimate future redemption costs and is primarily based on redemption choices made by Card Members, reward offerings by partners, and Membership Rewards program changes. The WAC per point is derived from the previous 12 months of redemptions and is adjusted as appropriate for certain changes in redemption costs that are not representative of future cost expectations.We periodically evaluate our liability estimation process and assumptions based on developments in redemption patterns, cost per point redeemed, partner contract changes and other factors.The process of estimating the Membership Rewards liability includes a high degree of judgment. Actual redemptions and associated redemption costs could differ significantly from our estimates, resulting in either higher or lower Membership Rewards expense.Changes in the Membership Rewards URR and WAC per point have the effect of either increasing or decreasing the liability through the current period Membership Rewards expense by an amount estimated to cover the cost of all points previously earned but not yet redeemed by current enrollees as of the end of the reporting period. As of December 31, 2019, an increase in the estimated URR of current enrollees of 25 basis points would increase the Membership Rewards liability and corresponding rewards expense by approximately $123 million. Similarly, an increase in the WAC per point of 1 basis point would increase the Membership Rewards liability and corresponding rewards expense by approximately $114 million.GOODWILL RECOVERABILITYGoodwill represents the excess of acquisition cost of an acquired business over the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed. Goodwill is not amortized but is tested for impairment at the reporting unit level annually or when events or circumstances arise, such as adverse changes in the business climate, that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of the reporting unit below its carrying value. Our methodology for conducting this goodwill impairment testing contains both a qualitative and quantitative assessment.We have the option to initially perform an assessment of qualitative factors in order to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount. The qualitative factors may include, but are not limited to, economic conditions, industry and market considerations, cost factors, overall financial performance of the reporting unit and other company and reporting unit-specific events. If we determine that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a 67Table of Contentsreporting unit is less than its carrying amount, we then perform the impairment evaluation using a more detailed quantitative assessment. We could also directly perform this quantitative assessment for any reporting unit, bypassing the qualitative assessment.Our methodology for conducting the quantitative goodwill impairment testing is fundamentally based on the measurement of fair value for our reporting units, which inherently entails the use of significant management judgment. For valuation, we use a combination of the income approach (discounted cash flows) and market approach (market multiples) in estimating the fair value of our reporting units.When preparing discounted cash flow models under the income approach, we estimate future cash flows using the reporting unit’s internal multi-year forecast, and a terminal value calculated using a growth rate that we believe is appropriate in light of current and expected future economic conditions. To discount these cash flows we use our expected cost of equity, determined using a capital asset pricing model. When using the market method under the market approach, we apply comparable publicly traded companies’ multiples (e.g., earnings, revenues) to our reporting units’ actual results. The judgment in estimating forecasted cash flows, discount rates and market comparables is significant, and imprecision could materially affect the fair value of our reporting units.We could be exposed to an increased risk of further goodwill impairment if future operating results or macroeconomic conditions differ significantly from management’s current assumptions.INCOME TAXESWe are subject to the income tax laws of the United States, its states and municipalities and those of the foreign jurisdictions in which we operate. These tax laws are complex, and the manner in which they apply to the taxpayer’s facts is sometimes open to interpretation. In establishing a provision for income tax expense, we must make judgments about the application of inherently complex tax laws.In particular, the Tax Act is complex and requires interpretation of certain provisions to estimate the impact on our income tax expense. The estimates are based on our current interpretations of the Tax Act, and may change due to additional guidance or context from the Internal Revenue Service, the U.S. Treasury Department or others. Unrecognized Tax BenefitsWe establish a liability for unrecognized tax benefits, which are the differences between a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return and the benefit recognized in the financial statements.In establishing a liability for an unrecognized tax benefit, assumptions may be made in determining whether, and the extent to which, a tax position should be sustained. A tax position is recognized only when it is more likely than not to be sustained upon examination by the relevant taxing authority, based on its technical merits. The amount of tax benefit recognized is the largest benefit that we believe is more likely than not to be realized on ultimate settlement. As new information becomes available, we evaluate our tax positions and adjust our unrecognized tax benefits, as appropriate.Tax benefits ultimately realized can differ from amounts previously recognized due to uncertainties, with any such differences generally impacting the provision for income tax.Deferred Tax Asset RealizationDeferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the differences between the financial statement and tax bases of assets and liabilities using the enacted tax rates expected to be in effect for the years in which the differences are expected to reverse.Since deferred taxes measure the future tax effects of items recognized in the Consolidated Financial Statements, certain estimates and assumptions are required to determine whether it is more likely than not that all or some portion of the benefit of a deferred tax asset will not be realized. In making this assessment, we analyze and estimate the impact of future taxable income, reversing temporary differences and available tax planning strategies. These assessments are performed quarterly, taking into account any new information.Changes in facts or circumstances can lead to changes in the ultimate realization of deferred tax assets due to uncertainties.68Table of ContentsOTHER MATTERSRECENTLY ISSUED ACCOUNTING STANDARDSRefer to the Recently Issued Accounting Standards section of Note 1 to the “Consolidated Financial Statements.”GLOSSARY OF SELECTED TERMINOLOGYAdjusted net interest income — A non-GAAP measure that represents net interest income attributable to our Card Member loans (which includes, on a GAAP basis, interest that is deemed uncollectible), excluding the impact of interest expense and interest income not attributable to our Card Member loans. Asset securitizations — Asset securitization involves the transfer and sale of loans or receivables to a special-purpose entity created for the securitization activity, typically a trust. The trust, in turn, issues securities, commonly referred to as asset-backed securities that are secured by the transferred loans and receivables. The trust uses the proceeds from the sale of such securities to pay the purchase price for the transferred loans or receivables. The securitized loans and receivables of our Lending Trust and Charge Trust (collectively, the Trusts) are reported as assets and the securities issued by the Trusts are reported as liabilities on our Consolidated Balance Sheets.Average discount rate — This calculation is generally designed to reflect the average pricing at all merchants accepting American Express cards and represents the percentage of proprietary and GNS billed business retained by us from merchants we acquire, or from merchants acquired by third parties on our behalf, net of amounts retained by such third parties. The average discount rate, together with billed business, drive our discount revenue.Billed business — Represents transaction volumes (including cash advances) on cards and other payment products issued by American Express (proprietary billed business) and cards issued under network partnership agreements with banks and other institutions, including joint ventures (GNS billed business). In-store spending activity within GNS retail cobrand portfolios, from which we earn no revenue, is not included in billed business. Billed business is reported as inside the United States or outside the United States based on the location of the issuer. Billed business, together with the average discount rate, drive our discount revenue.Capital ratios — Represents the minimum standards established by regulatory agencies as a measure to determine whether the regulated entity has sufficient capital to absorb on- and off-balance sheet losses beyond current loss accrual estimates. Refer to the Capital Strategy section under “Consolidated Capital Resources and Liquidity” for further related definitions under Basel III.Cards-in-force — Represents the number of cards that are issued and outstanding by American Express (proprietary cards-in-force) and cards issued and outstanding under network partnership agreements with banks and other institutions, including joint ventures (GNS cards-in-force), except for GNS retail cobrand cards that had no out-of-store spending activity during the prior twelve months. Basic cards-in-force excludes supplemental cards issued on consumer accounts. Cards-in-force is useful in understanding the size of our Card Member base.Card Member — The individual holder of an issued American Express-branded card.Card Member loans — Represents the outstanding amount due from Card Members for charges made on their American Express credit cards, as well as any interest charges and card-related fees. Card Member loans also include revolving balances on certain American Express charge card products.Card Member receivables — Represents the outstanding amount due from Card Members for charges made on their American Express charge cards, as well as any card-related fees, other than revolving balances on certain American Express charge cards with Pay Over Time features. Such revolving balances are included within Card Member loans.Charge cards — Represents cards that generally carry no pre-set spending limits and are primarily designed as a method of payment and not as a means of financing purchases. Charge Card Members generally must pay the full amount billed each month. No finance charges are assessed on charge cards. Each charge card transaction is authorized based on its likely economics reflecting a Card Member’s most recent credit information and spend patterns. Some charge cards have additional Pay Over Time feature(s) that allow revolving of certain charges.Cobrand cards — Cards issued under cobrand agreements with selected commercial partners. Pursuant to the cobrand agreements, we make payments to our cobrand partners, which can be significant, based primarily on the amount of Card Member spending and corresponding rewards earned on such spending and, under certain arrangements, on the number of accounts acquired and retained. The partner is then liable for providing rewards to the Card Member under the cobrand partner’s own loyalty program.69Table of ContentsCredit cards — Represents cards that have a range of revolving payment terms, grace periods, and rate and fee structures.Discount revenue — Primarily represents revenue earned from fees charged to merchants who have entered into a card acceptance agreement. The discount fee is generally deducted from our payment for Card Member purchases.Interest expense — Includes interest incurred primarily to fund Card Member loans and receivables, general corporate purposes and liquidity needs. Interest expense is divided principally into two categories: (i) deposits, which primarily relates to interest expense on deposits taken from customers and institutions, and (ii) debt, which primarily relates to interest expense on our long-term financing and short-term borrowings, (e.g., commercial paper, federal funds purchased, bank overdrafts and other short-term borrowings), as well as the realized impact of derivatives hedging interest rate risk on our long-term debt.Interest income — Includes (i) interest on loans, (ii) interest and dividends on investment securities and (iii) interest income on deposits with banks and other.Interest on loans — Assessed using the average daily balance method for Card Member loans. Unless the loan is classified as non-accrual, interest is recognized based upon the principal amount outstanding in accordance with the terms of the applicable account agreement until the outstanding balance is paid or written off.Interest and dividends on investment securities — Primarily relates to our performing fixed-income securities. Interest income is recognized using the effective interest method, which adjusts the yield for security premiums and discounts, fees and other payments, so a constant rate of return is recognized on the outstanding balance of the related investment security throughout its term. Amounts are recognized until securities are in default or when it is likely that future interest payments will not be made as scheduled.Interest income on deposits with banks and other — Primarily relates to the placement of cash in excess of near-term funding requirements in interest-bearing time deposits, overnight sweep accounts, and other interest-bearing demand and call accounts.Loyalty Coalitions — Programs that enable consumers to earn rewards points and use them to save on purchases from a variety of participating merchants through multi-category rewards platforms. Merchants in these programs generally fund the consumer offers and are responsible to us for the cost of rewards points; we earn revenue from operating the loyalty platform and by providing marketing support.Net card fees — Represents the card membership fees earned during the period recognized as revenue over the covered card membership period (typically one year), net of the provision for projected refunds for Card Membership cancellation and deferred acquisition costs.Net interest yield on average Card Member loans — A non-GAAP measure that is computed by dividing adjusted net interest income by average Card Member loans, computed on an annualized basis. Reserves and net write-offs related to uncollectible interest are recorded through provision for losses, and are thus not included in the net interest yield calculation.Net loss ratio — Represents the ratio of GCP charge card write-offs, consisting of principal (resulting from authorized transactions) and fee components, less recoveries, on Card Member receivables expressed as a percentage of gross amounts billed to corporate Card Members.Net write-off rate — principal only — Represents the amount of proprietary consumer or small business Card Member loans or receivables written off, consisting of principal (resulting from authorized transactions), less recoveries, as a percentage of the average loan or receivable balance during the period.Net write-off rate — principal, interest and fees — Includes, in the calculation of the net write-off rate, amounts for interest and fees in addition to principal for Card Member loans, and fees in addition to principal for Card Member receivables.Operating expenses — Represents salaries and employee benefits, professional services, occupancy and equipment, and other expenses.Return on average equity — Calculated by dividing one-year period net income by one-year average total shareholders’ equity.70Table of ContentsCAUTIONARY NOTE REGARDING FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTSThis report includes forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, which are subject to risks and uncertainties.

""Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations"" in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2019, filed with the SEC on February 13, 2020.As a result of the adoption of CECL on January 1, 2020, there is a lack of comparability in both the reserves and provisions for credit losses for the periods presented. Results for reporting periods beginning after January 1, 2020 are presented using the CECL methodology, while comparative information continues to be reported in accordance with the incurred loss methodology in effect for prior periods.

U.S. billed business decreased 16 percent and non-U.S. billed business decreased 23 percent due to the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic during 2020.Additional billed business highlights for the full year 2020 as compared to full year 2019:•Worldwide non-T&E billed business decreased 1 percent and T&E billed business decreased 61 percent.•Proprietary consumer billed business decreased by 17 percent, primarily driven by declines in T&E, and offline non-T&E spend, which were partially offset by increased online and card-not-present spend at non-T&E merchants. •Proprietary commercial billed business decreased by 21 percent, primarily driven by year-over-year decreases in T&E spend by large and global corporate card customers, with less pronounced billed business declines from small and mid-sized enterprises, where T&E volumes made up a lower proportion of spend. See Tables 5 and 6 for more details on billed business performance. The decrease in discount revenue was also driven by a decrease in the average discount rate primarily due to a shift in spend mix to non-T&E categories. The average discount rate was 2.28 percent for 2020 and 2.37 percent for 2019.Net card fees increased, primarily driven by our premium card product portfolios. Card fees, which are recognized over a twelve-month period, are slower to react to economic shifts, such as those arising from the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic. Other fees and commissions decreased, primarily due to the impacts of travel restrictions related to the COVID-19 pandemic, which resulted in lower foreign exchange conversion revenue related to decreased cross-border Card Member spending and lower travel commissions and fees from our consumer travel business, as well as a decline in late fees due to lower delinquencies.Other revenues decreased, primarily driven by a net loss in the current year, as compared to net income in the prior year, from the GBT JV and lower revenue earned on cross-border Card Member spending due to the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic, including travel restrictions.Interest income decreased, primarily driven by a reduction in benchmark interest rates and lower average Card Member loan volumes.Interest expense decreased, primarily driven by lower interest rates paid on deposits and a reduction in outstanding debt.46Table of ContentsTABLE 3: PROVISIONS FOR CREDIT LOSSES SUMMARYYears Ended December 31,ChangeChange(Millions, except percentages)2020201920182020 vs. 20192019 vs. 2018Card Member receivablesNet write-offs$881 $900 $859 $(19)(2)%$41 5 %Reserve build134 63 78 71 113 (15)(19)Total1,015 963 937 52 5 26 3 Card Member loansNet write-offs2,170 2,235 1,843 (65)(3)392 21 Reserve build1,283 227 423 1,056 #(196)(46)Total3,453 2,462 2,266 991 40 196 9 OtherNet write-offs - Other loans(a)111 98 79 13 13 19 24 Net write-offs - Other receivables(b)27 20 32 7 35 (12)(38)Reserve build - Other loans(a)66 28 44 38 #(16)(36)Reserve build (release) - Other receivables(b)58 2 (6)56 #8 (133)Total262 148 149 114 77 (1)(1)Total provisions for credit losses$4,730 $3,573 $3,352 $1,157 32 %$221 7 %# Denotes a variance greater than 100 percent(a)Relates to Other loans of $2.9 billion, $4.8 billion, and $3.8 billion less reserves of $238 million, $152 million, and $124 million, as of December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively.(b)Relates to Other receivables included in Other assets on the Consolidated Balance Sheets of $3 billion, $3.1 billion, and $2.9 billion, less reserves of $85 million, $27 million, $25 million as of December 31, 2020, 2019, and 2018, respectively.PROVISIONS FOR CREDIT LOSSESCard Member loans and receivables provision for credit losses increased, primarily driven by a higher reserve build reflecting the deterioration of the global macroeconomic outlook, including unemployment and GDP, partially offset by improved credit performance and a decline in the outstanding balance of Card Member loans and receivables.Other provision for credit losses increased, primarily driven by a higher reserve build and higher net write-offs.

The contract renewal included new pricing terms, some of which became effective upon contract signing and others that were tied to the product re-launch. These pricing changes, as well as changes in the expense classification of certain benefits associated with the re-launch, resulted in an increase to Marketing and business development and decreases to both Card Member rewards and Card Member services expenses, as compared to the prior year.47Table of ContentsMarketing and business development expense decreased, primarily due to a temporary reduction in proactive marketing for Card Member acquisitions, as well as decreases in corporate client incentives and network partner payments due to lower billed business, all of which were a result of the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic, partially offset by incremental investments in limited time enhancements to our Card Member value proposition to maintain customer engagement and the Delta changes described above.Card Member rewards expense decreased, primarily driven by decreases in Membership Rewards and cash back rewards expenses of $1,579 million and cobrand rewards expense of $819 million, both of which were primarily driven by lower billed business as a result of the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic. In addition, changes in redemption mix due to a decline in higher cost travel redemptions since the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic contributed to a decrease in the Membership Rewards weighted average cost (WAC) per reward point and expense. Cobrand rewards expense also reflected the impact of the Delta changes described above. The Membership Rewards Ultimate Redemption Rate (URR) for current program participants was 96 percent (rounded up) at both December 31, 2020 and 2019.Card Member services expense decreased, primarily due to lower usage of travel-related benefits as a result of the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic, as well as the Delta changes described above.Salaries and employee benefits expense decreased, primarily driven by lower incentive compensation expenses, partially offset by increased payroll costs due to a higher full year average headcount as compared to the prior year.Other expenses decreased, primarily driven by a prior year litigation-related charge, lower employee-related operating costs and lower professional services expense, partially offset by a prior year non-income tax-related benefit.48Table of ContentsINCOME TAXESThe effective tax rate for 2020 was 27.0 percent. The effective tax rate for 2019 was 19.8 percent. The increase in the effective tax rate in the current period primarily reflected discrete tax charges related to the realizability of certain foreign deferred tax assets, resulting from cumulative losses in certain non-U.S. legal entities that were exacerbated by the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic. The tax rates in both periods reflect the level of pretax income in relation to recurring permanent tax benefits and the geographic mix of business.TABLE 5: SELECTED CARD-RELATED STATISTICAL INFORMATIONChangeChangeYears Ended December 31,2020201920182020 vs. 20192019 vs. 2018Billed business: (billions)U.S.$693.1 $827.7 $777.6 (16)%6 %Outside the U.S.317.5 413.1 406.4 (23)2 Total$1,010.6 $1,240.8 $1,184.0 (19)5 Proprietary$870.7 $1,070.5 $1,002.6 (19)7 GNS139.9 170.3 181.4 (18)(6)Total$1,010.6 $1,240.8 $1,184.0 (19)5 Cards-in-force: (millions)U.S.53.8 54.7 53.7 (2)2 Outside the U.S.58.2 59.7 60.3 (3)(1)Total112.0 114.4 114.0 (2)— Proprietary68.9 70.3 69.1 (2)2 GNS43.1 44.1 44.9 (2)(2)Total112.0 114.4 114.0 (2)— Basic cards-in-force: (millions)U.S.42.2 43.0 42.3 (2)2 Outside the U.S.49.1 50.0 50.3 (2)(1)Total91.3 93.0 92.6 (2)— Average proprietary basic Card Member spending: (dollars)U.S.$18,085 $21,515 $20,840 (16)3 Outside the U.S.$12,264 $16,351 $15,756 (25)4 Worldwide Average$16,352 $19,972 $19,340 (18)3 Average discount rate2.28 %2.37 %2.37 %Average fee per card (dollars)(a)$67 $58 $51 16 %14 %(a)Average fee per card is computed based on proprietary net card fees divided by average proprietary total cards-in-force.49Table of ContentsTABLE 6: BILLED BUSINESS-RELATED STATISTICAL INFORMATION 20202019Percentage Increase(Decrease)Percentage Increase (Decrease) Assuming No Changes in FX Rates(a)Percentage Increase(Decrease)Percentage Increase (Decrease)Assuming No Changes in FX Rates(a)WorldwideProprietaryProprietary consumer(17)%(17)%8 %9 %Proprietary commercial(21)(21)6 6 Total Proprietary(19)(19)7 8 GNS(18)(17)(6)(2)Worldwide Total(19)(18)5 6 T&E-related volume (14% and 30% of Worldwide Total for 2020 and 2019, respectively) (b)(61)(60)4 6 Non-T&E-related volume (86% and 70% of Worldwide Total for 2020 and 2019, respectively) (b)(1)(1)6 7 Airline-related volume (3% and 8% of Worldwide Total for 2020 and 2019, respectively) (b)(76)(76)1 3 U.S.ProprietaryProprietary consumer(15)7 Proprietary commercial(18)5 Total Proprietary(16)6 U.S. Total(16)6 T&E-related volume (13% and 25% of U.S. Total for 2020 and 2019, respectively) (b)(57)6 Non-T&E-related volume (87% and 75% of U.S. Total for 2020 and 2019, respectively) (b)(1)6 Airline-related volume (2% and 7% of U.S. Total for 2020 and 2019, respectively) (b)(75)4 Outside the U.S.ProprietaryProprietary consumer(21)(21)10 14 Proprietary commercial(32)(31)7 11 Total Proprietary(26)(25)9 13 Outside the U.S. Total(23)(22)2 6 Asia Pacific, Australia and New Zealand(16)(16)1 5 Latin America & Canada(32)(26)4 10 Europe, the Middle East & Africa(30)%(31)%1 %5 %(a)The foreign currency adjusted information assumes a constant exchange rate between the periods being compared for purposes of currency translation into U.S. dollars (i.e., assumes the foreign exchange rates used to determine results for the current year apply to the corresponding prior-year period against which such results are being compared).(b)Based on billed business from merchants we acquire or merchants acquired by third parties on our behalf (e.g., OptBlue merchants). 50Table of ContentsTABLE 7: SELECTED CREDIT-RELATED STATISTICAL INFORMATIONAs of or for the Years Ended December 31,ChangeChange(Millions, except percentages and where indicated)2020201920182020 vs. 20192019 vs. 2018Worldwide Card Member loans: Card Member loans: (billions)U.S. $64.2 $76.0 $72.0 (16)%6 %Outside the U.S. 9.2 11.4 9.9 (19)15 Total$73.4 $87.4 $81.9 (16)7 Credit loss reserves:Beginning balance (a)$4,027 $2,134 $1,706 89 25 Provisions - principal, interest and fees3,453 2,462 2,266 40 9 Net write-offs — principal less recoveries(1,795)(1,860)(1,539)(3)21 Net write-offs — interest and fees less recoveries(375)(375)(304)— 23 Other (b)34 22 5 55 #Ending balance$5,344 $2,383 $2,134 #12 % of loans7.3 %2.7 %2.6 %% of past due727 %177 %182 %Average loans (billions)$74.6 $82.8 $75.8 (10)9 Net write-off rate — principal only (c)2.4 %2.2 %2.0 %Net write-off rate — principal, interest and fees (c)2.9 %2.7 %2.4 %30+ days past due as a % of total1.0 %1.5 %1.4 %Worldwide Card Member receivables: Card Member receivables: (billions)U.S.$30.5 $39.0 $39.0 (22)— Outside the U.S.13.2 18.4 16.9 (28)9 Total$43.7 $57.4 $55.9 (24)3 Credit loss reserves:Beginning balance (a)$126 $573 $521 (78)10 Provisions - principal and fees1,015 963 937 5 3 Net write-offs - principal and fees less recoveries(881)(900)(859)(2)5 Other (b)7 (17)(26)#(35)Ending balance$267 $619 $573 (57)%8 %% of receivables0.6 %1.1 %1.0 %Net write-off rate — principal and fees (c)(d)2.0 %1.6 %1.6 %# Denotes a variance greater than 100 percent (a)Includes an increase of $1,643 million and decrease of $493 million to the beginning reserve balances for Card Member loans and receivables, respectively, as of January 1, 2020, related to the adoption of the CECL methodology.

These enhancements resulted in a change to the interest expense not attributable to our Card Member loan portfolio and therefore also on our Net Interest Yield on Average Card Member loans. Prior period amounts have been revised to conform to the current period presentation.Years Ended December 31,(Millions, except percentages and where indicated)202020192018Net interest income$7,985 $8,620 $7,663 Exclude:Interest expense not attributable to our Card Member loan portfolio (a)1,295 1,833 1,592 Interest income not attributable to our Card Member loan portfolio (b)(668)(1,227)(1,010)Adjusted net interest income (c)$8,612 $9,226 $8,245 Average Card Member loans (billions)$74.6 $82.8 $75.8 Net interest income divided by average Card Member loans (c)10.7 %10.4 %10.1 %Net interest yield on average Card Member loans (c)11.5 %11.1 %10.9 %(a)Primarily represents interest expense attributable to maintaining our corporate liquidity pool and funding Card Member receivables.(b)Primarily represents interest income attributable to Other loans, interest-bearing deposits and the fixed income investment portfolios.(c)Adjusted net interest income and net interest yield on average Card Member loans are non-GAAP measures. Refer to “Glossary of Selected Terminology” for the definitions of these terms. We believe adjusted net interest income is useful to investors because it represents the interest expense and interest income attributable to our Card Member loan portfolio and is a component of net interest yield on average Card Member loans, which provides a measure of profitability of our Card Member loan portfolio. Net interest yield on average Card Member loans reflects adjusted net interest income divided by average Card Member loans, computed on an annualized basis. Net interest income divided by average Card Member loans, computed on an annualized basis, a GAAP measure, includes elements of total interest income and total interest expense that are not attributable to the Card Member loan portfolio, and thus is not representative of net interest yield on average Card Member loans.52Table of ContentsBUSINESS SEGMENT RESULTS OF OPERATIONSWe consider a combination of factors when evaluating the composition of our reportable operating segments, including the results reviewed by the chief operating decision maker, economic characteristics, products and services offered, classes of customers, product distribution channels, geographic considerations (primarily United States versus outside the United States) and regulatory considerations. Refer to Note 24 to the “Consolidated Financial Statements” and Part I, Item 1. “Business” for additional discussion of products and services that comprise each segment.Effective for the first quarter of 2020, we made certain enhancements to our transfer pricing methodology related to the sharing of revenues among our card issuing, network and merchant businesses, and our methodology related to the allocation of certain funding costs primarily related to our Card Member loan and Card Member receivable portfolios. These enhancements resulted in certain changes to Non-interest revenues and Interest expense within Total revenues net of interest expense and Operating expenses within Total expenses across our reportable operating segments.The enhancements related to the allocation of certain funding costs also resulted in a change to our Net interest income divided by Average Card Member loans metric and Net Interest Yield on Average Card Member loans, a non-GAAP measure, within our reportable operating segments.For all of the above-referenced changes, prior period amounts have been revised to conform to the current period presentation.Results of the reportable operating segments generally treat each segment as a stand-alone business. The management reporting process that derives these results allocates revenue and expense using various methodologies as described below.TOTAL REVENUES NET OF INTEREST EXPENSEWe allocate discount revenue and certain other revenues among segments using a transfer pricing methodology. Within the GCSG and GCS segments, discount revenue generally reflects the issuer component of the overall discount revenue generated by each segment’s Card Members; within the GMNS segment, discount revenue generally reflects the network and acquirer component of the overall discount revenue.Net card fees and Other fees and commissions are directly attributable to the segment in which they are reported.Interest and fees on loans and certain investment income is directly attributable to the segment in which it is reported. Interest expense represents an allocated funding cost based on a combination of segment funding requirements and internal funding rates.PROVISIONS FOR CREDIT LOSSESThe provisions for credit losses are directly attributable to the segment in which they are reported.EXPENSESMarketing and business development expense is included in each segment based on the actual expenses incurred. Global brand advertising is primarily allocated to the segments based on the relative levels of revenue. Rewards and Card Member services expenses are included in each segment based on the actual expenses incurred.Salaries and employee benefits and other operating expenses reflect both costs incurred directly within each segment, as well as allocated expenses. The allocated expenses include service costs allocated based on activities directly attributable to the segment, and overhead expenses allocated based on the relative levels of revenue and Card Member loans and receivables.INCOME TAXESAn income tax provision (benefit) is allocated to each reportable operating segment based on the effective tax rates applicable to the various businesses that comprise the segment. 53Table of ContentsGLOBAL CONSUMER SERVICES GROUPTABLE 9: GCSG SELECTED INCOME STATEMENT DATAYears Ended December 31,ChangeChange(Millions, except percentages)2020201920182020 vs. 20192019 vs. 2018RevenuesNon-interest revenues$14,178 $16,702 $15,357 $(2,524)(15)%$1,345 9 %Interest income8,199 9,413 8,323 (1,214)(13)1,090 13 Interest expense1,051 1,730 1,448 (679)(39)282 19 Net interest income7,148 7,683 6,875 (535)(7)808 12 Total revenues net of interest expense21,326 24,385 22,232 (3,059)(13)2,153 10 Provisions for credit losses3,148 2,635 2,431 513 19 204 8 Total revenues net of interest expense after provisions for credit losses18,178 21,750 19,801 (3,572)(16)1,949 10 ExpensesMarketing, business development, rewards and Card Member services9,668 12,043 10,796 (2,375)(20)1,247 12 Salaries and employee benefits and other operating expenses4,903 4,967 4,585 (64)(1)382 8 Total expenses14,571 17,010 15,381 (2,439)(14)1,629 11 Pretax segment income3,607 4,740 4,420 (1,133)(24)320 7 Income tax provision906 933 805 (27)(3)128 16 Segment income$2,701 $3,807 $3,615 $(1,106)(29)%$192 5 %Effective tax rate25.1 %19.7 %18.2 %GCSG primarily issues a wide range of proprietary consumer cards globally. GCSG also provides services to consumers, including travel and lifestyle services and non-card financing products, and manages certain international joint ventures and our partnership agreements in China.TOTAL REVENUES NET OF INTEREST EXPENSENon-interest revenues decreased, primarily driven by lower discount revenue and other fees and commissions, partially offset by higher net card fees. Discount revenue decreased 20 percent, reflecting a decrease in proprietary consumer billed business of 17 percent. See Tables 5, 6 and 10 for more details on billed business performance.Other fees and commissions decreased 40 percent, primarily due to the impacts of travel restrictions related to the COVID-19 pandemic, which resulted in lower travel commissions and fees from our consumer travel business and lower foreign exchange conversion revenue related to decreased cross-border spending, as well as a decline in late fees due to lower delinquencies.Net card fees increased 16 percent, driven by a year-over-year increase in the average fee per card of our premium card products. Net interest income decreased, primarily due to lower average Card Member loan volumes and a reduction in benchmark interest rates, partially offset by a lower cost of funds. PROVISIONS FOR CREDIT LOSSESProvisions for credit losses increased, primarily driven by a higher reserve build in Card Member loans, partially offset by lower net write-offs in both the Card Member loans and receivables portfolios. The higher reserve build primarily reflected the deterioration of the global macroeconomic outlook, including unemployment and GDP, partially offset by improved credit performance and a decline in the outstanding balance of loans and receivables.54Table of ContentsEXPENSESMarketing, business development, rewards and Card Member services expenses decreased due to reductions in Card Member rewards and Card Member services expenses, partially offset by increased Marketing and business development costs. The decrease in Card Member rewards expense was primarily driven by a decrease in billed business and a change in redemption mix due to a decline in higher cost travel redemptions since the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic. The decrease in Card Member services expense was primarily driven by lower usage of travel-related benefits. Those decreases were partially offset by increased Marketing and business development expense, primarily due to incremental investments in limited time enhancements to our Card Member value

Discount revenue decreased, primarily due to a decrease in commercial billed business of 21 percent. See Tables 5, 6 and 13 for more details on billed business performance. Other fees and commissions decreased, primarily due to a decline in late fees due to lower delinquencies, as well as lower foreign exchange conversion revenue related to decreased cross-border spending, primarily driven by the impacts of travel restrictions related to the COVID-19 pandemic.Net interest income increased, primarily driven by a lower cost of funds, partially offset by a reduction in benchmark interest rates. PROVISIONS FOR CREDIT LOSSESProvisions for credit losses increased, primarily driven by a higher reserve build and higher net write-offs. The higher reserve build primarily reflected the deterioration of the global macroeconomic outlook, including unemployment and GDP, partially offset by improved credit performance and a decline in the outstanding balance of loans and receivables.EXPENSESMarketing, business development, rewards and Card Member services expenses decreased, primarily due to reductions in Card Member rewards expense and Marketing and business development expense. The decrease in Card Member rewards expense was primarily driven by a decrease in billed business. The decrease in Marketing and business development expense was primarily due to a decrease in corporate client incentives and a temporary reduction in proactive marketing for Card Member acquisitions, partially offset by incremental investments in limited time enhancements to our Card Member value proposition to maintain customer engagement.59Table of ContentsTABLE 13: GCS SELECTED STATISTICAL INFORMATIONAs of or for the Years Ended December 31,ChangeChange(Millions, except percentages and where indicated)2020201920182020 vs. 20192019 vs. 2018Proprietary billed business (billions)$406.5 $513.3 $486.2 (21)%6 %Proprietary cards-in-force14.5 14.9 14.5 (3)3 Average Card Member spending (dollars)$27,769 $34,905 $34,058 (20)2 Total segment assets (billions)$42.1 $52.8 $51.3 (20)3 GSBS Card Member loans:Total loans (billions)$13.2 $14.1 $12.4 (6)14 Average loans (billions)$12.9 $13.3 $11.7 (3)%14 %Net write-off rate - principal only(a)2.1 %1.9 %1.7 %Net write-off rate - principal, interest and fees(a)2.4 %2.2 %2.0 %30+ days past due as a % of total0.7 %1.3 %1.3 %Calculation of Net Interest Yield on Average Card Member Loans:Net interest income$967 $866 $723 Exclude:Interest expense not attributable to our Card Member loan portfolio(b)478 772 693 Interest income not attributable to our Card Member loan portfolio(c)(170)(222)(161)Adjusted net interest income(d)$1,275 $1,416 $1,255 Average Card Member loans (billions)$13.0 $13.4 $11.8 Net interest income divided by average Card Member loans(d)7.4 %6.5 %6.1 %Net interest yield on average Card Member loans(d)9.8 %10.6 %10.7 %Card Member receivables:Total receivables (billions)$25.0 $34.6 $34.4 (28)%1 %Net write-off rate - principal and fees(a)(e)2.1 %1.4 %1.5 %GCP Card Member receivables: Total receivables (billions)$10.9 $17.2 $17.7 (37)%(3)%90+ days past billing as a % of total(e)0.6 %0.8 %0.7 %Net write-off rate - principal and fees(a)(e)1.9 %0.8 %1.1 %GSBS Card Member receivables:Total receivables (billions)$14.1 $17.4 $16.7 (19)%4 %Net write-off rate - principal only(a)2.1 %1.9 %1.7 %Net write-off rate - principal and fees(a)2.3 %2.1 %2.0 %30+ days past due as a % of total0.7 %1.7 %1.6 %(a)Refer to Table 7 footnote (c).(b)Refer to Table 8 footnote (a).(c)Refer to Table 8 footnote (b).(d)Refer to Table 8 footnote (c).(e)For GCP Card Member receivables, delinquency data is tracked based on days past billing status rather than days past due.

GMNS also manages loyalty coalition businesses.TOTAL REVENUES NET OF INTEREST EXPENSENon-interest revenues decreased, primarily driven by lower discount revenue due to lower worldwide billed business and a decline in the average discount rate, primarily due to a shift in spend mix to non-T&E categories, as well as a decrease in other fees and commissions, due to lower foreign exchange conversion revenue related to decreased cross-border spending as a result of the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic. For a detailed discussion on billed business and the average discount rate, please refer to the “Consolidated Results of Operations.” Net interest income decreased, primarily driven by a lower interest expense credit relating to internal transfer pricing, which results in a net benefit for GMNS due to its merchant payables.EXPENSESMarketing, business development, and rewards and Card Member services expenses decreased, primarily driven by lower Marketing and business development expense, including decreased network partner payments due to lower spend volumes as a result of the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic.Salaries and employee benefits and other operating expenses decreased, primarily reflecting lower incentive compensation expense and lower professional services expense. 61Table of ContentsCORPORATE & OTHERCorporate functions and certain other businesses are included in Corporate & Other.Corporate & Other net loss was $1.3 billion and $1.4 billion in 2020 and 2019, respectively. The decrease in the net loss in 2020 compared to 2019 was primarily driven by a prior year litigation-related charge, a higher gain in the current year related to our strategic investments and lower incentive compensation in the current year, partially offset by a net loss in the current year as compared to net income in the prior year, related to the GBT JV.CONSOLIDATED CAPITAL RESOURCES AND LIQUIDITYOur balance sheet management objectives are to maintain:•A solid and flexible equity capital profile;•A broad, deep and diverse set of funding sources to finance our assets and meet operating requirements; and•Liquidity programs that enable us to continuously meet expected future financing obligations and business requirements for at least a twelve-month period in the event we are unable to continue to raise new funds under our traditional funding programs during a substantial weakening in economic conditions.We are closely monitoring the changing macroeconomic environment and actively managing our balance sheet to reflect evolving circumstances. Our objective is to remain financially strong against a backdrop of an uncertain operating environment and outlook.CAPITAL STRATEGYWe believe capital allocated to growing businesses with a return on risk-adjusted equity in excess of our costs will generate shareholder value. Our objective is to retain sufficient levels of capital generated through net income and other sources, such as the exercise of stock options by employees, to maintain a strong balance sheet, provide flexibility to support future business growth, and distribute excess capital to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. See ""Dividends and Share Repurchases"" below. The level and composition of our consolidated capital position are determined through our Internal Capital Adequacy Assessment Process, which takes into account our business activities, as well as marketplace conditions and requirements or expectations of credit rating agencies, regulators and shareholders, among others. As a bank holding company, we are subject to regulatory requirements administered by the U.S. federal banking agencies. The Federal Reserve has established specific capital adequacy guidelines that involve quantitative measures of assets, liabilities and certain off-balance sheet items. Failure to maintain minimum regulatory capital levels at American Express or our U.S. bank subsidiary, American Express National Bank (AENB), could affect our status as a financial holding company and cause the banking regulators with oversight of American Express or AENB to take actions that could limit our business operations. We seek to maintain capital levels and ratios in excess of the minimum regulatory requirements, specifically within a 10 to 11 percent target range for American Express' Common Equity Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio.We maintain certain flexibility to shift capital across our businesses as appropriate. For example, we may infuse additional capital into subsidiaries to maintain capital at targeted levels in consideration of debt ratings and regulatory requirements. These infused amounts can affect our capital and liquidity positions at the American Express parent company level.We report our capital ratios using the Basel III capital definitions and the Basel III standardized approach for calculating risk-weighted assets. 62Table of ContentsThe following table presents our regulatory risk-based capital and leverage ratios and those of AENB, as of December 31, 2020.

Refer to “Capital and Liquidity Regulation” under “Supervision and Regulation” and Note 22 to our “Consolidated Financial Statements” for additional information.The following table presents American Express Company's regulatory risk-based capital and risk-weighted assets, which are calculated in accordance with standard regulatory guidance as described below:TABLE 16: REGULATORY RISK-BASED CAPITAL COMPONENTS AND RISK-WEIGHTED ASSETSAmerican Express Company($ in Billions)December 31, 2020Risk-Based CapitalCommon Equity Tier 1$18.7 Tier 1 Capital20.3 Tier 2 Capital2.1 Total Capital22.4 Risk-Weighted Assets138.3 Average Total Assets to calculate the Tier 1 Leverage Ratio$185.1 Risk-Weighted Assets — Assets are weighted for risk according to a formula used by the Federal Reserve to conform to capital adequacy guidelines. On- and off-balance sheet items are weighted for risk, with off-balance sheet items converted to balance sheet equivalents, using risk conversion factors, before being allocated a risk-adjusted weight. Off-balance sheet exposures comprise a minimal part of the total risk-weighted assets.Common Equity Tier 1 Risk-Based Capital Ratio — Calculated as Common Equity Tier 1 capital (CET1), divided by risk-weighted assets. CET1 is the sum of common shareholders’ equity, adjusted for ineligible goodwill and intangible assets, certain deferred tax assets, as well as certain other comprehensive income items as follows: net unrealized gains/losses on securities, foreign currency translation adjustments and net unrealized pension and other postretirement benefit/losses, all net of tax. CET1 is also adjusted for the CECL final rules, as described below.Tier 1 Risk-Based Capital Ratio — Calculated as Tier 1 capital divided by risk-weighted assets. Tier 1 capital is the sum of CET1, our perpetual preferred stock and third-party non-controlling interests in consolidated subsidiaries, adjusted for capital held by insurance subsidiaries. The minimum requirement for the Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio is 1.5 percent higher than the minimum for the CET1 risk-based capital ratio. We have $1.6 billion of preferred shares outstanding to help address a portion of the Tier 1 capital requirements in excess of common equity requirements.Total Risk-Based Capital Ratio — Calculated as the sum of Tier 1 capital and Tier 2 capital, divided by risk-weighted assets. Tier 2 capital is the sum of the reserve for loan and receivable credit losses adjusted for the CECL final rules (limited to 1.25 percent of risk-weighted assets), and $360 million of eligible subordinated notes, adjusted for capital held by insurance 63Table of Contentssubsidiaries. The $360 million of eligible subordinated notes reflect a 40 percent, or $240 million, reduction of Tier 2 capital credit for the $600 million subordinated debt issued in December 2014. Tier 1 Leverage Ratio — Calculated by dividing Tier 1 capital by our average total consolidated assets for the most recent quarter.We elected to delay the impact of the adoption of the CECL methodology on regulatory capital for two years followed by a three-year phase-in period pursuant to rules issued by federal banking regulators (the CECL final rules). As of December 31, 2020, our reported regulatory capital excluded the $0.9 billion impact to retained earnings upon the adoption of the CECL methodology and 25 percent of the impact of the $1.5 billion increase in reserves for credit losses from January 1, 2020 to December 31, 2020. We will begin phasing in the cumulative amount that is not recognized in regulatory capital at 25 percent per year beginning January 1, 2022. Refer to ""Capital and Liquidity Regulation"" under Part 1, Item 1. ""Business - Supervision and Regulation"" for additional details.DIVIDENDS AND SHARE REPURCHASES We return capital to common shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. The share repurchases reduce common shares outstanding and generally more than offset the issuance of new shares as part of employee compensation plans.During the year ended December 31, 2020, we returned $2.3 billion to our shareholders in the form of common stock dividends of $1.4 billion and share repurchases of $0.9 billion. We repurchased 7 million common shares at an average price of $121.14 in 2020. These dividend and share repurchase amounts collectively represent approximately 70 percent of total capital generated during the year.In addition, during the year ended December 31, 2020, we paid $79 million in dividends on non-cumulative perpetual preferred shares outstanding. For additional information on our preferred shares, refer to Note 16 to the “Consolidated Financial Statements.”Our decisions on capital distributions depend on various factors, including: our capital levels and regulatory capital requirements; actual and forecasted business results; economic and market conditions; revisions to, or revocation of, the Federal Reserve’s authorization of our capital plan; and the Comprehensive Capital Analysis and Review (CCAR) process. Due to the uncertain business environment, we suspended share repurchases in March 2020 to maintain financial strength. Subsequently, the Federal Reserve announced that it would prohibit share repurchases in the third and fourth quarters of 2020 for all banking organizations participating in CCAR and would allow them to pay common stock dividends provided (a) they do not increase the amount of the dividend and (b) they do not exceed the average of a firm's net income for the four preceding calendar quarters. Based upon the results of its second round of 2020 stress testing, the Federal Reserve announced on December 18, 2020, certain modifications to its capital distribution restrictions that would apply for the first quarter of 2021. Refer to ""Stress Testing and Capital Planning"" under Part 1, Item 1. ""Business - Supervision and Regulation"" for additional details.We plan to resume share repurchases under our previously disclosed share repurchase program in the first quarter of 2021, up to our maximum capacity of approximately $440 million authorized by the Federal Reserve. Share purchases under publicly announced programs are made pursuant to open market purchases or privately negotiated transactions (including employee benefit plans) as market conditions warrant and at prices we deem appropriate.FUNDING STRATEGYOur principal funding objective is to maintain broad and well-diversified funding sources to allow us to meet our maturing obligations, cost-effectively finance asset growth in our global businesses, as well as to maintain a strong liquidity profile. The diversity of funding sources by type of instrument, by maturity and by investor base, among other factors, mitigates the impact of disruptions in any one type of instrument, maturity or investor. The mix of our funding in any period will seek to achieve cost efficiency consistent with both maintaining diversified sources and achieving our liquidity objectives. We seek to diversify our funding sources by maintaining scale and relevance in unsecured debt, asset securitizations and deposits. Our direct retail deposits have become a larger proportion of our funding over time and we expect that will continue. Our funding strategy and activities are integrated into our asset-liability management activities. We have in place a funding policy covering American Express Company and all of our subsidiaries.Our global proprietary card-issuing businesses generate significant assets in both domestic and international Card Member lending and receivable activities. Our financing needs are in large part a consequence of our proprietary card-issuing businesses, and the maintenance of a liquidity position to meet regulatory requirements and support all of our business activities, such as merchant payments. We generally pay merchants for card transactions prior to reimbursement by Card Members and therefore 64Table of Contentsfund the merchant payments during the period Card Member loans and receivables are outstanding. We also have additional financing needs associated with general corporate purposes. Our funding plan to meet these financing needs is in turn driven by, among other factors, our liquidity position, size and mix of business asset growth, choice of funding sources, and our maturing obligations.Due to the impact of COVID-19, we experienced significant reductions in our business volumes and decline in the balances of our Card Member loans and receivables. The decline in Card Member loans and receivables balances resulted in substantial liquidity levels, which were further strengthened by the strong growth in our direct retail deposits in 2020.FUNDING PROGRAMS AND ACTIVITIESWe meet our funding needs through a variety of sources, including direct and third-party distributed deposits and debt instruments, such as senior unsecured debt, asset securitizations, borrowings through secured borrowing facilities and a committed bank credit facility. We had the following consolidated debt and customer deposits outstanding as of December 31:TABLE 17: SUMMARY OF CONSOLIDATED DEBT AND CUSTOMER DEPOSITS(Billions)20202019Short-term borrowings$1.9 $6.4 Long-term debt43.0 57.8 Total debt44.9 64.2 Customer deposits86.9 73.3 Total debt and customer deposits$131.8 $137.5 We may redeem from time to time certain debt securities prior to the original contractual maturity dates in accordance with the optional redemption provisions of those debt securities.Our funding plan for the full year 2021 includes, among other sources, a limited amount of unsecured and secured term debt issuance. Actual funding activities can vary from our plans due to various factors, such as future business growth, the impact of global economic, political and other events on market capacity and funding needs, demand for securities offered by us, regulatory changes, ability to securitize and sell receivables, and the performance of receivables previously sold in securitization transactions. Many of these factors are beyond our control.Our equity capital and funding strategies are designed, among other things, to maintain appropriate and stable unsecured debt ratings from the major credit rating agencies: Moody’s Investor Services (Moody’s), Standard & Poor’s (S&P) and Fitch Ratings (Fitch). Such ratings help support our access to cost-effective unsecured funding as part of our overall funding strategy. Our asset securitization activities are rated separately.TABLE 18: UNSECURED DEBT RATINGSCredit AgencyAmerican Express EntityShort-Term RatingsLong-Term RatingsOutlookFitchAll rated entitiesF1ANegativeMoody’sAmerican Express Travel Related Services Company, Inc.N/AA2NegativeMoody'sAmerican Express Credit CorporationPrime-1A2NegativeMoody’sAmerican Express National BankPrime-1A3NegativeMoody'sAmerican Express CompanyN/AA3NegativeS&PAmerican Express Travel Related Services Company, Inc.N/AA-StableS&PAmerican Express Credit Corporation and American Express National BankA-2A-StableS&PAmerican Express CompanyA-2BBB+StableThese ratings are not a recommendation to buy or hold any of our securities and they may be revised or revoked at any time at the sole discretion of the rating organization.Downgrades in the ratings of our unsecured debt or asset securitization program securities could result in higher funding costs, as well as higher fees related to borrowings under our unused credit facilities. Declines in credit ratings could also reduce our borrowing capacity in the unsecured debt and asset securitization capital markets. We believe our funding mix, including the proportion of U.S. retail deposits insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) to total funding, should reduce the impact that credit rating downgrades would have on our funding capacity and costs.65Table of ContentsSHORT-TERM FUNDING PROGRAMSShort-term borrowings, such as commercial paper, are defined as any debt with an original maturity of twelve months or less, as well as interest-bearing overdrafts with banks. Our short-term funding programs are used primarily to fund working capital needs, such as managing seasonal variations in receivables balances. The amount of short-term borrowings issued in the future will depend on our funding strategy, our needs and market conditions. As of December 31, 2020, we had nil in commercial paper outstanding and we had an average of $628 million in commercial paper outstanding during 2020. Refer to Note 8 to the “Consolidated Financial Statements” for a further description of these borrowings.DEPOSIT PROGRAMSWe offer deposits within our U.S. bank subsidiary, AENB. These funds are currently insured up to an amount that is at least $250,000 per account holder through the FDIC. Our ability to obtain deposit funding and offer competitive interest rates is dependent on, among other factors, the capital level of AENB. Direct retail deposits offered by AENB is our primary deposit product channel, which makes FDIC-insured high-yield savings account and certificates of deposit (CDs) products available directly to consumers. AENB also sources deposits through third-party distribution channels as needed to meet our overall funding objectives. As of December 31, 2020, we had $86.9 billion in deposits. Refer to Note 7 to the “Consolidated Financial Statements” for a further description of these deposits.LONG-TERM DEBT AND ASSET SECURITIZATION PROGRAMSAs of December 31, 2020, we had $43.0 billion in long-term debt outstanding, including unsecured debt and asset-backed securities. Refer to Note 8 to the “Consolidated Financial Statements” for a further description of these borrowings.We periodically securitize Card Member loans and receivables arising from our card business, as the securitization market provides us with cost-effective funding. Securitization of Card Member loans and receivables is accomplished through the transfer of those assets to a trust, which in turn issues securities collateralized by the transferred assets to third-party investors. The proceeds from issuance are distributed to us, through our wholly owned subsidiaries, as consideration for the transferred assets. Refer to Note 5 to the “Consolidated Financial Statements” for a further description of our asset securitizations.On February 1, 2020, we removed U.S. consumer and small business Card Member receivables from the American Express Issuance Trust II (the Charge Trust) and substantially replaced them with U.S. corporate Card Member receivables. On April 20, 2020, we added approximately $1.7 billion of additional U.S. corporate Card Member receivables to the Charge Trust. Given the significant reductions in our business volumes and our resulting substantial cash and liquidity position, we did not issue any unsecured or secured term debt during 2020. 66Table of ContentsLIQUIDITY MANAGEMENTOur liquidity objective is to maintain access to a diverse set of on- and off-balance sheet liquidity sources. We seek to maintain liquidity sources in amounts sufficient to meet our expected future financial obligations and business requirements for liquidity for a period of at least twelve months in the event we are unable to raise new funds under our regular funding programs during a substantial weakening in economic conditions.Our liquidity management strategy includes a number of elements, including, but not limited to:•Maintaining diversified funding sources (refer to the “Funding Strategy” section for more details);•Maintaining unencumbered liquid assets and off-balance sheet liquidity sources;•Projecting cash inflows and outflows under a variety of economic and market scenarios; and•Establishing clear objectives for liquidity risk management, including compliance with regulatory requirements.We seek to maintain access to a diverse set of on-balance sheet and off-balance sheet liquidity sources, including cash and other liquid assets, committed bank credit facilities and secured borrowing facilities. Through our U.S. bank subsidiary, AENB, we also hold collateral eligible for use at the Federal Reserve’s discount window.The amount and type of liquidity resources we maintain can vary over time, based upon the results of stress scenarios required under the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, as well as additional stress scenarios required under our liquidity risk policy. These stress scenarios possess distinct characteristics, varying by cash flow assumptions, time horizon and qualifying liquidity sources, among other factors. Scenarios under our liquidity risk policy include market-wide, firm-specific and combined liquidity stresses. We consider other factors in determining the amount and type of liquidity we maintain, such as economic and financial market conditions, seasonality in business operations, growth in our businesses, potential acquisitions or dispositions, the cost and availability of alternative liquidity sources and credit rating agency guidelines and requirements. We believe that we currently maintain sufficient liquidity to meet all internal and regulatory liquidity requirements. As of December 31, 2020, we had a total of $54.6 billion in Cash and cash equivalents and Investment securities (which are substantially comprised of U.S. Government Treasury obligations). The increase of $21.7 billion from $32.9 billion as of December 31, 2019 was primarily driven by the decline in the balances of our Card Member loans and receivables and the growth in our direct retail deposits.The net interest expense to maintain these liquidity resources depends on the amount of liquidity resources we maintain and the difference between our cost of funding these amounts and their investment yields. As the amount of our liquidity resources has substantially increased, the level of future net interest expense to maintain these resources is expected to be significant, as the investment income is less than the cost of funding.67Table of ContentsSecuritized Borrowing CapacityAs of December 31, 2020, we maintained our committed, revolving, secured borrowing facility, with a maturity date of July 15, 2022, which gives us the right to sell up to $3.0 billion face amount of eligible AAA notes from the Charge Trust. As the balance of Card Member receivables in the Charge Trust fluctuates over time in line with business volumes, our capacity to draw on the Charge Trust facility may be reduced when volumes decline. We also maintained our committed, revolving, secured borrowing facility, with a maturity date of September 15, 2022, which gives us the right to sell up to $2.0 billion face amount of eligible AAA certificates from the American Express Credit Account Master Trust (the Lending Trust). Both facilities are used in the ordinary course of business to fund working capital needs, as well as to further enhance our contingent funding resources. As of December 31, 2020, no amounts were drawn on the Charge Trust facility or the Lending Trust facility.Federal Reserve Discount WindowAs an insured depository institution, AENB may borrow from the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco, subject to the amount of qualifying collateral that it may pledge. The Federal Reserve has indicated that both credit and charge card receivables are a form of qualifying collateral for secured borrowings made through the discount window. Whether specific assets will be considered qualifying collateral and the amount that may be borrowed against the collateral remain at the discretion of the Federal Reserve.We had approximately $64.8 billion as of December 31, 2020 in U.S. credit card loans and charge card receivables that could be sold over time through our securitization trusts or pledged in return for secured borrowings to provide further liquidity, subject in each case to applicable market conditions and eligibility criteria.Committed Bank Credit FacilityIn addition to the secured borrowing facilities described above, we maintained a committed syndicated bank credit facility as of December 31, 2020 of $3.5 billion, with a maturity date of October 15, 2022. The availability of this credit line is subject to compliance with certain covenants by American Express Credit Corporation (Credco), principally the maintenance by Credco of a 1.25 ratio of its combined earnings, certain capital contributions and fixed charges, to fixed charges. As of December 31, 2020 and 2019, Credco was in compliance with each of these covenants. As of December 31, 2020, no amounts were drawn on the committed credit facility. We may, from time to time, use this facility in the ordinary course of business to fund working capital needs. Any undrawn portion of this facility could serve as backstop for the amount of commercial paper outstanding. Our committed bank credit facility does not contain a material adverse change clause, which might otherwise preclude borrowing under the credit facility, nor is it dependent on our credit rating.68Table of ContentsCASH FLOWSThe following table summarizes our cash flow activity, followed by a discussion of the major drivers impacting operating, investing and financing cash flows for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to the year ended December 31, 2019.TABLE 19: CASH FLOWS(Billions)202020192018Total cash provided by (used in):Operating activities$5.6 $13.6 $8.9 Investing activities11.6 (16.7)(19.6)Financing activities(9.1)(0.5)5.1 Effect of foreign currency exchange rates on cash and cash equivalents0.4 0.2 0.1 Net increase (decrease) in cash and cash equivalents$8.5 $(3.4)$(5.5)Cash Flows from Operating ActivitiesOur cash flows from operating activities primarily include net income adjusted for (i) non-cash items included in net income, such as provisions for credit losses, depreciation and amortization, deferred taxes and stock-based compensation and (ii) changes in the balances of operating assets and liabilities, which can vary significantly in the normal course of business due to the amount and timing of payments.The decrease in net cash provided by operating activities was primarily driven by decreases in Net income and Accounts payable due to decreases in merchant payables reflecting the significant decline in billed business in the current year, and an increase in Other assets due to purchases of loyalty program points from certain of our cobrand partners. These points are held as prepaid assets until they are used for rewards, promotions and incentives.Cash Flows from Investing ActivitiesOur cash flows from investing activities primarily include changes in Card Member loans and receivables, as well as changes in our available-for-sale investment securities portfolio.The increase in net cash provided by investing activities was primarily due to a decline in the outstanding balances of Card Member loans and receivables driven by a significant decline in Card Member spending during the period as a result of the continued impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic and the resulting containment measures, combined with pay down of outstanding balances by Card Members, partially offset by a net increase in the investment securities portfolio.Cash Flows from Financing ActivitiesOur cash flows from financing activities primarily include changes in customer deposits, long-term debt and short-term borrowings, as well as dividend payments and share repurchases.The increase in net cash used in financing activities was primarily driven by higher net repayment of debt, partially offset by higher growth in customer deposits and the suspension of the share repurchase program.69Table of ContentsOFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS AND CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONSWe have identified both on- and off-balance sheet transactions, arrangements, obligations and other relationships that may have a material current or future effect on our financial condition, changes in financial condition, results of operations, or liquidity and capital resources.CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONSThe table below identifies transactions that represent our contractually committed future obligations. Purchase obligations include our agreements to purchase goods and services that are enforceable and legally binding and that specify significant terms, including: fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased; fixed, minimum or variable price provisions; and the approximate timing of the transaction.TABLE 20: COMMITTED FUTURE OBLIGATIONS BY YEARPayments due by year(a)(Millions)20212022-20232024-20252026 and thereafterTotalLong-term debt$11,829 $21,324 $5,757 $4,132 $43,042 Certificates of deposit3,828 3,698 483 — 8,009 Interest payments on long-term debt(b)713 760 402 1,058 2,933 Lease obligations141 273 232 1,024 1,670 Deemed repatriation tax(c)— 14 582 416 1,012 Purchase obligations(d)231 174 34 — 439 Other long-term liabilities(e) (f)243 36 6 38 323 Total$16,985 $26,279 $7,496 $6,668 $57,428 (a)The table above excludes approximately $0.8 billion of tax reserves related to the uncertainty in income taxes as inherent complexities and the number of tax years currently open for examination in multiple jurisdictions do not permit reasonable estimates of payments, if any, to be made over a range of years. Refer to Note 20 to the “Consolidated Financial Statements” for additional information.(b)Estimated interest payments were calculated using the effective interest rates as of December 31, 2020, and includes the effect of existing interest rate swaps. Actual cash flows may differ from estimated payments.(c)Represents the remaining obligation under the Tax Act to pay a one-time transition tax on unrepatriated earnings and profits of certain foreign subsidiaries.(d)The purchase obligation amounts represent either the early termination fees or non-cancelable minimum contractual obligations, as applicable, by period under contracts that were in effect as of December 31, 2020.(e)As of December 31, 2020, there were no minimum required contributions, and no contributions are currently planned, for the U.S. American Express Retirement Plan. For the U.S. American Express Retirement Restoration Plan and non-U.S. defined benefit pension and postretirement benefit plans, contributions in 2021 are anticipated to be approximately $47 million, and this amount has been included within other long-term liabilities. Remaining obligations under defined benefit pension and postretirement benefit plans aggregating $659 million have not been included in the table above as the timing of such obligations is not determinable. Additionally, other long-term liabilities do not include $9.8 billion of Membership Rewards liabilities, which are not considered long-term liabilities as Card Members in good standing can redeem points immediately, without restrictions, and because the timing of point redemption is not determinable.(f)As of December 31, 2020, we had committed to provide funding related to certain tax credit investments resulting in a $208 million unfunded commitment included in other long-term liabilities. In addition to this amount, there was a further $106 million of contractual off-balance sheet obligations that have not been included in the table above as the timing of such obligations is not determinable. Refer to Note 6 to the “Consolidated Financial Statements” for additional information.In addition to the contractual obligations noted in Table 20, we have financial commitments related to agreements with certain cobrand partners under which we are required to make a certain level of minimum payments over the life of the agreement, generally ranging from five to ten years. Such commitments are designed to be satisfied by the payments we make to such cobrand partners primarily based on Card Members' spending and earning rewards on their cobrand cards and as we acquire new Card Members. In the event these payments do not fully satisfy the commitment, we generally pay the cobrand partner up to the amount of the commitment in exchange for an equivalent value of reward points. As of December 31, 2020, we had approximately $4 billion in such commitments outstanding and also had certain cobrand arrangements that include commitments based on variables, the values of which are not yet determinable and thus the amount is not quantifiable. Refer to Note 12 to the ""Consolidated Financial Statements"" for further information.We also have off-balance sheet arrangements that include guarantees, indemnifications and certain other off-balance sheet arrangements.70Table of ContentsGUARANTEESAs of December 31, 2020, we had guarantees and indemnifications totaling approximately $1 billion related primarily to real estate and business dispositions in the ordinary course of business. Refer to Note 15 to the “Consolidated Financial Statements” for further discussion regarding our guarantees.CERTAIN OTHER OFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTSAs of December 31, 2020, we had approximately $314 billion of unused credit available to Card Members as part of established lending product agreements. Total unused credit available to Card Members does not represent potential future cash requirements, as a significant portion of this unused credit will likely not be drawn. Our charge card products generally have no pre-set spending limit, and therefore are not reflected in unused credit available to Card Members.We provide Card Member protection that covers losses associated with purchased goods and services. We have an accrual of $58 million related to this exposure as of December 31, 2020. To date, we have not experienced significant losses related to this exposure; however, our historical experience may not be representative in the current environment given the economic and financial disruption cause by the COVID-19 pandemic and resulting containment measures. See ""Arrangements with our business partners represent a significant portion of our business. We are exposed to risks associated with our business partners, including reputational issues, business slowdowns, bankruptcies, liquidations, restructurings and consolidations, and the possible obligation to make payments to our partners"" under “Risk Factors” and Note 12 to the ""Consolidated Financial Statements"" for further information.71Table of ContentsRISK MANAGEMENTGOVERNANCEWe use our comprehensive Enterprise-wide Risk Management (ERM) program to identify, aggregate, monitor, and manage risks. The program also defines our risk appetite, governance, culture and capabilities. The implementation and execution of the ERM program is headed by our Chief Risk Officer.Risk management is overseen by our Board of Directors through three Board committees: the Risk Committee, the Audit and Compliance Committee, and the Compensation and Benefits Committee. Each committee consists entirely of independent directors and provides regular reports to the full Board regarding matters reviewed at their committee. The committees meet regularly in private sessions with our Chief Risk Officer, the Chief Compliance & Ethics Officer, the Chief Audit Executive and other senior management with regard to our risk management processes, controls, talent and capabilities. The Board monitors the “tone at the top,” our risk culture, and oversees emerging and strategic risks.The Risk Committee of our Board of Directors provides oversight of our ERM framework, processes and methodologies. The Risk Committee approves our ERM policy. The ERM policy governs risk governance, risk oversight and risk appetite for risks, including individual credit risk, institutional credit risk, operational risk, compliance risk, reputational risk, market risk, funding and liquidity risk, model risk, strategic and business risk, and country risk. Risk appetite defines the authorized risk limits to control exposures within our risk capacity and risk tolerance, including stressed forward-looking scenarios. In addition, it establishes principles for risk taking in the aggregate and for each risk type, and is supported by a comprehensive system for monitoring limits, escalation triggers and assessing control programs.The Risk Committee reviews and concurs with the appointment, replacement, performance and compensation of our Chief Risk Officer and receives regular updates from the Chief Risk Officer on key risks, transactions and exposures.The Risk Committee reviews our risk profile against the tolerances specified in the Risk Appetite Framework, including significant risk exposures, risk trends in our portfolios and major risk concentrations.The Risk Committee also provides oversight of our compliance with Regulatory capital and liquidity standards, our Internal Capital Adequacy Assessment Process, including the CCAR submissions.The Audit and Compliance Committee of our Board of Directors reviews and approves compliance policies, which include our Compliance Risk Tolerance Statement. In addition, the Audit and Compliance Committee reviews the effectiveness of our Corporate-wide Compliance Risk Management Program. More broadly, this committee is responsible for assisting the Board in its oversight responsibilities relating to the integrity of our financial statements and financial reporting process, internal and external auditing, including the qualifications and independence of the independent registered public accounting firm and the performance of our internal audit services function, and the integrity of our systems of internal controls.The Audit and Compliance Committee provides oversight of our Internal Audit Group. The Audit and Compliance Committee reviews and concurs with the appointment, replacement, performance and compensation of our Chief Audit Executive, who reports to the Audit and Compliance Committee, and approves Internal Audit’s annual audit plan, charter, policies, budget and staffing levels, and overall risk assessment methodology. The Audit and Compliance Committee also receives regular updates on the audit plan’s status and results, including significant reports issued by Internal Audit and the status of our corrective actions.The Compensation and Benefits Committee of our Board of Directors works with the Chief Risk Officer to ensure our overall compensation programs, as well as those covering our risk-taking employees, appropriately balance risk with business incentives and how business performance is achieved without taking imprudent or excessive risk. Our Chief Risk Officer is actively involved in setting risk goals for the Company. Our Chief Risk Officer also reviews the current and forward-looking risk profiles of each business unit and provides input into performance evaluation. The Chief Risk Officer meets with the Compensation and Benefits Committee and attests whether performance goals and results have been achieved without taking imprudent risks. The Compensation and Benefits Committee uses a risk-balanced incentive compensation framework to decide on our bonus pools and the compensation of senior executives.72Table of ContentsThere are several internal management committees, including the Enterprise-wide Risk Management Committee (ERMC), chaired by our Chief Risk Officer. The ERMC is the highest-level management committee to oversee all firm-wide risks and is responsible for risk governance, risk oversight and risk appetite. It maintains the enterprise-wide risk appetite framework and monitors compliance with limits and escalations defined in it. The ERMC oversees implementation of risk policies company-wide. The ERMC reviews key risk exposures, trends and concentrations, significant compliance matters, and provides guidance on the steps to monitor, control and report major risks. In addition, the Asset Liability Committee, chaired by our Chief Financial Officer, is responsible for managing our capital, funding and liquidity, investment, market risk and asset/liability activities in accordance with our policies and in compliance with applicable regulatory requirements.As defined in the ERM policy, we follow the “three lines of defense” approach to risk management. The first line of defense comprises functions and management committees directly initiating risk taking. The Chief Executive Officer, business unit presidents and the Chief Financial Officer are part of the first line of defense. The second line comprises independent functions overseeing risk-taking activities of the first line. The Chief Risk Officer, the Chief Compliance & Ethics Officer, the Chief Operational Risk Officer and certain control groups, both at the enterprise level and within regulated entities, are part of the second line of defense. The global risk oversight team oversees the policies, strategies, frameworks, models, processes and capabilities deployed by the first line teams and provides challenges and independent assessments on how the first line of defense is managing risks. Our Internal Audit Group constitutes the third line of defense and provides independent assessments and effective challenge of the first and second lines of defense.CREDIT RISK MANAGEMENT PROCESSCredit risk is defined as loss due to obligor or counterparty default or changes in the credit quality of a counterparty or security. Our credit risks are divided into two broad categories: individual and institutional. Each has distinct risk management capabilities, strategies, and tools. Business units that create individual or institutional credit risk exposures of significant importance are supported by dedicated risk management teams, each led by a Chief Credit Officer.INDIVIDUAL CREDIT RISKIndividual credit risk arises from consumer and small business charge cards, credit cards, and term loans. These portfolios consist of millions of customers across multiple geographies, industries and levels of net worth. We benefit from the high-quality profile of our customers, which is driven by our brand, premium customer servicing, product features and risk management capabilities, which span underwriting, customer management and collections. The risk in these portfolios is generally correlated to broad economic trends, such as unemployment rates and GDP growth.The business unit leaders and their Chief Credit Officers take the lead in managing the credit risk process. These Chief Credit Officers are guided by the Individual Credit Risk Committee (ICRC), which is responsible for implementation and enforcement of the Individual Credit Risk Management Policy. The ICRC ensures compliance with ERMC guidelines and procedures and escalates to the ERMC as appropriate. Credit risk management is supported by sophisticated proprietary scoring and decision-making models that use up-to-date information on prospects and customers, such as spending and payment history and data feeds from credit bureaus. We have developed data-driven economic decision logic for customer interactions to better serve our customers.INSTITUTIONAL CREDIT RISKInstitutional credit risk arises principally within our GCS and GMNS businesses, as well as investment and liquidity management activities. Unlike individual credit risk, institutional credit risk is characterized by a lower loss frequency but higher severity. It is affected both by general economic conditions and by client-specific events. The absence of large losses in any given year or over several years is not necessarily representative of the level of risk of institutional portfolios, given the infrequency of loss events in such portfolios.Similar to individual credit risk, business units taking institutional credit risks are supported by Chief Credit Officers. These officers are guided by the Institutional Risk Management Committee (IRMC), which is responsible for implementation and enforcement of the Institutional Credit Risk Management Policy and for providing guidance to the credit officers of each business unit with substantial institutional credit risk exposures. The committee, along with the business unit Chief Credit Officers, makes investment decisions in core risk capabilities, ensures proper implementation of the underwriting standards and contractual rights for risk mitigation, monitors risk exposures, and determines risk mitigation actions. The IRMC formally reviews large institutional risk exposures to ensure compliance with ERMC guidelines and procedures and escalates them to the ERMC as appropriate. At the same time, the IRMC provides guidance to the business unit risk management teams to optimize risk-adjusted returns on capital. A centralized risk rating unit provides risk assessment of our institutional obligors.73Table of ContentsExposure to the Airline and Travel IndustryWe have multiple important cobrand, rewards, merchant acceptance and corporate payments arrangements with airlines. The ERM program evaluates the risks posed by our airline partners and the overall airline strategy company-wide through comprehensive business analysis of global airlines, and the travel industry more broadly, including cruise lines, travel agencies and tour operators. Our largest airline partner is Delta, and this relationship includes an exclusive cobrand credit card partnership and other arrangements including Membership Rewards redemption, merchant acceptance, travel and corporate payments. See ""We face intense competition for partner relationships, which could result in a loss or renegotiation of these arrangements that could have a material adverse impact on our business and results of operations"" and ""Arrangements with our business partners represent a significant portion of our business. We are exposed to risks associated with our business partners, including reputational issues, business slowdowns, bankruptcies, liquidations, restructurings and consolidations, and the possible obligation to make payments to our partners"" under “Risk Factors” for additional information.Debt ExposureAs part of our ongoing risk management process, we monitor our financial exposure to both sovereign and non-sovereign customers and counterparties, and measure and manage concentrations of risk by geographic regions, as well as by economic sectors and industries. A primary focus area for monitoring is credit deterioration due to weaknesses in economic and fiscal profiles. We evaluate countries based on the market assessment of the riskiness of their sovereign debt and our assessment of the economic and financial outlook and closely monitor those deemed high risk. As of December 31, 2020, we considered our gross credit exposures to government entities, financial institutions and corporations in those countries deemed high risk to be individually and collectively not material.OPERATIONAL RISK MANAGEMENT PROCESSWe consider operational risk to be the risk of loss due to, among other things, inadequate or failed processes, people or information systems, or impacts from the external environment, including failures to comply with laws and regulations as well as impacts from relationships with third parties. Operational risk is inherent in all business activities and can impact an organization through direct or indirect financial loss, brand damage, customer dissatisfaction, or legal and regulatory penalties.To appropriately measure and manage operational risk, we have implemented a comprehensive operational risk framework that is defined in the Operational Risk Management Policy approved by the Risk Committee. The Operational Risk Management Committee (ORMC), chaired by the Chief Operational Risk Officer, coordinates with all control groups on effective risk assessments and controls and oversees the preventive, responsive and mitigation efforts by Operational Excellence teams in the business units and staff groups.We use the operational risk framework to identify, measure, monitor and report inherent and emerging operational risks. This framework, supervised by the ORMC, consists of (a) operational risk event capture, (b) a project office to coordinate issue management and control enhancements, (c) key risk indicators, and (d) process and entity-level risk assessments.The framework requires the assessment of operational risk events to determine root causes, impact to customers and/or us, and resolution plan accountability to correct any defect, remediate customers, and enhance controls and testing to mitigate future issues. The impact is assessed from an operational, financial, brand, regulatory compliance and legal perspective.74Table of ContentsINFORMATION AND CYBER SECURITYWe define information and cyber security risk as the risk that a security incident could impact the confidentiality, integrity or availability of American Express customer, colleague or proprietary information.Our information and cyber security program is designed to protect the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of information and information systems from unauthorized access, use, disclosure, disruption, modification, or destruction. The program is built upon a foundation of advanced security technology, a well-staffed and highly trained team of experts, and robust operations based on the National Institute of Standards and Technology Cybersecurity Framework. This consists of controls designed to identify, protect, detect, respond and recover from information and cyber security incidents. We continue to invest in enhancements to cyber security capabilities and engage in industry and government forums to promote advancements to the broader financial services cyber security ecosystem.See “A major information or cyber security incident or an increase in fraudulent activity could lead to reputational damage to our brand and material legal, regulatory and financial exposure, and could reduce the use and acceptance of our cards” under “Risk Factors” for additional information.75Table of ContentsINFORMATION TECHNOLOGYWe define information technology risk as the risk that events or circumstances could compromise the processing, stability, capacity, performance, or resilience of information technology and cause financial, reputational, and/or regulatory impacts.We manage information technology risk through our policies, procedures, governance structure, and control framework to preserve the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of systems and processes across the Company.See “The uninterrupted operation of our information systems is critical to our success and a significant disruption could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations” under “Risk Factors” for additional information.PRIVACY We define privacy risk as the risk of financial loss, reputational damage, or regulatory or legal action resulting from decisions related to the violation of applicable laws, rules, regulations, contractual obligations, or the non-adherence to privacy policies, disclosures, or standards that apply to the processing of personal data.The Global Privacy Policy establishes the privacy framework and defines the American Express Data Protection & Privacy Principles, which governs the way we collect, use, store, share, transmit, delete or otherwise process our customer and colleague personal data globally. Chaired by the Chief Privacy Officer, the Privacy Risk Management Committee, a sub-committee of the ORMC, provides oversight and governance for our privacy program.DATA MANAGEMENT AND GOVERNANCEWe define data management and governance risk as the risk of inadequate data governance and/or data management practices adversely impacting the accuracy, completeness, timeliness, comprehensiveness or usability of data within or throughout its lifecycle. Our Enterprise Data Governance Policy establishes the framework and requirements for defining in-scope critical data and outlining the elements for managing data as a critical corporate asset. This policy is approved by the ERMC. Chaired by the Chief Data Officer, our Enterprise Data Committee, a sub-committee of the ERMC, provides governance and oversight for our enterprise-wide data governance and management activities. The committee is responsible for overseeing the standards and procedures, governance structure and oversight framework, which includes independent assessments and validations, monitoring and reporting of data governance and management-related issues and concerns.COMPLIANCE RISK MANAGEMENT PROCESSWe define compliance risk as the risk of legal or reputational harm, fines, monetary penalties and payment of damages or other forms of sanction as a result of non-compliance with applicable laws and/or regulations, internal policies and procedures and related practices, or ethical standards.We view our ability to effectively mitigate compliance risk as an important aspect of our business model. Our Global Compliance and Ethics organization is responsible for establishing and maintaining our corporate-wide Compliance Risk Management Program. Pursuant to this program, we seek to manage and mitigate compliance risk by assessing, controlling, monitoring, measuring and reporting the legal and regulatory risks to which we are exposed. The Compliance Risk Management Committee (CRMC), chaired by the Chief Compliance and Ethics Officer, is responsible for identifying, evaluating, managing, and escalating compliance risks. The CRMC has a dual reporting relationship directly to both the ERMC and the Audit and Compliance Committee.We have a comprehensive Anti-Money Laundering program that monitors and reports suspicious activity to the appropriate government authorities. As part of that program, the Global Risk Oversight team provides independent risk assessment of the rules used by the Anti-Money Laundering team. In addition, the Internal Audit Group reviews the processes for practices consistent with regulatory guidance.76Table of ContentsREPUTATIONAL RISK MANAGEMENT PROCESSWe define reputational risk as the risk that negative stakeholder reaction to our products, services, client and partner relationships, business activities and policies, management and workplace culture, or our response to unexpected events, could cause sustained critical media coverage, a decline in revenue or investment, talent attrition, litigation, or government or regulatory scrutiny.We view protecting our reputation for excellent customer service, trust, security and high integrity as core to our vision of providing the world’s best customer experience and fundamental to our long-term success.Our business leaders are responsible for considering the reputational risk implications of business activities and strategies and ensuring the relevant subject matter experts are engaged as needed. The ERMC is responsible for ensuring reputational risk considerations are included in the scope of appropriate subordinate risk policies and committees and properly reflected in all decisions escalated to the ERMC.MARKET RISK MANAGEMENT PROCESSMarket risk is the risk to earnings or asset and liability values resulting from movements in market prices. Our market risk exposures include interest rate risk and foreign exchange risk. Interest rate risk is driven by the relationship between interest rates on assets (such as loans, receivables and investment securities) and interest rates on liabilities (such as debt and deposits). Foreign exchange risk arises from transactions, funding, investments and earnings in currencies other than the U.S. dollar.Our risk policies establish the framework that guides and governs market risk management, including quantitative limits and escalation triggers. These policies are approved by the ERMC, Asset Liability Committee or Market Risk Management Committee.Market risk is managed by the Market Risk Management Committee. The Market Risk Oversight Officer provides an independent risk assessment and oversight over the policies and exposure management for market risk and Asset Liability Management activities, as well as overseeing compliance with associated regulatory requirements. Market risk management is also guided and governed by policies covering the use of derivative financial instruments, funding, liquidity and investments.Interest Rate RiskWe analyze a variety of interest rate scenarios to inform us of the potential impacts from interest rate changes on earnings and the value of assets, liabilities and the economic value of equity. Our interest rate exposure can vary over time as a result of, among other things, the proportion of our total funding provided by variable and fixed-rate debt and deposits compared to our Card Member loans and receivables. Interest rate swaps are used from time to time to effectively convert debt issuances to variable-rate from fixed-rate, or vice versa. Refer to Note 13 to the “Consolidated Financial Statements” for further discussion of our derivative financial instruments.In 2020, the composition of our balance sheet shifted substantially. There was a substantial net reduction in total fixed-rate assets within Card Member loans and Card Member receivables and an increase in certain floating-rate assets such as Cash and cash equivalents. As of December 31, 2020, a hypothetical immediate 100 basis point increase in market interest rates would have a detrimental impact of approximately $113 million on our annual net interest income. A hypothetical immediate 100 basis point decrease in market interest rates, which are assumed to remain at or above zero percent, would have a smaller but still detrimental impact on our annual net interest income. This measure first projects net interest income over the following twelve-month time horizon considering forecasted business growth and anticipated future market interest rates. The detrimental impact from rate changes is then measured by instantaneously increasing or decreasing the anticipated future interest rates by 100 basis points. Our estimated repricing risk assumes that our interest-rate sensitive assets and liabilities that reprice within the twelve-month horizon generally reprice by the same magnitude as benchmark rate changes. It is further assumed that, within our interest-rate sensitive liabilities, certain deposits reprice at lower magnitudes than benchmark rate movements, and the magnitude of this repricing in turn depends on, among other factors, the direction of rate movements. These assumptions are consistent with historical deposit repricing experience in the industry and within our own portfolio. Actual changes in our net interest income will depend on many factors, and therefore may differ from our estimated risk to changes in market interest rates. 77Table of ContentsLIBOR TransitionDue to uncertainty surrounding the suitability and sustainability of LIBOR, central banks and global regulators have called for financial market participants to prepare for the discontinuance of LIBOR and the establishment of alternative reference rates.We have financial instruments and commercial agreements that will be impacted by the discontinuance of LIBOR, including floating rate debt and equity instruments, derivatives, borrowings and other contracts. We have established an enterprise-wide, cross-functional initiative to identify, assess and monitor risks associated with LIBOR, engage with the industry participants and regulators and to transition to new alternative reference rates. As part of this initiative, we are updating our operational processes, IT systems and models for a timely transition.See “The discontinuance of LIBOR may negatively impact our access to funding and the value of our financial instruments and commercial agreements” under “Risk Factors” for additional information.Foreign Exchange RiskForeign exchange exposures arise in four principal ways: (1) Card Member spending in currencies that are not the billing currency, (2) cross-currency transactions and balances from our funding activities, (3) cross-currency investing activities, such as in the equity of foreign subsidiaries, and (4) revenues generated and expenses incurred in foreign currencies, which impact earnings.These foreign exchange risks are managed primarily by entering into foreign exchange spot transactions or hedged with foreign exchange forward contracts when the hedge costs are economically justified and in notional amounts designed to offset pretax impacts from currency movements in the period in which they occur. As of December 31, 2020, foreign currency derivative instruments with total notional amounts of approximately $26 billion were outstanding.With respect to Card Member spending and cross-currency transactions, including related foreign exchange forward contracts outstanding, the impact of a hypothetical 10 percent strengthening of the U.S. dollar would have been immaterial to projected earnings as of December 31, 2020. With respect to translation exposure of foreign subsidiary equity balances, including related foreign exchange forward contracts outstanding, a hypothetical 10 percent strengthening of the U.S. dollar would result in an immaterial reduction in other comprehensive income and equity as of December 31, 2020. With respect to anticipated earnings denominated in foreign currencies for the next twelve months, the adverse impact on pretax income of a hypothetical 10 percent strengthening of the U.S. dollar would be approximately $33 million as of December 31, 2020. To a much lesser extent, we are also subject to market risk arising from activities conducted by our Foreign Exchange International Payments business. We aim to minimize market risk from these activities through hedging, where appropriate, and the establishment of limits.The actual impact of interest rate and foreign exchange rate changes will depend on, among other factors, the timing of rate changes, the extent to which different rates do not move in the same direction or in the same direction to the same degree, changes in the cost, volume and mix of our hedging activities and changes in the volume and mix of our businesses.FUNDING & LIQUIDITY RISK MANAGEMENT PROCESSFunding and liquidity risk is defined as our inability to meet our ongoing financial and business obligations as they become due at a reasonable cost.Our Board-approved Liquidity Risk Policy establishes the framework that guides and governs liquidity risk management.Funding and Liquidity risk is managed by the Funding and Liquidity Committee. In addition, the Market Risk Oversight Officer provides independent oversight of liquidity risk management. We manage liquidity risk by maintaining access to a diverse set of cash, readily-marketable securities and contingent sources of liquidity, such that we can continuously meet our business requirements and expected future financing obligations for at least a twelve-month period in the event we are unable to raise new funds under our regular funding programs during a substantial weakening in economic conditions. We consider the trade-offs between maintaining too much liquidity, which can be costly and limit financial flexibility, and having inadequate liquidity, which may result in financial distress during a liquidity event.Funding and Liquidity risk is managed at an aggregate consolidated level as well as at certain subsidiaries in order to ensure that sufficient and accessible liquidity resources are maintained. The Funding and Liquidity Committee reviews forecasts of our aggregate and subsidiary cash positions and financing requirements, approves funding plans designed to satisfy those requirements under normal and stressed conditions, establishes guidelines to identify the amount of liquidity resources required and monitors positions and determines any actions to be taken.78Table of ContentsMODEL RISK MANAGEMENT PROCESSWe define model risk as the risk of adverse consequences, such as financial loss, poor business and strategic decision making, or damage to our reputation, from decisions based on incorrect or misused model outputs and reports.We manage model risk through a comprehensive model governance framework, including policies and procedures for model development, independent model validation and change management capabilities that seek to minimize erroneous model methodology, outputs and misuse. We also assess model performance on an ongoing basis.We utilize artificial intelligence and machine Learning (AI/ML) approaches for a variety of business use cases. We perform extensive reviews and testing to reduce the risk that these AI/ML techniques do not perform as intended.STRATEGIC AND BUSINESS RISK MANAGEMENT PROCESSStrategic and business risk is the risk related to our inability to achieve our business objectives due to poor strategic decisions, including decisions related to mergers, acquisitions, and divestitures, poor implementation of strategic decisions or declining demand for our products and services.Strategic decisions are reviewed and approved by business leaders and various committees and must be aligned with company policies. We seek to manage strategic and business risks through risk controls embedded in these processes as well as overall risk management oversight over business goals. Existing product performance is reviewed periodically by committees and business leaders. Mergers, acquisitions and divestitures can only be approved following Executive Committee due diligence, a comprehensive risk assessment by operational, market, credit and oversight leaders provided to the Chief Risk Officer and approval by either the Chief Risk Officer or appropriate risk committees. All new products and material changes in business processes are reviewed and approved by the New Products Committee and appropriate credit or risk committees.COUNTRY RISK MANAGEMENT PROCESSCountry risk is defined as the risk that economic, social, and/or political conditions and events in a country might adversely impact us, primarily as a result of greater credit losses, increased operational or market risk or the inability to repatriate capital.We manage country risk as part of the normal course of business. Policies and procedures establish country risk escalation thresholds to control and limit exposure, driven by processes that enable the monitoring of conditions in countries where we have exposure.79Table of ContentsCRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATESRefer to Note 1 to the “Consolidated Financial Statements” for a summary of our significant accounting policies. Certain of our accounting policies requiring significant management assumptions and judgments are as follows:RESERVES FOR CARD MEMBER CREDIT LOSSESReserves for Card Member credit losses represent our best estimate of the expected credit losses in our outstanding portfolio of Card Member loans and receivables as of the balance sheet date. The CECL methodology, which became effective January 1, 2020, requires us to estimate lifetime expected credit losses by incorporating historical loss experience and current and future economic conditions over a reasonable and supportable period (R&S Period) beyond the balance sheet date.In estimating expected credit losses, we use a combination of statistically based models and analysis of the results produced by these models to determine the quantitative and qualitative components of our total balance sheet reserves for credit losses. These quantitative and qualitative components entail a significant amount of judgment. The primary areas of judgment used in measuring the quantitative components of our reserves relate to the determination of the appropriate R&S Period, the modeling of the probability of and exposure at default, and the methodology to incorporate current and future economic conditions. We use these models and assumptions, combined with historical loss experience, to determine the reserve rates that are applied to the outstanding loan or receivable balances to produce our reserves for expected credit losses for the R&S Period. The qualitative component is intended to capture expected losses that may not have been fully captured in the quantitative component. Through an established governance structure, we consider certain external and internal factors, including emerging portfolio characteristics and trends, which consequentially may increase or decrease the reserves for Card Member credit losses.The R&S Period, which is approximately three years, represents the maximum time-period beyond the balance sheet date over which we can reasonably estimate expected credit losses, using all available portfolio information, current economic conditions and forecasts of future economic conditions. Card Member loan products do not have a contractual term and balances can revolve if minimum required payments are made, causing some balances to remain outstanding beyond the R&S Period. To determine expected credit losses beyond the R&S Period, we immediately revert to long-term average loss rates. Card Member receivable products are contractually required to be paid in full; therefore, we have assumed the balances will be either paid or written-off within the R&S Period.Within the R&S Period, our models use past loss experience and current and future economic conditions to estimate the probability of default, exposure at default and expected recoveries to estimate net losses at default. A significant area of judgment relates to how we apply future Card Member payments to the reporting period balances when determining the exposure at default. The nature of revolving loan products inherently includes a relationship between future payments and spend behavior, which creates complexity in the application of how future payments are either partially or entirely attributable to the existing balance at the end of the reporting period. Using historical customer behavior and other factors, we have assumed that future payments are first allocated to interest and fees associated with the reporting period balance and future spend. We then allocate a portion of the payment to the estimated higher minimum payment amount due because of any future spend. Any remaining portion of the future payment is then allocated to the remaining reporting period balance.CECL requires that the R&S Period include an assumption about current and future economic conditions. We incorporate multiple macroeconomic scenarios obtained from an independent third party. The estimated credit losses calculated from each macroeconomic scenario are reviewed and weighted to reflect management's judgment about uncertainty around the scenarios. These macroeconomic scenarios contain certain variables, including unemployment rates and real GDP, that are significant to our models. 80Table of ContentsMacroeconomic SensitivityTo demonstrate the sensitivity of estimated credit losses to the macroeconomic scenarios, we compared our modeled estimates under a baseline scenario to that under a pessimistic downside scenario. For every 10 percentage points change in weighting from the baseline scenario to the pessimistic downside scenario, the estimated credit losses increased by approximately $200 million.The modeled estimates under these scenarios were influenced by the duration, severity and timing of changes in economic variables within each scenario and these macroeconomic scenarios, under different conditions or using different assumptions, could result in significantly different estimated credit losses. It is difficult to estimate how potential changes in specific factors might affect the estimated credit losses, and current results may not be indicative of the potential future impact of macroeconomic forecast changes.In addition, this sensitivity analysis relates only to the modeled credit loss estimates under two scenarios without considering management’s judgment on the relative weighting for those and other scenarios, including the weight that has been placed on downside scenarios at the balance sheet date, or any potential changes in other adjustments to the quantitative reserve component or the impact of management judgment for the qualitative reserve component, which may have a positive or negative effect on the results. Thus, the results of this sensitivity analysis are hypothetical and are not intended to estimate or reflect our expectations of any changes in the overall reserves for credit losses due to changes in the macroeconomic environment.The following table reflects the range of key variables in the macroeconomic scenarios utilized for the computation of Reserves for Card Member credit losses as of December 31, 2020:December 31, 2020U.S. Unemployment RateFourth quarter of 20207%First quarter of 20217% - 8%Fourth quarter of 20217% - 11%Fourth quarter of 20226% - 12%U.S. GDP Growth (Contraction) (a)Fourth quarter of 20203%First quarter of 20214% - (5%)Fourth quarter of 20216% - (2%)Fourth quarter of 20224% - 3%(a)Real GDP quarter over quarter percentage change seasonally adjusted to annualized rates. Refer to ""Business Environment"" and Table 3 in MD&A and Note 1 and Note 3 to the ""Consolidated Financial Statements"" for a further description of the impact of CECL, both at implementation and for the year ended December 31, 2020.The process of estimating these reserves requires a high degree of judgment. To the extent our expected credit loss models are not indicative of future performance, actual losses could differ significantly from our judgments and expectations, resulting in either higher or lower future provisions for credit losses in any period.81Table of ContentsLIABILITY FOR MEMBERSHIP REWARDSThe Membership Rewards program is our largest card-based rewards program. Card Members can earn points for purchases charged on their enrolled card products. A significant portion of our cards, by their terms, allow Card Members to earn bonus points for purchases at merchants in particular industry categories. Membership Rewards points are redeemable for a broad variety of rewards, including travel, shopping, gift cards, and covering eligible charges. Points typically do not expire, and there is no limit on the number of points a Card Member may earn. Membership Rewards expense is driven by charge volume on enrolled cards, customer participation in the program and contractual arrangements with redemption partners.We record a Membership Rewards liability that represents the estimated cost of points earned that are expected to be redeemed by Card Members in the future. The Membership Rewards liability is impacted over time by enrollment levels, attrition, the volume of points earned and redeemed, and the associated redemption costs. We estimate the Membership Rewards liability by determining the URR and the WAC per point, which are applied to the points of current enrollees. Refer to Note 9 to the “Consolidated Financial Statements” for additional information.The URR assumption is used to estimate the number of points earned by current enrollees that will ultimately be redeemed in future periods. We use statistical and actuarial models to estimate the URR of points earned to date by current Card Members based on redemption trends, card product type, enrollment tenure, card spend levels and credit attributes. The WAC per point assumption is used to estimate future redemption costs and is primarily based on redemption choices made by Card Members, reward offerings by partners, and Membership Rewards program changes. The WAC per point assumption is derived from 12 months of redemptions and is adjusted as appropriate for certain changes in redemption costs that are not representative of future cost expectations and expected developments in redemption patterns.We periodically evaluate our liability estimation process and assumptions based on developments in redemption patterns, cost per point redeemed, partner contract changes and other factors.The process of estimating the Membership Rewards liability includes a high degree of judgment. Actual redemptions and associated redemption costs could differ significantly from our estimates, resulting in either higher or lower Membership Rewards expense.Changes in the Membership Rewards URR and WAC per point have the effect of either increasing or decreasing the liability through the current period Membership Rewards expense by an amount estimated to cover the cost of all points previously earned but not yet redeemed by current enrollees as of the end of the reporting period. As of December 31, 2020, an increase in the estimated URR of current enrollees of 25 basis points would increase the Membership Rewards liability and corresponding rewards expense by approximately $128 million. Similarly, an increase in the WAC per point of 1 basis point would increase the Membership Rewards liability and corresponding rewards expense by approximately $141 million.GOODWILL RECOVERABILITYGoodwill represents the excess of acquisition cost of an acquired business over the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed. Goodwill is not amortized but is tested for impairment at the reporting unit level annually or when events or circumstances arise, such as adverse changes in the business climate, that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of the reporting unit below its carrying value. Our methodology for conducting this goodwill impairment testing contains both a qualitative and quantitative assessment.We have the option to initially perform an assessment of qualitative factors in order to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount. The qualitative factors may include, but are not limited to, economic conditions, industry and market considerations, cost factors, overall financial performance of the reporting unit and other company and reporting unit-specific events. If we determine that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, we then perform the impairment evaluation using a more detailed quantitative assessment. We could also directly perform this quantitative assessment for any reporting unit, bypassing the qualitative assessment.Our methodology for conducting the quantitative goodwill impairment testing is fundamentally based on the measurement of fair value for our reporting units, which inherently entails the use of significant management judgment. For valuation, we use a combination of the income approach (discounted cash flows) and market approach (market multiples) in estimating the fair value of our reporting units.82Table of ContentsWhen preparing discounted cash flow models under the income approach, we estimate future cash flows using the reporting unit’s internal multi-year forecast, and a terminal value calculated using a growth rate that we believe is appropriate in light of current and expected future economic conditions. To discount these cash flows we use our expected cost of equity, determined using a capital asset pricing model. When using the market method under the market approach, we apply comparable publicly traded companies’ multiples (e.g., earnings, revenues) to our reporting units’ actual results. The judgment in estimating forecasted cash flows, discount rates and market comparables is significant, and imprecision could materially affect the fair value of our reporting units.We could be exposed to an increased risk of further goodwill impairment if future operating results or macroeconomic conditions differ significantly from management’s current assumptions.INCOME TAXESWe are subject to the income tax laws of the United States, its states and municipalities and those of the foreign jurisdictions in which we operate. These tax laws are complex, and the manner in which they apply to the taxpayer’s facts is sometimes open to interpretation. In establishing a provision for income tax expense, we must make judgments about the application of inherently complex tax laws.Unrecognized Tax BenefitsWe establish a liability for unrecognized tax benefits, which are the differences between a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return and the benefit recognized in the financial statements.In establishing a liability for an unrecognized tax benefit, assumptions may be made in determining whether, and the extent to which, a tax position should be sustained. A tax position is recognized only when it is more likely than not to be sustained upon examination by the relevant taxing authority, based on its technical merits. The amount of tax benefit recognized is the largest benefit that we believe is more likely than not to be realized on ultimate settlement. As new information becomes available, we evaluate our tax positions and adjust our unrecognized tax benefits, as appropriate.Tax benefits ultimately realized can differ from amounts previously recognized due to uncertainties, with any such differences generally impacting the provision for income tax.Deferred Tax Asset RealizationDeferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the differences between the financial statement and tax bases of assets and liabilities using the enacted tax rates expected to be in effect for the years in which the differences are expected to reverse.Since deferred taxes measure the future tax effects of items recognized in the Consolidated Financial Statements, certain estimates and assumptions are required to determine whether it is more likely than not that all or some portion of the benefit of a deferred tax asset will not be realized. In making this assessment, we analyze and estimate the impact of future taxable income, reversing temporary differences and available tax planning strategies. These assessments are performed quarterly, taking into account any new information.Changes in facts or circumstances can lead to changes in the ultimate realization of deferred tax assets due to uncertainties.83Table of ContentsOTHER MATTERSRECENTLY ISSUED ACCOUNTING STANDARDSRefer to the Recently Issued and Adopted Accounting Standards section of Note 1 to the “Consolidated Financial Statements.”GLOSSARY OF SELECTED TERMINOLOGYAdjusted net interest income — A non-GAAP measure that represents net interest income attributable to our Card Member loans (which includes, on a GAAP basis, interest that is deemed uncollectible), excluding the impact of interest expense and interest income not attributable to our Card Member loans. Airline-related volume — Represents spend at airlines as a merchant.Asset securitizations — Asset securitization involves the transfer and sale of loans or receivables to a special-purpose entity created for the securitization activity, typically a trust. The trust, in turn, issues securities, commonly referred to as asset-backed securities, that are secured by the transferred loans and receivables. The trust uses the proceeds from the sale of such securities to pay the purchase price for the transferred loans or receivables. The securitized loans and receivables of our Lending Trust and Charge Trust (collectively, the Trusts) are reported as assets and the securities issued by the Trusts are reported as liabilities on our Consolidated Balance Sheets.Average discount rate — This calculation is generally designed to reflect the average pricing at all merchants accepting American Express cards and represents the percentage of proprietary and GNS billed business retained by us from merchants we acquire, or from merchants acquired by third parties on our behalf, net of amounts retained by such third parties. The average discount rate, together with billed business, drive our discount revenue.Billed business — Represents transaction volumes (including cash advances) on cards and other payment products issued by American Express (proprietary billed business) and cards issued under network partnership agreements with banks and other institutions, including joint ventures (GNS billed business). In-store spending activity within GNS retail cobrand portfolios, from which we earn no revenue, is not included in billed business. Billed business is reported as inside the United States or outside the United States based on the location of the issuer. Billed business, together with the average discount rate, drive our discount revenue.Capital ratios — Represents the minimum standards established by regulatory agencies as a measure to determine whether the regulated entity has sufficient capital to absorb on- and off-balance sheet losses beyond current loss accrual estimates. Refer to the Capital Strategy section under “Consolidated Capital Resources and Liquidity” for further related definitions under Basel III.Cards-in-force — Represents the number of cards that are issued and outstanding by American Express (proprietary cards-in-force) and cards issued and outstanding under network partnership agreements with banks and other institutions, including joint ventures (GNS cards-in-force), except for GNS retail cobrand cards that had no out-of-store spending activity during the prior twelve months. Basic cards-in-force excludes supplemental cards issued on consumer accounts. Cards-in-force is useful in understanding the size of our Card Member base.Card Member — The individual holder of an issued American Express-branded card.Card Member loans — Represents the outstanding amount due from Card Members for charges made on their American Express credit cards, as well as any interest charges and card-related fees. Card Member loans also include revolving balances on certain American Express charge card products.Card Member receivables — Represents the outstanding amount due from Card Members for charges made on their American Express charge cards, as well as any card-related fees, other than revolving balances on certain American Express charge cards with Pay Over Time features. Such revolving balances are included within Card Member loans.Charge cards — Represents cards that generally carry no pre-set spending limits and are primarily designed as a method of payment and not as a means of financing purchases. Charge Card Members generally must pay the full amount billed each month. No finance charges are assessed on charge cards. Each charge card transaction is authorized based on its likely economics reflecting a Card Member’s most recent credit information and spend patterns. Some charge cards have additional Pay Over Time feature(s) that allow revolving of certain charges.84Table of ContentsCobrand cards — Cards issued under cobrand agreements with selected commercial partners. Pursuant to the cobrand agreements, we make payments to our cobrand partners, which can be significant, based primarily on the amount of Card Member spending and corresponding rewards earned on such spending and, under certain arrangements, on the number of accounts acquired and retained. The partner is then liable for providing rewards to the Card Member under the cobrand partner’s own loyalty program.Credit cards — Represents cards that have a range of revolving payment terms, grace periods, and rate and fee structures.Discount revenue — Primarily represents the amount earned on transactions occurring at merchants that have entered into a card acceptance agreement with us, a GNS partner or other third-party merchant acquirer, for facilitating transactions between the merchants and Card Members. Interest expense — Includes interest incurred primarily to fund Card Member loans and receivables, general corporate purposes and liquidity needs. Interest expense is divided principally into two categories: (i) deposits, which primarily relates to interest expense on deposits taken from customers and institutions, and (ii) debt, which primarily relates to interest expense on our long-term financing and short-term borrowings, (e.g., commercial paper, federal funds purchased, bank overdrafts and other short-term borrowings), as well as the realized impact of derivatives hedging interest rate risk on our long-term debt.Interest income — Includes (i) interest on loans, (ii) interest and dividends on investment securities and (iii) interest income on deposits with banks and other.Interest on loans — Assessed using the average daily balance method for Card Member loans. Unless the loan is classified as non-accrual, interest is recognized based upon the principal amount outstanding in accordance with the terms of the applicable account agreement until the outstanding balance is paid or written off.Interest and dividends on investment securities — Primarily relates to our performing fixed-income securities. Interest income is recognized using the effective interest method, which adjusts the yield for security premiums and discounts, fees and other payments, so a constant rate of return is recognized on the outstanding balance of the related investment security throughout its term. Amounts are recognized until securities are in default or when it is likely that future interest payments will not be made as scheduled.Interest income on deposits with banks and other — Primarily relates to the placement of cash in excess of near-term funding requirements in interest-bearing time deposits, overnight sweep accounts, and other interest-bearing demand and call accounts.Loyalty Coalitions — Programs that enable consumers to earn rewards points and use them to save on purchases from a variety of participating merchants through multi-category rewards platforms. Merchants in these programs generally fund the consumer offers and are responsible to us for the cost of rewards points; we earn revenue from operating the loyalty platform and by providing marketing support.Net card fees — Represents the card membership fees earned during the period recognized as revenue over the covered card membership period (typically one year), net of the provision for projected refunds for Card Membership cancellation and deferred acquisition costs.Net interest yield on average Card Member loans — A non-GAAP measure that is computed by dividing adjusted net interest income by average Card Member loans, computed on an annualized basis. Reserves and net write-offs related to uncollectible interest are recorded through provision for credit losses and are thus not included in the net interest yield calculation.Net write-off rate — principal only — Represents the amount of proprietary consumer or small business Card Member loans or receivables written off, consisting of principal (resulting from authorized transactions), less recoveries, as a percentage of the average loan or receivable balance during the period.Net write-off rate — principal, interest and fees — Includes, in the calculation of the net write-off rate, amounts for interest and fees in addition to principal for Card Member loans, and fees in addition to principal for Card Member receivables.Operating expenses — Represents salaries and employee benefits, professional services, occupancy and equipment, and other expenses.85Table of ContentsReserve build (release) — Represents the portion of the provisions for credit losses for the period related to increasing or decreasing reserves for credit losses as a result of, among other things, changes in volumes, macroeconomic outlook, portfolio composition and credit quality of portfolios. Reserve build represents the amount by which the provision for credit losses exceeds net write-offs, while reserve release represents the amount by which net write-offs exceed the provision for credit losses.Return on average equity — Calculated by dividing one-year period net income by one-year average total shareholders’ equity.T&E-related volume — Represents spend on travel and entertainment, which primarily includes airline, cruise, lodging and dining merchant categories. Non-T&E-related volume includes spend in all other merchant categories.86Table of ContentsCAUTIONARY NOTE REGARDING FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTSThis report includes forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, which are subject to risks and uncertainties.

Factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from these forward-looking statements, include, but are not limited to, the following:•our ability to rebuild growth momentum and improve our financial performance to pre-pandemic levels, which will depend in part on a recovery in consumer travel and therefore on how soon lockdowns ease, travel restrictions lift and the general public begins to feel comfortable traveling again; discount revenue recovering broadly in-line with billed business; credit performance and reserve levels; identifying attractive investment opportunities that help rebuild growth momentum, product innovation and the pace at which we wind down our value injection efforts; our ability to control operating expenses and generate operating expense leverage; the effective tax rate remaining consistent with current expectations; and our ability to resume our share repurchase program; any of which could be impacted by, among other things, the factors identified in the subsequent paragraphs;•our ability to grow billed business, revenues and EPS, which could be impacted by, among other things, uncertainty regarding the continued spread of COVID-19 (including new variants) and severity of the pandemic and the availability, distribution and use of effective treatments and vaccines; a further deterioration in global economic and business conditions; consumer and business spending not growing in line with expectations, including T&E spending not rebounding to 2019 levels by the end of 2021; an inability or unwillingness of Card Members to pay amounts owed to us; insufficient governmental stimulus and relief programs to address the ongoing impact of the pandemic; prolonged measures to contain the spread of COVID-19 (including travel restrictions) or premature easing of such containment measures, both of which could further exacerbate the effects on business activity and our Card Members, partners and merchants; health concerns associated with the pandemic continuing to affect consumer behavior, spending levels and preferences, and travel patterns and demand even after government restrictions are lifted and economies reopen; our inability to effectively manage risk in an uncertain environment; market volatility, changes in capital and credit market conditions and the availability and cost of capital; issues impacting brand perceptions and our reputation; the amount and efficacy of investments in share, scale and relevance; an inability of business partners to meet their obligations to us and our customers due to slowdowns or disruptions in their businesses, bankruptcy or liquidation, or otherwise; the impact of any future contingencies, including, but not limited to, restructurings, impairments, changes in reserves, legal costs, the imposition of fines or civil money penalties and increases in Card Member reimbursements; and the impact of regulation and litigation, which could affect the profitability of our business activities, limit our ability to pursue business opportunities, require changes to business practices or alter our relationships with partners, merchants and Card Members;•future credit performance and the amount and timing of future credit reserve builds and releases, which will depend in part on changes in consumer behavior that affect loan and receivable balances (such as paydown and revolve rates) and delinquency and write-off rates; macroeconomic factors such as unemployment rates, GDP and the volume of bankruptcies; the impact of the CECL methodology; collections capabilities and recoveries of previously written-off loans and receivables; the enrollment in, and effectiveness of, hardship programs and troubled debt restructurings; the availability of government stimulus programs for borrowers; and governmental actions that provide forms of relief with respect to certain loans and fees, such as limiting debt collections efforts and encouraging or requiring extensions, modifications or forbearance;•net interest income and the growth rate of loans outstanding being higher or lower than current expectations, which will depend on the behavior of Card Members and their actual spending and borrowing patterns; our ability to effectively manage risk and enhance Card Member value propositions; changes in interest rates and our cost of funds; credit actions, including line size and other adjustments to credit availability; and the effectiveness of our strategies to capture a greater share of existing Card Members’ spending and borrowings, reduce Card Member attrition and attract new customers;•the actual amount we spend on marketing in the future, which will be based in part on continued changes in macroeconomic conditions and business performance; management’s identification and assessment of attractive investment opportunities and the receptivity of Card Members and prospective customers to advertising and customer acquisition initiatives; the pace at which we wind down our value injections efforts; our ability to balance expense control and investments in the business; and management’s ability to realize efficiencies and optimize investment spending;•the actual amount to be spent on Card Member rewards and services and business development, and the relationship of these variable customer engagement costs to revenues, which could be impacted by continued changes in macroeconomic conditions and Card Member behavior as it relates to their spending patterns (including the level of spend in bonus categories) and the redemption of rewards and offers (including travel redemptions); the costs related to reward point 87Table of Contentsredemptions; Card Members’ interest in the value propositions we offer; further enhancements to product benefits to make them attractive to Card Members, potentially in a manner that is not cost-effective; and new and renegotiated contractual obligations with business partners;•our ability to control our operating expenses and the actual amount we spend on operating expenses in the future, which could be impacted by, among other things, management’s decision to increase or decrease spending in such areas as technology, business and product development, sales force, premium servicing and digital capabilities depending on overall business performance; our ability to innovate efficient channels of customer interactions, such as chat supported by artificial intelligence; restructuring activity; fraud costs; information security or compliance expenses or consulting, legal and other professional services fees, including as a result of litigation or internal and regulatory reviews; the level of M&A activity and related expenses; the payment of civil money penalties, disgorgement, restitution, non-income tax assessments and litigation-related settlements; impairments of goodwill or other assets;

Refer to Note 1 to the “Consolidated Financial Statements” for further details.TOTAL REVENUES NET OF INTEREST EXPENSEDiscount revenue increased, primarily driven by an increase in worldwide network volumes of 24 percent, reflecting, in part, the recovery from the adverse impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic in the prior year. U.S. network volumes increased 27 percent and non-U.S. network volumes increased 17 percent. See Tables 5 and 6 for more details on volume performance.The increase in discount revenue was also driven by an increase in the average discount rate, primarily due to a change in the mix of spending driven by increased levels of T&E-related volumes, as compared to the prior year. The average discount rate was 2.30 percent and 2.28 percent for 2021 and 2020, respectively.Net card fees increased, primarily driven by growth in our premium card portfolios.Other fees and commissions increased, primarily due to higher travel commissions and fees from our consumer travel business and higher foreign exchange conversion revenue related to cross-border Card Member spending, both of which reflect the partial recovery of travel-related revenues in the current year.Other revenues increased, primarily driven by a non-cash gain related to an increase in GBT's total equity book value arising from GBT's acquisition of Egencia and a lower net loss in the current year from GBT as compared to the prior year.Interest income decreased, primarily due to a decline in the interest yield on average Card Member loans driven by higher paydown rates on revolving loan balances.Interest expense decreased, primarily driven by lower interest rates paid on deposits and a reduction in average debt.44Table of ContentsTABLE 3: PROVISIONS FOR CREDIT LOSSES SUMMARYYears Ended December 31,ChangeChange(Millions, except percentages)2021202020192021 vs. 20202020 vs. 2019Card Member receivablesNet write-offs$129 $881 $900 $(752)(85)%$(19)(2)%Reserve (release) build (a)(202)134 63 (336)#71 #Total(73)1,015 963 (1,088)#52 5 Card Member loansNet write-offs879 2,170 2,235 (1,291)(59)(65)(3)Reserve (release) build (a)(2,034)1,283 227 (3,317)#1,056 #Total(1,155)3,453 2,462 (4,608)#991 40 OtherNet write-offs — Other loans (b)21 111 98 (90)(81)13 13 Net write-offs — Other receivables (c)33 27 20 6 22 7 35 Reserve (release) build — Other loans (a)(b)(185)66 28 (251)#38 #Reserve (release) build — Other receivables (a)(c)(60)58 2 (118)#56 #Total(191)262 148 (453)#114 77 Total provisions for credit losses (d)$(1,419)$4,730 $3,573 $(6,149)#$1,157 32 %# Denotes a variance of 100 percent or more(a)Refer to the “Glossary of Selected Terminology” for a definition of reserve (release) build.(b)Relates to Other loans of $2.9 billion, $2.9 billion and $4.8 billion less reserves of $52 million, $238 million and $152 million, as of December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively.(c)Relates to Other receivables included in Other assets on the Consolidated Balance Sheets of $2.7 billion, $3.0 billion and $3.1 billion, less reserves of $25 million, $85 million and $27 million as of December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively.(d)Results for reporting periods beginning on and after January 1, 2020 are presented using the CECL methodology, while information as of and for the year ended December 31, 2019 continues to be reported in accordance with the incurred loss methodology then in effect. Refer to Note 1 and Note 3 to the “Consolidated Financial Statements” for further information. PROVISIONS FOR CREDIT LOSSESCard Member receivables and loans provisions for credit losses decreased and resulted in a net benefit, primarily driven by reserve releases in the current year versus reserve builds in the prior year and lower net write-offs in the current year. The reserve releases in the current year were due to improved portfolio quality and macroeconomic outlook, in large part driven by improvement in unemployment rate projections, partially offset by increases in the outstanding balances of receivables and loans. The reserve builds in the prior year were due to the deterioration of the global macroeconomic outlook as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, partially offset by declines in the outstanding balances of receivables and loans and lower delinquencies.Other provision for credit losses decreased and resulted in a net benefit, primarily due to a reserve release in the current year versus a reserve build in the prior year and lower net write-offs in the current year. The reserve release in the current year was due to improved portfolio quality and macroeconomic outlook. The reserve build in the prior year was due to deteriorating portfolio quality and the previously mentioned deterioration of the global macroeconomic outlook, partially offset by a decline in the outstanding balance of other loans.Refer to Note 3 to the “Consolidated Financial Statements” for the range of key variables in the macroeconomic scenarios utilized for the computation of our reserves for credit losses.45Table of ContentsTABLE 4: EXPENSES SUMMARYYears Ended December 31,ChangeChange(Millions, except percentages)2021202020192021 vs. 20202020 vs. 2019Marketing and business development$9,053 $6,747 $7,125 $2,306 34 %$(378)(5)%Card Member rewards11,007 8,041 10,439 2,966 37 (2,398)(23)Card Member services1,993 1,230 2,223 763 62 (993)(45)Total marketing, business development, and Card Member rewards and services22,053 16,018 19,787 6,035 38 (3,769)(19)Salaries and employee benefits6,240 5,718 5,911 522 9 (193)(3)Other, net4,817 5,325 5,856 (508)(10)(531)(9)Total expenses$33,110 $27,061 $31,554 $6,049 22 %$(4,493)(14)%EXPENSESMarketing and business development expense increased, primarily due to increases in marketing investments to continue building growth momentum and higher partner payments driven by higher spending volumes.Card Member rewards expense increased, primarily driven by increases in Membership Rewards and cash back rewards expenses of $2.2 billion and cobrand rewards expense of $769 million, both of which were primarily driven by higher billed business. The increase in Membership Rewards expense was also driven by a larger proportion of spend in categories that earn incremental rewards and a higher mix of redemptions in travel-related categories, as compared to the prior year.The Membership Rewards Ultimate Redemption Rate (URR) for current program participants was 96 percent (rounded down) at December 31, 2021 and 96 percent (rounded up) at December 31, 2020.Card Member services expense increased, primarily due to higher usage of travel-related benefits in the current year, as compared to the prior year during which travel was more negatively impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic.Salaries and employee benefits expense increased, primarily driven by higher compensation.Other expenses decreased, primarily driven by higher net gains in the current year on Amex Ventures equity investments, the impact of the implementation of the Proportional Amortization Method (PAM) related to investments in qualified affordable housing projects and a net reserve release in the current year versus a reserve build in the prior year associated with merchant exposure for Card Member purchases, all of which were partially offset by an increase in professional services expense.Refer to Note 1 to the “Consolidated Financial Statements” for further information on PAM.46Table of ContentsINCOME TAXESThe effective tax rate was 24.6 percent and 27.0 percent for 2021 and 2020, respectively. The reduction in the effective tax rate primarily reflected discrete tax charges in the prior year related to the realizability of certain foreign deferred tax assets. The tax rates in both years reflected the level of pretax income in relation to recurring permanent tax benefits and the geographic mix of business. The current year's effective tax rate also reflected the implementation of PAM related to investments in qualified affordable housing projects.

Refer to “Glossary of Selected Terminology” for the definitions of these terms. We believe adjusted net interest income is useful to investors because it represents the interest expense and interest income attributable to our Card Member loan portfolio and is a component of net interest yield on average Card Member loans, which provides a measure of profitability of our Card Member loan portfolio. Net interest yield on average Card Member loans reflects adjusted net interest income divided by average Card Member loans, computed on an annualized basis. Net interest income divided by average Card Member loans, computed on an annualized basis, a GAAP measure, includes elements of total interest income and total interest expense that are not attributable to the Card Member loan portfolio, and thus is not representative of net interest yield on average Card Member loans.50Table of ContentsBUSINESS SEGMENT RESULTS OF OPERATIONSWe consider a combination of factors when evaluating the composition of our reportable operating segments, including the results reviewed by the chief operating decision maker, economic characteristics, products and services offered, classes of customers, product distribution channels, geographic considerations (primarily United States versus outside the United States) and regulatory considerations. Refer to Note 24 to the “Consolidated Financial Statements” and Part I, Item 1. “Business” for additional discussion of products and services that comprise each segment.As a result of organizational changes announced during the second quarter of 2021, our loyalty coalition businesses results, which were previously reported within the GMNS segment, are now reported within the GCSG segment. Prior period segment results have been revised to conform with current period presentation.Results of the reportable operating segments generally treat each segment as a stand-alone business. The management reporting process that derives these results allocates revenue and expense using various methodologies as described below.TOTAL REVENUES NET OF INTEREST EXPENSEWe allocate discount revenue and certain other revenues among segments using a transfer pricing methodology. Within the GCSG and GCS segments, discount revenue generally reflects the issuer component of the overall discount revenue generated by each segment’s Card Members; within the GMNS segment, discount revenue generally reflects the network and acquirer component of the overall discount revenue.Net card fees and Other fees and commissions are directly attributable to the segment in which they are reported.Interest and fees on loans and certain investment income is directly attributable to the segment in which it is reported. Interest expense represents an allocated funding cost based on a combination of segment funding requirements and internal funding rates.PROVISIONS FOR CREDIT LOSSESThe provisions for credit losses are directly attributable to the segment in which they are reported.EXPENSESMarketing and business development expense is included in each segment based on the actual expenses incurred. Global brand advertising is primarily allocated to the segments based on the relative levels of revenue. Rewards and Card Member services expenses are included in each segment based on the actual expenses incurred.Salaries and employee benefits and other operating expenses reflect both costs incurred directly within each segment, as well as allocated expenses. The allocated expenses include service costs allocated based on activities directly attributable to the segment, and overhead expenses allocated based on the relative levels of revenue and Card Member loans and receivables.51Table of ContentsGLOBAL CONSUMER SERVICES GROUPTABLE 9: GCSG SELECTED INCOME STATEMENT DATAYears Ended December 31,ChangeChange(Millions, except percentages)2021202020192021 vs. 20202020 vs. 2019RevenuesNon-interest revenues$18,157 $14,632 $17,178 $3,525 24 %$(2,546)(15)%Interest income7,391 8,199 9,414 (808)(10)(1,215)(13)Interest expense717 1,054 1,731 (337)(32)(677)(39)Net interest income6,674 7,145 7,683 (471)(7)(538)(7)Total revenues net of interest expense24,831 21,777 24,861 3,054 14 (3,084)(12)Provisions for credit losses (a)(945)3,150 2,636 (4,095)#514 19 Total revenues net of interest expense after provisions for credit losses25,776 18,627 22,225 7,149 38 (3,598)(16)ExpensesMarketing, business development, and Card Member rewards and services13,898 9,841 12,201 4,057 41 (2,360)(19)Salaries and employee benefits and other operating expenses5,052 5,099 5,179 (47)(1)(80)(2)Total expenses18,950 14,940 17,380 4,010 27 (2,440)(14)Pretax segment income$6,826 $3,687 $4,845 $3,139 85 %$(1,158)(24)%# Denotes a variance of 100 percent or more(a)Results for reporting periods beginning on and after January 1, 2020 are presented using the CECL methodology, while information as of and for the year ended December 31, 2019 continues to be reported in accordance with the incurred loss methodology then in effect.

GCSG also provides services to consumers, including travel and lifestyle services and non-card financing products, and manages certain international joint ventures, our partnership agreements in China and our loyalty coalition businesses operated in certain countries.TOTAL REVENUES NET OF INTEREST EXPENSENon-interest revenues increased, primarily driven by higher Discount revenue, Net card fees and Other fees and commissions.Discount revenue increased 31 percent, primarily driven by an increase in consumer billed business of 29 percent reflecting, in part, recovery from the adverse impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic in the prior year.See Tables 5, 6 and 10 for more details on volume performance.Net card fees increased 12 percent, primarily driven by growth in our premium card portfolios.Other fees and commissions increased 11 percent, primarily due to higher travel commissions and fees from our consumer travel business and higher foreign exchange conversion revenue related to increased cross-border Card Member spending, both of which reflect the partial recovery of travel-related revenues in the current year.Net interest income decreased, primarily due to a decline in interest income driven by lower revolving Card Member loan balances, partially offset by lower cost of funds.PROVISIONS FOR CREDIT LOSSESProvisions for credit losses decreased and resulted in a net benefit, primarily driven by reserve releases in the current year versus reserve builds in the prior year and lower net write-offs in the current year. The reserve releases in the current year were due to improved portfolio quality and macroeconomic outlook, in large part driven by improvement in unemployment rate projections, partially offset by increases in the outstanding balances of receivables and loans. The reserve builds in the prior year were due to the deterioration of the global macroeconomic outlook as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, partially offset by decreases in the outstanding balances of receivables and loans.52Table of ContentsEXPENSESMarketing, business development, and Card Member rewards and services expenses increased across all expense categories. The increase in Card Member rewards expense was primarily driven by higher billed business as well as a larger proportion of spend in categories that earn incremental rewards and a higher mix of redemptions in travel-related categories, as compared to the prior year. The increase in Marketing and business development expense was primarily due to increases in marketing investments to continue building growth momentum as well as higher spending volumes. The increase in Card Member services expense was primarily due to higher usage of travel-related benefits in the current year, as compared to the prior year during which travel was more negatively impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic.53Table of ContentsTABLE 10: GCSG SELECTED STATISTICAL INFORMATIONAs of or for the Years Ended December 31,ChangeChange(Millions, except percentages and where

Net interest income increased, primarily due to a higher interest expense credit, primarily driven by an increase in average merchant payables related to year-over-year network volume growth.EXPENSESMarketing, business development, and Card Member rewards and services expenses increased, primarily driven by higher Marketing and business development expense, as a result of increased spend on initiatives to support merchant engagement and increased network issuer expense, reflecting higher processed volumes from certain GNS partners.Salaries and employee benefits and other operating expenses decreased, primarily driven by a net reserve release in the current year versus a net reserve build in the prior year associated with merchant exposure for Card Member purchases, partially offset by higher compensation. 59Table of ContentsCORPORATE & OTHERCorporate functions and certain other businesses are included in Corporate & Other.Corporate & Other pretax loss was $1.0 billion and $1.6 billion in 2021 and 2020, respectively. The decrease in the pretax loss was primarily driven by higher net gains in the current year on Amex Ventures equity investments, a non-cash gain related to an increase in GBT's total equity book value arising from GBT's acquisition of Egencia and a lower net loss in the current year from GBT as compared to the prior year, partially offset by higher compensation.CONSOLIDATED CAPITAL RESOURCES AND LIQUIDITYOur balance sheet management objectives are to maintain:•A solid and flexible equity capital profile;•A broad, deep and diverse set of funding sources to finance our assets and meet operating requirements; and•Liquidity programs that enable us to continuously meet expected future financing obligations and business requirements for at least a twelve-month period in the event we are unable to continue to raise new funds under our regular funding programs during a substantial weakening in economic conditions.The global macroeconomic outlook continues to remain uncertain due to a variety of factors, including the Omicron variant, labor shortages, supply chain disruptions and inflation. We monitor the changing macroeconomic environment and manage our balance sheet to reflect evolving circumstances.CAPITAL STRATEGYWe believe capital allocated to growing businesses with a return on risk-adjusted equity in excess of our costs will generate shareholder value. Our objective is to retain sufficient levels of capital generated through net income and other sources, such as the exercise of stock options by employees, to maintain a strong balance sheet, provide flexibility to support future business growth, and distribute excess capital to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. See “Dividends and Share Repurchases” below.The level and composition of our consolidated capital position are determined through our Internal Capital Adequacy Assessment Process, which takes into account our business activities, as well as marketplace conditions and requirements or expectations of credit rating agencies, regulators and shareholders, among others. As a bank holding company, we are subject to regulatory requirements administered by the U.S. federal banking agencies. The Federal Reserve has established specific capital adequacy guidelines that involve quantitative measures of assets, liabilities and certain off-balance sheet items. Failure to maintain minimum regulatory capital levels at American Express or our U.S. bank subsidiary, American Express National Bank (AENB), could affect our status as a financial holding company and cause the banking regulators with oversight of American Express or AENB to take actions that could limit our business operations.We seek to maintain capital levels and ratios in excess of the minimum regulatory requirements, specifically within a 10 to 11 percent target range for American Express' Common Equity Tier 1 (CET1) risk-based capital ratio.We maintain certain flexibility to shift capital across our businesses as appropriate. For example, we may infuse additional capital into subsidiaries to maintain capital at targeted levels in consideration of debt ratings and regulatory requirements. These infused amounts can affect our capital and liquidity positions at the American Express parent company level.We report our capital ratios using the Basel III capital definitions and the Basel III standardized approach for calculating risk-weighted assets.60Table of ContentsThe following table presents our regulatory risk-based capital and leverage ratios and those of AENB, as of December 31, 2021.

On- and off-balance sheet items are weighted for risk, with off-balance sheet items converted to balance sheet equivalents, using risk conversion factors, before being allocated a risk-adjusted weight. Off-balance sheet exposures comprise a minimal part of the total risk-weighted assets.Common Equity Tier 1 Risk-Based Capital Ratio — Calculated as CET1 capital, divided by risk-weighted assets. CET1 capital is common shareholders’ equity, adjusted for ineligible goodwill and intangible assets and certain deferred tax assets. CET1 capital is also adjusted for the CECL final rules, as described below.Tier 1 Risk-Based Capital Ratio — Calculated as Tier 1 capital divided by risk-weighted assets. Tier 1 capital is the sum of CET1 capital, preferred shares and third-party non-controlling interests in consolidated subsidiaries, adjusted for capital held by insurance subsidiaries. The minimum requirement for the Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio is 1.5 percent higher than the minimum for the CET1 risk-based capital ratio. We issue preferred shares to help address a portion of the Tier 1 capital requirements in excess of common equity requirements. See “Preferred Shares” below for further information.61Table of ContentsTotal Risk-Based Capital Ratio — Calculated as the sum of Tier 1 capital and Tier 2 capital, divided by risk-weighted assets. Tier 2 capital is the sum of the reserve for loan and receivable credit losses adjusted for the CECL final rules (limited to 1.25 percent of risk-weighted assets), and $240 million of eligible subordinated notes, adjusted for capital held by insurance subsidiaries. The $240 million of eligible subordinated notes reflect a 60 percent, or $360 million, reduction of Tier 2 capital credit for the $600 million subordinated debt issued in December 2014. Tier 1 Leverage Ratio — Calculated by dividing Tier 1 capital by our average total consolidated assets for the most recent quarter.We elected to delay the impact of the adoption of the CECL methodology on regulatory capital for two years followed by a three-year phase-in period pursuant to rules issued by federal banking regulators (the CECL final rules). As of December 31, 2021, our reported regulatory capital excluded the $0.9 billion impact to retained earnings upon the adoption of the CECL methodology and 25 percent of the $0.9 billion decrease in reserves for credit losses from January 1, 2020 to December 31, 2021. We have begun phasing in the $0.7 billion cumulative amount that is not recognized in regulatory capital at 25 percent per year beginning January 1, 2022. Refer to “Capital and Liquidity Regulation” under Part 1, Item 1. “Business - Supervision and Regulation” for additional details.As a Category IV firm, we were not subject to the Federal Reserve's supervisory stress tests in 2021 and will be participating in the Federal Reserve's supervisory stress tests in 2022. We are required to submit to the Federal Reserve our annual capital plan, on or before April 5 of each year.On June 24, 2021, the Federal Reserve confirmed our SCB of 2.5 percent and resulting CET1 capital ratio requirement of 7 percent, which remain unchanged from the levels announced in August 2020.DIVIDENDS AND SHARE REPURCHASESWe return capital to common shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. The share repurchases reduce common shares outstanding and generally more than offset the issuance of new shares as part of employee compensation plans.During the year ended December 31, 2021, we returned $9.0 billion to our shareholders in the form of common stock dividends of $1.4 billion and share repurchases of $7.6 billion. We repurchased 46 million common shares at an average price of $165.40 in 2021. These dividend and share repurchase amounts collectively represent approximately 109 percent of total capital generated during the year.We plan to increase the regular quarterly dividend on our common shares outstanding by approximately 20 percent, from 43 cents to 52 cents per share beginning with the first quarter of 2022, subject to approval by our Board of Directors.In addition, during the year ended December 31, 2021, we paid $71 million in dividends on non-cumulative perpetual preferred shares outstanding. Refer to Note 16 to the “Consolidated Financial Statements” for additional information on our preferred shares.During the first six months of 2021, the Federal Reserve placed restrictions on common stock dividends and common share repurchases for bank holding companies like us that participate in the Federal Reserve's Comprehensive Capital Analysis and Review (CCAR). These capital distribution restrictions ceased to apply on July 1, 2021. Our capital distributions have since returned to being governed by the SCB framework and based on managing our CET1 risk-based capital ratio within a 10 to 11 percent target range. We may conduct share repurchases through a variety of methods, including open market purchases, 10b5-1 plans, privately negotiated transactions (including employee benefit plans) or other purchases, including block trades, accelerated share repurchase programs or any combination of such methods as market conditions warrant and at prices we deem appropriate.Our decisions on capital distributions depend on various factors, including: our capital levels and regulatory capital requirements; regulatory guidance or restrictions, actual and forecasted business results; economic and market conditions; revisions to, or revocation of, the Federal Reserve’s authorization of our capital plan; and the supervisory stress test process. PREFERRED SHARESWe issue preferred shares to finance a portion of the Tier 1 capital requirements in excess of common equity requirements. On August 3, 2021, we issued $1.6 billion of 3.550% Fixed Rate Reset Noncumulative Preferred Shares, Series D. With the proceeds from that issuance, we redeemed in full the $850 million of 4.900% Fixed Rate/Floating Rate Noncumulative Preferred Shares, Series C on September 15, 2021 and the $750 million of 5.200% Fixed Rate/Floating Rate Noncumulative Preferred Shares, Series B on November 15, 2021. Refer to Note 16 to the “Consolidated Financial Statements” for additional information on our preferred shares.62Table of ContentsFUNDING STRATEGYOur principal funding objective is to maintain broad and well-diversified funding sources to allow us to finance our global businesses and to maintain a strong liquidity profile. Our funding strategy and activities are integrated into our asset-liability management activities. We have in place a funding policy covering American Express Company and all of our subsidiaries.Our global proprietary card-issuing businesses generate significant assets in both domestic and international Card Member lending and receivable activities. Our financing needs are in large part a consequence of our proprietary card-issuing businesses, where we generally pay merchants for card transactions prior to reimbursement by Card Members and therefore fund the merchant payments during the period Card Member loans and receivables are outstanding. In addition, we maintain a liquidity position to meet regulatory requirements and support our business activities.We aim to satisfy these financing needs with a diverse set of funding sources. The diversity of funding sources by type of instrument, by tenor and by investor base, among other factors, mitigates the impact of disruptions in any one type of instrument, tenor or investor. We seek to achieve diversity and cost efficiency in our funding sources by maintaining scale and market relevance in unsecured debt, asset securitizations and deposits, and access to secured borrowing facilities and a committed bank credit facility.Our direct retail deposits have become a larger proportion of our funding over time. We expect the balance of these deposits to continue to grow. Our funding plan is primarily driven by the size and mix of business asset growth, our liquidity position, and choice of funding sources, as well as cash requirements generated by the redemptions of deposits by our customers, the maturities of debt outstanding and related interest payments. In executing our funding plan, we aim to maintain a balanced debt maturity profile with an appropriate mix of short-term and long-term refinancing requirements.FUNDING PROGRAMS AND ACTIVITIESWe had the following customer deposits and consolidated debt outstanding as of December 31:TABLE 17: SUMMARY OF CUSTOMER DEPOSITS AND CONSOLIDATED DEBT(Billions)20212020Customer deposits$84.4 $86.9 Short-term borrowings2.2 1.9 Long-term debt38.7 43.0 Total debt and customer deposits$125.3 $131.8 We may redeem from time to time certain debt securities prior to the original contractual maturity dates in accordance with the optional redemption provisions of those debt securities.Our funding plan for the full year 2022 includes, among other sources, approximately $8.0 billion to $12.0 billion of unsecured term debt issuance and approximately $6.0 billion to $10.0 billion of secured term debt issuance. Actual funding activities can vary from our plans due to various factors, such as future business growth, the impact of global economic, political and other events on market capacity and funding needs, demand for securities offered by us, regulatory changes, ability to securitize and sell receivables, and the performance of receivables previously sold in securitization transactions. Many of these factors are beyond our control.In order to simplify our funding and reporting structure, in October 2021 we terminated the commercial paper program at American Express Credit Corporation (Credco) and Credco's committed syndicated bank credit facility, the undrawn amounts from which could serve as a backstop for the amount of commercial paper outstanding. Concurrently, we established a new commercial paper program at American Express Travel Related Services Company, Inc. (TRS) and a new credit facility with American Express Company and TRS as co-borrowers and co-obligors, as described further below. We also completed an exchange offer on November 30, 2021, in which American Express Company issued $1.7 billion of new senior notes with a 3.300% coupon and May 3, 2027 maturity in exchange for the same amount of outstanding senior notes with the same coupon and maturity issued by Credco. Following completion of the exchange offer, $339 million of Credco's 3.300% senior notes with May 3, 2027 maturity remain outstanding. Due to the limited amount of publicly issued debt outstanding, Credco deregistered from ongoing SEC reporting beginning January 1, 2022. Credco will continue to finance certain Card Member receivables and loans using intercompany borrowing as its primary funding source.Our equity capital and funding strategies are designed, among other things, to maintain appropriate and stable unsecured debt ratings from the major credit rating agencies: Moody’s Investor Services (Moody’s), Standard & Poor’s (S&P) and Fitch Ratings (Fitch). Such ratings help support our access to cost-effective unsecured funding as part of our overall funding strategy. Our asset securitization activities are rated separately.63Table of ContentsTABLE 18: UNSECURED DEBT RATINGSCredit AgencyAmerican Express EntityShort-Term RatingsLong-Term RatingsOutlookFitchAmerican Express Credit CorporationN/AAStableFitchAll other rated entitiesF1AStableMoody’sAmerican Express Travel Related Services Company, Inc.Prime-1A2StableMoody'sAmerican Express Credit CorporationN/AA2StableMoody’sAmerican Express National BankPrime-1A3StableMoody'sAmerican Express CompanyN/AA2StableS&PAmerican Express Travel Related Services Company, Inc.A-2A-StableS&PAmerican Express Credit CorporationN/AA-StableS&PAmerican Express National BankA-2A-StableS&PAmerican Express CompanyA-2BBB+StableThese ratings are not a recommendation to buy or hold any of our securities and they may be revised or revoked at any time at the sole discretion of the rating organization.Downgrades in the ratings of our unsecured debt or asset securitization program securities could result in higher funding costs, as well as higher fees related to borrowings under our unused credit facilities. Declines in credit ratings could also reduce our borrowing capacity in the unsecured debt and asset securitization capital markets. We believe our funding mix, including the proportion of U.S. retail deposits insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) to total funding, should reduce the impact that credit rating downgrades would have on our funding capacity and costs.64Table of ContentsDEPOSIT PROGRAMSWe offer deposits within our U.S. bank subsidiary, AENB. These funds are currently insured up to an amount that is at least $250,000 per account holder through the FDIC. Our ability to obtain deposit funding and offer competitive interest rates is dependent on, among other factors, the capital level of AENB. Direct retail deposits offered by AENB is our primary deposit product channel, which makes FDIC-insured high-yield savings account and certificates of deposit (CDs) products available directly to consumers. AENB also offers checking account products and sources deposits through third-party distribution channels as needed to meet our overall funding objectives. As of December 31, 2021, we had $84.4 billion in deposits. Refer to Note 7 to the “Consolidated Financial Statements” for a further description of these deposits and scheduled maturities of certificates of deposits.SHORT-TERM FUNDING PROGRAMSShort-term borrowings, such as commercial paper, are defined as any debt with an original maturity of twelve months or less, as well as interest-bearing overdrafts with banks. Our short-term funding programs are used primarily to fund working capital needs, such as managing seasonal variations in receivables balances. The amount of short-term borrowings issued in the future will depend on our funding strategy, our needs and market conditions. As of December 31, 2021, we had nil commercial paper outstanding and an average of nil in commercial paper outstanding during 2021. Refer to Note 8 to the “Consolidated Financial Statements” for a further description of these borrowings.LONG-TERM DEBT AND ASSET SECURITIZATION PROGRAMSAs of December 31, 2021, we had $38.7 billion in long-term debt outstanding, including unsecured debt and asset-backed securities. During 2021, we issued $5.8 billion of unsecured debt and asset-backed securities with maturities ranging from 2 to 5 years. Refer to Note 8 to the “Consolidated Financial Statements” for a further description of these borrowings and scheduled maturities of long-term debt obligations.We periodically securitize Card Member loans and receivables arising from our U.S. card business, as the securitization market provides us with cost-effective funding. Securitization of Card Member loans and receivables is accomplished through the transfer of those assets to a trust, which in turn issues securities collateralized by the transferred assets to third-party investors. The proceeds from issuance are distributed to us, through our wholly owned subsidiaries, as consideration for the transferred assets. Refer to Note 5 to the “Consolidated Financial Statements” for a further description of our asset securitizations.TABLE 19: DEBT ISSUANCES(Billions)2021American Express Company:Fixed Rate Senior Notes (weighted-average coupon rate of 1.27%)$1.9 Floating Rate Senior Notes (compounded SOFR (a) plus weighted-average spread of 42 basis points)1.1 American Express Credit Account Master Trust:Fixed Rate Class A Certificates (weighted-average coupon of 0.90%)2.8 Total$5.8 (a)Secured overnight financing rate (SOFR).In addition, American Express Company issued $1.7 billion of 3.300% new senior notes in exchange for the same amount of outstanding senior notes issued by Credco, as described above.65Table of ContentsLIQUIDITY MANAGEMENTOur liquidity objective is to maintain access to a diverse set of on- and off-balance sheet liquidity sources. We seek to maintain liquidity sources in amounts sufficient to meet our expected future financial obligations and business requirements for liquidity for a period of at least twelve months in the event we are unable to raise new funds under our regular funding programs during a substantial weakening in economic conditions.Our liquidity management strategy includes a number of elements, including, but not limited to:•Maintaining diversified funding sources (refer to the “Funding Strategy” section for more details);•Maintaining unencumbered liquid assets and off-balance sheet liquidity sources;•Projecting cash inflows and outflows under a variety of economic and market scenarios; and•Establishing clear objectives for liquidity risk management, including compliance with regulatory requirements.We seek to maintain access to a diverse set of on-balance sheet and off-balance sheet liquidity sources, including cash and other liquid assets, committed bank credit facilities and secured borrowing facilities. Through our U.S. bank subsidiary, AENB, we also hold collateral eligible for use at the Federal Reserve’s discount window.The amount and type of liquidity resources we maintain can vary over time, based upon the results of stress scenarios required under the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, as well as additional stress scenarios required under our liquidity risk policy. These stress scenarios possess distinct characteristics, varying by cash flow assumptions, time horizon and qualifying liquidity sources, among other factors. Scenarios under our liquidity risk policy include market-wide, firm-specific and combined liquidity stresses. We consider other factors in determining the amount and type of liquidity we maintain, such as economic and financial market conditions, seasonality in business operations, growth in our businesses, potential acquisitions or dispositions, the cost and availability of alternative liquidity sources and credit rating agency guidelines and requirements. We believe that we currently maintain sufficient liquidity to meet all internal and regulatory liquidity requirements. As of December 31, 2021, we had a total of $24.6 billion in Cash and cash equivalents and Investment securities (which are substantially comprised of U.S. Government Treasury obligations). The decrease of $30.0 billion from $54.6 billion as of December 31, 2020 was primarily driven by the increase in the balances of our Card Member loans and receivables, debt maturities, share repurchases and a reduction in customer deposits, partially offset by the issuance of unsecured and secured debt securities.The investment income we receive on liquidity resources is less than the interest expense on the sources of funding for these balances. In 2021, the net interest costs to maintain these resources were substantial. The level of future net interest costs depends on the amount of liquidity resources we maintain and the difference between our cost of funding these amounts and their investment yields.66Table of ContentsSecuritized Borrowing CapacityAs of December 31, 2021, we maintained our committed, revolving, secured borrowing facility, with a maturity date of July 15, 2024, which gives us the right to sell up to $3.0 billion face amount of eligible AAA notes from the American Express Issuance Trust II (the Charge Trust). We also maintained our committed, revolving, secured borrowing facility, with a maturity date of September 16, 2024, which gives us the right to sell up to $2.0 billion face amount of eligible AAA certificates from the American Express Credit Account Master Trust (the Lending Trust). Both facilities are used in the ordinary course of business to fund working capital needs, as well as to further enhance our contingent funding resources. As of December 31, 2021, $2.0 billion was drawn on the Charge Trust facility, which was subsequently repaid on January 18, 2022. No amounts were drawn on the Lending Trust facility.Federal Reserve Discount WindowAs an insured depository institution, AENB may borrow from the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco, subject to the amount of qualifying collateral that it may pledge. The Federal Reserve has indicated that both credit and charge card receivables are a form of qualifying collateral for secured borrowings made through the discount window. Whether specific assets will be considered qualifying collateral and the amount that may be borrowed against the collateral remain at the discretion of the Federal Reserve.We had approximately $80.8 billion as of December 31, 2021 in U.S. credit card loans and charge card receivables that could be sold over time through our securitization trusts or pledged in return for secured borrowings to provide further liquidity, subject in each case to applicable market conditions and eligibility criteria.Committed Bank Credit FacilityIn addition to the secured borrowing facilities described above, we maintained a committed syndicated bank credit facility of $3.5 billion as of December 31, 2021. This facility was maintained by our wholly owned subsidiary Credco through September 30, 2021 and the availability of the credit line was subject to compliance with certain covenants by Credco, principally the maintenance by Credco of a 1.25 ratio of its combined earnings, certain capital contributions and fixed charges, to fixed charges. Effective October 1, 2021, this facility was terminated, and we entered into a new committed syndicated bank credit facility for the same amount with a maturity date of October 15, 2024 with American Express Company and TRS as co-borrowers and co-obligors. The availability of the new credit facility is subject to our maintenance of a minimum CET1 risk-based capital ratio of 4.5 percent, with certain restrictions in relation to either accessing the facility or distributing capital to common shareholders in the event our CET1 risk-based capital ratio falls between 4.5 percent and 6.5 percent. As of December 31, 2021, we were in compliance with the covenants contained in the new credit facility and no amounts were drawn on the facility. We may, from time to time, use this facility in the ordinary course of business to fund working capital needs. Any undrawn portion of this facility could serve as a backstop for the amount of commercial paper outstanding.The new credit facility does not contain a material adverse change clause, which might otherwise preclude borrowing under the facility, nor is it dependent on our credit rating.Off-balance Sheet ArrangementsWe have certain off-balance sheet obligations that include guarantees, indemnifications and certain Card Member and partner arrangements that may have a material current or future effect on our financial condition, changes in financial condition, results of operations, or liquidity and capital resources. For more information on these obligations, refer to Note 12, Note 15 and Note 23 to the “Consolidated Financial Statements.”67Table of ContentsCASH FLOWSThe following table summarizes our cash flow activity, followed by a discussion of the major drivers impacting operating, investing and financing cash flows for the year ended December 31, 2021 compared to the year ended December 31, 2020.TABLE 20: CASH FLOWS(Billions)202120202019Total cash provided by (used in):Operating activities$14.6 $5.6 $13.6 Investing activities(10.5)11.6 (16.7)Financing activities(14.9)(9.1)(0.5)Effect of foreign currency exchange rates on cash and cash equivalents(0.1)0.4 0.2 Net (decrease) increase in cash and cash equivalents$(10.9)$8.5 $(3.4)Cash Flows from Operating ActivitiesOur cash flows from operating activities primarily include net income adjusted for (i) non-cash items included in net income, such as provisions for credit losses, depreciation and amortization, stock-based compensation, deferred taxes and other non-cash items and (ii) changes in the balances of operating assets and liabilities, which can vary significantly in the normal course of business due to the amount and timing of payments.In 2021, the net cash provided by operating activities was primarily driven by cash generated from net income for the period and higher net operating liabilities, primarily resulting from an increase in Membership Rewards liability and higher accounts payable to merchants related to growth in billed business.In 2020, the net cash provided by operating activities was primarily driven by the cash generated from net income for the period, partially offset by lower accounts payable to merchants and purchases of loyalty program points from certain of our cobrand partners, which resulted in an increase in Other assets.Cash Flows from Investing ActivitiesOur cash flows from investing activities primarily include changes in Card Member loans and receivables, as well as changes in our available-for-sale investment securities portfolio.In 2021, the net cash used in investing activities was primarily driven by higher Card Member loan and receivable balances, resulting from higher Card Member spending, partially offset by net maturities of our investment securities.In 2020, the net cash provided by investing activities was primarily driven by a decline in Card Member loan and receivable balances, partially offset by net purchases of investment securities. The decline in Card Member loan and receivable balances was due to the ongoing pay down of outstanding balances by Card Members combined with significant declines in spending that occurred due to the COVID-19 pandemic.Cash Flows from Financing ActivitiesOur cash flows from financing activities primarily include changes in customer deposits, long-term debt and short-term borrowings, as well as dividend payments and share repurchases.In 2021, the net cash used in financing activities was primarily driven by share repurchases, net debt repayments, decreases in customer deposits, dividends and redemption of preferred shares, partially offset by the proceeds from the issuance of preferred shares.In 2020, the net cash used in financing activities was primarily driven by debt repayments, dividends and share repurchases, partially offset by growth in customer deposits.68Table of ContentsRISK MANAGEMENTGOVERNANCEWe use our comprehensive Enterprise-wide Risk Management (ERM) program to identify, aggregate, monitor, and manage risks. The program also defines our risk appetite, governance, culture and capabilities. The implementation and execution of the ERM program is headed by our Chief Risk Officer.Risk management is overseen by our Board of Directors through three Board committees: the Risk Committee, the Audit and Compliance Committee, and the Compensation and Benefits Committee. Each committee consists entirely of independent directors and provides regular reports to the full Board regarding matters reviewed at their committee. The committees meet regularly in private sessions with our Chief Risk Officer, the Chief Compliance & Ethics Officer, the Chief Audit Executive and other senior management with regard to our risk management processes, controls, talent and capabilities. The Board monitors the “tone at the top,” our risk culture, and oversees emerging and strategic risks.The Risk Committee of our Board of Directors provides oversight of our ERM framework, processes and methodologies. The Risk Committee approves our ERM policy. The ERM policy governs risk governance, risk oversight and risk appetite for risks, including individual credit risk, institutional credit risk, operational risk, compliance risk, reputational risk, market risk, funding and liquidity risk, model risk, strategic and business risk, country risk and environmental, social and governance risk. Risk appetite defines the authorized risk limits to control exposures within our risk capacity and risk tolerance, including stressed forward-looking scenarios. In addition, it establishes principles for risk taking in the aggregate and for each risk type, and is supported by a comprehensive system for monitoring limits, escalation triggers and assessing control programs.The Risk Committee reviews and concurs with the appointment, replacement, performance and compensation of our Chief Risk Officer and receives regular updates from the Chief Risk Officer on key risks, transactions and exposures.The Risk Committee reviews our risk profile against the tolerances specified in the Risk Appetite Framework, including significant risk exposures, risk trends in our portfolios and major risk concentrations.The Risk Committee also provides oversight of our compliance with Regulatory capital and liquidity standards, our Internal Capital Adequacy Assessment Process, including the CCAR submissions.The Audit and Compliance Committee of our Board of Directors reviews and approves compliance policies, which include our Compliance Risk Tolerance Statement. In addition, the Audit and Compliance Committee reviews the effectiveness of our Corporate-wide Compliance Risk Management Program. More broadly, this committee is responsible for assisting the Board in its oversight responsibilities relating to the integrity of our financial statements and financial reporting process, internal and external auditing, including the qualifications and independence of the independent registered public accounting firm and the performance of our internal audit services function, and the integrity of our systems of internal controls.The Audit and Compliance Committee provides oversight of our Internal Audit Group. The Audit and Compliance Committee reviews and concurs with the appointment, replacement, performance and compensation of our Chief Audit Executive, who reports to the Audit and Compliance Committee, and approves Internal Audit’s annual audit plan, charter, policies, budget and staffing levels, and overall risk assessment methodology. The Audit and Compliance Committee also receives regular updates on the audit plan’s status and results, including significant reports issued by Internal Audit and the status of our corrective actions.The Compensation and Benefits Committee of our Board of Directors works with the Chief Risk Officer to ensure our overall compensation programs, as well as those covering our risk-taking employees, appropriately balance risk with business incentives and how business performance is achieved without taking imprudent or excessive risk. Our Chief Risk Officer is actively involved in setting risk goals for the Company. Our Chief Risk Officer also reviews the current and forward-looking risk profiles of each business unit and provides input into performance evaluation. The Chief Risk Officer meets with the Compensation and Benefits Committee and attests whether performance goals and results have been achieved without taking imprudent risks. The Compensation and Benefits Committee uses a risk-balanced incentive compensation framework to decide on our bonus pools and the compensation of senior executives.69Table of ContentsThere are several internal management committees, including the Enterprise-wide Risk Management Committee (ERMC), chaired by our Chief Risk Officer. The ERMC is the highest-level management committee to oversee all firm-wide risks and is responsible for risk governance, risk oversight and risk appetite. It maintains the enterprise-wide risk appetite framework and monitors compliance with limits and escalations defined in it. The ERMC oversees implementation of risk policies company-wide. The ERMC reviews key risk exposures, trends and concentrations, significant compliance matters, and provides guidance on the steps to monitor, control and report major risks. In addition, the Asset Liability Committee, chaired by our Chief Financial Officer, is responsible for managing our capital, funding and liquidity, investment, market risk and asset/liability activities in accordance with our policies and in compliance with applicable regulatory requirements.As defined in the ERM policy, we follow the “three lines of defense” approach to risk management. The first line of defense comprises functions and management committees directly initiating risk taking. The Chief Executive Officer, business unit presidents and the Chief Financial Officer are part of the first line of defense. The second line comprises independent functions overseeing risk-taking activities of the first line. The Chief Risk Officer, the Chief Compliance & Ethics Officer, the Chief Operational Risk Officer and certain control groups, both at the enterprise level and within regulated entities, are part of the second line of defense. The global risk oversight team oversees the policies, strategies, frameworks, models, processes and capabilities deployed by the first line teams and provides challenges and independent assessments on how the first line of defense is managing risks. Our Internal Audit Group constitutes the third line of defense and provides independent assessments and effective challenge of the first and second lines of defense.CREDIT RISK MANAGEMENT PROCESSCredit risk is defined as loss due to default or changes in the credit quality of a customer, obligor or security. Our credit risks are divided into two broad categories: individual and institutional. Each has distinct risk management capabilities, strategies, and tools. Business units that create individual or institutional credit risk exposures of significant importance are supported by dedicated risk management teams, each led by a Chief Credit Officer.INDIVIDUAL CREDIT RISKIndividual credit risk arises from consumer and small business charge cards, credit cards, and term loans. These portfolios consist of millions of customers across multiple geographies, industries and levels of net worth. We benefit from the high-quality profile of our customers, which is driven by our brand, premium customer servicing, product features and risk management capabilities, which span underwriting, customer management and collections. The risk in these portfolios is generally correlated to broad economic trends, such as unemployment rates and gross domestic product (GDP) growth.The business unit leaders and their Chief Credit Officers take the lead in managing the credit risk process. These Chief Credit Officers are guided by the Individual Credit Risk Committee (ICRC), which is responsible for implementation and enforcement of the Individual Credit Risk Management Policy. The ICRC ensures compliance with ERMC guidelines and procedures and escalates to the ERMC as appropriate. Credit risk management is supported by sophisticated proprietary scoring and decision-making models that use up-to-date information on prospects and customers, such as spending and payment history and data feeds from credit bureaus. We have developed data-driven economic decision logic for customer interactions to better serve our customers.INSTITUTIONAL CREDIT RISKInstitutional credit risk arises principally within our GCS and GMNS businesses, as well as investment and liquidity management activities. Unlike individual credit risk, institutional credit risk is characterized by a lower loss frequency but higher severity. It is affected both by general economic conditions and by client-specific events. The absence of large losses in any given year or over several years is not necessarily representative of the level of risk of institutional portfolios, given the infrequency of loss events in such portfolios.Similar to individual credit risk, business units taking institutional credit risks are supported by Chief Credit Officers. These officers are guided by the Institutional Risk Management Committee (IRMC), which is responsible for implementation and enforcement of the Institutional Credit Risk Management Policy and for providing guidance to the credit officers of each business unit with substantial institutional credit risk exposures. The committee, along with the business unit Chief Credit Officers, makes investment decisions in core risk capabilities, ensures proper implementation of the underwriting standards and contractual rights for risk mitigation, monitors risk exposures, and determines risk mitigation actions. The IRMC formally reviews large institutional risk exposures to ensure compliance with ERMC guidelines and procedures and escalates them to the ERMC as appropriate. At the same time, the IRMC provides guidance to the business unit risk management teams to optimize risk-adjusted returns on capital. A centralized risk rating unit provides risk assessment of our institutional obligors.70Table of ContentsExposure to the Airline and Travel IndustryWe have multiple important cobrand, rewards, merchant acceptance and corporate payments arrangements with airlines. The ERM program evaluates the risks posed by our airline partners and the overall airline strategy company-wide through comprehensive business analysis of global airlines, and the travel industry more broadly, including cruise lines, travel agencies and tour operators. Our largest airline partner is Delta, and this relationship includes an exclusive cobrand credit card partnership and other arrangements including Membership Rewards redemption, merchant acceptance, travel and corporate payments. See “We face intense competition for partner relationships, which could result in a loss or renegotiation of these arrangements that could have a material adverse impact on our business and results of operations” and “Arrangements with our business partners represent a significant portion of our business. We are exposed to risks associated with our business partners, including reputational issues, business slowdowns, bankruptcies, liquidations, restructurings and consolidations, and the possible obligation to make payments to our partners” under “Risk Factors” for additional information.Debt ExposureAs part of our ongoing risk management process, we monitor our financial exposure to both sovereign and non-sovereign customers and counterparties, and measure and manage concentrations of risk by geographic regions, as well as by economic sectors and industries. A primary focus area for monitoring is credit deterioration due to weaknesses in economic and fiscal profiles. We evaluate countries based on the market assessment of the riskiness of their sovereign debt and our assessment of the economic and financial outlook and closely monitor those deemed high risk. As of December 31, 2021, we considered our gross credit exposures to government entities, financial institutions and corporations in those countries deemed high risk to be individually and collectively not material.OPERATIONAL RISK MANAGEMENT PROCESSWe consider operational risk to be the risk of loss due to, among other things, inadequate or failed processes, people or information systems, or impacts from the external environment, including failures to comply with laws and regulations as well as impacts from relationships with third parties. Operational risk is inherent in all business activities and can impact an organization through direct or indirect financial loss, brand damage, customer dissatisfaction, or legal and regulatory penalties.To appropriately measure and manage operational risk, we have implemented a comprehensive operational risk framework that is defined in the Operational Risk Management Policy approved by the ERMC. The Operational Risk Management Committee (ORMC), chaired by the Chief Operational Risk Officer, coordinates with all control groups on effective risk assessments and controls and oversees the preventive, responsive and mitigation efforts by Operational Excellence teams in the business units and staff groups.We use the operational risk framework to identify, measure, monitor and report inherent and emerging operational risks. This framework, supervised by the ORMC, consists of (a) operational risk event capture, (b) a project office to coordinate issue management and control enhancements, (c) key risk indicators, and (d) process and entity-level risk assessments.The framework requires the assessment of operational risk events to determine root causes, impact to customers and/or us, and resolution plan accountability to correct any defect, remediate customers, and enhance controls and testing to mitigate future issues. The impact is assessed from an operational, financial, brand, regulatory compliance and legal perspective.71Table of ContentsINFORMATION AND CYBER SECURITYWe define information and cyber security risk as the risk that a security incident could impact the confidentiality, integrity or availability of American Express customer, colleague or proprietary information.Our information and cyber security program is designed to protect the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of information and information systems from unauthorized access, use, disclosure, disruption, modification, or destruction. The program is built upon a foundation of advanced security technology, a well-staffed and highly trained team of experts, and robust operations based on the National Institute of Standards and Technology Cybersecurity Framework. This consists of controls designed to identify, protect, detect, respond and recover from information and cyber security incidents. We continue to invest in enhancements to cyber security capabilities and engage in industry and government forums to promote advancements to the broader financial services cyber security ecosystem.See “A major information or cyber security incident or an increase in fraudulent activity could lead to reputational damage to our brand and material legal, regulatory and financial exposure, and could reduce the use and acceptance of our cards” under “Risk Factors” for additional information.72Table of ContentsINFORMATION TECHNOLOGYWe define information technology risk as the risk that events or circumstances could compromise the processing, stability, capacity, performance, or resilience of information technology and cause financial, reputational, and/or regulatory impacts.We manage information technology risk through our policies, procedures, governance structure, and control framework to preserve the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of systems and processes across our Company.See “The uninterrupted operation of our information systems is critical to our success and a significant disruption could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations” under “Risk Factors” for additional information.PRIVACY We define privacy risk as the risk of financial loss, reputational damage, or regulatory or legal action resulting from decisions related to the violation of applicable laws, rules, regulations, contractual obligations, or the non-adherence to privacy policies, disclosures, or standards that apply to the processing of personal data.The Global Privacy Policy establishes the privacy framework and defines the American Express Data Protection & Privacy Principles, which governs the way we collect, use, store, share, transmit, delete or otherwise process our customer and colleague personal data globally. Chaired by the Chief Privacy Officer, the Privacy Risk Management Committee, a sub-committee of the ORMC, provides oversight and governance for our privacy program.DATA MANAGEMENT AND GOVERNANCEWe define data management and governance risk as the risk of financial, reputational, and/or regulatory impacts due to inadequate data governance and/or data management practices adversely impacting the accuracy, completeness, timeliness, comprehensiveness or usability of data throughout its lifecycle. Our Enterprise Data Governance Policy establishes the framework for defining in-scope critical data and the requirements for managing such data effectively throughout its lifecycle as a critical corporate asset. This policy is approved by the ERMC. Chaired by the Chief Data Officer, our Enterprise Data Committee, a sub-committee of the ERMC, provides governance and oversight for our enterprise-wide data governance and management activities.COMPLIANCE RISK MANAGEMENT PROCESSWe define compliance risk as the risk of legal or reputational harm, fines, monetary penalties and payment of damages or other forms of sanction as a result of non-compliance with applicable laws and/or regulations, internal policies and procedures and related practices, or ethical standards.We view our ability to effectively mitigate compliance risk as an important aspect of our business model. Our Global Compliance and Ethics organization is responsible for establishing and maintaining our corporate-wide Compliance Risk Management Program. Pursuant to this program, we seek to manage and mitigate compliance risk by assessing, controlling, monitoring, measuring and reporting the legal and regulatory risks to which we are exposed. The Compliance Risk Management Committee (CRMC), chaired by the Chief Compliance and Ethics Officer, is responsible for identifying, evaluating, managing, and escalating compliance risks. The CRMC has a dual reporting relationship directly to both the ERMC and the Audit and Compliance Committee.We have a comprehensive Anti-Money Laundering program that monitors and reports suspicious activity to the appropriate government authorities. As part of that program, the Global Risk Oversight team provides independent risk assessment of the rules used by the Anti-Money Laundering team. In addition, the Internal Audit Group reviews the processes for practices consistent with regulatory guidance.73Table of ContentsREPUTATIONAL RISK MANAGEMENT PROCESSWe define reputational risk as the risk that negative stakeholder reaction to our products, services, client and partner relationships, business activities and policies, management and workplace culture, or our response to unexpected events, could cause sustained critical media coverage, a decline in revenue or investment, talent attrition, litigation, or government or regulatory scrutiny.We view protecting our reputation for excellent customer service, trust, security and high integrity as core to our vision of providing the world’s best customer experience and fundamental to our long-term success.Our business leaders are responsible for considering the reputational risk implications of business activities and strategies and ensuring the relevant subject matter experts are engaged as needed. The ERMC is responsible for ensuring reputational risk considerations are included in the scope of appropriate subordinate risk policies and committees and properly reflected in all decisions escalated to the ERMC.MARKET RISK MANAGEMENT PROCESSMarket risk is the risk to earnings or asset and liability values resulting from movements in market prices. Our market risk exposures include (i) interest rate risk due to changes in the relationship between the interest rates on our assets (such as loans, receivables and investment securities) and the interest rates on our liabilities (such as debt and deposits) and (ii) foreign exchange risk related to transactions, funding, investments and earnings in currencies other than the U.S. dollar.Our risk policies establish the framework that guides and governs market risk management, including quantitative limits and escalation triggers. These policies are approved by the ERMC, Asset Liability Committee or Market Risk Management Committee.Market risk is managed by the Market Risk Management Committee. The Market Risk Oversight Officer provides an independent risk assessment and oversight over the policies and exposure management for market risk and Asset Liability Management activities, as well as overseeing compliance with associated regulatory requirements. Market risk management is also guided and governed by policies covering the use of derivative financial instruments, funding, liquidity and investments.Interest Rate RiskWe analyze a variety of interest rate scenarios to inform us of the potential impacts from interest rate changes on earnings and the value of assets, liabilities and the economic value of equity. Our interest rate exposure can vary over time as a result of, among other things, the proportion of our total funding provided by variable and fixed-rate debt and deposits compared to our Card Member loans and receivables. Interest rate swaps are used from time to time to effectively convert debt issuances to variable-rate from fixed-rate, or vice versa. Refer to Note 13 to the “Consolidated Financial Statements” for further discussion of our derivative financial instruments.As of December 31, 2021, a hypothetical, immediate 100 basis point increase in market interest rates would have a detrimental impact of approximately $206 million on our annual net interest income. A hypothetical immediate 100 basis point decrease in market interest rates, which are assumed to remain at or above zero percent, would have a smaller but still detrimental impact on our annual net interest income. This measure first projects net interest income over the following twelve-month time horizon considering forecasted business growth and anticipated future market interest rates. The detrimental impact from rate changes is then measured by instantaneously increasing or decreasing the anticipated future interest rates by 100 basis points. Our estimated repricing risk assumes that our interest-rate sensitive assets and liabilities that reprice within the twelve-month horizon generally reprice by the same magnitude as benchmark rate changes. It is further assumed that, within our interest-rate sensitive liabilities, certain deposits reprice at lower magnitudes than benchmark rate movements, and the magnitude of this repricing in turn depends on, among other factors, the direction of rate movements. These assumptions are consistent with historical deposit repricing experience in the industry and within our own portfolio. Actual changes in our net interest income will depend on many factors, and therefore may differ from our estimated risk to changes in market interest rates. 74Table of ContentsLIBOR TransitionWe have an enterprise-wide, cross-functional initiative to identify, assess and monitor risks associated with the London interbank offered rate (LIBOR), engage with industry participants, customers and regulators and to transition to new alternative reference rates, such as the secured overnight financing rate. As part of this initiative, we have amended and continue to amend contracts to replace references to USD LIBOR tenors that will cease to be quoted after June 2023 and have updated our operational processes, IT systems and models for a timely transition.See “The discontinuance of LIBOR may negatively impact our access to funding and the value of our financial instruments and commercial agreements” under “Risk Factors” for additional information.Foreign Exchange RiskForeign exchange exposures arise in four principal ways: (1) Card Member spending in currencies that are not the billing currency, (2) cross-currency transactions and balances from our funding activities, (3) cross-currency investing activities, such as in the equity of foreign subsidiaries, and (4) revenues generated and expenses incurred in foreign currencies, which impact earnings.These foreign exchange risks are managed primarily by entering into foreign exchange spot transactions or hedged with foreign exchange forward contracts when the hedge costs are economically justified and in notional amounts designed to offset pretax impacts from currency movements in the period in which they occur. As of December 31, 2021, foreign currency derivative instruments with total notional amounts of approximately $32 billion were outstanding.With respect to Card Member spending and cross-currency transactions, including related foreign exchange forward contracts outstanding, the impact of a hypothetical 10 percent strengthening of the U.S. dollar would have been immaterial to projected earnings as of December 31, 2021. With respect to translation exposure of foreign subsidiary equity balances, including related foreign exchange forward contracts outstanding, a hypothetical 10 percent strengthening of the U.S. dollar would result in an immaterial reduction in other comprehensive income and equity as of December 31, 2021. With respect to anticipated earnings denominated in foreign currencies for the next twelve months, the adverse impact on pretax income of a hypothetical 10 percent strengthening of the U.S. dollar would be approximately $112 million as of December 31, 2021. To a much lesser extent, we are also subject to market risk arising from activities conducted by our Foreign Exchange International Payments business. We aim to minimize market risk from these activities through hedging, where appropriate, and the establishment of limits.The actual impact of interest rate and foreign exchange rate changes will depend on, among other factors, the timing of rate changes, the extent to which different rates do not move in the same direction or in the same direction to the same degree, changes in the cost, volume and mix of our hedging activities and changes in the volume and mix of our businesses.75Table of ContentsFUNDING & LIQUIDITY RISK MANAGEMENT PROCESSFunding and liquidity risk is defined as our inability to meet our ongoing financial and business obligations at a reasonable cost as they become due.Our Board-approved Liquidity Risk Policy establishes the framework that guides and governs liquidity risk management.Funding and liquidity risk is managed by the Funding and Liquidity Committee. To manage this risk, we seek to maintain access to a diverse set of cash, readily-marketable securities and contingent sources of liquidity, such that we can continuously meet our business requirements and expected future financing obligations for at least a twelve-month period in the event we are unable to raise new funds under our regular funding programs during a substantial weakening in economic conditions. We consider the trade-offs between maintaining too much liquidity, which can be costly and limit financial flexibility, and having inadequate liquidity, which may result in financial distress during a liquidity event.Funding and liquidity risk is managed at an aggregate consolidated level as well as at certain subsidiaries in order to ensure that sufficient and accessible liquidity resources are maintained. The Funding and Liquidity Committee reviews forecasts of our aggregate and subsidiary cash positions and financing requirements, approves funding plans designed to satisfy those requirements under normal and stressed conditions, establishes guidelines to identify the amount of liquidity resources required and monitors positions and determines any actions to be taken.MODEL RISK MANAGEMENT PROCESSWe define model risk as the risk of adverse consequences, such as financial loss, poor business and strategic decision making, damage to our reputation or customer harm, from decisions based on incorrect or misused model outputs and outcomes.Model risk is managed through a comprehensive risk management and governance framework, including policies and procedures for model development, independent model validation, model risk reporting and change management capabilities that seek to minimize erroneous model methodology, outputs, and misuse. We also assess model performance and model- related issues on an ongoing basis and seek to address deficiencies in a timely manner. In addition, we utilize artificial intelligence and machine learning (AI/ML) models for a variety of business use cases. We perform extensive reviews and testing to reduce the risk that these AI/ML techniques result in adverse consequences.STRATEGIC AND BUSINESS RISK MANAGEMENT PROCESSStrategic and business risk is the risk related to our inability to achieve our business objectives due to poor strategic decisions, including decisions related to mergers, acquisitions, and divestitures, poor implementation of strategic decisions or declining demand for our products and services.Strategic decisions are reviewed and approved by business leaders and various committees and must be aligned with company policies. We seek to manage strategic and business risks through risk controls embedded in these processes as well as overall risk management oversight over business goals. Existing product performance is reviewed periodically by committees and business leaders. Mergers, acquisitions and divestitures can only be approved following Executive Committee due diligence, a comprehensive risk assessment by operational, market, credit and oversight leaders provided to the Chief Risk Officer and approval by either the Chief Risk Officer or appropriate risk committees. All new products and material changes in business processes are reviewed and approved by the New Products Committee and appropriate credit or risk committees.76Table of ContentsCOUNTRY RISK MANAGEMENT PROCESSCountry risk is defined as the risk that economic, social, and/or political conditions and events in a country present. They might adversely impact us, primarily as a result of greater credit losses, increased operational or market risk or the inability to repatriate capital.We manage country risk as part of the normal course of business. Policies and procedures establish country risk escalation thresholds to control and limit exposure, driven by processes that enable the monitoring of conditions in countries where we have exposure.CLIMATE-RELATED RISK We define climate-related risk as: (1) risks related to the transition to a low-carbon economy, which may include extensive changes pertaining to policy, legal, technology, market and reputational risks, and (2) risks related to the physical impacts of climate change, typically driven by acute physical risk such as increased severity of extreme weather events (e.g., cyclones, hurricanes, floods) and chronic physical risk which are longer-term shifts in climate patterns (e.g., sea level rise, chronic heat waves). Such transition and physical risk events driven by climate change can have broad impact to our customers, operations, suppliers and business.Climate-related risk is interconnected and overarching across all risk types as it may manifest as credit risk, operational risk, market risk, liquidity risk and other risk types. We continue to enhance our focus on climate-related risk within our risk governance framework. We are currently performing a risk identification process for climate-related risk to determine the meaningfulness and measurability of the risk. Furthermore, Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) issues with an emphasis on climate-related risk are currently identified as an “emerging risk” within our risk governance framework. 77Table of ContentsCRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATESRefer to Note 1 to the “Consolidated Financial Statements” for a summary of our significant accounting policies. Certain of our accounting policies requiring significant management assumptions and judgments are as follows:RESERVES FOR CARD MEMBER CREDIT LOSSESReserves for Card Member credit losses represent our best estimate of the expected credit losses in our outstanding portfolio of Card Member loans and receivables as of the balance sheet date. The CECL methodology, which became effective January 1, 2020, requires us to estimate lifetime expected credit losses by incorporating historical loss experience, as well as current and future economic conditions over a reasonable and supportable period (R&S Period) beyond the balance sheet date.In estimating expected credit losses, we use a combination of statistically based models and analysis of the results produced by these models to determine the quantitative and qualitative components of our total balance sheet reserves for credit losses. These quantitative and qualitative components entail a significant amount of judgment. The primary areas of judgment used in measuring the quantitative components of our reserves relate to the determination of the appropriate R&S Period, the modeling of the probability of and exposure at default, and the methodology to incorporate current and future economic conditions. We use these models and assumptions, combined with historical loss experience, to determine the reserve rates that are applied to the outstanding loan or receivable balances to produce our reserves for expected credit losses for the R&S Period. The qualitative component is intended to capture expected losses that may not have been fully captured in the quantitative component. Through an established governance structure, we consider certain external and internal factors, including emerging portfolio characteristics and trends, which consequentially may increase or decrease the reserves for Card Member credit losses.The R&S Period, which is approximately three years, represents the maximum time-period beyond the balance sheet date over which we can reasonably estimate expected credit losses, using all available portfolio information, current economic conditions and forecasts of future economic conditions. Card Member loan products do not have a contractual term and balances can revolve if minimum required payments are made, causing some balances to remain outstanding beyond the R&S Period. To determine expected credit losses beyond the R&S Period, we immediately revert to long-term average loss rates. Card Member receivable products are contractually required to be paid in full; therefore, we have assumed the balances will be either paid or written-off no later than 180 days past due.Within the R&S Period, our models use past loss experience and current and future economic conditions to estimate the probability of default, exposure at default and expected recoveries to estimate net losses at default. A significant area of judgment relates to how we apply future Card Member payments to the reporting period balances when determining the exposure at default. The nature of revolving loan products inherently includes a relationship between future payments and spend behavior, which creates complexity in the application of how future payments are either partially or entirely attributable to the existing balance at the end of the reporting period. Using historical customer behavior and other factors, we have assumed that future payments are first allocated to interest and fees associated with the reporting period balance and future spend. We then allocate a portion of the payment to the estimated higher minimum payment amount due because of any future spend. Any remaining portion of the future payment is then allocated to the remaining reporting period balance.CECL requires that the R&S Period include an assumption about current and future economic conditions. We incorporate multiple macroeconomic scenarios provided to us by an independent third party. The estimated credit losses calculated from each macroeconomic scenario are reviewed each period and weighted to reflect management's judgment about uncertainty surrounding these scenarios. These macroeconomic scenarios contain certain variables, including unemployment rates and real GDP, that are significant to our models.78Table of ContentsMacroeconomic SensitivityTo demonstrate the sensitivity of estimated credit losses to the macroeconomic scenarios, we compared our modeled estimates under a baseline scenario to that under a pessimistic downside scenario. For every 10 percentage points change in weighting from the baseline scenario to the pessimistic downside scenario, the estimated credit losses increased by approximately $110 million.The modeled estimates under these scenarios were influenced by the duration, severity and timing of changes in economic variables within each scenario and these macroeconomic scenarios, under different conditions or using different assumptions, could result in significantly different estimated credit losses. It is difficult to estimate how potential changes in specific factors might affect the estimated credit losses, and current results may not be indicative of the potential future impact of macroeconomic forecast changes.In addition, this sensitivity analysis relates only to the modeled credit loss estimates under two scenarios without considering management’s judgment on the relative weighting for those and other scenarios, including the weight that has been placed on the downside scenario at the balance sheet date, or any potential changes in other adjustments to the quantitative reserve component or the impact of management judgment for the qualitative reserve component, which may have a positive or negative effect on the results. Thus, the results of this sensitivity analysis are hypothetical and are not intended to estimate or reflect our expectations of any changes in the overall reserves for credit losses due to changes in the macroeconomic environment.Refer to Note 3 to the “Consolidated Financial Statements” for further information on the range of macroeconomic scenario key variables used, in conjunction with other inputs described above, to calculate reserves for Card Member credit losses.The process of estimating these reserves requires a high degree of judgment. To the extent our expected credit loss models are not indicative of future performance, actual losses could differ significantly from our judgments and expectations, resulting in either higher or lower future provisions for credit losses in any period.79Table of ContentsLIABILITY FOR MEMBERSHIP REWARDSThe Membership Rewards program is our largest card-based rewards program. Card Members can earn points for purchases charged on their enrolled card products. A significant portion of our cards, by their terms, allow Card Members to earn bonus points for purchases at merchants in particular industry categories. Membership Rewards points are redeemable for a broad variety of rewards, including travel, shopping, gift cards, and covering eligible charges. Points typically do not expire, and there is no limit on the number of points a Card Member may earn. Membership Rewards expense is driven by charge volume on enrolled cards, customer participation in the program and contractual arrangements with redemption partners.We record a Membership Rewards liability that represents our best estimate of the cost of points earned that are expected to be redeemed by Card Members in the future. The Membership Rewards liability is impacted over time by enrollment levels, attrition, the volume of points earned and redeemed, and the associated redemption costs. We estimate the Membership Rewards liability by determining the URR and the weighted average cost (WAC) per point, which are applied to the points of current enrollees. Refer to Note 9 to the “Consolidated Financial Statements” for additional information.The URR assumption is used to estimate the number of points earned by current enrollees that will ultimately be redeemed in future periods. We use statistical and actuarial models to estimate the URR of points earned to date by current Card Members based on redemption trends, card product type, enrollment tenure, card spend levels and credit attributes. The WAC per point assumption is used to estimate future redemption costs and is primarily based on redemption choices made by Card Members, reward offerings by partners, and Membership Rewards program changes. The WAC per point assumption is derived from 12 months of redemptions and is adjusted as appropriate for certain changes in redemption costs that are not representative of future cost expectations and expected developments in redemption patterns.We periodically evaluate our liability estimation process and assumptions based on developments in redemption patterns, cost per point redeemed, partner contract changes and other factors.The process of estimating the Membership Rewards liability includes a high degree of judgment. Actual redemptions and associated redemption costs could differ significantly from our estimates, resulting in either higher or lower Membership Rewards expense.Changes in the Membership Rewards URR and WAC per point have the effect of either increasing or decreasing the liability through the current period Membership Rewards expense by an amount estimated to cover the cost of all points previously earned but not yet redeemed by current enrollees as of the end of the reporting period. As of December 31, 2021, an increase in the estimated URR of current enrollees of 25 basis points would increase the Membership Rewards liability and corresponding rewards expense by approximately $140 million. Similarly, an increase in the WAC per point of 1 basis point would increase the Membership Rewards liability and corresponding rewards expense by approximately $168 million.80Table of ContentsGOODWILL RECOVERABILITYGoodwill represents the excess of acquisition cost of an acquired business over the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed. Goodwill is not amortized but is tested for impairment at the reporting unit level annually or when events or circumstances arise, such as adverse changes in the business climate, that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of the reporting unit below its carrying value. Our methodology for conducting this goodwill impairment testing contains both a qualitative and quantitative assessment.We have the option to initially perform an assessment of qualitative factors in order to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount. The qualitative factors may include, but are not limited to, economic conditions, industry and market considerations, cost factors, overall financial performance of the reporting unit and other company and reporting unit-specific events. If we determine that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, we then perform the impairment evaluation using a more detailed quantitative assessment. We could also directly perform this quantitative assessment for any reporting unit, bypassing the qualitative assessment.Our methodology for conducting the quantitative goodwill impairment testing is fundamentally based on the measurement of fair value for our reporting units, which inherently entails the use of significant management judgment. For valuation, we use a combination of the income approach (discounted cash flows) and market approach (market multiples) in estimating the fair value of our reporting units.When preparing discounted cash flow models under the income approach, we estimate future cash flows using the reporting unit’s internal multi-year forecast, and a terminal value calculated using a growth rate that we believe is appropriate in light of current and expected future economic conditions. To discount these cash flows we use our expected cost of equity, determined using a capital asset pricing model. When using the market method under the market approach, we apply comparable publicly traded companies’ multiples (e.g., earnings, revenues) to our reporting units’ actual results. The judgment in estimating forecasted cash flows, discount rates and market comparables is significant, and imprecision could materially affect the fair value of our reporting units.We could be exposed to an increased risk of goodwill impairment if future operating results or macroeconomic conditions differ significantly from management’s current assumptions.INCOME TAXESWe are subject to the income tax laws of the United States, its states and municipalities and those of the foreign jurisdictions in which we operate. These tax laws are complex, and the manner in which they apply to the taxpayer’s facts is sometimes open to interpretation. In establishing a provision for income tax expense, we must make judgments about the application of inherently complex tax laws.Unrecognized Tax BenefitsWe establish a liability for unrecognized tax benefits, which are the differences between a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return and the benefit recognized in the financial statements.In establishing a liability for an unrecognized tax benefit, assumptions may be made in determining whether, and the extent to which, a tax position should be sustained. A tax position is recognized only when it is more likely than not to be sustained upon examination by the relevant taxing authority, based on its technical merits. The amount of tax benefit recognized is the largest benefit that we believe is more likely than not to be realized on ultimate settlement. As new information becomes available, we evaluate our tax positions and adjust our unrecognized tax benefits, as appropriate.Tax benefits ultimately realized can differ from amounts previously recognized due to uncertainties, with any such differences generally impacting the provision for income tax.Deferred Tax Asset RealizationDeferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the differences between the financial statement and tax bases of assets and liabilities using the enacted tax rates expected to be in effect for the years in which the differences are expected to reverse.Since deferred taxes measure the future tax effects of items recognized in the Consolidated Financial Statements, certain estimates and assumptions are required to determine whether it is more likely than not that all or some portion of the benefit of a deferred tax asset will not be realized. In making this assessment, we analyze and estimate the impact of future taxable income, reversing temporary differences and available tax planning strategies. These assessments are performed quarterly, taking into account any new information.Changes in facts or circumstances can lead to changes in the ultimate realization of deferred tax assets due to uncertainties.81Table of ContentsOTHER MATTERSRECENTLY ADOPTED ACCOUNTING STANDARDSRefer to the Recently Adopted Accounting Standards section of Note 1 to the “Consolidated Financial Statements.”GLOSSARY OF SELECTED TERMINOLOGYAdjusted net interest income — A non-GAAP measure that represents net interest income attributable to our Card Member loans (which includes, on a GAAP basis, interest that is deemed uncollectible), excluding the impact of interest expense and interest income not attributable to our Card Member loans.Airline-related volume — Represents spend at airlines as a merchant, which is included within T&E-related volume.Asset securitizations — Asset securitization involves the transfer and sale of loans or receivables to a special-purpose entity created for the securitization activity, typically a trust. The trust, in turn, issues securities, commonly referred to as asset-backed securities that are secured by the transferred loans and receivables. The trust uses the proceeds from the sale of such securities to pay the purchase price for the transferred loans or receivables. The securitized loans and receivables of our Lending Trust and Charge Trust (collectively, the Trusts) are reported as assets and the securities issued by the Trusts are reported as liabilities on our Consolidated Balance Sheets.Average discount rate — This calculation is generally designed to reflect the average pricing at all merchants accepting American Express cards and represents the percentage of network volumes retained by us from spend at merchants we acquire, or from merchants acquired by third parties on our behalf, net of amounts retained by such third parties. The average discount rate, together with network volumes, drive our discount revenue.Billed business — Represents transaction volumes (including cash advances) on cards and other payment products issued by American Express. Billed business is reported as inside the United States or outside the United States based on the location of the issuer.Capital ratios — Represents the minimum standards established by regulatory agencies as a measure to determine whether the regulated entity has sufficient capital to absorb on- and off-balance sheet losses beyond current loss accrual estimates. Refer to the Capital Strategy section under “Consolidated Capital Resources and Liquidity” for further related definitions under Basel III.Card Member — The individual holder of an issued American Express-branded card.Card Member loans — Represents revolve-eligible transactions on our card products, as well as any interest charges and associated card-related fees.Card Member receivables — Represents transactions on our card products and card related fees that need to be paid in full on or before the Card Member's payment due date.Cards-in-force — Represents the number of cards that are issued and outstanding by American Express (proprietary cards-in-force) and cards issued and outstanding under network partnership agreements with banks and other institutions, including joint ventures (GNS cards-in-force), except for GNS retail cobrand cards that had no out-of-store spending activity during the prior twelve months. Basic cards-in-force excludes supplemental cards issued on consumer accounts. Cards-in-force is useful in understanding the size of our Card Member base.Charge cards — Represents cards that generally carry no pre-set spending limits and are primarily designed as a method of payment and not as a means of financing purchases. Each charge card transaction is authorized based on its likely economics reflecting a Card Member’s most recent credit information and spend patterns. Charge Card Members must pay the full amount of balances billed each month, with the exception of balances that can be revolved under lending features offered on certain charge cards, such as Pay Over Time and Plan It, that allow Card Members to pay for eligible purchases with interest over time.Cobrand cards — Cards issued under cobrand agreements with selected commercial partners. Pursuant to the cobrand agreements, we make payments to our cobrand partners, which can be significant, based primarily on the amount of Card Member spending and corresponding rewards earned on such spending and, under certain arrangements, on the number of accounts acquired and retained. The partner is then liable for providing rewards to the Card Member under the cobrand partner’s own loyalty program.Credit cards — Represents cards that have a range of revolving payment terms, structured payment features (e.g. Plan It), grace periods, and rate and fee structures.Discount revenue — Primarily represents the amount earned on transactions occurring at merchants that have entered into a card acceptance agreement with us, a GNS partner or other third-party merchant acquirer, for facilitating transactions between the merchants and Card Members.82Table of ContentsGoods and Services (G&S)-related volume — Includes spend in merchant categories other than T&E-related merchant categories, which includes B2B spending by small and medium size enterprise customers in our GCS segment.Interest expense — Includes interest incurred primarily to fund Card Member loans and receivables, general corporate purposes and liquidity needs. Interest expense is divided principally into two categories: (i) deposits, which primarily relates to interest expense on deposits taken from customers and institutions, and (ii) debt, which primarily relates to interest expense on our long-term financing and short-term borrowings, (e.g., commercial paper, federal funds purchased, bank overdrafts and other short-term borrowings), as well as the realized impact of derivatives hedging interest rate risk on our long-term debt.Interest income — Includes (i) interest on loans, (ii) interest and dividends on investment securities and (iii) interest income on deposits with banks and other.Interest on loans — Assessed using the average daily balance method for Card Member loans. Unless the loan is classified as non-accrual, interest is recognized based upon the principal amount outstanding in accordance with the terms of the applicable account agreement until the outstanding balance is paid or written off.Interest and dividends on investment securities — Primarily relates to our performing fixed-income securities. Interest income is recognized using the effective interest method, which adjusts the yield for security premiums and discounts, fees and other payments, so a constant rate of return is recognized on the outstanding balance of the related investment security throughout its term. Amounts are recognized until securities are in default or when it is likely that future interest payments will not be made as scheduled.Interest income on deposits with banks and other — Primarily relates to the placement of cash in excess of near-term funding requirements in interest-bearing time deposits, overnight sweep accounts, and other interest-bearing demand and call accounts.Loyalty coalitions — Programs that enable consumers to earn rewards points and use them to save on purchases from a variety of participating merchants through multi-category rewards platforms. Merchants in these programs generally fund the consumer offers and are responsible to us for the cost of rewards points; we earn revenue from operating the loyalty platform and by providing marketing support.Net card fees — Represents the card membership fees earned during the period recognized as revenue over the covered card membership period (typically one year), net of the provision for projected refunds for Card Membership cancellation and deferred acquisition costs.Net interest yield on average Card Member loans — A non-GAAP measure that is computed by dividing adjusted net interest income by average Card Member loans, computed on an annualized basis. Reserves and net write-offs related to uncollectible interest are recorded through provision for credit losses and are thus not included in the net interest yield calculation.Net write-off rate — principal only — Represents the amount of proprietary consumer or small business Card Member loans or receivables written off, consisting of principal (resulting from authorized transactions), less recoveries, as a percentage of the average loan or receivable balance during the period.Net write-off rate — principal, interest and fees — Includes, in the calculation of the net write-off rate, amounts for interest and fees in addition to principal for Card Member loans, and fees in addition to principal for Card Member receivables.Network volumes — Represents the total of billed business and processed volumes. Network volumes are reported as United States or outside the United States based on the location of the issuer.Operating expenses — Represents salaries and employee benefits, professional services, data processing and equipment, and other expenses.Processed volumes — Represents transaction volumes (including cash advances) on cards issued under network partnership agreements with banks and other institutions, including joint ventures, as well as alternative payment solutions facilitated by American Express. Processed volume is reported as United States or outside the United States based on the location of the issuer.Reserve build (release) — Represents the portion of the provisions for credit losses for the period related to increasing or decreasing reserves for credit losses as a result of, among other things, changes in volumes, macroeconomic outlook, portfolio composition and credit quality of portfolios. Reserve build represents the amount by which the provision for credit losses exceeds net write-offs, while reserve release represents the amount by which net write-offs exceed the provision for credit losses.Return on average equity — Calculated by dividing the preceding twelve months of net income by one-year monthly average total shareholders’ equity.T&E-related volume — Represents spend on travel and entertainment, which primarily includes airline, cruise, lodging and dining merchant categories.83Table of ContentsCAUTIONARY NOTE REGARDING FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTSThis report includes forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, which are subject to risks and uncertainties.

We undertake no obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statements. Factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from these forward-looking statements, include, but are not limited to, the following:•our ability to grow earnings per share in the future, which will depend in part on revenue growth, credit performance and the effective tax rate remaining consistent with current expectations and our ability to continue investing in customers, brand and talent, controlling operating expenses, effectively managing risk and executing our share repurchase program; any of which could be impacted by, among other things, the factors identified in the subsequent paragraphs as well as the following: the extent and duration of the effect of the pandemic on the economy, inflation, consumer confidence, consumer and business spending, and customer behaviors, such as with respect to travel, dining, shopping and in-person events; the impact on consumers and businesses as forbearance and government support programs end; the continued stress on businesses due to containment measures, operational changes, supply chain issues and staffing shortages; issues impacting brand perceptions and our reputation; the impact of any future contingencies, including, but not limited to, restructurings, investment gains, impairments, changes in reserves, legal costs, the imposition of fines or civil money penalties and increases in Card Member reimbursements; impacts related to new or renegotiated cobrand and other partner agreements; and the impact of regulation and litigation, which could affect the profitability of our business activities, limit our ability to pursue business opportunities, require changes to business practices or alter our relationships with partners, merchants and Card Members;•our ability to grow revenues net of interest expense, which could be impacted by, among other things, uncertainty regarding the continued spread of COVID-19 (including new variants) and the availability, distribution and use of effective treatments and vaccines; a deterioration in global economic and business conditions; consumer and business spending not growing in line with expectations; prolonged measures to contain the spread of COVID-19 (including travel restrictions), concern of the possible imposition of further containment measures or premature easing of such containment measures, any of which could further exacerbate the effects on business activity and our Card Members, partners and merchants; health concerns associated with the pandemic continuing to affect customer behaviors, spending levels and preferences, and travel patterns and demand even after containment measures are lifted; the amount and efficacy of investments in share, scale and relevance; growth in Card Member loans and the yield on Card Member loans not remaining consistent with current expectations; the average discount rate changing by a greater or lesser amount than expected; an inability of business partners to meet their obligations to us and our customers due to slowdowns or disruptions in their businesses, bankruptcy or liquidation, or otherwise;

Beginning in the first quarter of 2022, we made reporting presentation changes to our Consolidated Statements of Income to separately present revenues earned from processed volumes, previously reported in Discount revenue, Other fees and commissions and Other revenue, as Processed revenue. The remaining balances from Other fees and commissions and Other revenue were combined as Service fees and other revenue. We also disaggregated Marketing and business development expense into Business Development expense and Marketing expense.

See Tables 5 and 6 for more details on billed business performance.Net card fees increased, primarily driven by growth in our premium card portfolios.Service fees and other revenue increased, primarily driven by foreign exchange related revenues associated with Card Member cross-currency spending, higher travel commissions and fees from our consumer travel business, and growth in delinquency fees. The increase was partially offset by a non-cash gain related to an increase in GBTG's total equity book value in the prior year.Processed revenue increased, primarily driven by an increase in processed volumes, partially offset by the prior-year repositioning of certain of our alternative payment solutions.Interest income increased, primarily driven by higher average Card Member loan balances and interest rates.Interest expense increased, primarily driven by higher interest rates paid on deposits and debt outstanding.44Table of ContentsTABLE 3: PROVISIONS FOR CREDIT LOSSES SUMMARYYears Ended December 31,ChangeChange(Millions, except percentages)2022202120202022 vs. 20212021 vs. 2020Card Member loansNet write-offs$1,066 $879 $2,170 $187 21 %$(1,291)(59)%Reserve build (release) (a)448 (2,034)1,283 2,482 #(3,317)#Total1,514 (1,155)3,453 2,669 #(4,608)#Card Member receivablesNet write-offs462 129 881 333 #(752)(85)Reserve build (release) (a)165 (202)134 367 #(336)#Total627 (73)1,015 700 #(1,088)#OtherNet write-offs — Other loans (b)22 21 111 1 5 (90)(81)Net write-offs — Other receivables (c)15 33 27 (18)(55)6 22 Reserve build (release) — Other loans (a)(b)7 (185)66 192 #(251)#Reserve (release) build — Other receivables (a)(c)(3)(60)58 57 95 (118)#Total41 (191)262 232 #(453)#Total provisions for credit losses$2,182 $(1,419)$4,730 $3,601 # %$(6,149)# %# Denotes a variance of 100 percent or more(a)Refer to the “Glossary of Selected Terminology” for a definition of reserve build (release).(b)Relates to Other loans of $5.4 billion, $2.9 billion and $2.9 billion less reserves of $59 million, $52 million and $238 million, as of December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively.(c)Relates to Other receivables included in Other assets on the Consolidated Balance Sheets of $3.1 billion, $2.7 billion and $3.0 billion, less reserves of $22 million, $25 million and $85 million as of December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively.PROVISIONS FOR CREDIT LOSSESCard Member loans and receivables provisions for credit losses increased, primarily due to reserve builds in the current year, versus reserve releases in the prior year. The reserve builds in the current year were primarily driven by increases in loans and receivables outstanding, higher delinquencies and changes in macroeconomic forecasts, partially offset by the release of COVID-19 pandemic-driven reserves for Card Member loans. The reserve releases in the prior year were due to improved portfolio quality and macroeconomic forecasts, partially offset by increases in loans and receivables outstanding.Other provisions for credit losses increased, primarily due to a net reserve build in the current year, versus a reserve release in the prior year. The net reserve build in the current year was primarily driven by increases in non-card loans outstanding, partially offset by improved credit performance. The reserve release in the prior year was due to improved portfolio quality and macroeconomic forecasts.Refer to Note 3 to the “Consolidated Financial Statements” for further information regarding our reserves for credit losses.45Table of ContentsTABLE 4: EXPENSES SUMMARYYears Ended December 31,ChangeChange(Millions, except percentages)2022202120202022 vs. 20212021 vs. 2020Card Member rewards$14,002 $11,007 $8,041 $2,995 27 %$2,966 37 %Business development4,943 3,762 3,051 1,181 31 711 23 Card Member services2,959 1,993 1,230 966 48 763 62 Marketing5,458 5,291 3,696 167 3 1,595 43 Salaries and employee benefits7,252 6,240 5,718 1,012 16 522 9 Other, net6,481 4,817 5,325 1,664 35 (508)(10)Total expenses$41,095 $33,110 $27,061 $7,985 24 %$6,049 22 %EXPENSESCard Member rewards expense increased, primarily driven by increases in Membership Rewards and cash back rewards expenses, collectively, of $2.0 billion, and cobrand rewards expense of $1.0 billion, both of which were primarily driven by higher billed business. The increase in Membership Rewards expense was also driven by a larger proportion of spend in categories that earn incremental rewards such as travel and a higher mix of redemptions in travel-related categories.The Membership Rewards Ultimate Redemption Rate (URR) for current program participants was 96 percent (rounded down) at both December 31, 2022 and 2021.Business development expense increased, primarily due to increased partner payments and client incentives, both of which were driven by higher network volumes.Card Member services expense increased, primarily due to higher usage of travel-related benefits.Marketing expense increased, primarily due to business investments to drive growth momentum and accelerate new card acquisitions.Salaries and employee benefits expense increased, primarily driven by higher compensation costs, reflecting an increase in our colleague base to support business growth as well as compensation decisions made.Other expenses increased, primarily driven by net losses on Amex Ventures investments in the current year, as compared to net gains in the prior year.INCOME TAXESThe effective tax rate was 21.6 percent and 24.6 percent for 2022 and 2021, respectively. The reduction in the effective tax rate primarily reflected discrete tax benefits in the current year related to the resolution of prior-year tax items. The tax rates in both years reflected the level of pretax income in relation to recurring permanent tax benefits and the geographic mix of business.46Table of ContentsTABLE 5: SELECTED CARD-RELATED STATISTICAL INFORMATIONChangeChangeYears Ended December 31,2022202120202022 vs. 20212021 vs. 2020Network volumes (billions)$1,552.8$1,284.2$1,037.821 %24 %Billed business$1,338.3$1,089.8$870.723 25 Processed volumes$214.5$194.4$167.110 16 Cards-in-force (millions)133.3121.7112.010 9 Proprietary cards-in-force76.771.468.97 4 Basic cards-in-force (millions)111.5100.791.311 10 Proprietary basic cards-in-force59.154.752.78 4 Average proprietary basic Card Member spending (dollars)$23,496$20,392$16,35215 25 Average discount rate2.34 %2.30 %2.28 %Average fee per card (dollars)(a)$82$74$6711 %10 %(a)Average fee per card is computed on an annualized basis based on proprietary Net card fees divided by average proprietary total cards-in-force.TABLE 6: NETWORK VOLUMES-RELATED STATISTICAL INFORMATION 20222021Year over Year Percentage Increase(Decrease)Percentage Increase (Decrease) Assuming No Changes in FX Rates(a)Year over Year Percentage Increase(Decrease)Percentage Increase (Decrease)Assuming No Changes in FX Rates(a)Network volumes21 %24 %24 %23 %Total billed business23 25 25 24 U.S. Consumer Services24 32 Commercial Services21 22 21 20 International Card Services23 36 22 18 Processed volumes10 18 16 14 Merchant industry billed business metricsG&S-related (75% and 81% of billed business for 2022 and 2021, respectively)13 16 19 18 T&E-related (25% and 19% of billed business for 2022 and 2021, respectively)64 67 59 58 Airline-related (6% and 3% of billed business for 2022 and 2021, respectively)119 %125 %63 %61 %(a)The foreign currency adjusted information assumes a constant exchange rate between the periods being compared for purposes of currency translation into U.S. dollars (i.e., assumes the foreign exchange rates used to determine results for the current year apply to the corresponding prior-year period against which such results are being compared).47Table of ContentsTABLE 7: SELECTED CREDIT-RELATED STATISTICAL INFORMATIONAs of or for the Years Ended December 31,ChangeChange(Millions, except percentages and where indicated)2022202120202022 vs. 20212021 vs. 2020Card Member loans:Card Member loans (billions)$108.0 $88.6 $73.4 22 %21 %Credit loss reserves:Beginning balance $3,305 $5,344 $4,027 (38)33 Provisions — principal, interest and fees1,514 (1,155)3,453 ##Net write-offs — principal less recoveries(837)(672)(1,795)25 (63)Net write-offs — interest and fees less recoveries(229)(207)(375)11 (45)Other (a)(6)(5)34 (20)#Ending balance$3,747 $3,305 $5,344 13 (38)% of loans3.5 %3.7 %7.3 %% of past due348 %555 %727 %Average loans (billions)$95.4 $76.1 $74.6 25 2 Net write-off rate — principal, interest and fees (b)1.1 %1.2 %2.9 %Net write-off rate — principal only (b)0.9 %0.9 %2.4 %30+ days past due as a % of total1.0 %0.7 %1.0 %Card Member receivables:Card Member receivables (billions)$57.6 $53.6 $43.7 7 23 Credit loss reserves:Beginning balance$64 $267 $126 (76)#Provisions — principal and fees627 (73)1,015 ##Net write-offs — principal and fees less recoveries (c)(462)(129)(881)#(85)Other (a)— (1)7 ##Ending balance$229 $64 $267 # %(76)%% of receivables0.4 %0.1 %0.6 %Net write-off rate — principal and fees (b)(c)(d)0.8 %0.3 %2.0 %# Denotes a variance of 100 percent or more(a)Other includes foreign currency translation adjustments.(b)We present a net write-off rate based on principal losses only (i.e., excluding interest and/or fees) to be consistent with industry convention.

Refer to “Glossary of Selected Terminology” for the definitions of these terms. We believe adjusted net interest income is useful to investors because it represents the interest expense and interest income attributable to our Card Member loan portfolio and is a component of net interest yield on average Card Member loans, which provides a measure of profitability of our Card Member loan portfolio. Net interest yield on average Card Member loans reflects adjusted net interest income divided by average Card Member loans, computed on an annualized basis. Net interest income divided by average Card Member loans, computed on an annualized basis, a GAAP measure, includes elements of total interest income and total interest expense that are not attributable to the Card Member loan portfolio, and thus is not representative of net interest yield on average Card Member loans.49Table of ContentsBUSINESS SEGMENT RESULTS OF OPERATIONSWe consider a combination of factors when evaluating the composition of our reportable operating segments, including the results reviewed by the chief operating decision maker, economic characteristics, products and services offered, classes of customers, product distribution channels, geographic considerations (primarily United States versus outside the United States) and regulatory considerations. Refer to Note 24 to the “Consolidated Financial Statements” and Part I, Item 1. “Business” for additional discussion of products and services that comprise each segment.Effective for the third quarter of 2022, we realigned our reportable segments to reflect organizational changes announced during the second quarter of 2022. Prior periods presented herein have been recast to conform to the new reportable operating segments, which are: USCS, CS, ICS and GMNS, with corporate functions and certain other businesses and operations included in Corporate & Other. Refer to Note 24 to the “Consolidated Financial Statements” for additional information.Results of the reportable operating segments generally treat each segment as a stand-alone business. The management reporting process that derives these results allocates revenue and expense using various methodologies as described below.TOTAL REVENUES NET OF INTEREST EXPENSEWe allocate discount revenue and certain other revenues among segments using a transfer pricing methodology. Within the USCS, CS and ICS segments, discount revenue generally reflects the issuer component of the overall discount revenue generated by each segment’s Card Members; within the GMNS segment, discount revenue generally reflects the network and acquirer component of the overall discount revenue being allocated.Net card fees, processed revenue and certain other revenues are directly attributable to the segment in which they are reported.Interest and fees on loans and certain investment income is directly attributable to the segment in which it is reported. Interest expense represents an allocated funding cost based on a combination of segment funding requirements and internal funding rates.PROVISIONS FOR CREDIT LOSSESThe provisions for credit losses are directly attributable to the segment in which they are reported.EXPENSESCard Member rewards and Card Member services expenses are included in each segment based on the actual expenses incurred. Business development and Marketing expenses are included in each segment based on the actual expenses incurred. Global brand advertising is primarily allocated to the segments based on the relative levels of revenue. Salaries and employee benefits and other expenses reflect both costs incurred directly within each segment, as well as allocated expenses. The allocated expenses include service costs, which primarily reflect salaries and benefits associated with our technology and customer servicing groups, and overhead expenses. Service costs are allocated based on activities directly attributable to the segment, and overhead expenses are allocated based on the relative levels of revenue and Card Member loans and receivables.50Table of ContentsU.S. CONSUMER SERVICESTABLE 9: USCS SELECTED INCOME STATEMENT DATAYears Ended December 31,ChangeChange(Millions, except percentages)2022202120202022 vs. 20212021 vs. 2020RevenuesNon-interest revenues$16,440 $12,989 $10,125 $3,451 27 %$2,864 28 %Interest income8,457 6,328 7,009 2,129 34 (681)(10)Interest expense983 395 787 588 #(392)(50)Net interest income7,474 5,933 6,222 1,541 26 (289)(5)Total revenues net of interest expense23,914 18,922 16,347 4,992 26 2,575 16 Provisions for credit losses1,021 (919)2,617 1,940 #(3,536)#Total revenues net of interest expense after provisions for credit losses22,893 19,841 13,730 3,052 15 6,111 45 Total expenses17,493 13,883 10,627 3,610 26 3,256 31 Pretax segment income$5,400 $5,958 $3,103 $(558)(9)%$2,855 92 %# Denotes a variance of 100 percent or moreUSCS issues a wide range of proprietary consumer cards and provides services to U.S. consumers, including travel and lifestyle services as well as banking and non-card financing products.TOTAL REVENUES NET OF INTEREST EXPENSENon-interest revenues increased across all revenue categories, primarily driven by higher Discount revenue and Net card fees.Discount revenue increased 25 percent, primarily driven by an increase in U.S. consumer billed business of 24 percent.

Our objective is to retain sufficient levels of capital generated through net income and other sources, such as the exercise of stock options by employees, to maintain a strong balance sheet, provide flexibility to support future business growth, and distribute excess capital to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. See “Dividends and Share Repurchases” below.The level and composition of our consolidated capital position are determined through our Internal Capital Adequacy Assessment Process, which takes into account our business activities, as well as marketplace conditions and requirements or expectations of credit rating agencies, regulators and shareholders, among others. As a bank holding company, we are subject to regulatory requirements administered by the U.S. federal banking agencies. The Federal Reserve has established specific capital adequacy guidelines that involve quantitative measures of assets, liabilities and certain off-balance sheet items. Failure to maintain minimum regulatory capital levels at American Express or our U.S. bank subsidiary, American Express National Bank (AENB), could affect our status as a financial holding company and cause the banking regulators with oversight of American Express or AENB to take actions that could limit our business operations.We seek to maintain capital levels and ratios in excess of the minimum regulatory requirements, specifically within a 10 to 11 percent target range for American Express Company's Common Equity Tier 1 (CET1) risk-based capital ratio.We maintain certain flexibility to shift capital across our businesses as appropriate. For example, we may infuse additional capital into subsidiaries to maintain capital at targeted levels in consideration of debt ratings and regulatory requirements. These infused amounts can affect the capital and liquidity positions at the American Express parent company level or at our subsidiaries.We report our capital ratios using the Basel III capital definitions and the Basel III standardized approach for calculating risk-weighted assets.61Table of ContentsThe following table presents our regulatory risk-based capital and leverage ratios and those of AENB, as of December 31, 2022: TABLE 16: REGULATORY RISK-BASED CAPITAL AND LEVERAGE RATIOSEffective Minimum (a)Ratios as of December 31, 2022Risk-Based CapitalCommon Equity Tier 17.0 %American Express Company10.3 %American Express National Bank11.3Tier 18.5American Express Company11.1American Express National Bank11.3Total10.5American Express Company12.8American Express National Bank13.2Tier 1 Leverage4.0 %American Express Company9.9American Express National Bank9.7 %(a)Represents Basel III minimum requirements and applicable regulatory buffers as defined by the federal banking regulators, which includes the stress capital buffer (SCB) for American Express Company and the capital conservation buffer for AENB.

On- and off-balance sheet items are weighted for risk, with off-balance sheet items converted to balance sheet equivalents, using risk conversion factors, before being allocated a risk-adjusted weight. Off-balance sheet exposures comprise a minimal part of the total risk-weighted assets.Common Equity Tier 1 Risk-Based Capital Ratio — Calculated as CET1 capital, divided by risk-weighted assets. CET1 capital is common shareholders’ equity, adjusted for ineligible goodwill and intangible assets and certain deferred tax assets. CET1 capital is also adjusted for the Current Expected Credit Loss (CECL) final rules, as described below.62Table of ContentsTier 1 Risk-Based Capital Ratio — Calculated as Tier 1 capital, divided by risk-weighted assets. Tier 1 capital is the sum of CET1 capital, preferred shares and third-party non-controlling interests in consolidated subsidiaries, adjusted for capital held by insurance subsidiaries. The minimum requirement for the Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio is 1.5 percent higher than the minimum for the CET1 risk-based capital ratio. We have $1.6 billion of preferred shares outstanding to help address a portion of the Tier 1 capital requirements in excess of common equity requirements. See Note 16 to the ""Consolidated Financial Statements"" for additional information on our preferred shares.Total Risk-Based Capital Ratio — Calculated as the sum of Tier 1 capital and Tier 2 capital, divided by risk-weighted assets. Tier 2 capital is the sum of the reserve for loan and receivable credit losses adjusted for the CECL final rules (limited to 1.25 percent of risk-weighted assets), and $870 million of eligible subordinated notes, adjusted for capital held by insurance subsidiaries. The $870 million of eligible subordinated notes includes the $750 million subordinated debt issued in May 2022 and the $120 million remaining Tier 2 capital credit for the $600 million subordinated debt issued in December 2014.Tier 1 Leverage Ratio — Calculated by dividing Tier 1 capital by our average total consolidated assets for the most recent quarter.We elected to delay the recognition of $0.7 billion of impact to regulatory capital from the adoption of the CECL methodology for two years, followed by a three-year phase-in period at 25 percent once per year beginning January 1, 2022, pursuant to rules issued by federal banking regulators (the CECL final rules). As of January 1, 2023, we have phased in 50 percent of such amount. Refer to “Capital and Liquidity Regulation” under Part 1, Item 1. “Business - Supervision and Regulation” for additional details.As a Category IV firm, we participated in the Federal Reserve's supervisory stress tests in 2022. On August 4, 2022, the Federal Reserve confirmed our SCB of 2.5 percent, which resulted in a minimum CET1 ratio of 7 percent, effective October 1, 2022.DIVIDENDS AND SHARE REPURCHASESWe return capital to common shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. The share repurchases reduce common shares outstanding and generally more than offset the issuance of new shares as part of employee compensation plans.During the year ended December 31, 2022, we returned $4.9 billion to our shareholders in the form of common stock dividends of $1.6 billion and share repurchases of $3.3 billion. We repurchased 20 million common shares at an average price of $168.14 in 2022. These dividend and share repurchase amounts collectively represent approximately 64 percent of total capital generated during the year.We plan to increase the regular quarterly dividend on our common shares outstanding by approximately 15 percent, from 52 cents to 60 cents per share, beginning with the first quarter 2023 dividend declaration.In addition, during the year ended December 31, 2022, we paid $57 million in dividends on non-cumulative perpetual preferred shares outstanding. Refer to Note 16 to the “Consolidated Financial Statements” for additional information on our preferred shares.Our decisions on capital distributions depend on various factors, including: our capital levels and regulatory capital requirements; regulatory guidance or restrictions, actual and forecasted business results; economic and market conditions; revisions to, or revocation of, the Federal Reserve’s authorization of our capital plan; and the supervisory stress test process. We may conduct share repurchases through a variety of methods, including open market purchases, 10b5-1 plans, privately negotiated transactions (including employee benefit plans) or other purchases, including block trades, accelerated share repurchase programs or any combination of such methods as market conditions warrant and at prices we deem appropriate. 63Table of ContentsFUNDING STRATEGYOur principal funding objective is to maintain broad and well-diversified funding sources to allow us to finance our global businesses and to maintain a strong liquidity profile. Our funding strategy and activities are integrated into our asset-liability management activities. We have in place a funding policy covering American Express Company and all of our subsidiaries.Our global proprietary card-issuing businesses generate significant assets in both domestic and international Card Member lending and receivable activities. Our financing needs are in large part a consequence of our proprietary card-issuing businesses, where we generally pay merchants for card transactions prior to reimbursement by Card Members and therefore fund the merchant payments during the period Card Member loans and receivables are outstanding. In addition, we maintain a liquidity position to meet regulatory requirements and support our business activities.We aim to satisfy these financing needs with a diverse set of funding sources. The diversity of funding sources by type of instrument, by tenor and by investor base, among other factors, mitigates the impact of disruptions in any one type of instrument, tenor or investor. We seek to achieve diversity and cost efficiency in our funding sources by maintaining scale and market relevance in deposits, unsecured debt and asset securitizations, and access to secured borrowing facilities and a committed bank credit facility.We expect the balance of our direct deposits to continue to grow. Our funding plan is primarily driven by the size and mix of business asset growth, our liquidity position, and choice of funding sources, as well as cash requirements generated by the redemptions of deposits by our customers, the maturities of debt outstanding and related interest payments. In executing our funding plan, we aim to maintain a balanced debt maturity profile with an appropriate mix of short-term and long-term refinancing requirements.FUNDING PROGRAMS AND ACTIVITIESWe had the following customer deposits and consolidated debt outstanding as of December 31:TABLE 18: SUMMARY OF CUSTOMER DEPOSITS AND CONSOLIDATED DEBT(Billions)20222021Customer deposits$110.2 $84.4 Short-term borrowings1.3 2.2 Long-term debt42.6 38.7 Total customer deposits and debt$154.1 $125.3 We may redeem from time to time certain debt securities prior to the original contractual maturity dates in accordance with the optional redemption provisions of those debt securities.Our funding plan for the full year 2023 includes, among other sources, approximately $6.0 billion to $10.0 billion of unsecured term debt issuance and approximately $5.0 billion to $9.0 billion of secured term debt issuance. Actual funding activities can vary from our plans due to various factors, such as future business growth, the impact of global economic, political and other events on market capacity and funding needs, demand for securities offered by us, regulatory changes, ability to securitize and sell loans and receivables, and the performance of loans and receivables previously sold in securitization transactions. Many of these factors are beyond our control.Our equity capital and funding strategies are designed, among other things, to maintain appropriate and stable unsecured debt ratings from the major credit rating agencies: Moody’s Investor Services (Moody’s), Standard & Poor’s (S&P) and Fitch Ratings (Fitch). Such ratings help support our access to cost-effective unsecured funding as part of our overall funding strategy. Our asset securitization activities are rated separately.64Table of ContentsTABLE 19: UNSECURED DEBT RATINGSAmerican Express EntityMoody'sS&PFitchAmerican Express CompanyLong TermA2BBB+AShort TermN/AA-2F1OutlookStableStableStableAmerican Express Travel Related Services Company, Inc.Long TermA2A-AShort TermPrime-1A-2F1OutlookStableStableStableAmerican Express National BankLong TermA3A-AShort TermPrime-1A-2F1OutlookStableStableStableAmerican Express Credit CorporationLong TermA2A-AShort TermN/AN/AN/AOutlookStableStableStableThese ratings are not a recommendation to buy or hold any of our securities and they may be revised or revoked at any time at the sole discretion of the rating organization.Downgrades in the ratings of our unsecured debt or asset securitization program securities could result in higher funding costs, as well as higher fees related to borrowings under our unused credit facilities. Declines in credit ratings could also reduce our borrowing capacity in the unsecured debt and asset securitization capital markets. We believe our funding mix, including the proportion of U.S. retail deposits insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) to total funding, should reduce the impact that credit rating downgrades would have on our funding capacity and costs.DEPOSIT PROGRAMSWe offer deposits within our U.S. bank subsidiary, AENB. These funds are currently insured up to an amount that is at least $250,000 per account holder through the FDIC. Our ability to obtain deposit funding and offer competitive interest rates is dependent on, among other factors, the capital level of AENB. Direct retail deposits offered by AENB is our primary deposit product channel, which makes FDIC-insured high-yield savings account and certificates of deposit (CDs) products available directly to consumers. AENB also offers checking account products and sources deposits through third-party distribution channels as needed to meet our overall funding objectives. As of December 31, 2022, we had $110.2 billion in deposits. Refer to Note 7 to the “Consolidated Financial Statements” for a further description of these deposits and scheduled maturities of certificates of deposits.SHORT-TERM FUNDING PROGRAMSShort-term borrowings, such as commercial paper, are defined as any debt with an original maturity of twelve months or less, as well as interest-bearing overdrafts with banks. Our short-term funding programs are used primarily to fund working capital needs, such as managing seasonal variations in receivables balances. The amount of short-term borrowings issued in the future will depend on our funding strategy, our needs and market conditions. We had no commercial paper outstanding at any point during 2022. Refer to Note 8 to the “Consolidated Financial Statements” for a further description of these borrowings.65Table of ContentsLONG-TERM DEBT AND ASSET SECURITIZATION PROGRAMSAs of December 31, 2022, we had $42.6 billion in long-term debt outstanding, including unsecured debt and asset-backed securities. Refer to Note 8 to the “Consolidated Financial Statements” for a further description of these borrowings and scheduled maturities of long-term debt obligations.We periodically securitize Card Member loans and receivables arising from our U.S. card business, as the securitization market provides us with cost-effective funding. Securitization of Card Member loans and receivables is accomplished through the transfer of those assets to a trust, which in turn issues securities collateralized by the transferred assets to third-party investors. The proceeds from issuance are distributed to us, through our wholly owned subsidiaries, as consideration for the transferred assets. Refer to Note 5 to the “Consolidated Financial Statements” for a further description of our asset securitizations.TABLE 20: DEBT ISSUANCES(Billions)2022American Express Company:Fixed Rate Senior Notes (weighted-average coupon rate of 3.60%)$10.2 Floating Rate Senior Notes (compounded SOFR (a) plus weighted-average spread of 83 basis points)1.0 Fixed-to-Floating Rate Senior Notes (4.42% coupon during the fixed rate period and compounded SOFR (a) plus 1.76% during the floating rate period)1.2 Fixed-to-Floating Rate Subordinated Notes (4.989% coupon during the fixed rate period and compounded SOFR (a)plus 2.255% during the floating rate period)0.8 American Express Credit Account Master Trust:Fixed Rate Class A Certificates (weighted-average coupon of 3.51%)7.3 Total$20.5 (a)Secured overnight financing rate (SOFR).66Table of ContentsLIQUIDITY MANAGEMENTOur liquidity objective is to maintain access to a diverse set of on- and off-balance sheet liquidity sources. We seek to maintain liquidity sources in amounts sufficient to meet our expected future financial obligations and business requirements for liquidity for a period of at least twelve months in the event we are unable to raise new funds under our regular funding programs during a substantial weakening in economic conditions.Our liquidity management strategy includes a number of elements, including, but not limited to:•Maintaining diversified funding sources (refer to the “Funding Strategy” section for more details);•Maintaining unencumbered liquid assets and off-balance sheet liquidity sources;•Projecting cash inflows and outflows under a variety of economic and market scenarios; and•Establishing clear objectives for liquidity risk management, including compliance with regulatory requirements.We seek to maintain access to a diverse set of on-balance sheet and off-balance sheet liquidity sources, including cash and other liquid assets, committed bank credit facilities and secured borrowing facilities. Through our U.S. bank subsidiary, AENB, we also hold collateral eligible for use at the Federal Reserve’s discount window.The amount and type of liquidity resources we maintain can vary over time, based upon the results of stress scenarios required under the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, as well as additional stress scenarios required under our liquidity risk policy. These stress scenarios possess distinct characteristics, varying by cash flow assumptions, time horizon and qualifying liquidity sources, among other factors. Scenarios under our liquidity risk policy include market-wide, firm-specific and combined liquidity stresses. We consider other factors in determining the amount and type of liquidity we maintain, such as economic and financial market conditions, seasonality in business operations, growth in our businesses, potential acquisitions or dispositions, the cost and availability of alternative liquidity sources and credit rating agency guidelines and requirements. The investment income we receive on liquidity resources has historically been less than the interest expense on the sources of funding for these balances. The level of future net interest income or costs depends on the amount of liquidity resources we maintain and the difference between our cost of funding these amounts and their investment yields.67Table of ContentsSecuritized Borrowing CapacityAs of December 31, 2022, we maintained our committed, revolving, secured borrowing facility, with a maturity date of July 15, 2024, which gives us the right to sell up to $3.0 billion face amount of eligible AAA notes from the American Express Issuance Trust II (the Charge Trust). We also maintained our committed, revolving, secured borrowing facility, with a maturity date of September 16, 2024, which gives us the right to sell up to $2.0 billion face amount of eligible AAA certificates from the American Express Credit Account Master Trust (the Lending Trust). Both facilities are used in the ordinary course of business to fund working capital needs, as well as to further enhance our contingent funding resources. As of December 31, 2022, no amounts were drawn on the Charge Trust facility or the Lending Trust facility.Federal Reserve Discount WindowAs an insured depository institution, AENB may borrow from the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco, subject to the amount of qualifying collateral that it may pledge. The Federal Reserve has indicated that both credit and charge card receivables are a form of qualifying collateral for secured borrowings made through the discount window. Whether specific assets will be considered qualifying collateral and the amount that may be borrowed against the collateral remain at the discretion of the Federal Reserve.As of December 31, 2022, we had approximately $102.8 billion in U.S. credit card loans and charge card receivables that could be sold over time through our securitization trusts or pledged in return for secured borrowings to provide further liquidity, subject in each case to applicable market conditions and eligibility criteria.Committed Bank Credit FacilityIn addition to the secured borrowing facilities described above, as of December 31, 2022 we maintained a committed syndicated bank credit facility of $3.5 billion with a maturity date of October 15, 2024. The availability of the credit facility is subject to our maintenance of a minimum CET1 risk-based capital ratio of 4.5 percent, with certain restrictions in relation to either accessing the facility or distributing capital to common shareholders in the event our CET1 risk-based capital ratio falls between 4.5 percent and 6.5 percent. It does not contain a material adverse change clause, which might otherwise preclude borrowing under the facility, nor is it dependent on our credit rating. As of December 31, 2022, we were in compliance with the covenants contained in the credit facility and no amounts were drawn on the facility. We use this facility from time to time in the ordinary course of business to fund working capital needs. Any undrawn portion of this facility could serve as a backstop for the amount of commercial paper outstanding.Off-balance Sheet ArrangementsWe have certain off-balance sheet obligations that include guarantees, indemnifications and certain Card Member and partner arrangements that may have a material current or future effect on our financial condition, changes in financial condition, results of operations, or liquidity and capital resources. For more information on these obligations, refer to Note 12, Note 15 and Note 23 to the “Consolidated Financial Statements.”68Table of ContentsCASH FLOWSThe following table summarizes our cash flow activity, followed by a discussion of the major drivers impacting operating, investing and financing cash flows for the year ended December 31, 2022 compared to the year ended December 31, 2021:TABLE 21: CASH FLOWS(Billions)202220212020Total cash provided by (used in):Operating activities$21.1 $14.6 $5.6 Investing activities(33.7)(10.5)11.6 Financing activities24.5 (14.9)(9.1)Effect of foreign currency exchange rates on cash and cash equivalents— (0.1)0.4 Net increase (decrease) in cash and cash equivalents$11.9 $(10.9)$8.5 Cash Flows from Operating ActivitiesOur cash flows from operating activities primarily include net income adjusted for (i) non-cash items included in net income, such as provisions for credit losses, depreciation and amortization, stock-based compensation, deferred taxes and other non-cash items and (ii) changes in the balances of operating assets and liabilities, which can vary significantly in the normal course of business due to the amount and timing of payments.In 2022, the net cash provided by operating activities was primarily driven by cash generated from net income for the period and higher net operating liabilities, resulting from higher accounts payable to merchants and an increase in Membership Rewards liability related to growth in billed business. In 2021, the net cash provided by operating activities was primarily driven by cash generated from net income for the period and higher net operating liabilities, resulting from an increase in Membership Rewards liability and higher accounts payable to merchants related to growth in billed business.Cash Flows from Investing ActivitiesOur cash flows from investing activities primarily include changes in Card Member loans and receivables, as well as changes in our available-for-sale investment securities portfolio.In 2022, the net cash used in investing activities was primarily driven by higher Card Member loan and receivable balances, resulting from higher Card Member spending and net purchases of investment securities.In 2021, the net cash used in investing activities was primarily driven by higher Card Member loan and receivable balances, resulting from higher Card Member spending, partially offset by net maturities of our investment securities.Cash Flows from Financing ActivitiesOur cash flows from financing activities primarily include changes in customer deposits, long-term debt and short-term borrowings, as well as dividend payments and share repurchases.In 2022, the net cash provided by financing activities was primarily driven by growth in customer deposits and net proceeds from debt, partially offset by share repurchases and dividend payments.In 2021, the net cash used in financing activities was primarily driven by share repurchases, net debt repayments, decreases in customer deposits, dividends and redemption of preferred shares, partially offset by the proceeds from the issuance of preferred shares.69Table of ContentsRISK MANAGEMENTGOVERNANCEWe use our comprehensive Enterprise-wide Risk Management (ERM) program to identify, aggregate, monitor, measure, report and manage risks. The program also defines our risk appetite, governance, culture and capabilities. The implementation and execution of the ERM program is headed by our Chief Risk Officer.Risk management is overseen by our Board of Directors through three Board committees: the Risk Committee, the Audit and Compliance Committee, and the Compensation and Benefits Committee. Each committee consists entirely of independent directors and provides regular reports to the full Board regarding matters reviewed at their committee. The committees meet regularly in private sessions with our Chief Risk Officer, the Chief Compliance Officer, the Chief Audit Executive and other senior management with regard to our risk management processes, risk profile and performance, controls, talent and capabilities. The Board monitors the “tone at the top,” our risk culture, and oversees emerging and strategic risks.The Risk Committee of our Board of Directors provides oversight of our ERM framework, processes and methodologies. The Risk Committee approves our ERM policy. The ERM policy governs risk governance, risk oversight and risk appetite, including credit risk (at both the individual and institutional levels), operational risk (e.g., operations, legal, conduct, third-party, information technology, information security, data management, privacy and people risks), compliance risk, reputational risk, market risk, funding and liquidity risk, model risk, strategic and business risk, country risk and environmental, social and governance risk. Risk appetite defines the authorized risk limits to control exposures within our risk capacity and risk tolerance, including stressed forward-looking scenarios. In addition, it establishes principles for risk taking in the aggregate and for each risk type, and is supported by a comprehensive system for monitoring performance (including limits and escalation triggers) and assessing control programs.The Risk Committee reviews and concurs with the appointment, replacement, performance and compensation of our Chief Risk Officer and receives regular updates from the Chief Risk Officer on key risks and exposures.The Risk Committee reviews our risk profile against the tolerances specified in the Risk Appetite Framework, including significant risk exposures, risk trends in our portfolios and major risk concentrations.The Risk Committee also provides oversight of our compliance with Regulatory capital and liquidity standards, and our Internal Capital Adequacy Assessment Process, including the CCAR submissions.The Audit and Compliance Committee of our Board of Directors reviews and approves compliance policies, which include our Compliance Risk Tolerance Statement. In addition, the Audit and Compliance Committee reviews the effectiveness of our Corporate-wide Compliance Risk Management Program. More broadly, this committee is responsible for assisting the Board in its oversight responsibilities relating to the integrity of our financial statements and financial reporting process, internal and external auditing, including the qualifications and independence of the independent registered public accounting firm and the performance of our internal audit services function, and the integrity of our systems of internal controls.The Audit and Compliance Committee provides oversight of our Internal Audit Group. The Audit and Compliance Committee reviews and concurs with the appointment, replacement, performance and compensation of our Chief Audit Executive, who reports to the Audit and Compliance Committee, and approves Internal Audit’s annual audit plan, charter, policies, budget and staffing levels, and overall risk assessment methodology. The Audit and Compliance Committee also receives regular updates on the audit plan’s status and results, including significant reports issued by Internal Audit and the status of our corrective actions.The Compensation and Benefits Committee of our Board of Directors works with the Chief Risk Officer to ensure our overall compensation programs, as well as those covering our risk-taking employees, appropriately balance risk with business incentives and that business performance is achieved without taking imprudent or excessive risk. Our Chief Risk Officer is actively involved in setting risk goals for the Company. Our Chief Risk Officer also reviews the risk profiles of each business unit and provides input into performance evaluation. The Chief Risk Officer meets with the Compensation and Benefits Committee and attests whether performance goals and results have been achieved without taking imprudent risks. The Compensation and Benefits Committee uses a risk-balanced incentive compensation framework to decide on our bonus pools and the compensation of senior executives.70Table of ContentsThere are several internal management committees, including the Enterprise Risk Management Committee (ERMC), chaired by our Chief Risk Officer. The ERMC is the highest-level management committee to oversee all firm-wide risks and is responsible for risk governance, risk oversight and risk appetite. It maintains the enterprise-wide risk appetite framework and monitors compliance with limits and escalations defined in it. The ERMC oversees implementation of risk policies company-wide. The ERMC reviews key risk exposures, trends and concentrations, significant compliance matters, and provides guidance on the steps to monitor, control and report major risks. In addition, the Asset Liability Committee, chaired by our Chief Financial Officer, is responsible for managing our capital, funding and liquidity, investment, market risk and asset/liability activities in accordance with our policies and in compliance with applicable regulatory requirements.As defined in the ERM policy, we follow the “three lines of defense” approach to risk management. The first line of defense comprises functions and management committees directly initiating risk taking. The Chief Executive Officer, business unit presidents and the Chief Financial Officer are part of the first line of defense. The second line comprises independent functions overseeing risk-taking activities of the first line. The Chief Risk Officer, the Chief Compliance Officer, the Chief Operational Risk Officer and certain control groups, both at the enterprise level and within regulated entities, are part of the second line of defense. The global risk oversight team oversees the policies, strategies, frameworks, models, processes and capabilities deployed by the first line teams and provides challenges and independent assessments on how the first line of defense is managing risks. Our Internal Audit Group constitutes the third line of defense and provides independent assessments and effective challenge of the first and second lines of defense.CREDIT RISK MANAGEMENT PROCESSWe define credit risk as loss due to default or changes in the credit quality of a customer, obligor or security. Our credit risks are divided into two broad categories: individual and institutional. Each has distinct risk management capabilities, strategies, and tools. Business units that create individual or institutional credit risk exposures of significant importance are supported by dedicated risk management teams, each led by a Chief Credit Officer.Individual Credit RiskIndividual credit risk arises from consumer and small business charge cards, credit cards, and term loans. These portfolios consist of millions of customers across multiple geographies, industries and levels of net worth. We benefit from the high-quality profile of our customers, which is driven by our brand, premium customer servicing, product features and risk management capabilities, which span underwriting, customer management and collections. The risk in these portfolios is generally correlated to broad economic trends, such as unemployment rates and gross domestic product (GDP) growth.The business unit leaders and their Chief Credit Officers take the lead in managing the credit risk process. These Chief Credit Officers are guided by the Individual Credit Risk Committee (ICRC), which is responsible for implementation and enforcement of the Individual Credit Risk Management Policy. The ICRC ensures compliance with ERMC guidelines and procedures and escalates to the ERMC as appropriate. Credit risk management is supported by sophisticated proprietary scoring and decision-making models that use up-to-date information on prospects and customers, such as spending and payment history and data feeds from credit bureaus. We have developed data-driven economic decision logic for customer interactions to better serve our customers.Institutional Credit RiskInstitutional credit risk arises principally within our CS, ICS and GMNS businesses, as well as investment and liquidity management activities. Unlike individual credit risk, institutional credit risk is characterized by a lower loss frequency but higher severity. It is affected both by general economic conditions and by client-specific events. The absence of large losses in any given year or over several years is not necessarily representative of the level of risk of institutional portfolios, given the infrequency of loss events in such portfolios.71Table of ContentsSimilar to individual credit risk, business units taking institutional credit risks are supported by Chief Credit Officers. These officers are guided by the Institutional Risk Management Committee (IRMC), which is responsible for implementation and enforcement of the Institutional Credit Risk Management Policy and for providing guidance to the credit officers of each business unit with substantial institutional credit risk exposures. The committee, along with the business unit Chief Credit Officers, makes investment decisions in core risk capabilities, ensures proper implementation of the underwriting standards and contractual rights for risk mitigation, monitors risk exposures, and determines risk mitigation actions. The IRMC formally reviews large institutional risk exposures to ensure compliance with ERMC guidelines and procedures and escalates them to the ERMC as appropriate. At the same time, the IRMC provides guidance to the business unit risk management teams to optimize risk-adjusted returns on capital. A centralized risk rating unit provides risk assessment of our institutional obligors.Exposure to the Airline and Travel IndustryWe have multiple important cobrand, rewards, merchant acceptance and corporate payments arrangements with airlines. The ERM program evaluates the risks posed by our airline partners and the overall airline strategy company-wide through comprehensive business analysis of global airlines, and the travel industry more broadly, including cruise lines, travel agencies and tour operators. Our largest airline partner is Delta, and this relationship includes an exclusive cobrand credit card partnership and other arrangements including Membership Rewards redemption, merchant acceptance, travel and corporate payments. See “We face intense competition for partner relationships, which could result in a loss or renegotiation of these arrangements that could have a material adverse impact on our business and results of operations” and “Arrangements with our business partners represent a significant portion of our business. We are exposed to risks associated with our business partners, including reputational issues, business slowdowns, bankruptcies, liquidations, restructurings and consolidations, and the possible obligation to make payments to our partners” under “Risk Factors” for additional information.Debt ExposureAs part of our ongoing risk management process, we monitor our financial exposure to both sovereign and non-sovereign customers and counterparties, and measure and manage concentrations of risk by geographic regions, as well as by economic sectors and industries. A primary focus area for monitoring is credit deterioration due to weaknesses in economic and fiscal profiles. We evaluate countries based on the market assessment of the riskiness of their sovereign debt and our assessment of the economic and financial outlook and closely monitor those deemed high risk. As of December 31, 2022, we considered our gross credit exposures to government entities, financial institutions and corporations in those countries deemed high risk to be individually and collectively not material.OPERATIONAL RISK MANAGEMENT PROCESSWe consider operational risk to be the risk of loss due to, among other things, inadequate or failed processes, people or information systems, or impacts from the external environment, including failures to comply with laws and regulations as well as impacts from relationships with third parties. Operational risk is inherent in all business activities and can impact an organization through direct or indirect financial loss, brand damage, customer dissatisfaction, or legal and regulatory penalties.To appropriately measure and manage operational risk, we have implemented a comprehensive operational risk framework that is defined in the Operational Risk Management Policy approved by the ERMC. The Operational Risk Management Committee (ORMC), chaired by the Chief Operational Risk Officer, coordinates with all control groups on effective risk assessments and controls. It also oversees the preventive, responsive and mitigation efforts by Operational Excellence teams in the business units and staff groups.We use the operational risk framework to identify, measure, monitor and report inherent and emerging operational risks. This framework, supervised by the ORMC, consists of (a) operational risk event capture, (b) a project office to coordinate issue management and control enhancements, (c) key risk indicators, and (d) process and entity-level risk assessments.The framework requires the assessment of operational risk events to determine root causes, impact to customers and/or us, and resolution plan accountability to correct any defect, remediate customers, and enhance controls and testing to mitigate future issues. The impact is assessed from an operational, financial, brand, regulatory compliance and legal perspective.72Table of ContentsInformation and Cyber SecurityWe define information and cyber security risk as the risk that a security incident could impact the confidentiality, integrity or availability of American Express customer, colleague or proprietary information.Our information and cyber security program is designed to protect information systems from unauthorized access, use, disclosure, disruption, modification, or destruction. The program is built upon a foundation of advanced security technology, a well-staffed and highly trained team of experts, and operations based on the National Institute of Standards and Technology Cybersecurity Framework. This consists of controls designed to identify, protect, detect, respond and recover from information and cyber security incidents. We continue to invest in enhancements to cyber security capabilities and engage in industry and government forums to promote advancements to the broader financial services cyber security ecosystem.See “A major information or cyber security incident or an increase in fraudulent activity could lead to reputational damage to our brand and material legal, regulatory and financial exposure, and could reduce the use and acceptance of our products and services” under “Risk Factors” for additional information.Information TechnologyWe define information technology risk as the risk that events or circumstances could compromise the processing, stability, capacity, performance, or resilience of information technology and cause financial, reputational, and/or regulatory impacts.We manage information technology risk through our policies, procedures, governance structure, and control framework to preserve the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of systems and processes across our Company.See “The uninterrupted operation of our information systems is critical to our success and a significant disruption could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations” under “Risk Factors” for additional information.Privacy We define privacy risk as the risk of financial loss, reputational damage, or regulatory or legal action resulting from decisions related to the violation of applicable laws, rules, regulations, contractual obligations, or the non-adherence to privacy policies, disclosures, or standards that apply to the processing of personal data.The Global Privacy Policy establishes the privacy framework and defines the American Express Data Protection & Privacy Principles, which governs the way we collect, use, store, share, transmit, delete or otherwise process our customer and colleague personal data globally. Chaired by the Chief Privacy Officer, the Privacy Risk Management Committee, a sub-committee of the ORMC, provides oversight and governance for our privacy program.Data Management and GovernanceWe define data management and governance risk as the risk of financial, reputational, and/or regulatory impacts due to inadequate data governance and/or data management practices adversely impacting the accuracy, completeness, timeliness, comprehensiveness or usability of data throughout its lifecycle. Our Enterprise Data Governance Policy establishes the framework for defining in-scope critical data and the requirements for managing such data effectively throughout its lifecycle as a critical corporate asset. This policy is approved by the ERMC. Chaired by the Chief Data Officer, our Enterprise Data Committee, a sub-committee of the ERMC, provides governance and oversight for our enterprise-wide data governance and management activities.73Table of ContentsThird Party RiskWe define third party risk as the risk that relationships with third parties (including their significant subcontractors) create unexpected outcomes and deviations from expectations or stated obligations. The Third Party Management Policy is approved by the Risk Committee of our Board and the ERMC. It sets forth the procurement, risk management, and contracting framework for managing third-party relationships commensurate with their risk and complexity. Our Third Party Lifecycle Management program sets guidelines for identifying, measuring, monitoring, and reporting the risk associated with third parties through the life cycle of the relationships, which includes planning, due diligence and third-party selection, contracting, ongoing monitoring and termination.Conduct RiskWe define conduct risk as the risk that colleagues, intentionally or unintentionally, fail to fulfill their responsibilities to American Express, our customers, colleagues or stakeholders in a manner consistent with our Code of Conduct, policies and values as well as applicable laws and regulations. Conduct issues also have the potential to increase several other risk types, including reputational risk, which may undermine the integrity and trust upon which our brand is built. The Conduct Risk Management Policy is approved by the ERMC. It establishes the governance framework for conduct risk across the Company. The policy requires annual risk assessments, implementation of detective and preventive controls, colleague training and timely escalations of conduct issues. It also provides guidance on consequence management for any substantiated cases of misconduct. The Conduct Risk Committee oversees conduct risk related topics and escalates such matters to the ERMC, as appropriate.COMPLIANCE RISK MANAGEMENT PROCESSWe define compliance risk as the risk of legal or reputational harm, fines, monetary penalties and payment of damages or other forms of sanction as a result of non-compliance with applicable laws and/or regulations, internal policies and procedures and related practices, or ethical standards.We view our ability to effectively mitigate compliance risk as an important aspect of our business model. Our Global Compliance and Ethics organization is responsible for establishing and maintaining our corporate-wide Compliance Risk Management Program. Pursuant to this program, we seek to manage and mitigate compliance risk by assessing, controlling, monitoring, measuring and reporting the legal and regulatory risks to which we are exposed. The Compliance Risk Management Committee (CRMC), chaired by the Chief Compliance Officer, is responsible for identifying, evaluating, managing, and escalating compliance risks. The CRMC has a dual reporting relationship directly to both the ERMC and the Audit and Compliance Committee.We have a comprehensive Anti-Money Laundering program that monitors and reports suspicious activity to the appropriate government authorities. The program includes an independent risk assessment of the rules used by the Anti-Money Laundering team. In addition, the Internal Audit Group reviews the processes for practices consistent with regulatory guidance.REPUTATIONAL RISK MANAGEMENT PROCESSWe define reputational risk as the risk that negative stakeholder reaction to our products, services, client and partner relationships, business activities and policies, management and workplace culture, or our response to unexpected events, could cause sustained critical media coverage, a decline in revenue or investment, talent attrition, litigation, or government or regulatory scrutiny.We view protecting our reputation for excellent customer service, trust, security and high integrity as core to our vision of providing the world’s best customer experience and fundamental to our long-term success.Our business leaders are responsible for considering the reputational risk implications of business activities and strategies and ensuring the relevant subject matter experts are engaged as needed. The ERMC is responsible for ensuring reputational risk considerations are included in the scope of appropriate subordinate risk policies and committees and properly reflected in all decisions escalated to the ERMC.74Table of ContentsMARKET RISK MANAGEMENT PROCESSWe define market risk as the risk to earnings or asset and liability values resulting from movements in market prices. Our market risk exposures include (i) interest rate risk due to changes in the relationship between the interest rates on our assets (such as loans, receivables and investment securities) and the interest rates on our liabilities (such as debt and deposits) and (ii) foreign exchange risk related to transactions, funding, investments and earnings in currencies other than the U.S. dollar.Our risk policies establish the framework that guides and governs market risk management, including quantitative limits and escalation triggers. These policies are approved by the ERMC, Asset Liability Committee or Market Risk Management Committee.Market risk is managed by the Market Risk Management Committee. The Market Risk Oversight Officer provides an independent risk assessment and oversight over the policies and exposure management for market risk and Asset Liability Management activities, as well as overseeing compliance with associated regulatory requirements. Market risk management is also guided and governed by policies covering the use of derivative financial instruments, funding, liquidity and investments.Interest Rate RiskWe analyze a variety of interest rate scenarios to inform us of the potential impacts from interest rate changes on earnings and the value of assets, liabilities and the economic value of equity. Our interest rate exposure can vary over time as a result of, among other things, the proportion of our total funding provided by variable and fixed-rate debt and deposits compared to our Card Member loans and receivables. Interest rate swaps are used from time to time to effectively convert debt issuances to variable-rate from fixed-rate, or vice versa. Refer to Note 13 to the “Consolidated Financial Statements” for further discussion of our derivative financial instruments.As of December 31, 2022, a hypothetical, immediate 100 basis point increase in market interest rates would have a detrimental impact of approximately $141 million on our annual net interest income. This measure first projects net interest income over the following twelve-month time horizon considering forecasted business growth and anticipated future market interest rates. The detrimental impact from rate changes is then measured by instantaneously increasing or decreasing the anticipated future interest rates by 100 basis points. Our estimated repricing risk assumes that our interest-rate sensitive assets and liabilities that reprice within the twelve-month horizon generally reprice by the same magnitude, subject to applicable interest rate caps or floors, as benchmark rates change. It is further assumed that, within our interest-rate sensitive liabilities, certain deposits reprice at lower magnitudes than benchmark rate movements, and the magnitude of this repricing in turn depends on, among other factors, the direction of rate movements. These assumptions are consistent with historical deposit repricing experience in the industry and within our own portfolio. Actual changes in our net interest income will depend on many factors, and therefore may differ from our estimated risk to changes in market interest rates. Foreign Exchange RiskForeign exchange exposures arise in four principal ways: (1) Card Member spending in currencies that are not the billing currency, (2) cross-currency transactions and balances from our funding activities, (3) cross-currency investing activities, such as in the equity of foreign subsidiaries, and (4) revenues generated and expenses incurred in foreign currencies, which impact earnings.These foreign exchange risks are managed primarily by entering into foreign exchange spot transactions or hedged with foreign exchange forward contracts when the hedge costs are economically justified and in notional amounts designed to offset pretax impacts from currency movements in the period in which they occur. As of December 31, 2022, foreign currency derivative instruments with total notional amounts of approximately $34 billion were outstanding.75Table of ContentsWith respect to Card Member spending and cross-currency transactions, including related foreign exchange forward contracts outstanding, the impact of a hypothetical 10 percent strengthening of the U.S. dollar would have been immaterial to projected earnings as of December 31, 2022. With respect to translation exposure of foreign subsidiary equity balances, including related foreign exchange forward contracts outstanding, a hypothetical 10 percent strengthening of the U.S. dollar would result in an immaterial reduction in other comprehensive income and equity as of December 31, 2022. With respect to anticipated earnings denominated in foreign currencies for the next twelve months, the adverse impact on pretax income of a hypothetical 10 percent strengthening of the U.S. dollar would be approximately $153 million as of December 31, 2022. To a much lesser extent, we are also subject to market risk arising from activities conducted by our Foreign Exchange International Payments business. We aim to minimize market risk from these activities through hedging, where appropriate, and the establishment of limits.The actual impact of interest rate and foreign exchange rate changes will depend on, among other factors, the timing of rate changes, the extent to which different rates do not move in the same direction or in the same direction to the same degree, changes in the cost, volume and mix of our hedging activities and changes in the volume and mix of our businesses.FUNDING & LIQUIDITY RISK MANAGEMENT PROCESSWe define funding and liquidity risk as our inability to meet our ongoing financial and business obligations at a reasonable cost as they become due.Our Board-approved Liquidity Risk Policy establishes the framework that guides and governs liquidity risk management.Funding and liquidity risk is managed by the Funding and Liquidity Committee. To manage this risk, we seek to maintain access to a diverse set of cash, readily-marketable securities and contingent sources of liquidity, such that we can continuously meet our business requirements and expected future financing obligations for at least a twelve-month period in the event we are unable to raise new funds under our regular funding programs during a substantial weakening in economic conditions. We consider the trade-offs between maintaining too much liquidity, which can be costly and limit financial flexibility, and having inadequate liquidity, which may result in financial distress during a liquidity event.Funding and liquidity risk is managed at an aggregate consolidated level as well as at certain subsidiaries in order to ensure that sufficient and accessible liquidity resources are maintained. The Funding and Liquidity Committee reviews forecasts of our aggregate and subsidiary cash positions and financing requirements, approves funding plans designed to satisfy those requirements under normal and stressed conditions, establishes guidelines to identify the amount of liquidity resources required and monitors positions and determines any actions to be taken.MODEL RISK MANAGEMENT PROCESSWe define model risk as the risk of adverse consequences, such as financial loss, poor business and strategic decision making, damage to our reputation or customer harm, from decisions based on incorrect or misused model outputs and outcomes.The Enterprise-Wide Model Risk Policy establishes the comprehensive framework for governing model risk. This policy is approved by the ERMC. The comprehensive risk management and governance framework includes procedures for model development, independent model validation, model risk reporting and change management capabilities that seek to minimize erroneous model methodology, outputs, and misuse. We also assess model performance and model- related issues on an ongoing basis and seek to address deficiencies in a timely manner. In addition, we utilize artificial intelligence and machine learning (AI/ML) models for a variety of business use cases. We perform extensive reviews and testing to reduce the risk that these AI/ML techniques result in adverse consequences.76Table of ContentsSTRATEGIC AND BUSINESS RISK MANAGEMENT PROCESSWe define strategic and business risk as the risk related to our inability to achieve our business objectives due to poor strategic decisions, including decisions related to mergers, acquisitions, and divestitures, poor implementation of strategic decisions or declining demand for our products and services.Strategic decisions are reviewed and approved by business leaders and various committees and must be aligned with company policies. We seek to manage strategic and business risks through risk controls embedded in these processes as well as overall risk management oversight over business goals. Existing product performance is reviewed periodically by committees and business leaders. Mergers, acquisitions and divestitures can only be approved following Executive Committee due diligence, a comprehensive risk assessment by operational, market, credit and oversight leaders provided to the Chief Risk Officer and approval by either the Chief Risk Officer or appropriate risk committees. All new and material changes to products and services are reviewed and approved by the New Products Committee and appropriate credit or risk committees.COUNTRY RISK MANAGEMENT PROCESSWe define country risk as the risk that economic, social, and/or political conditions and events in a country present. They might adversely impact us, primarily as a result of greater credit losses, increased operational or market risk or the inability to repatriate capital.We manage country risk as part of the normal course of business. Policies and procedures establish country risk escalation thresholds to control and limit exposure, driven by processes that enable the monitoring of conditions in countries where we have exposure.ENVIRONMENTAL, SOCIAL AND GOVERNANCE (ESG) AND CLIMATE-RELATED RISK We define climate-related risk as: (1) risks related to the transition to a low-carbon economy, which may include extensive changes pertaining to policy, legal, technology, market and reputational risks, and (2) risks related to the physical impacts of climate change, typically driven by acute physical risk such as increased severity of extreme weather events (e.g., cyclones, hurricanes, floods) and chronic physical risk which are longer-term shifts in climate patterns (e.g., sea level rise, chronic heat waves). Such transition and physical risk events driven by climate change can have broad impact on our customers, operations, suppliers and business.Climate-related risk is interconnected and overarching across all risk types as it may manifest as credit risk, operational risk, market risk, liquidity risk or other risk types. We continue to enhance our focus on climate-related risk within our risk governance framework. We are currently performing a risk identification process for climate-related risk to determine the meaningfulness and measurability of the risk. Furthermore, ESG risks, with an emphasis on climate-related risk, are currently identified as an “emerging risk” within our risk governance framework. 77Table of ContentsCRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATESRefer to Note 1 to the “Consolidated Financial Statements” for a summary of our significant accounting policies. Certain of our accounting policies requiring significant management assumptions and judgments are as follows:RESERVES FOR CARD MEMBER CREDIT LOSSESReserves for Card Member credit losses represent our best estimate of the expected credit losses in our outstanding portfolio of Card Member loans and receivables as of the balance sheet date. The CECL methodology, which became effective January 1, 2020, requires us to estimate lifetime expected credit losses by incorporating historical loss experience, as well as current and future economic conditions over a reasonable and supportable period (R&S Period) beyond the balance sheet date.In estimating expected credit losses, we use a combination of statistically based models and analysis of the results produced by these models to determine the quantitative and qualitative components of our total balance sheet reserves for credit losses. These quantitative and qualitative components entail a significant amount of judgment. The primary areas of judgment used in measuring the quantitative components of our reserves relate to the determination of the appropriate R&S Period, the modeling of the probability of and exposure at default, and the methodology to incorporate current and future economic conditions. We use these models and assumptions, combined with historical loss experience, to determine the reserve rates that are applied to the outstanding loan or receivable balances to produce our reserves for expected credit losses for the R&S Period. The qualitative component is intended to capture expected losses that may not have been fully captured in the quantitative component. Through an established governance structure, we consider certain external and internal factors, including emerging portfolio characteristics and trends, which consequentially may increase or decrease the reserves for Card Member credit losses.The R&S Period, which is approximately three years, represents the maximum time-period beyond the balance sheet date over which we can reasonably estimate expected credit losses, using all available portfolio information, current economic conditions and forecasts of future economic conditions. Card Member loan products do not have a contractual term and balances can revolve if minimum required payments are made, causing some balances to remain outstanding beyond the R&S Period. To determine expected credit losses beyond the R&S Period, we immediately revert to long-term average loss rates. Card Member receivable products are contractually required to be paid in full; therefore, we have assumed the balances will be either paid or written-off no later than 180 days past due.Within the R&S Period, our models use past loss experience and current and future economic conditions to estimate the probability of default, exposure at default and expected recoveries to estimate net losses at default. A significant area of judgment relates to how we apply future Card Member payments to the reporting period balances when determining the exposure at default. The nature of revolving loan products inherently includes a relationship between future payments and spend behavior, which creates complexity in the application of how future payments are either partially or entirely attributable to the existing balance at the end of the reporting period. Using historical customer behavior and other factors, we have assumed that future payments are first allocated to interest and fees associated with the reporting period balance and future spend. We then allocate a portion of the payment to the estimated higher minimum payment amount due because of any future spend. Any remaining portion of the future payment is then allocated to the remaining reporting period balance.CECL requires that the R&S Period include an assumption about current and future economic conditions. We incorporate multiple macroeconomic scenarios provided to us by an independent third party. The estimated credit losses calculated from each macroeconomic scenario are reviewed each period and weighted to reflect management's judgment about uncertainty surrounding these scenarios. These macroeconomic scenarios contain certain variables, including unemployment rates and real GDP, that are significant to our models.78Table of ContentsMacroeconomic SensitivityTo demonstrate the sensitivity of estimated credit losses to the macroeconomic scenarios, we compared our modeled estimates under a baseline scenario to that under a pessimistic downside scenario. As of December 31, 2022, for every 10 percentage points change in weighting from the baseline scenario to the pessimistic downside scenario, the estimated credit losses increased by approximately $120 million.The modeled estimates under these scenarios were influenced by the duration, severity and timing of changes in economic variables within each scenario and these macroeconomic scenarios, under different conditions or using different assumptions, could result in significantly different estimated credit losses. It is difficult to estimate how potential changes in specific factors might affect the estimated credit losses, and current results may not be indicative of the potential future impact of macroeconomic forecast changes.In addition, this sensitivity analysis relates only to the modeled credit loss estimates under two scenarios without considering management’s judgment on the relative weighting for those and other scenarios, including the weight that has been placed on the downside scenario at the balance sheet date, or any potential changes in other adjustments to the quantitative reserve component or the impact of management judgment for the qualitative reserve component, which may have a positive or negative effect on the results. Thus, the results of this sensitivity analysis are hypothetical and are not intended to estimate or reflect our expectations of any changes in the overall reserves for credit losses due to changes in the macroeconomic environment.Refer to Note 3 to the “Consolidated Financial Statements” for further information on the range of macroeconomic scenario key variables used, in conjunction with other inputs described above, to calculate reserves for Card Member credit losses.The process of estimating these reserves requires a high degree of judgment. To the extent our expected credit loss models are not indicative of future performance, actual losses could differ significantly from our judgments and expectations, resulting in either higher or lower future provisions for credit losses in any period.79Table of ContentsLIABILITY FOR MEMBERSHIP REWARDSThe Membership Rewards program is our largest card-based rewards program. Card Members can earn points for purchases charged on their enrolled card products. A significant portion of our cards, by their terms, allow Card Members to earn bonus points for purchases at merchants in particular industry categories. Membership Rewards points are redeemable for a broad variety of rewards, including, but not limited to, travel, shopping, gift cards, and covering eligible charges. Points typically do not expire, and there is no limit on the number of points a Card Member may earn. Membership Rewards expense is driven by charge volume on enrolled cards, customer participation in the program and contractual arrangements with redemption partners.We record a Membership Rewards liability that represents our best estimate of the cost of points earned that are expected to be redeemed by Card Members in the future. The Membership Rewards liability is impacted over time by enrollment levels, attrition, the volume of points earned and redeemed, and the associated redemption costs. We estimate the Membership Rewards liability by determining the URR and the weighted average cost (WAC) per point, which are applied to the points of current enrollees. Refer to Note 9 to the “Consolidated Financial Statements” for additional information.The URR assumption is used to estimate the number of points earned by current enrollees that will ultimately be redeemed in future periods. We use statistical and actuarial models to estimate the URR of points earned to date by current Card Members based on redemption trends, card product type, enrollment tenure, card spend levels and credit attributes. The WAC per point assumption is used to estimate future redemption costs and is primarily based on redemption choices made by Card Members, reward offerings by partners, and Membership Rewards program changes. The WAC per point assumption is derived from 12 months of redemptions and is adjusted as appropriate for certain changes in redemption costs that are not representative of future cost expectations and expected developments in redemption patterns.We periodically evaluate our liability estimation process and assumptions based on developments in redemption patterns, cost per point redeemed, partner contract changes and other factors.The process of estimating the Membership Rewards liability includes a high degree of judgment. Actual redemptions and associated redemption costs could differ significantly from our estimates, resulting in either higher or lower Membership Rewards expense.Changes in the Membership Rewards URR and WAC per point have the effect of either increasing or decreasing the liability through the current period Membership Rewards expense by an amount estimated to cover the cost of all points previously earned but not yet redeemed by current enrollees as of the end of the reporting period. As of December 31, 2022, an increase in the estimated URR of current enrollees of 25 basis points would increase the Membership Rewards liability and corresponding rewards expense by approximately $157 million. Similarly, an increase in the WAC per point of 1 basis point would increase the Membership Rewards liability and corresponding rewards expense by approximately $190 million.GOODWILL RECOVERABILITYGoodwill represents the excess of acquisition cost of an acquired business over the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed. Goodwill is not amortized but is tested for impairment at the reporting unit level annually or when events or circumstances arise, such as adverse changes in the business climate, that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of the reporting unit below its carrying value. Our methodology for conducting this goodwill impairment testing contains both a qualitative and quantitative assessment.We have the option to initially perform an assessment of qualitative factors in order to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount. The qualitative factors may include, but are not limited to, economic conditions, industry and market considerations, cost factors, overall financial performance of the reporting unit and other company and reporting unit-specific events. If we determine that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, we then perform the impairment evaluation using a more detailed quantitative assessment. We could also directly perform this quantitative assessment for any reporting unit, bypassing the qualitative assessment.80Table of ContentsOur methodology for conducting the quantitative goodwill impairment testing is fundamentally based on the measurement of fair value for our reporting units, which inherently entails the use of significant management judgment. For valuation, we use a combination of the income approach (discounted cash flows) and market approach (market multiples) in estimating the fair value of our reporting units.When preparing discounted cash flow models under the income approach, we estimate future cash flows using the reporting unit’s internal multi-year forecast, and a terminal value calculated using a growth rate that we believe is appropriate in light of current and expected future economic conditions. To discount these cash flows we use our expected cost of equity, determined using a capital asset pricing model. When using the market method under the market approach, we apply comparable publicly traded companies’ multiples (e.g., earnings, revenues) to our reporting units’ operating results. The judgment in estimating forecasted cash flows, discount rates and market comparables is significant, and imprecision could materially affect the fair value of our reporting units.We could be exposed to an increased risk of goodwill impairment if future operating results or macroeconomic conditions differ significantly from management’s current assumptions.INCOME TAXESWe are subject to the income tax laws of the United States, its states and municipalities and those of the foreign jurisdictions in which we operate. These tax laws are complex, and the manner in which they apply to the taxpayer’s facts is sometimes open to interpretation. In establishing a provision for income tax expense, we must make judgments about the application of inherently complex tax laws.Unrecognized Tax BenefitsWe establish a liability for unrecognized tax benefits, which are the differences between a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return and the benefit recognized in the financial statements.In establishing a liability for an unrecognized tax benefit, assumptions may be made in determining whether, and the extent to which, a tax position should be sustained. A tax position is recognized only when it is more likely than not to be sustained upon examination by the relevant taxing authority, based on its technical merits. The amount of tax benefit recognized is the largest benefit that we believe is more likely than not to be realized on ultimate settlement. As new information becomes available, we evaluate our tax positions and adjust our unrecognized tax benefits, as appropriate.Tax benefits ultimately realized can differ from amounts previously recognized due to uncertainties, with any such differences generally impacting the provision for income tax.Deferred Tax Asset RealizationDeferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the differences between the financial statement and tax bases of assets and liabilities using the enacted tax rates expected to be in effect for the years in which the differences are expected to reverse.Since deferred taxes measure the future tax effects of items recognized in the Consolidated Financial Statements, certain estimates and assumptions are required to determine whether it is more likely than not that all or some portion of the benefit of a deferred tax asset will not be realized. In making this assessment, we analyze and estimate the impact of future taxable income, reversing temporary differences and available tax planning strategies. These assessments are performed quarterly, taking into account any new information.Changes in facts or circumstances can lead to changes in the ultimate realization of deferred tax assets due to uncertainties.81Table of ContentsOTHER MATTERSAs previously disclosed, we identified during an internal review that over time certain current and former U.S. Card Members with multiple cards were not credited certain Membership Rewards points that they had earned. We completed our review of this matter in the fourth quarter of 2022, which resulted in an immaterial impact to our Consolidated Financial Statements for the year ended December 31, 2022.RECENTLY ISSUED AND ADOPTED ACCOUNTING STANDARDSRefer to the Recently Issued and Adopted Accounting Standards section of Note 1 to the “Consolidated Financial Statements.”GLOSSARY OF SELECTED TERMINOLOGYAdjusted net interest income — A non-GAAP measure that represents net interest income attributable to our Card Member loans (which includes, on a GAAP basis, interest that is deemed uncollectible), excluding the impact of interest expense and interest income not attributable to our Card Member loans.Airline-related volume — Represents spend at airlines as a merchant, which is included within T&E-related volume.Asset securitizations — Asset securitization involves the transfer and sale of loans or receivables to a special-purpose entity created for the securitization activity, typically a trust. The trust, in turn, issues securities, commonly referred to as asset-backed securities that are secured by the transferred loans and receivables. The trust uses the proceeds from the sale of such securities to pay the purchase price for the transferred loans or receivables. The securitized loans and receivables of our Lending Trust and Charge Trust (collectively, the Trusts) are reported as assets and the securities issued by the Trusts are reported as liabilities on our Consolidated Balance Sheets.Average discount rate — This calculation is generally designed to reflect the average pricing at all merchants accepting American Express cards and represents the percentage of network volumes retained by us from spend at merchants we acquire, or from merchants acquired by third parties on our behalf, net of amounts retained by such third parties. The average discount rate, together with billed business, drive our discount revenue.Billed business (Card Member spending) — Represents transaction volumes (including cash advances) on payment products issued by American Express.Capital ratios — Represents the minimum standards established by regulatory agencies as a measure to determine whether the regulated entity has sufficient capital to absorb on- and off-balance sheet losses beyond current loss accrual estimates. Refer to the Capital Strategy section under “Consolidated Capital Resources and Liquidity” for further related definitions under Basel III.Card Member — The individual holder of an issued American Express-branded card.Card Member loans — Represents revolve-eligible transactions on our card products, as well as any interest charges and associated card-related fees.Card Member receivables — Represents transactions on our card products and card related fees that need to be paid in full on or before the Card Member's payment due date.Cards-in-force — Represents the number of cards that are issued and outstanding by American Express (proprietary cards-in-force) and cards issued and outstanding under network partnership agreements with banks and other institutions, except for retail cobrand cards issued by network partners that had no out-of-store spending activity during the prior twelve months. Basic cards-in-force excludes supplemental cards issued on consumer accounts. Cards-in-force is useful in understanding the size of our Card Member base.Charge cards — Represents cards that generally carry no pre-set spending limits and are primarily designed as a method of payment and not as a means of financing purchases. Each charge card transaction is authorized based on its likely economics reflecting a Card Member’s most recent credit information and spend patterns. Charge Card Members must pay the full amount of balances billed each month, with the exception of balances that can be revolved under lending features offered on certain charge cards, such as Pay Over Time and Plan It, that allow Card Members to pay for eligible purchases with interest over time.82Table of ContentsCobrand cards — Cards issued under cobrand agreements with selected commercial partners. Pursuant to the cobrand agreements, we make payments to our cobrand partners, which can be significant, based primarily on the amount of Card Member spending and corresponding rewards earned on such spending and, under certain arrangements, on the number of accounts acquired and retained. The partner is then liable for providing rewards to the Card Member under the cobrand partner’s own loyalty program.Credit cards — Represents cards that have a range of revolving payment terms, structured payment features (e.g. Plan It), grace periods, and rate and fee structures.Discount revenue — Discount revenue represents the amount we earn and retain from the merchant payable for facilitating transactions between Card Members and merchants on payment products issued by American Express.Goods and Services (G&S)-related volume — Includes spend in merchant categories other than T&E-related merchant categories, which includes B2B spending by small and mid-sized enterprise customers in our CS and ICS segments.Interest expense — Includes interest incurred primarily to fund Card Member loans and receivables, general corporate purposes and liquidity needs. Interest expense is divided principally into two categories: (i) deposits, which primarily relates to interest expense on deposits taken from customers and institutions, and (ii) debt, which primarily relates to interest expense on our long-term financing and short-term borrowings, (e.g., commercial paper, federal funds purchased, bank overdrafts and other short-term borrowings), as well as the realized impact of derivatives hedging interest rate risk on our long-term debt.Interest income — Includes (i) interest on loans, (ii) interest and dividends on investment securities and (iii) interest income on deposits with banks and other.Interest on loans — Assessed using the average daily balance method for Card Member loans. Unless the loan is classified as non-accrual, interest is recognized based upon the principal amount outstanding in accordance with the terms of the applicable account agreement until the outstanding balance is paid or written off.Interest and dividends on investment securities — Primarily relates to our performing fixed-income securities. Interest income is recognized using the effective interest method, which adjusts the yield for security premiums and discounts, fees and other payments, so a constant rate of return is recognized on the outstanding balance of the related investment security throughout its term. Amounts are recognized until securities are in default or when it is likely that future interest payments will not be made as scheduled.Interest income on deposits with banks and other — Primarily relates to the placement of cash in excess of near-term funding requirements in interest-bearing time deposits, overnight sweep accounts, and other interest-bearing demand and call accounts.Loyalty coalitions — Programs that enable consumers to earn rewards points and use them to save on purchases from a variety of participating merchants through multi-category rewards platforms. Merchants in these programs generally fund the consumer offers and are responsible to us for the cost of rewards points; we earn revenue from operating the loyalty platform and by providing marketing support.Net card fees — Represents the card membership fees earned during the period recognized as revenue over the covered card membership period (typically one year), net of the provision for projected refunds for Card Membership cancellation and deferred acquisition costs.Net interest yield on average Card Member loans — A non-GAAP measure that is computed by dividing adjusted net interest income by average Card Member loans, computed on an annualized basis. Reserves and net write-offs related to uncollectible interest are recorded through provision for credit losses and are thus not included in the net interest yield calculation.Net write-off rate — principal only — Represents the amount of proprietary consumer or small business Card Member loans or receivables written off, consisting of principal (resulting from authorized transactions), less recoveries, as a percentage of the average loan or receivable balance during the period.Net write-off rate — principal, interest and fees — Includes, in the calculation of the net write-off rate, amounts for interest and fees in addition to principal for Card Member loans, and fees in addition to principal for Card Member receivables.Network volumes — Represents the total of billed business and processed volumes.Operating expenses — Represents salaries and employee benefits, professional services, data processing and equipment, and other expenses.83Table of ContentsProcessed revenue — Represents revenues related to network partnership agreements, comprising royalties, fees and amounts earned for facilitating transactions on cards issued by network partners. Processed revenue also includes fees earned on alternative payment solutions facilitated by American Express.Processed volumes — Represents transaction volumes (including cash advances) on cards issued under network partnership agreements with banks and other institutions, including joint ventures, as well as alternative payment solutions facilitated by American Express.Reserve build (release) — Represents the portion of the provisions for credit losses for the period related to increasing or decreasing reserves for credit losses as a result of, among other things, changes in volumes, macroeconomic outlook, portfolio composition and credit quality of portfolios. Reserve build represents the amount by which the provision for credit losses exceeds net write-offs, while reserve release represents the amount by which net write-offs exceed the provision for credit losses.T&E-related volume — Represents spend on travel and entertainment, which primarily includes airline, cruise, lodging and dining merchant categories.84Table of ContentsCAUTIONARY NOTE REGARDING FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTSThis report includes forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, which are subject to risks and uncertainties.

4962,AXP,AMERICAN EXPRESS CO,2016,"ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (“MD&A”) EXECUTIVE OVERVIEW BUSINESS INTRODUCTION We are a global services company with four reportable operating segments: U.S. Card Services (USCS), International Card Services (ICS), Global Commercial Services (GCS) and Global Network & Merchant Services (GNMS). Refer to “Business” for a discussion of changes to our reportable operating segments, effective in the first quarter of 2016. We provide our customers with access to products, insights and experiences that enrich lives and build business success. Our principal products and services are charge and credit payment card products and travel-related services offered to consumers and businesses around the world. Business travel-related services are offered through a non-consolidated joint venture, American Express Global Business Travel (GBT JV). Prior to July 1, 2014, these business travel operations were wholly owned. We compete in the global payments industry with charge, credit and debit card networks, issuers and acquirers, as well as evolving and growing alternative payment providers. As the payments industry continues to evolve, we face increasing competition from non-traditional players that leverage new technologies and customers’ existing accounts and relationships to create payment or other fee-based solutions. Our products and services are sold globally to diverse customer groups, including consumers, small businesses, mid-sized companies and large corporations. These products and services are sold through various channels, including direct mail, online applications, in-house and third-party sales forces and direct response advertising. The following types of revenue are generated from our various products and services: • Discount revenue, our largest revenue source, which represents fees generally charged to merchants when Card Members use their cards to purchase goods and services at merchants on our network; • Net card fees, which represent revenue earned from annual card membership fees; • Travel commissions and fees, which are earned by charging a transaction or management fee to both customers and suppliers for travel-related transactions (business travel commissions and fees included through June 30, 2014); • Other commissions and fees, which are earned on foreign exchange conversions, card-related fees, such as late fees and assessments, loyalty coalition-related fees and other service fees; • Other revenue, which represents revenues arising from contracts with partners of our Global Network Services (GNS) business (including commissions and signing fees), insurance premiums earned from Card Member travel and other insurance programs, prepaid card-related revenues, revenues related to the GBT JV transition services agreement, earnings from equity method investments (including the GBT JV after June 30, 2014) and other miscellaneous revenue and fees; and • Interest on loans, which principally represents interest income earned on outstanding balances. FINANCIAL HIGHLIGHTS For 2015, we reported net income of $5.2 billion and diluted earnings per share of $5.05. This compared to $5.9 billion of net income and $5.56 diluted earnings per share for 2014, and $5.4 billion of net income and $4.88 diluted earnings per share for 2013. 2015 results included: • A $419 million ($335 million after-tax) charge in the fourth quarter, related to Enterprise Growth (EG), that was driven primarily by the impairment of goodwill and technology, plus some restructuring costs. 51 Table of Contents 2014 results included: • A $719 million ($453 million after-tax) gain on the sale of our investment in Concur Technologies (Concur) in the fourth quarter; • A $626 million ($409 million after-tax) gain as a result of the business travel joint venture transaction in the second quarter; • $420 million ($277 million after-tax) of net charges for costs related to reengineering initiatives, including $313 million ($206 million after-tax) and $133 million ($90 million after-tax) of restructuring charges in the fourth and second quarter, respectively; and • A $109 million ($68 million after-tax) charge related to the renewal of our partnership with Delta Air Lines (Delta) in the fourth quarter. 2013 results included: • A $66 million ($41 million after-tax) charge related to a proposed merchant litigation settlement in the fourth quarter. In addition, effective December 1, 2015, we transferred the Card Member loans and receivables related to our cobrand partnerships with Costco Wholesale Corporation (Costco) in the United States and JetBlue Airways Corporation (JetBlue) (the HFS portfolios) to Card Member loans and receivables held for sale (HFS) on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Refer to Note 2 to the “Consolidated Financial Statements” for additional information. NON-GAAP MEASURES We prepare our Consolidated Financial Statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (GAAP). However, certain information included within this report constitutes non-GAAP financial measures. Our calculations of non-GAAP financial measures may differ from the calculations of similarly titled measures by other companies. BUSINESS ENVIRONMENT Our performance in 2015 reflected both the strength of our business and the headwinds we have been managing throughout the year. Results for the year benefited from healthy loan growth, strong card acquisitions, excellent credit performance, disciplined operating expense control and the benefits of our strong capital position. Our results were also challenged by several factors. First, the cumulative impact from the initial increased costs associated with early renewals of certain of our cobrand relationships and the end of our relationship with Costco in Canada negatively impacted our results. Second, the U.S. dollar continued to strengthen as the year progressed. Third, our decision to increase spending on growth initiatives for the year, consistent with the elevated levels of 2014, further pressured our 2015 earnings. Fourth, the economic, regulatory, and competitive environments all became even more challenging as the year progressed. The combination of these factors resulted in billings and revenue growth rates that were fairly steady throughout the year. Billings did grow in 2015, although growth rates decelerated modestly during the second half of the year. International billed business continued to be strong versus the prior year after excluding Canada (due to the termination of our relationship with Costco Canada last year) and adjusting for foreign currency exchange rates. In the United States, we saw softening in billings on the Costco cobrand card, where volumes dropped versus the prior year. Lower gas prices also continued to be a drag on billings. GCS billed business growth continued to slow due, in part, to lower airline volumes and a generally cautious corporate spending environment. Our billings growth rates during the second half of 2016 will be impacted by the end of our relationship with Costco in the United States, which is expected to occur around mid-year. For the full year, discount revenue was down slightly versus the prior year driven in part by a decline in our discount rate due primarily to the continued rollout of OptBlue, and we anticipate that the discount rate will further decline by a greater amount during 2016, due to the continued expansion of OptBlue, a greater impact from international regulatory changes, and continued competitive pressures. 52 Table of Contents Growth in net interest income remained strong during the year, driven by loan growth. Card Member loans held for investment were down in 2015 on a reported basis due to the transfer of the Costco and JetBlue loan portfolios to Card Member loans and receivables HFS, effective December 1, 2015. Excluding the HFS portfolios from the prior year, worldwide loans increased. We expect to see strong growth in loans held for investment in 2016, and continue to believe there are opportunities to increase our share of lending without significantly changing our overall risk profile. Our credit provision was down versus the prior year, as lending write-off rates remained at lower levels. We expect continued growth in loans will contribute to an increase in provisions; we also expect to see some upward pressure on our write-off rates, due primarily to the seasoning of loans related to new Card Members. Our capital position allowed us to return over $5 billion to our shareholders in the form of dividends and share repurchases, representing approximately 105 percent of total capital generated during the year, reflecting our ongoing commitment to using our capital strength to create value for our shareholders. As mentioned above, we are now reporting the Costco portfolio as HFS. We expect the sale to close around mid-year 2016 and that our merchant acceptance agreement will extend through the transaction close. The ultimate gain on sale will be determined based on the assets actually sold, but we currently estimate a gain of approximately $1 billion. We have not yet signed a definitive agreement and given that we are still several months away from the close, and the Card Member borrowing and paydown trends are difficult to predict in this type of transition, the final gain could differ from our estimate. We expect the portfolio sale gain will be partially used to fund spending on growth initiatives throughout 2016, resulting in some unevenness in our quarterly performance. As of December 31, 2015, Costco cobrand accounts were responsible for approximately 19 percent of our worldwide Card Member loans held for investment and HFS (combined) and approximately 10 percent of our total cards-in-force. Costco cobrand accounts generated approximately 8 percent of our worldwide billed business for the year ended December 31, 2015. Approximately 70 percent of the spending on these accounts occurred outside Costco warehouses. In addition, 1 percent of our worldwide billed business for the year ended December 31, 2015, came from spending on other (non-Costco cobrand) American Express cards at Costco warehouses. In an effort to accelerate and expand our cost control efforts to right size our cost base with the evolving business environment, we have launched, in the first quarter of 2016, cost initiatives that are designed to remove $1 billion from our overall cost base, which includes total operating expenses plus marketing and promotion costs, by the end of 2017. We plan to take action throughout 2016 to drive benefits in 2017 and beyond, which we expect will result in restructuring charges in 2016. See “Legal, Regulatory and Compliance Risk” in “Risk Factors” for information on the potential impacts of an adverse decision in the Department of Justice (DOJ) case and related merchant litigations on our business. For discussion of certain legislative and regulatory changes that could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition, see “Card-Issuing Business and Deposit Programs — Regulation” under “U.S. Card Services,” “International Card Services — Regulation,” “Global Commercial Services — Regulation,” “Global Network & Merchant Services — Regulation” and “Supervision and Regulation” in “Business.” 53 Table of Contents CONSOLIDATED RESULTS OF OPERATIONS As a result of the GBT JV transaction, we deconsolidated the Global Business Travel net assets, effective June 30, 2014, resulting in a lack of comparability between the periods presented. As mentioned previously, effective December 1, 2015, we transferred the Card Member loans and receivables related to the HFS portfolios (included in the USCS segment), to Card Member loans and receivables HFS on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. The primary impacts beyond the HFS classification on the Consolidated Balance Sheets are to provisions for losses and credit metrics, which no longer reflect amounts related to these loans and receivables, as credit costs are reported in Other expenses through a valuation allowance adjustment. Other, non-credit related metrics (i.e., billed business, cards-in-force, net interest yield), continue to reflect amounts related to the HFS portfolios. Refer to Note 2 to the “Consolidated Financial Statements” for additional information. The relative strengthening of the U.S. dollar over the periods of comparison has had an impact on our results of operations. Where meaningful in describing our performance, foreign currency-adjusted amounts, which exclude the impact of changes in the foreign exchange (FX) rates, have been provided.

(b) Return on Average Equity (ROE) is computed by dividing (i) one-year period net income ($5.2 billion, $5.9 billion and $5.4 billion for 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively) by (ii) one-year average total shareholders’ equity ($21.5 billion, $20.3 billion and $19.3 billion for 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively). (c) Return on average tangible common equity (ROTCE), a non-GAAP measure, is computed in the same manner as ROE except the computation of average tangible common equity, a non-GAAP measure, excludes from one-year average total shareholders’ equity, one-year average goodwill and other intangibles of $3.8 billion, $3.9 billion and $4.1 billion as of December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively, and one-year average preferred shares of $1.6 billion, $0.7 billion and nil as of December 31, 2015, 2014, and 2013, respectively. We believe ROTCE is a useful measure of the profitability of our business.

U.S. billed business increased 5 percent, and non-U.S. billed business increased 8 percent on an FX-adjusted basis in 2015 compared to 2014, due to increases in average spending per proprietary basic card and basic cards-in-force.1 The average discount rate was 2.46 percent, 2.48 percent and 2.51 percent for 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively. The decrease in the average discount rate in 2015 compared to 2014 was driven, in part, by growth of the OptBlue program to expand card acceptance by U.S. small merchants, changes in industry mix and competition, partially offset by the decline in Costco merchant volume in Canada (which was at a lower discount rate than the average) due to the expiration of our merchant agreement. The average discount rate will likely decline by a greater amount during 2016 due to the continued expansion of Optblue, a greater impact from international regulatory changes and continued competitive pressures. Overall, changes in the mix of spending by location and industry, merchant incentives and concessions, volume related pricing discounts, strategic investments, certain pricing initiatives, competition, pricing regulation (including regulation of competitors’ interchange rates) and other factors will likely result in continued erosion of our discount rate over time. See Tables 5 and 6 for more details on billed business performance and the average discount rate. Net card fees remained relatively flat in 2015 compared to 2014 and increased $81 million or 3 percent in 2014 compared to 2013, while FX-adjusted net card fees increased 5 percent in both periods.1 The increases in both years on an FX-adjusted basis were primarily driven by higher average proprietary cards-in-force. The current year increase also reflects a benefit from certain pricing initiatives. Travel commissions and fees decreased $769 million or 69 percent in 2015 compared to 2014 and $795 million or 42 percent in 2014 compared to 2013. The decreases in both years were primarily due to the business travel joint venture transaction, resulting in a lack of comparability between periods. Other commissions and fees remained relatively flat in 2015 compared to 2014 and increased $94 million or 4 percent in 2014 compared to 2013. FX-adjusted other commissions and fees increased 9 percent in 2015 compared to 2014 and 6 percent in 2014 compared to 2013. 1 The increases, on an FX-adjusted basis, in both periods were primarily driven by higher loyalty coalition revenues, as well as higher delinquency fees. Other revenues decreased $956 million or 32 percent in 2015 compared to 2014 and increased $715 million or 31 percent in 2014 compared to 2013. The decrease in the current year was primarily driven by prior-year gains related to the sales of investment securities in Concur, and the sales of investment securities in Industrial and Commercial Bank of China. The increase in the prior year was primarily driven by the gains on the sales of our investment securities in Concur, revenues earned related to the GBT JV transition services agreement, and higher Loyalty Edge revenues, partially offset by the loss of revenue from the publishing business, which was sold in the fourth quarter of 2013. Interest income increased $366 million or 5 percent in 2015 compared to 2014, and $174 million or 2 percent in 2014 compared to 2013. The increase in both years primarily reflects higher average Card Member loans, partially offset by decreases in interest and dividends on investment securities, driven by lower average investment securities. Interest expense decreased $84 million or 5 percent in 2015 compared to 2014, and $251 million or 13 percent in 2014 compared to 2013. The decrease in both years was primarily driven by a lower cost of funds on debt and customer deposits, partially offset by increases in average customer deposit balances. 1 The foreign currency adjusted information assumes a constant exchange rate between the periods being compared for purposes of currency translation into U.S. dollars (e.g., assumes the foreign exchange rates used to determine results for the current year apply to the corresponding year period against which such results are being compared). Certain amounts included in the calculations of foreign currency-adjusted revenues and expenses, which constitute non-GAAP measures, are subject to management allocations. We believe the presentation of information on a foreign currency adjusted basis is helpful to investors by making it easier to compare our performance in one period to that of another period without the variability caused by fluctuations in currency exchange rates. 55 Table of Contents TABLE 3: PROVISIONS FOR LOSSES SUMMARY Years Ended December 31, (Millions, except percentages) 2015 2014 2013 Change2015 vs. 2014 Change2014 vs. 2013 Charge card $ 737 $ 792 $ 648 $ (55 ) (7 )% $ 144 22 % Card Member loans 1,190 1,138 1,115 52 5 23 2 Other 61 114 69 (53 ) (46 ) 45 65 Total provisions for losses (a) $ 1,988 $ 2,044 $ 1,832 $ (56 ) (3 )% $ 212 12 % (a) Effective December 1, 2015, Provisions for losses does not reflect provisions related to the HFS portfolios. PROVISIONS FOR LOSSES Charge card provision for losses decreased $55 million or 7 percent in 2015 compared to 2014, and increased $144 million or 22 percent in 2014 compared to 2013. The decrease in the current year primarily reflects a reserve release versus a reserve build in 2014, partially offset by higher write-offs. The increase in the prior year was primarily due to a slower reserve rate improvement in 2014 versus 2013, higher corporate card write-offs and the effects of changes in other loss reserve assumptions resulting in a reserve build versus a reserve release in 2013. Card Member loans provision for losses increased $52 million or 5 percent in 2015 compared to 2014, and $23 million or 2 percent in 2014 compared to 2013. The increase in the current year primarily reflects a reserve build versus a reserve release in 2014. The reserve build in the current year was due to a small increase in delinquency rates combined with an increase in loan balances, partially offset by lower write-offs and the impact related to transferring the HFS portfolios to Card Member loans and receivables HFS, as related credit costs are reported in Other expenses through a valuation allowance adjustment beginning in December 2015. The increase in the prior year was driven by higher average Card Member loans, a slower improvement in the reserve rate and the effects of changes in other loss reserve assumptions resulting in a lower reserve release compared to 2013, partially offset by the benefit of lower net write-offs due to improved credit performance. Other provision for losses decreased $53 million or 46 percent in 2015 compared to 2014 and increased $45 million or 65 percent in 2014 compared to 2013. The decrease in the current year and increase in the prior year were due, in part, to a merchant-related charge in the fourth quarter of 2014. TABLE 4: EXPENSES SUMMARY Years Ended December 31, (Millions, except percentages) 2015 2014 2013 Change2015 vs. 2014 Change2014 vs. 2013 Marketing and promotion $ 3,109 $ 3,216 $ 2,939 $ (107 ) (3 )% $ 277 9 % Card Member rewards 6,996 6,931 6,457 65 1 474 7 Card Member services and other 1,018 822 767 196 24 55 7 Total marketing, promotion, rewards and Card Member services and other 11,123 10,969 10,163 154 1 806 8 Salaries and employee benefits 4,976 6,095 6,191 (1,119 ) (18 ) (96 ) (2 ) Other, net (a) 6,793 6,089 6,796 704 12 (707 ) (10 ) Total expenses $ 22,892 $ 23,153 $ 23,150 $ (261 ) (1 )% $ 3 — % (a) Effective December 1, 2015, Other, net includes the valuation allowance adjustment associated with the HFS portfolios. EXPENSES Marketing and promotion expenses decreased $107 million or 3 percent (although they increased 1 percent on an FX-adjusted basis) in 2015 compared to 2014 and increased $277 million or 9 percent in 2014 compared to 2013.2 Both periods reflect elevated levels of spending on growth initiatives. Card Member rewards expenses increased $65 million or 1 percent in 2015 compared to 2014, and $474 million or 7 percent in 2014 compared to 2013. The current year increase was primarily driven by higher cobrand rewards expense of $199 million, driven by rate impacts as a result of cobrand partnership renewal costs, partially offset by a decrease in Membership Rewards expense of $134 million. The latter was primarily driven by slower growth in the Ultimate Redemption Rate (URR) and a decline in the weighted average cost (WAC) per point assumption, including 2 Refer to footnote 1 on page 55 for details regarding foreign currency adjusted information. 56 Table of Contents the impact of the $109 million charge in the fourth quarter of 2014 related to the Delta partnership renewal, partially offset by increased expenses related to new points earned, driven by higher spending volumes. The prior year increase was primarily due to higher Membership Rewards expense of $263 million, driven by a $266 million increase related to new points earned, in line with higher spending volumes, and a higher WAC per point assumption, including the impact of the previously mentioned charge related to the Delta partnership renewal; these increases were offset by slower average growth in the URR. Cobrand rewards expense increased $211 million in 2014 compared to 2013, primarily driven by higher spending volumes. The Membership Rewards URR for current program participants was 95 percent (rounded down) at December 31, 2015, compared to 95 percent (rounded up) at December 31, 2014 and 94 percent (rounded down) at December 31, 2013. Card Member services and other expenses increased $196 million or 24 percent in 2015 compared to 2014 and increased $55 million or 7 percent in 2014 compared to 2013. The increase in the current year was primarily due to higher costs related to certain previously renewed cobrand partnership agreements. The increase in the prior year was primarily driven by increased engagement levels and use of certain Card Member benefits, as well as American Express-branded airport lounges opened in 2014. Salaries and employee benefits expenses decreased $1.1 billion or 18 percent in 2015 compared to 2014, and $96 million or 2 percent in 2014 compared to 2013. The decrease in both years was primarily due to the business travel joint venture transaction (resulting in a lack of comparability between periods). The decrease in the current year was also driven by restructuring charges in the second and fourth quarters of 2014 and lower compensation costs in 2015 as a result of those initiatives. In 2014, compared to 2013, those restructuring charges partially offset the impact of the business travel joint venture transaction. Other expenses increased $704 million or 12 percent in 2015 compared to 2014 and decreased $707 million or 10 percent in 2014 compared to 2013. The increase in the current year reflects the net gain from the 2014 business travel joint venture transaction, partially offset by the EG charge discussed previously. Refer to Note 2 to the “Consolidated Financial Statements” for further details on the charge. The decrease in the prior year was primarily driven by the gain from the business travel joint venture transaction (resulting in a lack of comparability between periods), and a charge in 2013 related to the rejected merchant litigation settlement. See “Legal Proceedings” for further information on this merchant litigation. INCOME TAXES The effective tax rate was 35.0 percent in 2015 compared to 34.5 percent in 2014 and 32.1 percent in 2013. The tax rates for 2015, 2014, and 2013 include benefits of $33 million, expenses of $40 million and benefits of $150 million, respectively, related to the resolution of certain prior years’ items. The tax rate for 2015 also includes the impact of the nondeductible portion of the goodwill impairment charge in EG. The tax rates for all periods reflect the level of pretax income in relation to recurring permanent tax benefits and geographic mix of business. 57 Table of Contents TABLE 5: SELECTED STATISTICAL INFORMATION Years Ended December 31, 2015 2014 2013 Change2015 vs. 2014 Change2014 vs. 2013 Card billed business: (billions) United States $ 721.0 $ 688.1 $ 637.0 5 % 8 % Outside the United States 318.7 334.7 315.4 (5 ) 6 Total $ 1,039.7 $ 1,022.8 $ 952.4 2 7 Total cards-in-force: (millions) United States 57.6 54.9 53.1 5 3 Outside the United States 60.2 57.3 54.1 5 6 Total 117.8 112.2 107.2 5 5 Basic cards-in-force: (millions) United States 44.8 42.6 41.1 5 4 Outside the United States 49.5 47.0 44.0 5 7 Total $ 94.3 $ 89.6 $ 85.1 5 5 Average discount rate (a) 2.46 % 2.48 % 2.51 % Average basic Card Member spending (dollars) (b) $ 16,743 $ 16,884 $ 16,334 (1 ) 3 Average fee per card (dollars) (b) 39 40 40 (3 ) — Average fee per card adjusted (dollars) (b) $ 44 $ 45 $ 44 (2 )% 2 % (a) In the three months ended March 31, 2015, we changed the classification related to certain payments to partners, reducing both discount revenue and marketing and promotion expense. The misclassification in prior periods has been revised to conform to the current period presentation. Accordingly, the average discount rate for prior periods was also revised, resulting in a reduction of between zero and one basis point in any period from what was originally reported. (b) Average basic Card Member spending and average fee per card are computed from proprietary card activities only. Average fee per card is computed based on net card fees, including the amortization of deferred direct acquisition costs divided by average worldwide proprietary cards-in-force. The average fee per card, adjusted, which is a non-GAAP measure, is computed in the same manner, but excludes amortization of deferred direct acquisition costs. The amount of amortization excluded was $283 million, $306 million and $262 million for the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively. We present the average fee per card, adjusted, because we believe this metric presents a useful indicator of card fee pricing across a range of our proprietary card products. 58 Table of Contents TABLE 6: SELECTED STATISTICAL INFORMATION 2015 2014 PercentageIncrease(Decrease) Percentage Increase(Decrease) AssumingNo Changes inFX Rates (a) PercentageIncrease(Decrease) Percentage Increase(Decrease) AssumingNo Changes inFX Rates (a) Worldwide (b) Billed business 2 % 6 % 7 % 9 % Proprietary billed business 1 4 7 7 GNS billed business (c) 3 15 12 15 Airline-related volume (8% and 9% of worldwide billed business for 2015 and 2014, respectively) (5 ) 1 5 6 United States (b) Billed business 5 8 Proprietary consumer card billed business (d) 5 7 Proprietary small business billed business (d) 7 10 Proprietary corporate services billed business (e) 2 8 T&E-related volume (26% of U.S. billed business for both 2015 and 2014) 4 6 Non-T&E-related volume (74% of U.S. billed business for both 2015 and 2014) 5 9 Airline-related volume (7% and 8% of U.S. billed business for 2015 and2014, respectively) (2 ) 3 Outside the United States (b) Billed business (5 ) 8 6 10 Japan, Asia Pacific & Australia (JAPA) billed business 4 15 10 14 Latin America & Canada (LACC) billed business (18 ) (3 ) (1 ) 8 Europe, the Middle East & Africa (EMEA) billed business (5 ) 8 7 7 Proprietary consumer and small business billed business (f) (10 ) 3 2 6 JAPA billed business (3 ) 10 — 6 LACC billed business (29 ) (17 ) (5 ) 2 EMEA billed business (3 ) 10 9 8 Proprietary corporate services billed business (e) (10 )% 7 % 3 % 6 % (a) The foreign currency adjusted information assumes a constant exchange rate between the periods being compared for purposes of currency translation into U.S. dollars (i.e., assumes the foreign exchange rates used to determine results for the current year apply to the corresponding prior year period against which such results are being compared).

(f) We present a net write-off rate based on principal losses only (i.e., excluding interest and/or fees) to be consistent with industry convention. In addition, because we consider uncollectible interest and/or fees in our reserves for credit losses, a net write-off rate including principal, interest and/or fees is also presented. The twelve months ended December 31, 2015 reflect the impact of a change in the timing of charge-offs for Card Member receivables and loans in certain modification programs from 180 days past due to 120 days past due. 60 Table of Contents TABLE 8: NET INTEREST YIELD ON CARD MEMBER LOANS Years Ended December 31, (Millions, except percentages and where indicated) 2015 2014 2013 Net interest income $ 5,922 $ 5,472 $ 5,047 Exclude: Interest expense not attributable to the Company’s Card Member loan portfolio 961 1,019 1,181 Interest income not attributable to the Company’s Card Member loan portfolio (387 ) (359 ) (361 ) Adjusted net interest income (a) $ 6,496 $ 6,132 $ 5,867 Average loans including HFS loan portfolios (billions) (b) $ 69.0 $ 66.0 $ 63.3 Exclude certain non-traditional Card Member loans and other fees (billions) (0.2 ) (0.2 ) (0.3 ) Adjusted average loans (billions) (a) $ 68.8 $ 65.8 $ 63.0 Net interest income divided by average loans 8.6 % 8.3 % 8.0 % Net interest yield on Card Member loans (a) 9.4 % 9.3 % 9.3 % (a) Adjusted net interest income, adjusted average loans, and net interest yield on Card Member loans are non-GAAP measures. Refer to “Glossary of Selected Terminology” for definitions of these terms. We believe adjusted net interest income and adjusted average loans are useful to investors because they are components of net interest yield on Card Member loans, which provides a measure of profitability of our Card Member loan portfolio. (b) For purposes of the calculation of net interest yield on Card Member loans, average loans continues to include the HFS loan portfolios. 61 Table of Contents BUSINESS SEGMENT RESULTS We consider a combination of factors when evaluating the composition of our reportable operating segments, including the results reviewed by the chief operating decision maker, economic characteristics, products and services offered, classes of customers, product distribution channels, geographic considerations (primarily United States versus outside the United States) and regulatory considerations. Refer to Note 25 of the “Consolidated Financial Statements” for additional discussion of the products and services by segment. In light of the organizational changes discussed under “Business,” our financial disclosures will reflect segment changes starting in the first quarter of 2016. This overview discusses the operating segments used for financial reporting in 2015. Results of the business segments generally treat each segment as a stand-alone business. The management reporting process that derives these results allocates revenue and expense using various methodologies as described below. TOTAL REVENUES NET OF INTEREST EXPENSE We allocate discount revenue and certain other revenues among segments using a transfer pricing methodology. Within the USCS, ICS and GCS segments, discount revenue generally reflects the issuer component of the overall discount revenue generated by each segment’s Card Members; within the GNMS segment, discount revenue generally reflects the network and acquirer component of the overall discount revenue. Net card fees and travel commissions and fees are directly attributable to the segment in which they are reported. Interest and fees on loans and certain investment income is directly attributable to the segment in which it is reported. Interest expense represents an allocated funding cost based on a combination of segment funding requirements and internal funding rates. PROVISIONS FOR LOSSES The provisions for losses are directly attributable to the segment in which they are reported. EXPENSES Marketing and promotion expenses are included in each segment based on actual expenses incurred, with the exception of brand advertising, which is primarily reflected in the GNMS and USCS segments. Rewards and Card Member services expenses are included in each segment based on actual expenses incurred within each segment. Salaries and employee benefits and other operating expenses reflect expenses such as professional services, occupancy and equipment and communications incurred directly within each segment. In addition, expenses related to support services, such as technology costs, are allocated to each segment primarily based on support service activities directly attributable to the segment. Other overhead expenses, such as staff group support functions, are allocated from Corporate & Other to the other segments based on a mix of each segment’s direct consumption of services and relative level of pretax income. CAPITAL Each business segment is allocated capital based on established business model operating requirements, risk measures and regulatory capital requirements. The business model operating requirements reflect the capital needed to support operations and specific balance sheet items. The risk measures reflect considerations for credit, market and operational risk. INCOME TAXES An income tax provision (benefit) is allocated to each business segment based on the effective tax rates applicable to the various businesses that comprise the segment. 62 Table of Contents U.S. CARD SERVICES TABLE 9: USCS SELECTED INCOME STATEMENT DATA Years Ended December 31, (Millions, except percentages) 2015 2014 2013 Change2015 vs. 2014 Change2014 vs. 2013 Revenues Non-interest revenues $ 13,180 $ 12,628 $ 12,019 $ 552 4 % $ 609 5 % Interest income 6,267 5,786 5,565 481 8 221 4 Interest expense 654 604 693 50 8 (89 ) (13 ) Net interest income 5,613 5,182 4,872 431 8 310 6 Total revenues net of interest expense 18,793 17,810 16,891 983 6 919 5 Provisions for losses 1,453 1,396 1,250 57 4 146 12 Total revenues net of interest expense after provisions for losses 17,340 16,414 15,641 926 6 773 5 Expenses Marketing, promotion, rewards, Card Member services and other 7,776 7,197 6,721 579 8 476 7 Salaries and employee benefits and other operating expenses 4,209 4,117 3,926 92 2 191 5 Total expenses 11,985 11,314 10,647 671 6 667 6 Pretax segment income 5,355 5,100 4,994 255 5 106 2 Income tax provision 1,942 1,900 1,801 42 2 99 5 Segment income $ 3,413 $ 3,200 $ 3,193 $ 213 7 % $ 7 — % Effective tax rate 36.3 % 37.3 % 36.1 % USCS offers a wide range of card products and services to consumers and small businesses in the United States, provides travel services to Card Members and other consumers, and operates a coalition loyalty business. TOTAL REVENUES NET OF INTEREST EXPENSE Non-interest revenues increased $552 million or 4 percent in 2015 compared to 2014, driven by 6 percent growth in billed business, partially offset by a decline in the average discount rate and increases in contra-discount revenues, such as cash rebate rewards from new Card Member acquisition offers and payments under previously renewed cobrand partnership agreements. The increase in billed business was primarily driven by 6 percent higher cards-in-force and a 1 percent increase in average spending per proprietary basic card. Net interest income increased $481 million or 8 percent in 2015 compared to 2014, due to higher interest income resulting from higher average Card Member loans, partially offset by higher interest expense. Total revenues net of interest expense increased $919 million or 5 percent in 2014 compared to 2013, primarily driven by higher discount revenue, as a result of 8 percent growth in billed business, partially offset by a decrease in the average discount rate and higher cash rebate rewards. The increase also reflected higher net interest income, primarily driven by higher average Card Member loans and lower funding costs. PROVISIONS FOR LOSSES Overall, provisions for losses increased $57 million or 4 percent in 2015 compared to 2014. Charge card provision for losses decreased $31 million or 7 percent, primarily due to a reserve release in 2015 versus a reserve build in 2014, partially offset by higher write-off rates. Card Member loans provision for losses increased $88 million or 9 percent, driven by a higher reserve build in the current year, versus a reserve release in 2014, due to a small increase in delinquency rates combined with an increase in loan balances, partially offset by lower net write-offs and the impact related to transferring the HFS portfolios to Card Member loans and receivables HFS, as credit costs related to the HFS portfolios are reported in Other expenses through a valuation allowance adjustment beginning in December 2015. Provisions for losses increased $146 million in 2014 compared to 2013, primarily due to higher average Card Member loans, a slower reserve rate improvement and a lower reserve release in 2014, partially offset by the benefit of lower net write-offs for Card Member loans. Refer to Table 10 for the charge card and lending write-off rates for 2015, 2014 and 2013. 63 Table of Contents EXPENSES Marketing, promotion, rewards, Card Member services and other expenses increased $579 million or 8 percent in 2015 compared to 2014, driven in part by a $233 million or 5 percent increase in Card Member rewards expense. The increase in rewards costs was driven by higher cobrand rewards expenses of $252 million, partially offset by a decrease in Membership Rewards expense of $19 million. The increase in cobrand rewards expense was driven by higher spending volumes and rate increases, which were due in part to the previously renewed cobrand partnership agreements. The decrease in Membership Rewards expense was primarily driven by slower growth in the URR and a decline in the WAC per point assumption, including the impact of a $96 million charge in the fourth quarter of 2014 related to the Delta partnership renewal, partially offset by higher spending volumes. Card Member services and other expenses increased $207 million or 42 percent in 2015 compared to 2014, primarily driven by higher costs related to renewed cobrand partnership agreements. Marketing and promotion increased $139 million or 9 percent in 2015 compared to 2014, reflecting elevated levels of spending on growth initiatives. Salaries and employee benefits and other operating expenses increased $92 million or 2 percent in 2015, compared to 2014, primarily driven by higher spending on growth initiatives and the December 2015 valuation allowance adjustment related to the HFS portfolios mentioned previously, partially offset by lower fraud losses in the current year and a change in the estimated value of certain investments in our Community Reinvestment Act (CRA) portfolio in the prior year. Total expenses increased $667 million in 2014 compared to 2013, primarily driven by higher marketing and promotion expenses, higher cobrand rewards expenses related to higher spending volumes and an increase in Membership Rewards expense, which was due to higher new points earned and a higher WAC per point assumption, including the impact of the previously mentioned charge related to the Delta partnership renewal. The increase also reflected higher salaries and employee benefits and other expenses, driven by an increase in card-related fraud losses, a change in the estimated value of certain investments in our CRA portfolio and higher restructuring charges in 2014. 64 Table of Contents TABLE 10: USCS SELECTED STATISTICAL INFORMATION As of or for the Years Ended December 31, (Millions, except percentages and where indicated) 2015 2014 2013 Change2015 vs. 2014 Change2014 vs. 2013 Card billed business (billions) $ 572.3 $ 542.0 $ 501.0 6 % 8 % Total cards-in-force 48.3 45.6 43.7 6 4 Basic cards-in-force 36.2 34.0 32.5 6 5 Average basic Card Member spending (dollars)* $ 16,413 $ 16,294 $ 15,689 1 4 U.S. Consumer Travel: Travel sales $ 3,761 $ 3,774 $ 3,967 — (5 ) Travel commissions and fees/sales 7.0 % 7.2 % 7.1 % Total segment assets (billions) (a) $ 117.3 $ 113.2 $ 103.5 4 9 Segment capital $ 10,320 $ 10,433 $ 9,269 (1 ) 13 Return on average segment capital (b) 32.4 % 32.5 % 35.6 % Return on average tangible segment capital (b) 33.7 % 33.6 % 37.0 % Card Member receivables: (c) Total receivables (billions) $ 23.3 $ 22.5 $ 21.8 4 3 Net write-off rate — principal only (d) 1.7 % 1.6 % 1.7 % Net write-off rate — principal and fees (d) 1.9 % 1.8 % 1.9 % 30+ days past due as a % of total 1.5 % 1.7 % 1.6 % Card Member loans: (c) Total loans (billions) $ 51.4 $ 62.6 $ 58.4 (18 )% 7 % Net write-off rate — principal only (d) 1.4 % 1.5 % 1.8 % Net write-off rate — principal, interest and fees (d) 1.6 % 1.7 % 2.0 % 30+ days past due loans as a % of total 1.0 % 1.0 % 1.1 % Calculation of Net Interest Yield on Card Member Loans: Net interest income $ 5,613 $ 5,182 $ 4,872 Exclude: Interest expense not attributable to the Company’s Card Member loan portfolio 164 157 183 Interest income not attributable to the Company’s Card Member loan portfolio (16 ) (11 ) (9 ) Adjusted net interest income (e) $ 5,761 $ 5,328 $ 5,046 Average loans including HFS loan portfolios (billions) (f) $ 61.9 $ 57.8 $ 54.7 Exclude certain non-traditional Card Member loans and other fees (billions) — — — Adjusted average loans (billions) (e) $ 61.9 $ 57.8 $ 54.7 Net interest income divided by average loans 9.1 % 9.0 % 8.9 % Net interest yield on Card Member loans (e) 9.3 % 9.2 % 9.2 % * Proprietary cards only.

TOTAL REVENUES NET OF INTEREST EXPENSE Non-interest revenues decreased $416 million or 9 percent in 2015 compared to 2014, and FX-adjusted non-interest revenues increased 5 percent, primarily driven by net foreign exchange fees and spread revenue on cross-border Card Member spending, higher net card fees and revenue from our Loyalty Partner business.3 Billed business decreased 10 percent in 2015 compared to 2014, while FX-adjusted billed business increased 3 percent, primarily due to higher average Card Member spending per card, partially offset by lower cards-in-force in Canada driven by the termination of our relationship with Costco in that country.3 Refer to Tables 5 and 6 for additional information on billed business by region. Interest income decreased $146 million or 13 percent (and remained flat on an FX-adjusted basis), in 2015 compared to 2014, primarily driven by lower average loans as a result of the termination of our relationship with Costco in Canada, offset by a higher net interest yield. 3 Interest expense decreased $88 million or 27 percent in 2015 compared to 2014, primarily driven by lower funding costs, as a result of lower average loans. Total revenues net of interest expense increased $91 million or 2 percent in 2014 compared to 2013, primarily driven by higher Loyalty Partner-related fees, higher discount revenue and an increase in net card fees. PROVISIONS FOR LOSSES Provisions for losses decreased $41 million or 11 percent (4 percent increase on an FX-adjusted basis) in 2015, compared to 2014, and decreased $18 million or 5 percent (1 percent on an FX-adjusted basis) in 2014 compared to 2013.3 Refer to Table 12 for Card Member receivables and loans write-off rates for 2015, 2014 and 2013. EXPENSES Marketing, promotion, rewards, Card Member services and other expenses decreased $217 million or 10 percent in 2015 compared to 2014, but increased 3 percent on an FX-adjusted basis, reflecting elevated levels of spending on growth initiatives, primarily in marketing.3 3 Refer to footnote 1 on page 55 for details regarding foreign currency adjusted information. 66 Table of Contents Salaries and employee benefits and other operating expenses decreased $275 million or 11 percent in 2015 compared to 2014, primarily due to restructuring charges in 2014. Total expenses increased $303 million or 7 percent in 2014 compared to 2013, primarily driven by higher marketing and promotion expenses, higher Loyalty Partner expenses and higher restructuring charges in 2014. INCOME TAXES The effective tax rate in all periods reflects the recurring permanent tax benefit related to the segment’s ongoing funding activities outside the United States, in relation to the levels of pretax income. The benefit is allocated to ICS under our internal tax allocation process. The effective tax rates for 2015 and 2013 also include the allocated share of tax benefits related to the resolution of certain prior-years’ items. In addition, the effective tax rate in each of the periods reflects the impact of recurring permanent tax benefits on varying levels of pretax income. 67 Table of Contents TABLE 12: ICS SELECTED STATISTICAL INFORMATION As of or for the Years Ended December 31, (Millions, except percentages and where indicated) 2015 2014 2013 Change2015 vs. 2014 Change2014 vs. 2013 Card billed business (billions) $ 120.2 $ 133.8 $ 131.7 (10 )% 2 % Total cards-in-force 15.2 15.7 15.7 (3 ) — Basic cards-in-force 10.5 11.0 10.7 (5 ) 3 Average basic Card Member spending (dollars)* $ 11,459 $ 12,297 $ 12,429 (7 ) (1 ) International Consumer Travel: Travel sales $ 1,304 $ 1,422 $ 1,420 (8 ) — Travel commissions and fees/sales 6.7 % 6.8 % 6.9 % Total segment assets (billions) (a) $ 35.4 $ 30.7 $ 31.1 15 (1 ) Segment capital $ 2,906 $ 2,948 $ 3,132 (1 ) (6 ) Return on average segment capital (b) 13.2 % 13.6 % 20.9 % Return on average tangible segment capital (b) 21.3 % 24.6 % 38.8 % Card Member receivables: Total receivables (billions) $ 7.0 $ 7.7 $ 7.8 (9 ) (1 ) Net write-off rate — principal only (d) 2.0 % 1.9 % (c ) Net write-off rate — principal and fees (d) 2.2 % 2.1 % (c ) 30+ days past due as a % of total 1.4 % 1.3 % (c ) 90+ days past billing as a % of total (c ) (c ) 1.1 % Net loss ratio as a % of charge volume (c ) (c ) 0.20 % Card Member loans: Total loans (billions) $ 7.1 $ 7.7 $ 8.8 (8 )% (13 )% Net write-off rate — principal only (d) 1.9 % 2.0 % 1.9 % Net write-off rate — principal, interest and fees (d) 2.4 % 2.4 % 2.3 % 30+ days past due loans as a % of total 1.6 % 1.6 % 1.4 % Calculation of Net Interest Yield on Card Member Loans: Net interest income $ 697 $ 755 $ 757 Exclude: Interest expense not attributable to the Company’s Card Member loan portfolio 68 89 93 Interest income not attributable to the Company’s Card Member loan portfolio (32 ) (39 ) (29 ) Adjusted net interest income (e) $ 733 $ 805 $ 821 Average loans (billions) $ 7.0 $ 8.2 $ 8.5 Exclude certain non-traditional Card Member loans and other fees (billions) (0.1 ) (0.2 ) (0.2 ) Adjusted average loans (billions) (e) $ 6.9 $ 8.0 $ 8.3 Net interest income divided by average loans 10.0 % 9.2 % 8.9 % Net interest yield on Card Member loans (e) 10.6 % 10.0 % 9.9 % * Proprietary cards only.

Our business travel operations, which had been included in GCS, were deconsolidated effective June 30, 2014 in connection with the formation of the GBT JV, discussed previously. Therefore, there is a lack of comparability against periods prior to the deconsolidation. Our proportional share of the GBT JV net income or loss is reported within Other revenues. TOTAL REVENUES NET OF INTEREST EXPENSE Non-interest revenues decreased $1.7 billion or 32 percent in 2015 compared to 2014. The decrease was primarily due to the gain on the sale of our investment in Concur in 2014 and the impact of the business travel joint venture transaction (resulting in a lack of comparability between periods). Billed business decreased 2 percent in 2015 compared to 2014 and increased 2 percent on an FX-adjusted basis.4 Billed business volume increased 2 percent within the United States and decreased 10 percent outside the United States. FX-adjusted billed business outside the United States increased 3 percent.4 Net interest expense decreased $54 million or 24 percent in 2015 compared to 2014, primarily driven by lower funding costs due to lower Card Member receivables. Total revenues net of interest expense increased $95 million or 2 percent in 2014 compared to 2013, primarily due to the gain on the sale of our investment in Concur in 2014 and higher discount revenue from an increased level of Card Member spending, partially offset by the impact of the business travel joint venture transaction (resulting in a lack of comparability between periods). PROVISIONS FOR LOSSES Provisions for losses decreased $32 million or 18 percent in 2015 compared to 2014, primarily driven by a lower charge card provision, resulting from a lower reserve build due to lower average Card Member receivables and lower net write-offs. Provisions for losses increased $51 million or 40 percent in 2014 compared to 2013, primarily driven by higher average Card Member receivables resulting in higher net write-offs. Refer to Table 14 for the charge card net loss ratio as a percentage of charge volume. 4 Refer to footnote 1 on page 55 for details regarding foreign currency adjusted information. 69 Table of Contents EXPENSES Marketing, promotion, rewards, Card Member services and other expenses decreased $50 million or 7 percent in 2015 compared to 2014, primarily driven by lower Card Member rewards due to lower spending volumes and a $13 million charge related to the Delta partnership renewal in the fourth quarter of 2014. Salaries and employee benefits and other operating expenses decreased $189 million or 11 percent in 2015 compared to 2014, primarily due to the impact of the business travel joint venture transaction (resulting in a lack of comparability between periods), partially offset by elevated level of spending on growth initiatives in 2015. Total expenses decreased $1.1 billion or 32 percent in 2014 compared to 2013, primarily due to the impact of the business travel joint venture transaction (resulting in a lack of comparability between periods), including the gain associated with the transaction in the second quarter of 2014, partially offset by transaction-related costs and restructuring charges. INCOME TAXES The effective tax rate for 2015 reflects the impact of certain nondeductible foreign losses. The effective tax rate for 2013 reflects the reversal of a valuation allowance related to deferred tax assets associated with certain of our non-U.S. business travel operations, as well as the allocated share of tax benefits related to the resolution of certain prior-years’ tax items.

GNMS acquires merchants; leverages our global closed-loop network to offer multi-channel marketing programs and capabilities, services and reporting and analytical data to our merchants around the world; and provides financing products for qualified merchants. It also enters into partnership agreements with third-party card issuers and acquirers to license the American Express brand and broaden the Card Member and merchant base for our network worldwide. TOTAL REVENUES NET OF INTEREST EXPENSE Non-interest revenues decreased $190 million or 4 percent in 2015 compared to 2014. FX-adjusted non-interest revenues increased 2 percent, primarily due to higher royalties from our GNS bank partners and an increase in discount revenue driven by 2 percent growth in global worldwide card billed business.5 Net interest income decreased $29 million or 9 percent in 2015 compared to 2014, due to a reduction in the interest expense credit, which was partially offset by higher interest income on our merchant financing loans. The interest expense credit relates to internal transfer pricing and funding rates, which resulted in a net benefit for GNMS due to its merchant payables. Total revenues net of interest expense increased $234 million or 4 percent in 2014 compared to 2013, primarily due to higher merchant-related revenues as a result of global worldwide card billed business growth of 7 percent, and an increase in net interest income. PROVISIONS FOR LOSSES Provisions for losses decreased $39 million or 42 percent in 2015 compared to 2014, and increased $26 million or 39 percent in 2014 compared to 2013. The change in both periods reflected a merchant-related charge in the fourth quarter of 2014. EXPENSES Marketing, promotion, rewards, Card Member services and other expenses decreased $121 million or 15 percent in 2015 compared to 2014, primarily driven by the reinvestment of a significant portion of the gain from the business travel joint venture transaction in growth initiatives in the prior year. Salaries and employee benefits and other operating expenses decreased $214 million or 10 percent in 2015 compared to 2014, primarily driven by a litigation reserve release in the third quarter of 2015, associated with the rejected 2013 merchant litigation settlement, and a prior-year restructuring charge. 5 Refer to footnote 1 on page 55 for details regarding foreign currency adjusted information. 71 Table of Contents Total expenses increased $57 million or 2 percent in 2014 compared to 2013, primarily driven by the reinvestment of a significant portion of the gain from the business travel joint venture transaction in growth initiatives, partially offset by a charge in 2013 to reserve for the previously mentioned merchant litigation settlement.

Return on average tangible segment capital, a non-GAAP measure, is computed in the same manner as return on average segment capital except the computation excludes from average segment capital average goodwill and other intangibles of $206 million, $189 million and $195 million as of December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively. We believe return on average tangible segment capital is a useful measure of the profitability of our business. CORPORATE & OTHER Corporate functions and certain other businesses, including EG and other operations, are included in Corporate & Other. Corporate & Other net expense increased to $1.1 billion in 2015, compared to $929 million and $900 million in 2014 and 2013, respectively. The increase in net expense was driven by EG charges in the third and fourth quarter of 2015 of $91 million and $419 million, respectively. The third quarter charge of $91 million related to previously capitalized software development costs, while the fourth quarter charge of $419 million reflected a write-down in goodwill ($219 million) and technology and other ($165 million), plus restructuring charges ($35 million). These 2015 charges were partially offset by higher restructuring costs in 2014. Refer to Note 2 to the “Consolidated Financial Statements” for further details on the fourth quarter EG impairment charges. Results for all periods disclosed also include net interest expense related to maintaining the liquidity pool discussed in “Consolidated Capital Resources and Liquidity — Liquidity Management,” as well as interest expense related to other corporate indebtedness. 72 Table of Contents CONSOLIDATED CAPITAL RESOURCES AND LIQUIDITY Our balance sheet management objectives are to maintain: • A solid and flexible equity capital profile; • A broad, deep and diverse set of funding sources to finance our assets and meet operating requirements; and • Liquidity programs that enable us to continuously meet expected future financing obligations and business requirements for at least a 12-month period, even in the event we are unable to continue to raise new funds under our traditional funding programs during a substantial weakening in economic conditions. CAPITAL STRATEGY Our objective is to retain sufficient levels of capital generated through earnings and other sources to maintain a solid equity capital base and to provide flexibility to support future business growth. We believe capital allocated to growing businesses with a return on risk-adjusted equity in excess of our costs will generate shareholder value. The level and composition of our consolidated capital position are determined through our internal capital adequacy assessment process, which takes into account our business activities, as well as marketplace conditions and requirements or expectations of credit rating agencies, regulators and shareholders, among others. Our consolidated capital position is also influenced by subsidiary capital requirements. As a bank holding company, we are also subject to regulatory requirements administered by the U.S. federal banking agencies. The Federal Reserve has established specific capital adequacy guidelines that involve quantitative measures of assets, liabilities and certain off-balance sheet items. We report our capital ratios using the Basel III capital definitions, inclusive of transition provisions, and the Basel III Standardized Approach for calculating risk-weighted assets (see section on Transitional Basel III). The Basel III standards will be fully phased-in by January 1, 2019 (see section on Fully Phased-in Basel III). We also report capital adequacy standards on a parallel basis to regulators under Basel requirements for Advanced Approaches institutions. The parallel period will continue until we receive regulatory approval to exit parallel reporting, at which point we will begin publicly disclosing regulatory risk-based capital ratios using both the Standardized and Advanced Approaches, and will be required to use the lower of the regulatory risk-based capital ratios based on the Standardized or Advanced Approaches to determine whether we are in compliance with minimum capital requirements. 73 Table of Contents The following table presents our regulatory risk-based capital ratios and leverage ratios and those of our significant bank subsidiaries, as well as additional ratios widely utilized in the marketplace, as of December 31, 2015.

We believe presenting the ratio of Tangible Common Equity to Risk-Weighted Assets is a useful measure of evaluating the strength of our capital position. Tangible Common Equity to Risk-Weighted Assets ratio is widely used in the marketplace, although it may be calculated differently by different companies. TABLE 18: REGULATORY RISK-BASED CAPITAL COMPONENTS AND RISK WEIGHTED ASSETS ($ in Billions) December 31,2015 Risk-Based Capital Common Equity Tier 1 $ 16.7 Tier 1 Capital 18.3 Tier 2 Capital (a) 2.3 Total Capital 20.6 Risk Weighted Assets 135.2 Average Total Assets to calculate the Tier 1 Leverage Ratio 156.4 Total Leverage Exposure to calculate SLR $ 186.6 (a) Tier 2 capital is the sum of the allowance for receivable and loan losses (limited to 1.25 percent of risk-weighted assets), a portion of the unrealized gains on equity securities, $600 million of subordinated notes issued in the fourth quarter of 2014 and $750 million of subordinated debentures. The $750 million of subordinated debentures do not meet the requirements of Tier 2 capital under Basel III, and are being transitioned out of capital (the total amount included in Tier 2 capital as of December 31, 2015, was $187 million). Hence, the total amount of subordinated debt included in Tier 2 capital as of December 31, 2015, was $787 million. The $750 million of subordinated debentures have been fully transitioned out of capital as of January 1, 2016. 74 Table of Contents We seek to maintain capital levels and ratios in excess of the minimum regulatory requirements and finance such capital in a cost efficient manner; failure to maintain minimum capital levels could affect our status as a financial holding company and cause the respective regulatory agencies to take actions that could limit our business operations. Our primary source of equity capital has been the generation of net income. Historically, capital generated through net income and other sources, such as the exercise of stock options by employees, has exceeded the annual growth in our capital requirements. To the extent capital has exceeded business, regulatory and rating agency requirements, we have historically returned excess capital to shareholders through our regular common share dividend and share repurchase program. We maintain certain flexibility to shift capital across our businesses as appropriate. For example, we may infuse additional capital into subsidiaries to maintain capital at targeted levels in consideration of debt ratings and regulatory requirements. These infused amounts can affect the capital profile and liquidity levels at the American Express parent company level. We do not currently intend or foresee a need to shift capital from non-U.S. subsidiaries with permanently reinvested earnings to a U.S. parent company. The following are definitions for our regulatory risk-based capital ratios and leverage ratio, which are calculated as per standard regulatory guidance: Risk-Weighted Assets — Assets are weighted for risk according to a formula used by the Federal Reserve to conform to capital adequacy guidelines. On- and off-balance sheet items are weighted for risk, with off-balance sheet items converted to balance sheet equivalents, using risk conversion factors, before being allocated a risk-adjusted weight. The off-balance sheet items comprise a minimal part of the overall calculation. Risk-weighted assets under Basel III as of December 31, 2015 were $135.2 billion. Common Equity Tier 1 Risk-Based Capital Ratio — The Common Equity Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio is calculated as Common Equity Tier 1 capital, divided by risk-weighted assets. Common Equity Tier 1 is the sum of common shareholders’ equity, adjusted for ineligible goodwill and intangible assets, certain deferred tax assets, as well as certain other comprehensive income items as follows: net unrealized gains/losses on securities and derivatives, and net unrealized pension and other postretirement benefit losses, all net of tax and subject to transition provisions. Common Equity Tier 1 capital as of December 31, 2015 was $16.7 billion. Tier 1 Risk-Based Capital Ratio — The Tier 1 capital ratio is calculated as Tier 1 capital divided by risk-weighted assets. Tier 1 capital is the sum of Common Equity Tier 1 capital, our perpetual preferred stock and third-party non-controlling interests in consolidated subsidiaries adjusted for capital to be held by insurance subsidiaries and deferred tax assets from net operating losses not deducted from Common Equity Tier 1 capital. Tier 1 capital as of December 31, 2015 was $18.3 billion. Total Risk-Based Capital Ratio — The total risk-based capital ratio is calculated as the sum of Tier 1 capital and Tier 2 capital, divided by risk-weighted assets. Tier 2 capital is the sum of the allowance for receivable and loan losses (limited to 1.25 percent of risk-weighted assets) a portion of the unrealized gains on equity securities, $600 million of subordinated notes issued in the fourth quarter of 2014 and $750 million of subordinated debentures adjusted for capital to be held by insurance subsidiaries. The $750 million of subordinated debentures do not meet the requirements of Tier 2 capital under Basel III, and are being transitioned out of capital (the total amount included in Tier 2 capital as of December 31, 2015 was $187 million). Hence, the total amount of subordinated debt included in Tier 2 capital as of December 31, 2015 was $787 million. Tier 2 capital as of December 31, 2015 was $2.3 billion. The $750 million of subordinated debentures have been fully transitioned out of capital as of January 1, 2016. See “Fully Phased-in Basel III” section. Tier 1 Leverage Ratio — The Tier 1 leverage ratio is calculated by dividing Tier 1 capital by our average total consolidated assets for the most recent quarter. Average total consolidated assets as of December 31, 2015 were $156.4 billion. The following is a definition for Tangible Common Equity to Risk-Weighted Assets ratio, which is widely used in the marketplace, although it may be calculated differently by different companies: Common Equity and Tangible Common Equity to Risk-Weighted Assets Ratios — Common equity equals our shareholders’ equity of $20.7 billion as of December 31, 2015, less preferred shares of $1.6 billion. Tangible common equity, a non-GAAP measure, equals common equity less goodwill and other intangibles of $3.5 billion as of December 31, 2015. We believe presenting the ratio of tangible common equity to risk-weighted assets is a useful measure of evaluating the strength of our capital position. 75 Table of Contents FULLY PHASED-IN BASEL III Basel III, when fully phased-in, will require bank holding companies and their bank subsidiaries to maintain more capital than prior requirements, with a greater emphasis on common equity. The following table presents our estimates for our regulatory risk-based capital ratios and leverage ratios had Basel III been fully phased-in as of December 31, 2015. These ratios are calculated using the Standardized Approach for determining risk-weighted assets. As noted previously, we are currently taking steps toward Basel III Advanced Approaches implementation in the United States. We believe the presentation of these ratios is helpful to investors by showing the impact of future regulatory capital standards on our capital and leverage ratios. TABLE 19: ESTIMATED FULLY PHASED-IN BASEL III CAPITAL AND LEVERAGE RATIOS ($ in Billions) December 31,2015 Estimated Common Equity Tier 1 Ratio under Fully Phased-In Basel III (a) 11.8 % Estimated Tier 1 Capital Ratio under Fully Phased-In Basel III (a) 13.0 Estimated Tier 1 Leverage Ratio under Fully Phased-In Basel III (b) 11.2 Estimated Supplementary Leverage Ratio under Fully Phased-In Basel III 9.4 % Estimated Risk-Weighted Assets under Fully Phased-In Basel III (c) $ 135.0 Estimated Average Total Assets to calculate the Tier 1 Leverage Ratio (b) 156.0 Estimated Total Leverage Exposure to calculate SLR under Fully Phased-In Basel III (d) $ 186.1 (a) The Fully Phased-in Basel III Common Equity Tier 1 and Tier 1 risk-based capital ratios, non-GAAP measures, are calculated as Common Equity Tier 1 or Tier 1 capital under Fully Phased-in Basel III rules, as applicable, divided by risk-weighted assets under Fully Phased-in Basel III rules. Refer to Table 20 for a reconciliation of Common Equity Tier 1 and Tier 1 capital under Fully Phased-in Basel III rules to Common Equity Tier 1 and Tier 1 capital under Transitional Basel III rules. (b) The Fully Phased-in Basel III Tier 1 and supplementary leverage ratios, non-GAAP measures, are calculated by dividing Fully Phased-in Basel III Tier 1 capital by our average total assets and Fully Phased-in total leverage exposure for supplementary leverage ratio purposes under Fully Phased-in Basel III, respectively. (c) Estimated Fully Phased-in Basel III risk-weighted assets, a non-GAAP measure, reflect our Basel III risk-weighted assets, with all transition provisions fully phased in. This includes incremental risk weighting applied to deferred tax assets and significant investments in unconsolidated financial institutions, as well as exposures to past due accounts, equities and sovereigns. (d) Estimated Fully Phased-in Basel III Leverage Exposure, a non-GAAP measure, reflects average total consolidated assets with adjustments for Tier 1 capital deductions on a fully phased-in basis, off-balance sheet derivatives, undrawn conditionally and unconditionally cancellable commitments and other off-balance sheet liabilities. The Basel capital standards establish minimum requirements for the Tier 1 risk-based capital ratios that are 1.5 percent higher than the minimum requirements for Common Equity Tier 1 risk-based capital ratios. This difference between Tier 1 capital, which includes common equity and qualifying preferred securities and Common Equity Tier 1 is also present in the minimum capital requirements within Comprehensive Capital Analysis and Review (CCAR). We issued $750 million of preferred shares in the fourth quarter of 2014 and $850 million in the first quarter of 2015. The preferred shares issuances help to finance a portion of the Tier 1 capital requirements in excess of common equity requirements. Our $750 million of subordinated debentures, which prior to 2014, were fully included in Tier 2 capital (but not in Tier 1 capital), do not meet the requirements of Tier 2 capital under Basel III. The phase-out of the subordinated debentures from Tier 2 capital began in the first quarter of 2014 and will be fully phased out on January 1, 2016, which affects our total risk-based capital ratio. At our option, the subordinated debentures are redeemable for cash on or after September 1, 2016 at 100 percent of the principal amount plus any accrued but unpaid interest. We currently intend to exercise this redemption option, subject to business and market conditions. As previously mentioned, we issued $600 million of subordinated notes in the fourth quarter of 2014, which qualifies as Tier 2 capital under Basel rules. Our total risk-based capital ratio is expected to remain well in excess of the required minimum. 76 Table of Contents The following table presents a comparison of our Common Equity Tier 1 and Tier 1 risk-based capital under Transitional Basel III rules to our estimated Common Equity Tier 1 and Tier 1 risk-based capital under Fully Phased-in Basel III rules as of December 31, 2015. TABLE 20: TRANSITIONAL BASEL III VERSUS FULLY PHASED-IN BASEL III (Billions) CET1 Tier 1 Risk-Based Capital under Transitional Basel III $ 16.7 $ 18.3 Adjustments related to: AOCI (0.3 ) (0.3 ) Transition provisions for intangible assets (0.5 ) (0.5 ) Deferred tax assets (0.1 ) (0.1 ) Other 0.1 0.1 Estimated Common Equity Tier 1 (CET1) and Tier 1 Risk-Based Capital under Fully Phased-in Basel III $ 15.9 $ 17.5 Fully Phased-in Basel III Risk-Weighted Assets — The Fully Phased-in Basel III risk-weighted assets reflect our Basel III risk-weighted assets, with all transition provisions fully phased in. This includes incremental risk weighting applied to deferred tax assets and significant investments in unconsolidated financial institutions, as well as exposures to past due accounts, equities and sovereigns. The Fully Phased-in Basel III risk-weighted assets as of December 31, 2015 were estimated to be $135.0 billion. Fully Phased-in Basel III Tier 1 Leverage Ratio — The Fully Phased-in Basel III Tier 1 leverage ratio is calculated by dividing Fully Phased-in Basel III Tier 1 capital by our average total consolidated assets. Basel III Supplementary Leverage Ratio — The supplementary leverage ratio under Fully Phased-in Basel III rules is calculated by dividing Fully Phased-in Basel III Tier 1 capital by our total assets for supplementary leverage capital purposes under Basel III. Total assets for supplementary leverage capital purposes reflect total consolidated assets with adjustments for Tier 1 capital deductions, off-balance sheet derivatives, undrawn unconditionally cancellable commitments and other off-balance sheet liabilities. Total assets for supplementary leverage capital purposes as of December 31, 2015 were estimated to be $186.1 billion. SHARE REPURCHASES AND DIVIDENDS We return capital to common shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. The share repurchases reduce common shares outstanding and more than offset the issuance of new shares as part of employee compensation plans. During the year ended December 31, 2015, we returned $5.6 billion to our shareholders in the form of common stock dividends ($1.1 billion) and share repurchases ($4.5 billion). We repurchased 58.8 million common shares at an average price of $76.70 in 2015. These dividend and share repurchase amounts represent approximately 105 percent of total capital generated during the year. The amount of capital we generated in 2015 significantly exceeded the capital required to finance organic business growth and acquisitions. The proposed sales of the HFS loan portfolios are expected to, all else remaining constant, increase our capital ratios due to the reduction in risk-weighted assets. This additional capital flexibility may be used to support growth in loans, potential acquisitions, distributions to shareholders, or a combination thereof. Beginning in 2016, participating CCAR firms are now required to submit their capital plans and stress testing results to the Federal Reserve on or before April 5 of each year instead of on or before January 5 of each year as previously required. The Federal Reserve is expected to publish the decisions for all the bank holding companies participating in CCAR 2016, including the reasons for any objection to capital plans, by June 30, 2016. In addition, during the year ended December 31, 2015, we had $750 million of non-cumulative perpetual preferred shares (the “Series B Preferred Shares”) and $850 million of non-cumulative perpetual preferred shares (the “Series C Preferred Shares”) outstanding. Dividends declared and paid on Series B and Series C Preferred Shares during 2015 were $40 million and $22 million, respectively. For additional information on our preferred shares refer to Note 17 “Common and Preferred Shares” and Note 22 “Earnings per Common Share (EPS); Preferred Shares” of the “Consolidated Financial Statements.” 77 Table of Contents FUNDING STRATEGY Our principal funding objective is to maintain broad and well-diversified funding sources to allow us to meet our maturing obligations, cost-effectively finance current and future asset growth in our global businesses as well as to maintain a strong liquidity profile. The diversity of funding sources by type of instrument, by maturity and by investor base, among other factors, provides additional insulation from the impact of disruptions in any one type of instrument, maturity or investor. The mix of our funding in any period will seek to achieve cost efficiency consistent with both maintaining diversified sources and achieving our liquidity objectives. Our funding strategy and activities are integrated into our asset-liability management activities. We have in place a funding policy covering American Express Company and all of our subsidiaries. Our proprietary card businesses are the primary asset-generating businesses, with significant assets in both domestic and international Card Member receivable and lending activities. Our financing needs are in large part a consequence of our proprietary card-issuing businesses and the maintenance of a liquidity position to support all of our business activities, such as merchant payments. We generally pay merchants for card transactions prior to reimbursement by Card Members and therefore fund the merchant payments during the period Card Member loans and receivables are outstanding. We also have additional financing needs associated with general corporate purposes, including acquisition activities. FUNDING PROGRAMS AND ACTIVITIES We meet our funding needs through a variety of sources, including direct and third-party distributed deposits and debt instruments, such as senior unsecured debentures, asset securitizations, borrowings through secured borrowing facilities and long-term committed bank borrowing facilities in certain non-U.S. regions. We had the following consolidated debt and customer deposits outstanding as of December 31: TABLE 21: SUMMARY OF CONSOLIDATED DEBT AND CUSTOMER DEPOSITS (Billions) 2015 2014 Short-term borrowings $ 4.8 $ 3.5 Long-term debt 48.1 58.0 Total debt 52.9 61.5 Customer deposits 55.0 44.2 Total debt and customer deposits $ 107.9 $ 105.7 Management does not currently expect to make any significant changes to our funding programs in order to satisfy Basel III’s liquidity coverage ratio (LCR) standard based upon our current understanding of the requirements, which may be subject to change as we receive additional clarification and implementation guidance from regulators relating to the requirements and as the interpretation of requirements evolves over time. Our funding plan for the full year 2016 includes, among other sources, approximately $3 billion to $7 billion of unsecured term debt issuance and up to $3 billion of secured term debt issuance. Our funding plans are subject to various risks and uncertainties, such as future business growth, the impact of global economic, political and other events on market capacity, demand for securities offered by us, regulatory changes, ability to securitize and sell receivables, and the performance of receivables previously sold in securitization transactions. Many of these risks and uncertainties are beyond our control. Our equity capital and funding strategies are designed, among other things, to maintain appropriate and stable unsecured debt ratings from the major credit rating agencies: Moody’s Investor Services (Moody’s), Standard & Poor’s (S&P), Fitch Ratings (Fitch) and Dominion Bond Rating Services (DBRS). Such ratings help support our access to cost-effective unsecured funding as part of our overall funding strategy. Our asset-backed securitization (ABS) activities are rated separately. 78 Table of Contents TABLE 22: UNSECURED DEBT RATINGS Credit Agency Entity Rated Short-TermRatings Long-TermRatings Outlook DBRS All rated entities R-1 (middle) A (high) Stable Fitch All rated entities F1 A+ Stable Moody’s TRS and rated operating subsidiaries (a) Prime-1 A2 Stable Moody’s American Express Company Prime-2 A3 Stable S&P TRS and rated operating subsidiaries (a)(b) A-2 A- Stable S&P American Express Company A-2 BBB+ Stable (a) American Express Travel Related Services Company, Inc. (b) S&P does not provide a rating for TRS short-term debt. Downgrades in the ratings of our unsecured debt or asset securitization program securities could result in higher funding costs, as well as higher fees related to borrowings under our unused lines of credit. Declines in credit ratings could also reduce our borrowing capacity in the unsecured debt and asset securitization capital markets. We believe our funding mix, including the proportion of U.S. retail deposits insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC), should reduce the impact that credit rating downgrades would have on our funding capacity and costs. SHORT-TERM FUNDING PROGRAMS Short-term borrowings, such as commercial paper, are defined as any debt with an original maturity of 12 months or less, as well as interest-bearing overdrafts with banks. Our short-term funding programs are used primarily to meet working capital needs, such as managing seasonal variations in receivables balances. The amount of short-term borrowings issued in the future will depend on our funding strategy, our needs and market conditions. We had the following short-term borrowings outstanding as of December 31: TABLE 23: SHORT-TERM BORROWINGS OUTSTANDING (Billions) 2015 2014 Commercial paper (a) $ 2.1 $ 0.8 Other short-term borrowings 2.7 2.7 Total $ 4.8 $ 3.5 (a) Average commercial paper outstanding was $0.9 billion and $0.2 billion in 2015 and 2014, respectively. Refer to Note 9 to the “Consolidated Financial Statements” for further description of these borrowings. DEPOSIT PROGRAMS We offer deposits within our American Express Centurion Bank (Centurion Bank) and American Express Bank, FSB (American Express Bank) subsidiaries (together, the Banks). These funds are currently insured up to $250,000 per account holder through the FDIC. Our ability to obtain deposit funding and offer competitive interest rates is dependent on the Banks’ capital levels. We, through the American Express Bank, have a direct retail deposit program, Personal Savings from American Express, to supplement our distribution of deposit products sourced through third-party distribution channels. The direct retail program makes FDIC-insured certificates of deposit (CDs) and high-yield savings account products available directly to consumers. 79 Table of Contents We held the following deposits as of December 31: TABLE 24: CUSTOMER DEPOSITS (Billions) 2015 2014 U.S. retail deposits: Savings accounts — Direct $ 29.0 $ 26.2 Certificates of deposit: (a) Direct 0.3 0.3 Third-party (brokered) 13.9 7.8 Sweep accounts — Third-party (brokered) 10.9 9.0 Other retail deposits: Non-U.S. deposits and U.S. non-interest bearing 0.2 0.2 Card Member credit balances — U.S. and non-U.S. 0.7 0.7 Total customer deposits $ 55.0 $ 44.2 (a) The weighted average remaining maturity and weighted average rate at issuance on the total portfolio of U.S. retail CDs, issued through direct and third-party programs, were 30.7 months and 1.69 percent, respectively, as of December 31, 2015. LONG-TERM DEBT PROGRAMS During 2015, we and our subsidiaries issued unsecured debt and asset-backed securities with maturities ranging from 2 to 5 years. These amounts included approximately $6.6 billion of unsecured debt and $1.0 billion of AAA-rated securitization certificates and notes. During the year, we retained approximately $0.1 billion of subordinated securities, as the pricing for these securities were not attractive compared to our other sources of financing available. Our 2015 debt issuances were as follows: TABLE 25: DEBT ISSUANCES (Billions) American Express Credit Corporation: Fixed Rate Senior Notes (weighted-average coupon of 2.26%) $ 4.9 Floating Rate Senior Notes (3-month LIBOR plus 80 basis points on average) 1.7 American Express Credit Account Master Trust: (a) Floating Rate Senior Certificates (1-month LIBOR plus 29 basis points on average) 1.0 Total $ 7.6 (a) Issuances from the American Express Credit Account Master Trust (the Lending Trust) do not include $0.1 billion of subordinated securities retained by us during the year. ASSET SECURITIZATION PROGRAMS We periodically securitize Card Member receivables and loans arising from our card business, as the securitization market provides us with cost-effective funding. Securitization of Card Member receivables and loans is accomplished through the transfer of those assets to a trust, which in turn issues securities collateralized by the transferred assets to third-party investors. The proceeds from issuance are distributed to us, through our wholly owned subsidiaries, as consideration for the transferred assets. The receivables and loans being securitized are reported as Card Member receivables and loans on our Consolidated Balance Sheets, with a portion also included in Card Member loans and receivables HFS, and the related securities issued to third-party investors are reported as long-term debt. Under the respective terms of the securitization trust agreements, the occurrence of certain triggering events associated with the performance of the assets of each trust could result in payment of trust expenses, establishment of reserve funds, or in a worst-case scenario, early amortization of investor securities. During the twelve months ended December 31, 2015, no such triggering events occurred. 80 Table of Contents LIQUIDITY MANAGEMENT We incur liquidity risk that arises in the course of offering our products and services. Our liquidity objective is to maintain access to a diverse set of on- and off-balance sheet liquidity sources. We seek to maintain liquidity sources, even in the event we are unable to raise new funds under our regular funding programs during a substantial weakening in economic conditions, in amounts sufficient to meet our expected future financial obligations and our businesses’ requirements for liquidity for a period of at least twelve months. Our liquidity risk policy sets out our objectives and approach to managing liquidity risk. The liquidity risks that we are exposed to could arise from a wide variety of scenarios. Our liquidity management strategy thus includes a number of elements, including, but not limited to: • Maintaining diversified funding sources (refer to the “Funding Strategy” section for more details); • Maintaining unencumbered liquid assets and off-balance sheet liquidity sources; • Projecting cash inflows and outflows under a variety of economic and market scenarios; • Establishing clear objectives for liquidity risk management, including compliance with regulatory requirements; • Incorporating liquidity risk management as appropriate into our capital adequacy framework. We seek to maintain access to a diverse set of on-balance sheet and off-balance sheet liquidity sources, including cash and other liquid assets, committed bank credit facilities and ABS conduit facilities. Through our U.S. bank subsidiaries, we also hold collateral eligible for use at the Federal Reserve’s discount window. The amount and type of liquidity resources we maintain can vary over time, based upon the results of stress scenarios required under the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (Dodd-Frank) and other regulatory measures of liquidity, such as the Liquidity Coverage Ratio (LCR), as well as additional stress scenarios required under our liquidity risk policy. These stress scenarios possess distinct characteristics, varying by cash flow assumptions, time horizon and qualifying liquidity sources, among other factors. Scenarios under our liquidity risk policy include market-wide, firm-specific and combined liquidity stresses. The LCR rule prescribes cash flow assumptions over a 30-day period and establishes qualifying criteria for high-quality liquid assets. We consider other factors in determining the amount and type of liquidity we maintain, such as economic and financial market conditions, seasonality in business operations, growth in our businesses, potential acquisitions or dispositions, the cost and availability of alternative liquidity sources and credit rating agency guidelines and requirements. The investment income we receive on liquidity resources, such as cash, is less than the interest expense on the sources of funding for these balances. The net interest costs on these amounts have been substantial. The level of future net interest costs depends on the amount of liquidity resources we maintain and the difference between our cost of funding these amounts and their investment yields. Securitized Borrowing Capacity As of December 31, 2015, we maintained our committed, revolving, secured borrowing facility, with a maturity date of July 15, 2018, that gives us the right to sell up to $3.0 billion face amount of eligible AAA notes from the American Express Issuance Trust II (the Charge Trust together with the Lending Trust, the Trusts). We also maintained our committed, revolving, secured borrowing facility, with a maturity date of September 15, 2017, that gives us the right to sell up to $2.0 billion face amount of eligible AAA certificates from the Lending Trust. Both facilities are used in the ordinary course of business to fund seasonal working capital needs, as well as to further enhance our contingent funding resources. As of December 31, 2015, $1.0 billion was drawn on the Charge Trust facility and $0.1 billion was drawn on the Lending Trust facility, both of which were subsequently repaid on January 15, 2016. Federal Reserve Discount Window As insured depository institutions, the Banks may borrow from the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco, subject to the amount of qualifying collateral that they may pledge. The Federal Reserve has indicated that both credit and charge card receivables are a form of qualifying collateral for secured borrowings made through the discount window. Whether specific assets will be considered qualifying collateral and the amount that may be borrowed against the collateral remain at the discretion of the Federal Reserve. We had approximately $50.9 billion as of December 31, 2015 in U.S. credit card loans and charge card receivables that could be sold over time through our securitization trusts or pledged in return for secured borrowings, to provide further liquidity, subject in each case to applicable market conditions and eligibility criteria. 81 Table of Contents Committed Bank Credit Facilities In addition to the secured borrowing facilities described earlier in this section, we maintained a committed syndicated bank credit facility as of December 31, 2015 of $3.0 billion, which expires on December 9, 2018. The availability of this credit line is subject to our compliance with certain financial covenants, principally the maintenance by American Express Credit Corporation (Credco) of a certain ratio of combined earnings and fixed charges to fixed charges. As of December 31, 2015, we were in compliance with each of our covenants. As of December 31, 2015, no amounts were drawn on the committed credit facility. The capacity of the facility mainly served to further enhance our contingent funding resources. Our committed bank credit facility does not contain a material adverse change clause, which might otherwise preclude borrowing under the credit facility, nor is it dependent on our credit rating. CASH FLOWS The following table summarizes our cash flow activity, followed by a discussion of the major drivers impacting operating, investing and financing cash flows. TABLE 26: CASH FLOWS (Billions) 2015 2014 2013 Total cash provided by (used in): Operating activities $ 11.0 $ 11.0 $ 8.5 Investing activities (8.2 ) (8.0 ) (7.2 ) Financing activities (2.0 ) — (3.9 ) Effect of foreign currency exchange rates on cash and cash equivalents (0.3 ) (0.2 ) (0.2 ) Net increase (decrease) in cash and cash equivalents $ 0.5 $ 2.8 $ (2.8 ) Cash Flows from Operating Activities Our cash flows from operating activities primarily include net income adjusted for (i) non-cash items included in net income and (ii) changes in the balances of operating assets and liabilities, which can vary significantly in the normal course of business due to the amount and timing of payments. For December 31, 2015 and 2014, net cash provided by operating activities remained consistent at $11.0 billion in both periods, driven by net income of $5.2 billion and $5.9 billion, respectively, adjusted for non-cash items including certain changes in provisions for losses, depreciation and amortization, deferred taxes, and stock-based compensation. Cash Flows from Investing Activities Our cash flows from investing activities primarily include changes in Card Member receivables and loans, including Card Member loans and receivables HFS, as well as changes in our available for sale investment securities portfolio. For the year ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, net cash used in investing activities was $8.2 billion and $8.0 billion, respectively. Both periods primarily reflect an increase in Card Member receivables and loans, including the HFS portfolios. In 2014, that increase was partially offset by the cash proceeds from the sale of our investment in Concur. Cash Flows from Financing Activities Our cash flows from financing activities primarily include issuing and repaying debt, changes in customer deposits, issuing and repurchasing our common shares, and paying dividends. For the year ended December 31, 2015, net cash used in financing activities was $2.0 billion. For the year ended December 31, 2014, net cash provided by financing activities was $11 million. The variance was primarily driven by an increase in debt repayments in the current year versus the prior year, partially offset by a greater increase in customer deposits in the current year versus the prior year. 82 Table of Contents OFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS AND CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS We have identified both on- and off-balance sheet transactions, arrangements, obligations and other relationships that may have a material current or future effect on our financial condition, changes in financial condition, results of operations, or liquidity and capital resources. CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS The table below identifies transactions that represent our contractually committed future obligations. Purchase obligations include our agreements to purchase goods and services that are enforceable and legally binding and that specify significant terms, including: fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased; fixed, minimum or variable price provisions; and the approximate timing of the transaction. TABLE 27: COMMITTED FUTURE OBLIGATIONS BY YEAR Payments due by year (a) (Millions) 2016 2017-2018 2019-2020 2021 andthereafter Total Long-term debt $ 6,814 $ 28,608 $ 10,262 $ 3,176 $ 48,860 Interest payments on long-term debt (b) 864 1,016 331 1,360 3,571 Certificates of deposit 2,493 6,810 4,841 — 14,144 Other long-term liabilities (c) 184 70 17 22 293 Operating lease obligations 165 278 187 863 1,493 Purchase obligations (d) 397 165 61 30 653 Cobrand obligations (e) 212 138 63 204 617 Total $ 11,129 $ 37,085 $ 15,762 $ 5,655 $ 69,631 (a) The table above excludes approximately $0.9 billion of tax liabilities related to the uncertainty in income taxes as inherent complexities and the number of tax years currently open for examination in multiple jurisdictions do not permit reasonable estimates of payments, if any, to be made over a range of years. (b) Estimated interest payments were calculated using the effective interest rate in place as of December 31, 2015, and includes the effect of existing interest rate swaps. Actual cash flows may differ from estimated payments. (c) As of December 31, 2015, there were no minimum required contributions, and no contributions are currently planned, for the U.S. American Express Retirement Plan. For the U.S. American Express Retirement Restoration Plan and non-U.S. defined benefit pension and postretirement benefit plans, contributions in 2016 are anticipated to be approximately $44 million, and this amount has been included within other long-term liabilities. Remaining obligations under defined benefit pension and postretirement benefit plans aggregating $726 million have not been included in the table above as the timing of such obligations is not determinable. Additionally, other long-term liabilities do not include $6.7 billion of Membership Rewards liabilities, which are not considered long-term liabilities as Card Members in good standing can redeem points immediately, without restrictions, and because the timing of point redemption is not determinable. (d) The purchase obligation amounts represent either the early termination fees or non-cancelable minimum contractual obligations, as applicable, by period under contracts that were in effect as of December 31, 2015. (e) Represents obligations to make payments under contractual agreements with certain cobrand partners. We expect to fully satisfy these obligations over the remaining term of these agreements as part of the ongoing operations of our business. In addition to the contractual obligations noted in Table 27, we have off-balance sheet arrangements that include guarantees, indemnifications and certain other off-balance sheet arrangements. GUARANTEES Our principal guarantees are associated with Card Member services to enhance the value of owning an American Express card. As of December 31, 2015, we had guarantees totaling approximately $48 billion related to Card Member protection plans, as well as other guarantees and indemnifications provided in the ordinary course of business. Refer to Note 16 to the “Consolidated Financial Statements” for further discussion regarding our guarantees. CERTAIN OTHER OFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS As of December 31, 2015, we had approximately $297 billion of unused credit available to Card Members as part of established lending product agreements. Total unused credit available to Card Members does not represent potential future cash requirements, as a significant portion of this unused credit will likely not be drawn. Our charge card products generally have no pre-set limit, and therefore are not reflected in unused credit available to Card Members. To mitigate counterparty credit risk related to derivatives, we accepted non-cash collateral in the form of security interests in U.S. Treasury securities from its derivatives counterparties with a fair value of nil and $91 million as of December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively, none of which was sold or repledged. Refer to Notes 7 and 13 to the “Consolidated Financial Statements” for discussion regarding our other off-balance sheet arrangements. 83 Table of Contents RISK MANAGEMENT GOVERNANCE We use our comprehensive Enterprise-wide Risk Management (ERM) program to identify, aggregate, monitor, and manage risks. The program also defines our risk appetite, governance, culture and capabilities. The implementation and execution of the ERM program is headed by our Chief Risk Officer. Risk management is overseen by our Board of Directors through three Board committees: the Risk Committee, the Audit and Compliance Committee, and the Compensation and Benefits Committee. Each committee consists entirely of independent directors and provides regular reports to the full Board regarding matters reviewed at their committee. The committees meet regularly in private sessions with our Chief Risk Officer, the Chief Compliance & Ethics Officer, the General Auditor and other senior management with regard to our risk management processes, controls, talent and capabilities. The Board monitors the “tone at the top,” our risk culture, and oversees emerging and strategic risks. The Risk Committee of our Board of Directors provides oversight on risk policies, risk appetite and our performance against goals. The Risk Committee approves our ERM policy along with its sub-policies governing individual credit risk, institutional credit risk, market risk, liquidity risk, operational risk, reputational risk and asset/liability risk, as well as policies governing the launch of new products and services, third-party management, and resolution planning. The ERM policy defines our risk appetite as well as governance over risk taking and oversight processes. Risk appetite defines the authorized risk limits to control exposures well within our risk capacity even under stressed forward-looking scenarios. In addition, it establishes principles for risk taking in the aggregate and for each risk type, and is supported by a comprehensive system for monitoring limits, escalation triggers and assessing control programs. The Risk Committee reviews and concurs in the appointment, replacement, performance and compensation of our Chief Risk Officer and receives regular updates from the Chief Risk Officer on key risks, transactions and exposures. The Risk Committee reviews our credit risk profile as well as credit risk performance, trends and risk management capabilities. The Risk Committee also reviews enterprise-wide operational risk trends, events and capabilities, with an emphasis on compliance, fraud, legal, process or control failures, information security, and privacy, as well as trends in market, funding, liquidity and reputational risks. The Risk Committee also provides oversight of our compliance with Basel capital and liquidity standards and its Internal Capital Adequacy Assessment Process, including its CCAR submissions; and resolution planning. The Audit and Compliance Committee of our Board of Directors approves our compliance policies and risk tolerance, and reinforces the importance of our compliance risk management. In addition, the Audit and Compliance Committee reviews the effectiveness of our Corporate-wide Compliance Risk Management Program. More broadly, this committee is responsible for assisting the Board in its oversight responsibilities relating to the integrity of our financial statements and financial reporting process, internal and external auditing, including the qualifications and independence of the independent registered public accounting firm and the performance of our internal audit services function, and the integrity of our systems of internal accounting and financial controls. The Audit and Compliance Committee provides oversight of our Internal Audit Group. The Audit and Compliance Committee reviews and concurs in the appointment, replacement, performance and compensation of our General Auditor and approves Internal Audit’s annual Audit Plan, charter, policies and budget. The Audit and Compliance Committee also receives regular updates on the Audit Plan’s status and results including significant reports issued by Internal Audit and the status of our corrective actions. The Compensation and Benefits Committee of our Board of Directors works with the Chief Risk Officer to ensure our overall compensation programs, as well as those covering our business units and risk-taking employees, appropriately balance risk with business incentives and how business performance is achieved without taking imprudent or excessive risk. Our Chief Risk Officer is actively involved in setting goals, including for our business units. Our Chief Risk Officer also reviews the current and forward-looking risk profiles of each business unit, and provides input into performance evaluation. The Chief Risk Officer meets with the Compensation and Benefits Committee and attests whether performance goals and results have been achieved without taking imprudent risks. The Compensation and Benefits Committee uses a risk-balanced incentive compensation framework to decide on our bonus pools and the compensation of senior executives. 84 Table of Contents There are several internal management committees, including the Enterprise-wide Risk Management Committee (ERMC), chaired by our Chief Risk Officer. The ERMC is the highest-level management committee to oversee all firm-wide risks. It maintains the enterprise-wide risk appetite framework and monitors compliance with limits and escalations defined in it. The ERMC oversees implementation of risk policies companywide with approval by the appropriate board committee. The ERMC reviews key risk exposures, trends and concentrations, significant compliance matters, economic capital and Basel capital trends, and provides guidance on the steps to monitor, control and report major risks. The ERMC is responsible for risk governance, risk oversight and risk appetite for all risks, which include individual credit risk, institutional credit risk, operational risk, compliance risk, reputational risk, market risk, asset liability management (ALM) risk, liquidity risk, model risk, and strategic and business risk. As defined in the ERM policy, we follow the “three lines of defense” approach to risk management. The first line of defense comprises functions and management committees directly initiating risk taking. Business unit presidents, our Chief Credit Officer, Chief Operational Risk Officer, Chief Market Risk Officer and Functional Risk Officer are part of the first line of defense. The second line comprises independent functions overseeing risk taking activities of the first line. The Global Risk Oversight Officer and Market Risk Oversight Officer, the Chief Compliance & Ethics Officer, the Corporate Comptroller and certain control groups, both at the enterprise level and within regulated entities, are part of the second line of defense. The global risk oversight team oversees the policies, strategies, frameworks, models, processes and capabilities deployed by the first line teams and provides challenges and independent assessments on how the first line of defense is managing risks. Our Internal Audit Group constitutes the third line of defense, and provides independent assessments and effective challenge of the first and second lines of defense. In addition, the Asset Liability Committee, chaired by our Chief Financial Officer, is responsible for managing market, liquidity, asset/liability risk and capital. CREDIT RISK MANAGEMENT PROCESS Credit risk is defined as loss due to obligor or counterparty default or changes in the credit quality of a security. Our credit risks are divided into two broad categories: individual and institutional. Each has distinct risk management capabilities, strategies, and tools. Business units that create individual or institutional credit risk exposures of significant importance are supported by dedicated risk management teams, each led by a Chief Credit Officer. To preserve independence, Chief Credit Officers for all business units report to our Chief Credit Officer. INDIVIDUAL CREDIT RISK Individual credit risk arises principally from consumer and small business charge cards, credit cards, lines of credit, and loans. These portfolios consist of millions of customers across multiple geographies, industries and levels of net worth. We benefit from the high-quality profile of our customers, which is driven by our brand, premium customer servicing, product features and risk management capabilities, which span underwriting, customer management and collections. Externally, the risk in these portfolios is correlated to broad economic trends, such as unemployment rates and gross domestic product (GDP) growth, which can affect customer liquidity. The business unit leaders and their Chief Credit Officers take the lead in managing the individual credit risk process. These Chief Credit Officers are guided by the Individual Credit Risk Committee, which is responsible for implementation and enforcement of the Individual Credit Risk Management Policy. This policy is further supported by subordinate policies and operating manuals covering decision logic and processes of credit extension, including prospecting, new account approvals, point-of-sale authorizations, credit line management and collections. The subordinate risk policies and operating manuals are designed to ensure consistent application of risk management principles and standardized reporting of asset quality and loss recognition. Individual credit risk management is supported by sophisticated proprietary scoring and decision-making models that use the most up-to-date information on prospects and customers, such as spending and payment history and data feeds from credit bureaus. Additional data, such as commercial variables, are integrated to further mitigate small business risk. We have developed data-driven economic decision logic for customer interactions to better serve our customers. INSTITUTIONAL CREDIT RISK Institutional credit risk arises principally within our Global Corporate Payments, Global Merchant Services, GNS, Prepaid Services, and Foreign Exchange Services businesses, as well as investment and liquidity management activities. Unlike individual credit risk, institutional credit risk is characterized by a lower loss frequency but higher severity. It is affected both by general economic conditions and by client-specific events. The absence of large losses in any given year or over several years is not necessarily representative of the level of risk of institutional portfolios, given the infrequency of loss events in such portfolios. 85 Table of Contents Similar to Individual Credit Risk, business units taking institutional credit risks are supported by Chief Credit Officers. These officers are guided by the Institutional Risk Management Committee (IRMC), which is responsible for implementation and enforcement of the Institutional Credit Risk Management Policy and for providing guidance to the credit officers of each business unit with substantial institutional credit risk exposures. The committee, along with the business unit Chief Credit Officers, makes investment decisions in core risk capabilities, ensures proper implementation of the underwriting standards and contractual rights of risk mitigation, monitors risk exposures, and determines risk mitigation actions. The IRMC formally reviews large institutional risk exposures to ensure compliance with ERMC guidelines and procedures and escalates them to the ERMC as appropriate. At the same time, the IRMC provides guidance to the business unit risk management teams to optimize risk-adjusted returns on capital. A centralized risk rating unit and a specialized airline risk group provide risk assessment of our institutional obligors. Exposure to the Airline Industry We have multiple important cobrand, rewards, merchant acceptance and corporate payments arrangements with airlines. The ERM program evaluates the risks posed by our airline partners and the overall airline strategy companywide through comprehensive business analysis of global airlines. Our largest airline partner is Delta, and this relationship includes exclusive cobrand credit card partnerships and other arrangements including Membership Rewards redemption, merchant acceptance, travel and corporate payments. See “Risk Factors.” Sovereign Debt Exposure As part of our ongoing risk management process, we monitor our financial exposure to both sovereign and non-sovereign customers and counterparties, and measure and manage concentrations of risk by geographic regions, as well as by economic sectors and industries. A primary focus area for monitoring is credit deterioration due to weaknesses in economic and fiscal profiles. We evaluate countries based on the market assessment of the riskiness of their sovereign debt and our assessment of our economic and financial outlook and closely monitor those deemed high risk. As of December 31, 2015, we considered our gross credit exposures to government entities, financial institutions and corporations in those countries deemed high risk to be individually and collectively not material. OPERATIONAL RISK MANAGEMENT PROCESS We define operational risk as the risk of not achieving business objectives due to inadequate or failed processes, people, or information systems, or the external environment, including failures to comply with laws and regulations. Operational risk is inherent in all business activities and can impact an organization through direct or indirect financial loss, brand damage, customer dissatisfaction, or legal and regulatory penalties. To appropriately measure and manage operational risk, we have implemented a comprehensive operational risk framework that is defined in the Operational Risk Management Policy approved by the Risk Committee. The Operational Risk Management Committee (ORMC) coordinates with all control groups on effective risk assessments and controls and oversees the preventive, responsive and mitigation efforts by Lead Operational Risk Officers in the business units and staff groups. To preserve independence, the Lead Operational Risk Officers for all business units report to our Chief Operational Risk Officer, who in turn reports directly to our Chief Risk Officer. We use the operational risk framework to identify, measure, monitor and report inherent and emerging operational risks. This framework, supervised by the ORMC, consists of (a) operational risk event capture, (b) a project office to coordinate issue management and control enhancements, (c) key risk indicators such as customer complaints or pre-implementation test metrics, and (d) process and entity-level risk assessments. The framework requires the assessment of operational risk events to determine root causes, impact to customers and/or us, and resolution plan accountability to correct any defect, remediate customers, and enhance controls and testing to mitigate future issues. Our impact is assessed from an operational, financial, brand, regulatory compliance and legal perspective. INFORMATION SECURITY, PRIVACY, AND DATA GOVERNANCE We have implemented an Information Security Framework and Operating Model that is designed to protect information and information systems from unauthorized access, use, disclosure, disruption, modification or destruction. Chaired by the Chief Information Security Officer, our Information Security Risk Management Committee, a sub-committee of the ORMC, provides oversight and governance for our information security risk management program. In addition, the committee is responsible for establishing cyber risk tolerances and in managing cyber crisis preparedness. The Information Security Oversight team provides challenges and independent assessment of the information security program. 86 Table of Contents We assess our cyber risk across four categories of “threat actors” that we currently believe pose the greatest risk, namely cyber criminals, nation state sponsored groups, determined insiders and “hacktivists” or social objectors. Our Information Security Framework and Operating Model uses an approach that looks at different phases of security to prepare, prevent, detect, respond and recover from cyber-security attacks. Our Privacy Framework and Operating Model follow a similar structure. Co-chaired by the U.S. Chief Privacy Officer and the International Chief Privacy Officer, our Privacy Risk Management Committee, a sub-committee of the ORMC, provides oversight and governance for our privacy program. The committee is responsible for the governance over the collection, notice, use, sharing, transfer, confidentiality and retention of personal data. Our Enterprise Data Governance Framework and Policy defines governance and data standards for data used in regulatory reporting, risk management as well as other critical systems including big data capabilities. COMPLIANCE RISK MANAGEMENT PROCESS We define compliance risk as the risk of legal or reputational harm, fines, monetary penalties and payment of damages or other forms of sanction as a result of non-compliance with applicable laws, regulations, rules or standards of conduct. We view our ability to effectively mitigate compliance risk as an important aspect of our business model. Our Global Compliance and Ethics organization is responsible for establishing and maintaining our corporate-wide Compliance Risk Management Program. Pursuant to this program, we seek to manage and mitigate compliance risk by assessing, controlling, monitoring, measuring and reporting the regulatory risks to which we are exposed. We have a comprehensive Anti-Money Laundering program that monitors and reports suspicious activity to the appropriate government authorities. As part of that program, the Global Risk Oversight team provides independent risk assessment of the models and rules used by the Anti-Money Laundering team. In addition, the Internal Audit Group reviews the processes for practices consistent with regulatory guidance. REPUTATIONAL RISK MANAGEMENT PROCESS We define reputational risk as the risk that negative publicity regarding our products, services, business practices, management, clients and partners, whether perceived or real, could cause a decline in the customer base, costly litigation, or revenue reductions. We view protecting our reputation as core to our vision of becoming the world’s most respected service brand and fundamental to our long-term success. Our business leaders are responsible for ensuring that reputational risk implications of transactions, business activities and management practices are appropriately considered and relevant subject matter experts are engaged as needed. The ERMC and its sub-committees are responsible for reviewing decisions where reputational risk may exist and ensuring that reputational risk considerations are properly reflected. MARKET RISK MANAGEMENT PROCESS Market risk is the risk to earnings or asset and liability values resulting from movements in market prices. Our market risk exposures include: • Interest rate risk due to changes in the relationship between interest rates on our assets (such as loans, receivables and investment securities) and our interest rates on our liabilities (such as debt and deposits); and • Foreign exchange risk related to earnings, funding, transactions and investments in currencies other than the U.S. dollar. Our Asset-Liability Management (ALM) and Market Risk policies establish the framework that guides and governs market risk management, including quantitative limits and escalation triggers. These policies are approved by the Risk Committee of the Board of Directors. Market risk is managed by the Market Risk Committee. The Market Risk Oversight Officer provides an independent risk assessment and oversight over the policies and exposures for market risk and ALM activities, as well as ensuring compliance with the Volcker Rule and other regulatory requirements. Market risk management is also guided and governed by policies covering the use of derivative financial instruments, funding, liquidity and investments. 87 Table of Contents Our interest rate exposure can vary over time as a result of, among other things, the proportion of our total funding provided by variable-and fixed-rate debt and deposits compared to our Card Member loans and receivables. Interest rate swaps are used from time to time to effectively convert debt issuances to (or from) variable-rate, from (or to) fixed-rate. We do not engage in derivative financial instruments for trading purposes. Refer to Note 14 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion of our derivative financial instruments. We analyze a variety of interest rate scenarios to inform us of the potential impacts from interest rate changes on earnings and the value of assets, liabilities and the economic value of equity. As of December 31, 2015, the detrimental effect on our annual net interest income of a hypothetical, immediate 100 basis point increase in interest rates would be approximately $216 million. To calculate this effect, the projected net interest income over a 12-month time horizon is measured, considering forecasted business growth and future interest rates. The change in projected net interest income from a 100 basis point increase in rates is measured by increasing our forecast of future interest rates by 100 basis points. The timing and loan balances associated with the sales of the HFS loan portfolios are key assumptions in projecting business growth this year. The HFS loan portfolio sales, if and when completed, are expected to reduce our exposure to rising interest rates, all else remaining constant. We are also subject to market risk from changes in the relationship between the benchmark Prime rate that determines the yield on our variable-rate lending receivables and the benchmark LIBOR rate that determines the effective interest cost on a significant portion of our outstanding debt. Differences in the rate of change of these two indices, commonly referred to as basis risk, would impact our variable-rate U.S. lending net interest margins because we borrow at rates based on LIBOR but lend to our customers based on the Prime rate. The detrimental effect on our net interest income of a hypothetical 10 basis point decrease in the spread between Prime and one-month LIBOR over the next 12 months is estimated to be $35 million. We currently have approximately $40 billion of Prime-based, variable-rate U.S. lending receivables and $35 billion of LIBOR-indexed debt, including asset securitizations. The HFS loan portfolios sales are expected to reduce our basis risk exposure, all else remaining constant. Foreign exchange exposures arise in four principal ways: 1) Card Member spending in currencies that are not the billing currency, 2) cross-currency transactions and balances from our funding activities, 3) cross-currency investing activities, such as in the equity of foreign subsidiaries, and 4) revenues generated and expenses incurred in foreign currencies, which impact earnings. These foreign exchange risks are managed primarily by entering into foreign exchange spot transactions or hedged with foreign exchange forward contracts when the hedge costs are economically justified and in notional amounts designed to offset pre-tax impacts from currency movements in the period in which they occur. As of December 31, 2015 and 2014, foreign currency derivative instruments with total notional amounts of approximately $26 billion and $30 billion were outstanding, respectively. With respect to Card Member spending and cross-currency transactions, including related foreign exchange forward contracts outstanding, a hypothetical 10 percent strengthening of the U.S. dollar would result in an immaterial impact to projected earnings as of December 31, 2015. With respect to translation exposure of foreign subsidiary equity balances, including related foreign exchange forward contracts outstanding, a hypothetical 10 percent strengthening of the U.S. dollar would result in an immaterial reduction in other comprehensive income and equity as of December 31, 2015. With respect to earnings denominated in foreign currencies, the adverse impact on pretax income of a hypothetical 10 percent strengthening of the U.S. dollar related to anticipated overseas operating results for the next 12 months would be approximately $179 million as of December 31, 2015. The actual impact of interest rate and foreign exchange rate changes will depend on, among other factors, the timing of rate changes, the extent to which different rates do not move in the same direction or in the same direction to the same degree, changes in the cost, volume and mix of our hedging activities and changes in the volume and mix of our businesses. FUNDING & LIQUIDITY RISK MANAGEMENT PROCESS Liquidity risk is defined as our inability to meet our ongoing financial and business obligations as they become due at a reasonable cost. Our Board-approved Liquidity Risk Policy establishes the framework that guides and governs liquidity risk management. Liquidity risk is managed by the Funding and Liquidity Committee. In addition, the Market Risk Oversight Officer provides independent oversight of liquidity risk management. We manage liquidity risk by maintaining access to a diverse set of cash, readily-marketable securities and contingent sources of liquidity, such that we can continuously meet our business requirements and expected future financing obligations for at least a 12-month period, even in the event we are unable to raise new funds under our regular funding programs during a substantial weakening in economic conditions. We consider the trade-offs between maintaining too much liquidity, which can be costly and limit financial flexibility, and having inadequate liquidity, which may result in financial distress during a liquidity event. 88 Table of Contents Liquidity risk is managed at an aggregate consolidated level as well as at certain subsidiaries in order to ensure that sufficient and accessible liquidity resources are maintained. The Funding and Liquidity Committee reviews forecasts of our aggregate and subsidiary cash positions and financing requirements, approves funding plans designed to satisfy those requirements under normal and stressed conditions, establishes guidelines to identify the amount of liquidity resources required and monitors positions and determines any actions to be taken. MODEL RISK MANAGEMENT PROCESS We define model risk as the risk of adverse consequences, such as financial loss, poor business and strategic decision making, or damage to our reputation, from decisions based on incorrect or misused model outputs and reports. We manage model risk through a comprehensive model governance framework, including policies and procedures for model development, independent model validation and change management capabilities that seek to minimize erroneous model methodology, outputs and misuse. We also assess model performance on an ongoing basis. STRATEGIC AND BUSINESS RISK MANAGEMENT PROCESS Strategic and business risk is the risk related to our inability to achieve our business objectives due to poor strategic decisions, including decisions related to mergers, acquisitions, and divestitures, poor implementation of strategic decisions or declining demand for our products and services. Strategic decisions are reviewed and approved by business leaders and various committees and must be aligned with company policies. We seek to manage strategic and business risks through risk controls embedded in these processes as well as overall risk management oversight over business goals. Existing product performance is reviewed periodically by committees and business leaders. Mergers, acquisitions and divestitures can only be approved following Deal Committee due diligence, a comprehensive risk assessment by operational, market, credit and oversight leaders and approval by either the Chief Risk Officer or appropriate risk committees. All new products and material changes in business processes are reviewed and approved by the New Products Committee and appropriate credit or risk committees. 89 Table of Contents CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES Refer to Note 1 to the “Consolidated Financial Statements” for a summary of our significant accounting policies. Certain of our accounting policies requiring significant management assumptions and judgments are as follows: RESERVES FOR CARD MEMBER LOSSES Reserves for Card Member losses represent our best estimate of the probable losses inherent in our outstanding portfolio of Card Member receivables and loans, as of the balance sheet date. As of December 31, 2015, this estimate does not reflect Card Member loans and receivables HFS. Refer to Note 2 to the “Consolidated Financial Statements” for additional information. In estimating these losses, we use statistical and analytical models that analyze portfolio performance and reflect our judgment regarding the quantitative components of the reserve. The models take into account several factors, including delinquency-based loss migration rates, loss emergence periods and average losses over an appropriate historical period, as well as expected future recoveries. We also consider whether to adjust the quantitative reserve for certain external and internal qualitative factors that may increase or decrease the reserves for losses on Card Member receivables and loans. The process of estimating these reserves requires a high degree of judgment. To the extent historical credit experience, updated for any external and internal qualitative factors such as environmental trends, is not indicative of future performance, actual losses could differ significantly from our judgments and expectations, resulting in either higher or lower future provisions for Card Member losses in any quarter. As of December 31, 2015, a 10 percent increase in our estimate of losses inherent in the outstanding portfolio of Card Member receivables and loans evaluated collectively for impairment, would increase reserves for losses with a corresponding change to provisions for losses by approximately $149 million. This sensitivity analysis is provided as a hypothetical scenario to assess the sensitivity of the provisions for losses. It does not represent our expectations for losses in the future, nor does it include how other portfolio factors such as delinquency-based loss migration rates or recoveries, or the amount of outstanding balances, may impact the level of reserves for losses and the corresponding impact on the provisions for losses. LIABILITY FOR MEMBERSHIP REWARDS EXPENSE The Membership Rewards program is our largest card-based rewards program. Card Members can earn points for purchases charged on their enrolled card products. Certain types of purchases allow Card Members to also earn bonus points. Membership Rewards points are redeemable for a broad variety of rewards including travel, entertainment, retail certificates and merchandise. Points typically do not expire, and there is no limit on the number of points a Card Member may earn. We record a Membership Rewards liability that represents the estimated cost of points earned that are expected to be redeemed by Card Members in the future. The Membership Rewards liability is impacted over time by enrollment levels, attrition, the volume of points earned and redeemed, and the associated redemption costs. We estimate the Membership Rewards liability by determining the URR and the WAC per point, which are applied to the points of current enrollees. The URR assumption is used to estimate the number of points earned by current enrollees that will ultimately be redeemed in future periods. We use statistical and actuarial models to estimate the URR of points earned to date by current Card Members based on redemption trends, card product type, enrollment tenure, card spend levels and credit attributes. The WAC per point assumption is used to estimate future redemption costs and is primarily based on redemption choices made by Card Members, reward offerings by partners, and Membership Rewards program changes. The WAC per point is derived from the previous 12 months of redemptions and is adjusted as appropriate for certain changes in redemption costs that are not representative of future cost expectations. We periodically evaluate our liability estimation process and assumptions based on developments in redemption patterns, cost per point redeemed, partner contract changes and other factors. The process of estimating the Membership Rewards liability includes a high degree of judgment. Actual redemptions and associated redemption costs could differ significantly from our judgment, resulting in either higher or lower Membership Rewards expense. Changes in the Membership Rewards URR and WAC per point have the effect of either increasing or decreasing the liability through the current period marketing, promotion, rewards and Card Member services expense by an amount estimated to cover the cost of all points previously earned but not yet redeemed by current enrollees as of the end of the reporting period. As of December 31, 2015, an increase in the estimated URR of current enrollees of 100 basis points would increase the Membership Rewards liability and corresponding rewards expense by approximately $341 million. Similarly, an increase in the WAC per point of 1 basis point would increase the Membership Rewards liability and corresponding rewards expense by approximately $85 million. 90 Table of Contents FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENT We hold investment securities and derivative instruments that are carried at fair value on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Management makes assumptions and judgments when estimating the fair values of these financial instruments. In accordance with fair value measurement and disclosure guidance, the objective of a fair value measurement is to determine the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date based on the principal or, in the absence of a principal, most advantageous market for the specific asset or liability. The disclosure guidance establishes a three-level hierarchy of inputs to valuation techniques used to measure fair value. The fair value hierarchy gives the highest priority to the measurement of fair value based on unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities (Level 1), followed by the measurement of fair value based on pricing models with significant observable inputs (Level 2), with the lowest priority given to the measurement of fair value based on pricing models with significant unobservable inputs (Level 3). We did not have any Level 3 financial instruments measured on a recurring basis during the year ended December 31, 2015. Investment Securities Our investment securities are mostly composed of fixed-income securities issued by states and municipalities, as well as the U.S. Government and Agencies. The fair market values for our investment securities, including investments comprising defined benefit pension plan assets, are obtained primarily from pricing services we engage and for each security, we receive one price from that pricing service. The fair values provided by the pricing services are estimated using pricing models, where the inputs to those models are based on observable market inputs or recent trades of similar securities. The pricing services did not apply any adjustments to the pricing models used as of December 31, 2015 and 2014. In addition, we did not apply any adjustments to prices received from the pricing services. We reaffirm our understanding of the valuation techniques used by our pricing services at least annually. In addition, we corroborate the prices provided by our pricing services for reasonableness by comparing the prices from the respective pricing services to valuations obtained from different pricing sources as well as comparing prices to the sale prices received from sold securities at least quarterly. In the measurement of fair value for our investment securities, even though the underlying inputs used in the pricing models are directly observable from active markets or recent trades of similar securities in inactive markets, the pricing models do entail a certain amount of subjectivity, and therefore differing judgments in the underlying inputs, or how they are modeled, could result in a different estimate of fair value. Other-Than-Temporary Impairment of Investment Securities Realized losses are recognized when management determines that a decline in the fair value of investment securities is other-than-temporary. Such determination requires judgment regarding the amount and timing of recovery. We review and evaluate our investment securities at least quarterly, and more often as market conditions may require, to identify investment securities that have indications of other-than-temporary impairments. We consider several factors when evaluating debt securities for other-than-temporary impairment, including the determination of the extent to which a decline in the fair value of a security is due to increased default risk for the specific issuer, or market interest rate risk. With respect to market interest rate risk, we assess whether we have the intent to sell the investment securities and whether we are more likely than not to be required to sell the investment securities before recovery of any unrealized losses. In determining whether any of our investment securities are other-than-temporarily impaired, a change in facts and circumstances could lead to a change in management judgment about our view on collectability and credit quality of the issuer, or the impact of market interest rates on the investment securities. Any such changes could result in us recognizing an other-than-temporary impairment loss through earnings. Derivative Instruments Our primary derivative instruments are interest rate swaps and foreign currency forward agreements. The fair value of our derivative instruments is estimated by using either a third-party valuation service that uses proprietary pricing models, or by internal pricing models, where the inputs to those models are readily observable from actively quoted markets. We reaffirm our understanding of the valuation techniques used by a third-party valuation service at least annually. To mitigate credit risk arising from our derivative instruments, counterparties are required to be pre-approved and rated as investment grade. In addition, we manage certain counterparty credit risks by exchanging cash and non-cash collateral under executed credit support agreements. The non-cash collateral does not reduce the derivative balance included in Other assets on the Consolidated Balance Sheets, but effectively reduces risk exposure as it is available in the event of counterparty default. Based on the assessment of credit risk of our derivative counterparties, we do not have derivative positions that warrant credit valuation adjustments. In the measurement of fair value for our derivative instruments, although the underlying inputs used in the pricing models are readily observable from actively quoted markets, the pricing models do entail a certain amount of subjectivity, and therefore differing judgments in the underlying inputs, or how they are modeled, could result in a different estimate of fair value. 91 Table of Contents GOODWILL RECOVERABILITY Goodwill represents the excess of acquisition cost of an acquired business over the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed. Goodwill is not amortized but is tested for impairment at the reporting unit level annually or when events or circumstances arise, such as adverse changes in the business climate, that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of the reporting unit below its carrying value. Our approach and methodology for conducting our goodwill impairment testing is fundamentally based on the measurement of fair value for our reporting units, which inherently entails the use of significant judgment. For valuation, we use a combination of the income approach (discounted cash flows) and market approach (market multiples) in estimating the fair value of our reporting units. When preparing discounted cash flow models under the income approach, we estimate future cash flows using the reporting unit’s internal multi-year forecast, and a terminal value calculated using a growth rate that we believe is appropriate in light of current and expected future economic conditions. To discount these cash flows we use our expected cost of equity, determined using a capital asset pricing model. When using the market method under the market approach, we apply comparable publicly traded companies’ multiples (e.g., earnings, revenues) to our reporting units’ actual results. The judgment in estimating forecasted cash flows, discount rates and market comparables is significant, and imprecision could materially affect the fair value of our reporting units. Refer to Note 2 of the “Consolidated Financial Statements” for additional information regarding the EG goodwill impairment in 2015. We could be exposed to an increased risk of further goodwill impairment if future operating results or macroeconomic conditions differ significantly from management’s current assumptions. INCOME TAXES We are subject to the income tax laws of the United States, its states and municipalities and those of the foreign jurisdictions in which we operate. These tax laws are complex, and the manner in which they apply to the taxpayer’s facts is sometimes open to interpretation. In establishing a provision for income tax expense, we must make judgments about the application of inherently complex tax laws. Unrecognized Tax Benefits We establish a liability for unrecognized tax benefits, which are the differences between a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return and the benefit recognized in the financial statements. In establishing a liability for an unrecognized tax benefit, assumptions may be made in determining whether, and the extent to which, a tax position should be sustained. A tax position is recognized only when it is more likely than not to be sustained upon examination by the relevant taxing authority, based on its technical merits. The amount of tax benefit recognized is the largest benefit that we believe is more likely than not to be realized on ultimate settlement. As new information becomes available, we evaluate our tax positions and adjust our unrecognized tax benefits, as appropriate. Tax benefits ultimately realized can differ from amounts previously recognized due to uncertainties, with any such differences generally impacting the provision for income tax. Deferred Tax Asset Realization Deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the differences between the financial statement and tax bases of assets and liabilities using the enacted tax rates expected to be in effect for the years in which the differences are expected to reverse. Since deferred taxes measure the future tax effects of items recognized in the Consolidated Financial Statements, certain estimates and assumptions are required to determine whether it is more likely than not that all or some portion of the benefit of a deferred tax asset will not be realized. In making this assessment, we analyze and estimate the impact of future taxable income, reversing temporary differences and available tax planning strategies. These assessments are performed quarterly, taking into account any new information. Changes in facts or circumstances can lead to changes in the ultimate realization of deferred tax assets due to uncertainties. 92 Table of Contents OTHER MATTERS RECENTLY ISSUED ACCOUNTING STANDARDS Refer to the Recently Issued Accounting Standards section of Note 1 to the “Consolidated Financial Statements.” GLOSSARY OF SELECTED TERMINOLOGY Adjusted average loans — Represents average Card Member loans on a gross basis, including gross loans classified as held for sale (i.e., not adjusted for any valuation allowance), and excluding the impact of certain non-traditional Card Member loans and other fees. Adjusted net interest income — Represents net interest income attributable to our Card Member loans and loans HFS, including interest that is deemed uncollectible; excludes the impact of interest expense and interest income not attributable to our Card Member loans. Asset securitizations — Asset securitization involves the transfer and sale of receivables or loans to a special-purpose entity created for the securitization activity, typically a trust. The trust, in turn, issues securities, commonly referred to as asset-backed securities that are secured by the transferred receivables or loans. The trust uses the proceeds from the sale of such securities to pay the purchase price for the underlying receivables or loans. The receivables and loans of our Charge Trust and Lending Trust being securitized are reported as assets, and the securities issued by the Trusts are reported as liabilities on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. Average discount rate — This calculation is generally designed to reflect pricing at merchants accepting general-purpose American Express cards. It represents the percentage of billed business (generated from both proprietary and GNS Card Member spending) retained by us from merchants we acquire, or for merchants acquired by a third party on our behalf, net of amounts retained by such third party. Basic cards-in-force — Proprietary basic consumer cards-in-force includes basic cards issued to the primary account owner, (i.e., not including additional supplemental cards issued on accounts). Proprietary basic small business and corporate cards-in-force includes both basic and supplemental cards issued. Non-proprietary basic cards-in-force includes cards that are issued and outstanding under network partnership agreements, except for supplemental cards and retail cobrand Card Member accounts which have had no out-of-store spending activity during the prior 12-month period. Billed business — Includes activities (including cash advances) related to proprietary cards, cards issued under network partnership agreements (non-proprietary billed business), corporate payment services and certain insurance fees charged on proprietary cards. In-store spending activity within retail cobrand portfolios in GNS, from which we earn no revenue, is not included in non-proprietary billed business. Card billed business is included in the United States or outside the United States based on where the issuer is located. Capital ratios — Represents the minimum standards established by the regulatory agencies as a measure to determine whether the regulated entity has sufficient capital to absorb on- and off-balance sheet losses beyond current loss accrual estimates. Refer to the Capital Strategy section under “Consolidated Capital Resources and Liquidity” for further related definitions under Transitional Basel III and Fully Phased-in Basel III. Card Member — The individual holder of an issued American Express-branded charge, credit and certain prepaid cards. Card Member loans — Represents the outstanding amount due from Card Members for charges made on their American Express credit cards, as well as any interest charges and card-related fees. Card Member loans also include revolving balances on certain American Express charge card products. Card Member loans and receivables HFS — Beginning as of December 1, 2015, represents Card Member loans and receivables related to our cobrand partnerships with Costco in the United States and Jetblue. Card Member receivables — Represents the outstanding amount due from Card Members for charges made on their American Express charge cards, as well as any card-related fees. Charge cards — Represents cards that generally carry no pre-set spending limits and are primarily designed as a method of payment and not as a means of financing purchases. Charge Card Members generally must pay the full amount billed each month. No finance charges are assessed on charge cards. Each charge card transaction is authorized based on its likely economics reflecting a Card Member’s most recent credit information and spend patterns. Some charge card accounts have an additional lending-on-charge feature that allows revolving certain balances. Credit cards — Represents cards that have a range of revolving payment terms, grace periods, and rate and fee structures. Discount revenue — Represents revenue earned from fees generally charged to merchants who have entered into a card acceptance agreement. The discount fee generally is deducted from our payment for Card Member purchases. Discount revenue is reduced by incentive payments made to merchants, payments to third-party card issuing partners, cash-back reward costs and statement credits, corporate incentive payments and other similar items. 93 Table of Contents Interest expense — Includes interest incurred primarily to fund Card Member receivables and loans, general corporate purposes and liquidity needs, and is recognized as incurred. Interest expense is divided principally into two categories: (i) deposits, which primarily relates to interest expense on deposits taken from customers and institutions, and (ii) debt, which primarily relates to interest expense on our long-term financing and short-term borrowings, (e.g., commercial paper, federal funds purchased, bank overdrafts and other short-term borrowings), as well as the realized impact of derivatives hedging interest rate risk on our long-term debt. Interest income — Includes (i) interest on loans, (ii) interest and dividends on investment securities and (iii) interest income on deposits with banks and other. Interest on loans — Assessed using the average daily balance method for Card Member loans and loans HFS. Unless the loan is classified as non-accrual, interest is recognized based upon the principal amount outstanding in accordance with the terms of the applicable account agreement until the outstanding balance is paid or written off. Interest and dividends on investment securities — Primarily relates to our performing fixed-income securities. Interest income is recognized as earned using the effective interest method, which adjusts the yield for security premiums and discounts, fees and other payments, so a constant rate of return is recognized on the outstanding balance of the related investment security throughout its term. Amounts are recognized until securities are in default or when it is likely that future interest payments will not be made as scheduled. Interest income on deposits with banks and other — Recognized as earned, and primarily relates to the placement of cash in excess of near-term funding requirements in interest-bearing time deposits, overnight sweep accounts, and other interest-bearing demand and call accounts. Liquidity Coverage Ratio — Represents the proposed minimum standards being established by the regulatory agencies as a measure to determine whether the regulated entity has sufficient liquidity to meet liquidity needs in periods of financial and economic stress. Merchant acquisition — Represents our process of entering into agreements with merchants to accept American Express-branded cards. Net card fees — Represents the card membership fees earned during the period. These fees are recognized as revenue over the covered card membership period (typically one year), net of the provision for projected refunds for Card Membership cancellation and deferred acquisition costs. Net interest yield on Card Member loans — Net interest yield on Card Member loans is computed by dividing adjusted net interest income by adjusted average loans, computed on an annualized basis. The calculation of net interest yield on Card Member loans includes interest that is deemed uncollectible. Reserves and net write-offs related to uncollectible interest are recorded through provisions for losses, which are not included in the net interest yield calculation. Net loss ratio — Represents the ratio of GCS charge card write-offs, consisting of principal (resulting from authorized transactions) and fee components, less recoveries, on Card Member receivables expressed as a percentage of gross amounts billed to corporate Card Members. Net write-off rate — principal only — Represents the amount of Card Member loans or USCS and ICS Card Member receivables written off, consisting of principal (resulting from authorized transactions), less recoveries, as a percentage of the average loan balance or USCS and ICS average receivables balance during the period. Net write-off rate — principal, interest and fees — Includes, in the calculation of the net write-off rate, amounts for interest and fees in addition to principal for Card Member loans, and fees in addition to principal for USCS and ICS Card Member receivables. Operating expenses — Represents salaries and employee benefits, professional services, occupancy and equipment, communications and other expenses. Return on average equity — Calculated by dividing one-year period net income by one-year average total shareholders’ equity. Return on average segment capital — Calculated by dividing one-year period segment income by one-year average segment capital. Return on average tangible segment capital — Computed in the same manner as the return on average segment capital, except the computation of average tangible segment capital excludes from average segment capital, average goodwill and other intangibles. Segment capital — Represents the capital allocated to a segment based upon specific business operational needs, risk measures, and regulatory capital requirements. Total cards-in-force — Represents the number of cards that are issued and outstanding. Non-proprietary cards-in-force includes all cards that are issued and outstanding under network partnership agreements, except for retail cobrand Card Member accounts which have no out-of-store spending activity during the prior 12-month period. Travel sales — Represents the total dollar amount of travel transaction volume for airline, hotel, car rental, and other travel arrangements made for consumers and small businesses. We earn revenue on these transactions by charging a transaction or management fee. 94 Table of Contents CAUTIONARY NOTE REGARDING FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS This report includes forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, which are subject to risks and uncertainties.

Factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from these forward-looking statements, include, but are not limited to, the following: • our ability to grow in the future, which will depend in part on the following: an acceleration of billed business and revenue growth, which could be impacted by, among other things, weakening economic conditions in the U.S. or internationally, a decline in consumer confidence impacting the willingness and ability of Card Members to sustain spending, a further decline in gas prices, a further strengthening of the U.S. dollar, a greater erosion of the average discount rate than expected and lower spending on new cards acquired than estimated; our success in addressing competitive pressures and implementing strategies and business initiatives, including growing profitable spending through proprietary, cobrand and network products, increasing penetration among corporate, middle market and small business clients, expanding our international footprint, growing loyalty coalitions and increasing merchant acceptance; the timing and impact of any potential sale of the Costco U.S. Card Member loan portfolio; realizing incremental economics associated with the Costco U.S. contract extension, which could be impacted by, among other things, Card Member behavior, including the desire of Costco U.S. Card Members to continue to use their Costco U.S. cobrand cards and the availability to those Card Members of other payment forms; the impact of any potential restructuring charges or other contingencies, including, but not limited to, litigation-related expenses, impairments, the imposition of fines or civil money penalties, an increase in Card Member reimbursements and changes in reserves; credit performance remaining in line with current expectations; continued growth of Card Member loans held for investment; the ability to continue to realize benefits from restructuring actions and operating leverage at levels consistent with current expectations;

our tax rate remaining in line with current expectations, which could be impacted by, among other things, our geographic mix of income being weighted more to higher tax jurisdictions than expected and unfavorable tax audits and other unanticipated tax items; the impact of accounting changes and reclassifications; and our ability to continue executing the share repurchase program; • our ability to reduce our overall cost base by $1 billion by the end of 2017, which will depend in part on the timing and financial impact of future reengineering plans (including whether we will recognize restructuring charges in future periods), which could be impacted by factors such as our inability to mitigate the operational and other risks posed by potential staff reductions, our inability to develop and implement technology resources to realize cost savings, underestimating hiring needs related to some of the job positions being eliminated and other employee needs not currently anticipated, lower than expected attrition rates and higher than expected redeployment rates; our ability to reduce annual operating expenses, which could be impacted by, among other things, the factors identified below; and our ability to optimize and lower marketing and promotion expenses, which could be impacted by higher advertising and mailing costs, competitive pressures that may require additional expenditures or limit our ability to reduce costs, contractual obligations with business partners, the availability of opportunities to invest at a higher level due to favorable business results and changes in macroeconomic conditions; • the ability to reduce annual operating expenses, which could be impacted by increases in significant categories of operating expenses, such as consulting or professional fees, including as a result of increased litigation, compliance or regulatory-related costs, technology costs or fraud costs; our ability to develop, implement and achieve substantial benefits from reengineering plans; higher than expected employee levels; the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates on costs; the payment of civil money penalties, disgorgement, restitution, non-income tax assessments and litigation-related settlements; impairments of goodwill or other assets; management’s decision to increase or decrease spending in such areas as technology, business and product development and sales forces depending on overall business performance; greater than expected inflation or merit increases; our ability to balance expense control and investments in the business; the impact of accounting changes and reclassifications; and the level of acquisition activity and related expenses; • our lending write-off rates increasing more quickly than current expectations and provision expense being higher than current expectations, which will depend in part on changes in the level of loan balances, delinquency rates of Card Members, unemployment rates, the volume of bankruptcies and recoveries of previously written-off loans; 95 Table of Contents • our ability to execute against our lending strategy and grow Card Member loans held for investment, including by targeting new lending prospects and deepening relationships with current customers, which may be affected by increasing competition, brand perceptions and reputation, our ability to manage risk in a growing Card Member loan portfolio, and the behavior of Card Members and their actual spending and borrowing patterns, which in turn may be driven by our ability to issue new and enhanced card products, offer attractive services and rewards programs, attract new Card Members, reduce Card Member attrition and capture a greater share of existing Card Members’ spending and borrowing; • uncertainties associated with the timing and impact of any potential sale of the Costco U.S. Card Member loan portfolio and the extension of the merchant acceptance agreement, such as the negotiation and execution of definitive documentation, operational issues related to the transfer of Card Member loans and accounts, the parties’ ability to satisfy the closing conditions and the amount of any gain we recognize as a result of a sale, which could be impacted by the credit quality and performance of the portfolio, the amount of any volume decline experienced by the cobrand portfolio and the timing of the potential sale as the gain will be determined by the amount of the aggregate outstanding loans transferred at closing; • the erosion of the average discount rate by a greater amount than anticipated during 2016 and beyond, including as a result of changes in the mix of spending by location and industry, merchant incentives and concessions, volume-related pricing discounts, strategic investments, certain pricing initiatives, competition, pricing regulation (including regulation of competitors’ interchange rates) and other factors; • the possibility that we will not fully execute on our plans for OptBlue to significantly increase merchant coverage, which will depend in part on the success of OptBlue merchant acquirers in signing merchants to accept American Express, which could be impacted by the pricing set by the merchant acquirers, the value proposition offered to small merchants and the efforts of OptBlue merchant acquirers to sign merchants for American Express acceptance, as well as the willingness of Card Members to use American Express cards at small merchants and of those merchants to accept American Express cards;

4962,AXP,AMERICAN EXPRESS CO,2017,"ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (MD&A) EXECUTIVE OVERVIEW BUSINESS INTRODUCTION We are a global services company with four reportable operating segments: U.S. Consumer Services (USCS), International Consumer and Network Services (ICNS), Global Commercial Services (GCS) and Global Merchant Services (GMS). The following types of revenue are generated from our various products and services: • Discount revenue, our largest revenue source, represents fees generally charged to merchants for accepting our cards as payment for goods or services sold. The fees charged, or merchant discount, which is generally expressed as a percentage of the charge amount, varies with, among other factors, the industry in which the merchant does business, the charge amount and the merchant’s overall charge volume, the method of submission of charges, the timing and method of payment to the merchant and, in certain instances, the geographic scope for the related card acceptance agreement (e.g., domestic or global). In some instances, an additional flat transaction fee is assessed as part of the merchant discount, and additional fees may be charged such as a variable fee for “non-swiped” card transactions or for transactions using cards issued outside the United States at merchants located in the United States; • Interest on loans, principally represents interest income earned on outstanding balances; • Net card fees, represent revenue earned from annual card membership fees, which varies based on the type of card and the number of cards for each account; • Other fees and commissions, represent foreign currency conversion fees charged to Card Members, Card Member delinquency fees, loyalty coalition-related fees, travel commissions and fees, service fees and fees related to our Membership Rewards program; and • Other revenue, represents revenues arising from contracts with partners of our Global Network Services (GNS) business (including commissions and signing fees), net revenue earned on cross-border Card Member spending, insurance premiums earned from Card Member travel and other insurance programs, merchant-related fees unrelated to merchant discount, prepaid card and Travelers Cheque-related revenue, revenues related to the American Express Global Business Travel Joint Venture (the GBT JV) transition services agreement, earnings from equity method investments (including the GBT JV) and other miscellaneous revenue and fees. FINANCIAL HIGHLIGHTS For 2016, we reported net income of $5.4 billion and diluted earnings per share of $5.65. This compared to $5.2 billion of net income and $5.05 diluted earnings per share for 2015, and $5.9 billion of net income and $5.56 diluted earnings per share for 2014. 2016 results included: • A $1.1 billion ($677 million after tax) gain on the sale of Card Member loans and receivables related to our cobrand partnership with Costco in the second quarter; • $410 million ($266 million after tax) of net restructuring charges; and • A $127 million ($79 million after tax) gain on the sale of Card Member loans and receivables related to our cobrand partnership with JetBlue in the first quarter. 2015 results included: • A $419 million ($335 million after tax) charge related to the Prepaid Services business, that was driven primarily by the impairment of goodwill and technology, plus some restructuring costs. 2014 results included: • A $719 million ($453 million after tax) gain on the sale of our investment in Concur Technologies (Concur) in the fourth quarter; • A $626 million ($409 million after tax) gain as a result of the GBT JV transaction in the second quarter; • $420 million ($277 million after tax) of net charges for costs related to reengineering initiatives; and • A $109 million ($68 million after tax) charge related to the renewal of our partnership with Delta Air Lines (Delta) in the fourth quarter. 36 Table of Contents NON-GAAP MEASURES We prepare our Consolidated Financial Statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (GAAP). However, certain information included within this report constitutes non-GAAP financial measures. Our calculations of non-GAAP financial measures may differ from the calculations of similarly titled measures by other companies. BUSINESS ENVIRONMENT In a challenging economic, competitive and regulatory environment, we remain focused on our key priorities of accelerating revenue growth, optimizing investments and resetting our cost base. In 2016, revenue was lower year-over-year, though revenue performance sequentially improved in the fourth quarter. We made a record level of business-building investments during 2016 and continued to make progress on our plans to remove $1 billion from our overall cost base by the end of 2017. In addition, we continued to leverage our strong capital position to return capital to shareholders through share repurchases and dividends. Our worldwide billings for 2016 adjusted for foreign currency exchange rates were up slightly year-over-year. Our U.S. consumer billings were down, resulting from the end of the Costco relationship in the United States in June 2016. We saw strong performance from middle market and small businesses in the United States, while spending by large corporations declined year-over-year. Internationally, our consumer and small business billings growth rates remained strong. Revenues net of interest expense for the year declined versus the prior year, primarily reflecting higher Costco-related revenues in the prior year. After excluding Costco-related revenues and the effect of foreign currency exchange rates, adjusted revenues net of interest expense grew, driven by increases in adjusted billed business, adjusted net interest income and net card fees across our premium card portfolios. Card Member loan growth was strong year-over-year and we continue to see opportunities to increase our share of our customers’ borrowings. Provisions for losses were up modestly versus the prior year, but grew more significantly after excluding from the prior year credit costs associated with the Costco and JetBlue Card Member loan portfolios. The growth in provisions for losses was driven by both higher Card Member loans and a slight increase in delinquency and net write-off rates due to the seasoning of loans related to newer Card Members. We expect that some modest, gradual upward pressure on our delinquency and write-off rates, due primarily to this seasoning of loans related to newer Card Members, will cause provisions to grow faster than loans in 2017. Total expenses for the year declined versus the prior year, driven by the gains on the sales of the Costco and JetBlue portfolios, which were recognized as a reduction in Other expenses, as well as a decline in rewards expense, driven by higher Costco cobrand rewards expenses included in the prior year and the shift in volumes to cash rebate cards, for which the rewards costs are classified as contra-discount revenue. Marketing and promotion expenses grew significantly due to higher levels of spending on growth initiatives. Card Member services and other expenses also increased, driven by higher levels of engagement in many of our premium services such as airport lounge access and certain cobrand card benefits. We anticipate spending less on marketing and promotion in 2017. Rewards expense and Card Member services and other expenses, after excluding Costco cobrand-related costs, should continue to grow in 2017 due to higher billings and enhancements to our card product value propositions. Competition remains intense across our businesses. While our businesses are global and diversified, to remain competitive we need to continue to demonstrate the differentiated value we deliver to merchants, customers and business partners in all aspects of our relationships. More intense competition has and will continue to impact our cost of renewing and ability to win or extend cobrand and other relationships. Throughout our business, we are focused on those products, services and relationships that offer the best value to our customers while also providing appropriate returns to our business and shareholders. For discussion of certain legislative and regulatory changes that could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition, see “Supervision and Regulation” in “Business.” 37 Table of Contents CONSOLIDATED RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Refer to the “Glossary of Selected Terminology” for the definitions of certain key terms and related information appearing within this section. Effective June 30, 2014, as a result of the GBT JV transaction, we deconsolidated the Global Business Travel net assets, and now offer business travel-related services through the non-consolidated joint venture, resulting in a lack of comparability between 2015 and 2014. Effective December 1, 2015, we transferred the Card Member loans and receivables related to our HFS portfolios to Card Member loans and receivables HFS on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. On March 18, 2016 and June 17, 2016, we completed the sales of the JetBlue and Costco cobrand card portfolios, respectively. For the periods from December 1, 2015, through the sale completion dates, the primary impacts beyond the HFS classification on the Consolidated Balance Sheets were to provisions for losses and credit metrics, which do not reflect amounts related to these HFS loans and receivables, as credit costs were reported in Other expenses through a valuation allowance adjustment. Other, non-credit related metrics (i.e., billed business, cards-in-force, net interest yield) reflect amounts related to the HFS portfolios through the sale completion dates. Additionally, for periods after the sale completion dates, activities associated with these cobrand partnerships and the HFS portfolios are no longer included in our Consolidated Results of Operations. Specifically, these impacts include: Discount revenue from Costco in the United States for spend on all American Express cards and from other merchants for spend on the Costco cobrand card; Other fees and commissions and Interest income from Costco cobrand Card Members; and Card Member rewards expense related to the Costco cobrand card, resulting in a lack of comparability between 2016 and 2015. The relationship of the U.S. dollar to various foreign currencies over the periods of comparison has had an impact on our results of operations. Where meaningful in describing our performance, foreign currency-adjusted amounts, which exclude the impact of changes in the foreign exchange (FX) rates, have been provided.

TOTAL REVENUES NET OF INTEREST EXPENSE Discount revenue decreased $617 million or 3 percent in 2016 compared to 2015, and remained relatively flat in 2015 compared to 2014. The decrease in 2016 was primarily driven by lower Costco-related revenue. Both periods of comparison reflected increases in contra-discount revenues, including cash rebate rewards, which in 2015 as compared to 2014 was offset by growth in billed business. 38 Table of Contents Overall, billed business was flat in 2016 compared to 2015. U.S. billed business decreased 3 percent, primarily driven by lower Costco-related volumes and non-U.S. billed business increased 6 percent (10 percent on an FX-adjusted basis).1 The average discount rate was 2.45 percent, 2.46 percent and 2.48 percent for 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively. The decrease in the average discount rate in 2016 compared to 2015 was driven primarily by growth of the OptBlue program, merchant negotiations, including those resulting from the recent regulatory changes affecting competitor pricing in the European Union and a prior-year benefit related to certain merchant rebate accruals, partially offset by the benefit to the discount rate from the decline in Costco merchant volumes in the current year. We expect the average discount rate will likely continue to decline over time due to further expansion of OptBlue, merchant negotiations and competition, volume related pricing discounts and certain pricing initiatives mainly driven by pricing regulation (including regulation of competitors’ interchange rates). See Tables 5 and 6 for more details on billed business performance and the average discount rate. Net card fees increased $186 million or 7 percent in 2016 compared to 2015 and remained relatively flat in 2015 compared to 2014 (increasing 5 percent on an FX-adjusted basis).1 The increase in 2016 was driven primarily by growth in the Platinum, Gold and Delta portfolios. Other fees and commissions decreased $113 million or 4 percent in 2016 compared to 2015, and $760 million or 21 percent in 2015 compared to 2014. The decrease in 2016 was primarily driven by lower Costco-related fees, partially offset by an increase in delinquency and loyalty coalition-related fees. The decrease in 2015 was primarily due to the GBT JV transaction, resulting in a lack of comparability between periods. Other revenues were relatively flat in 2016 compared to 2015, and decreased $956 million or 32 percent in 2015 compared to 2014. The current year included a contractual payment from a GNS partner and higher revenues from our Prepaid Services business, offset by lower revenues related to Costco, Loyalty Edge (which was sold in the fourth quarter of 2016), and the GBT JV transition services agreement. The decrease in 2015 was primarily driven by gains related to the sales of investment securities in Concur and Industrial and Commercial Bank of China in 2014. Interest income decreased $70 million or 1 percent in 2016 compared to 2015, and increased $366 million or 5 percent in 2015 compared to 2014. The decrease in 2016 was primarily driven by lower Costco cobrand loans and the associated interest income, partially offset by modestly higher yields and an increase in average Card Member loans across other lending products. The increase in 2015 primarily reflects higher average Card Member loans, partially offset by decreases in interest and dividends on investment securities driven by lower average investment securities. Interest expense increased $81 million or 5 percent in 2016 compared to 2015, and decreased $84 million or 5 percent in 2015 compared to 2014. The increase in 2016 was primarily driven by higher average customer deposit balances, partially offset by lower average long-term debt. The decrease in 2015 was primarily driven by a lower cost of funds on debt and customer deposits, partially offset by an increase in average customer deposit balances. TABLE 3: PROVISIONS FOR LOSSES SUMMARY Years Ended December 31, Change Change (Millions, except percentages) 2016 2015 2014 2016 vs. 2015 2015 vs. 2014 Charge card $ 696 $ 737 $ 792 $ (41 ) (6)% $ (55 ) (7)% Card Member loans 1,235 1,190 1,138 45 4 52 5 Other 95 61 114 34 56 (53 ) (46) Total provisions for losses(a) $ 2,026 $ 1,988 $ 2,044 $ 38 2 % $ (56 ) (3)% (a) Beginning December 1, 2015 through to the sale completion dates, does not reflect the HFS portfolios. PROVISIONS FOR LOSSES Charge card provision for losses decreased $41 million or 6 percent in 2016 compared to 2015, and $55 million or 7 percent in 2015 compared to 2014. The decrease in 2016 was driven by lower net write-offs and improved delinquencies. The decrease in 2015 reflects a reserve release versus a reserve build in 2014, partially offset by higher write-offs. Card Member loans provision for losses increased $45 million or 4 percent in 2016 compared to 2015, and $52 million or 5 percent in 2015 compared to 2014. The increase in 2016 was primarily driven by strong momentum in our lending growth initiatives, resulting in higher loan balances, increased net write-offs in the current year and a slight increase in delinquencies, partially offset by the impact of the HFS portfolios, as the current year does not reflect the associated credit costs, as previously mentioned. The increase in 2015 primarily reflects a reserve build versus a reserve release in 2014. The reserve build in 2015 was due to a small increase in delinquency rates combined with an increase in loan balances, partially offset by lower write-offs and the impact related to transferring the HFS portfolios to Card Member loans and receivables HFS in December 2015. 1 The foreign currency adjusted information assumes a constant exchange rate between the periods being compared for purposes of currency translation into U.S. dollars (i.e., assumes the foreign exchange rates used to determine results for the current period apply to the corresponding period against which such results are being compared). FX-adjusted revenues and expenses constitute non-GAAP measures. We believe the presentation of information on a foreign currency adjusted basis is helpful to investors by making it easier to compare our performance in one period to that of another period without the variability caused by fluctuations in currency exchange rates. 39 Table of Contents Other provision for losses increased $34 million or 56 percent in 2016 compared to 2015, and decreased $53 million or 46 percent in 2015 compared to 2014. The increase in 2016 was primarily driven by growth in the commercial financing portfolio resulting in higher net write-offs. The decrease in 2015 was primarily due to a merchant-related charge in the fourth quarter of 2014. TABLE 4: EXPENSES SUMMARY Years Ended December 31, Change Change (Millions, except percentages) 2016 2015 2014 2016 vs. 2015 2015 vs. 2014 Marketing and promotion $ 3,650 $ 3,109 $ 3,216 $ 541 17 % $ (107 ) (3)% Card Member rewards 6,793 6,996 6,931 (203 ) (3) 65 1 Card Member services and other 1,133 1,018 822 115 11 196 24 Total marketing, promotion, rewards and Card Member services and other 11,576 11,123 10,969 453 4 154 1 Salaries and employee benefits 5,259 4,976 6,095 283 6 (1,119 ) (18) Other, net(a) 5,162 6,793 6,089 (1,631 ) (24) 704 12 Total expenses $ 21,997 $ 22,892 $ 23,153 $ (895 ) (4)% $ (261 ) (1)% (a) Beginning December 1, 2015 through to the sale completion dates, includes the valuation allowance adjustment associated with the HFS portfolios. EXPENSES Marketing and promotion expenses increased $541 million or 17 percent in 2016 compared to 2015, and decreased $107 million or 3 percent in 2015 compared to 2014 (increasing 1 percent on an FX-adjusted basis), with higher levels of spending on growth initiatives in both periods.2 Card Member rewards expenses decreased $203 million or 3 percent in 2016 compared to 2015 and increased $65 million or 1 percent in 2015 compared to 2014. The decrease in 2016 was primarily driven by lower cobrand rewards expense of $518 million, primarily reflecting lower Costco-related expenses and a shift in volumes to cash rebate cards for which the rewards costs are classified as contra-discount revenue, partially offset by increased spending volumes across other cobrand card products. The lower cobrand rewards expense was partially offset by higher Membership Rewards expense of $315 million, primarily driven by an increase in new points earned as a result of higher spending volumes, recent enhancements to U.S. Consumer and Small Business Platinum rewards and less of a decline in the weighted average cost (WAC) per point. The increase in 2015 was primarily driven by higher cobrand rewards expense of $199 million, driven by rate impacts as a result of cobrand partnership renewal costs, partially offset by a decrease in Membership Rewards expense of $134 million. The latter was primarily driven by slower growth in the Ultimate Redemption Rate (URR) and a decline in the WAC per point assumption, including the impact of the $109 million charge in the fourth quarter of 2014 related to the Delta partnership renewal, partially offset by increased expenses related to new points earned, driven by higher spending volumes. The Membership Rewards URR for current program participants was 95 percent (rounded down) at December 31, 2016, compared to 95 percent (rounded down) at December 31, 2015, and 95 percent (rounded up) at December 31, 2014. Card Member services and other expenses increased $115 million or 11 percent in 2016 compared to 2015, and $196 million or 24 percent in 2015 compared to 2014. The increase in 2016 was primarily driven by increased usage of travel-related benefits. The increase in 2015 was primarily due to higher costs related to certain previously renewed cobrand partnership agreements. Salaries and employee benefits expenses increased $283 million or 6 percent in 2016 compared to 2015, and decreased $1.1 billion or 18 percent in 2015 compared to 2014. The increase in 2016 was primarily driven by higher restructuring charges in the current year. The decrease in 2015 was primarily due to the business travel joint venture transaction (resulting in a lack of comparability between periods). Other expenses decreased $1.6 billion or 24 percent in 2016 compared to 2015, and increased $704 million or 12 percent in 2015 compared to 2014. The decrease in 2016 was primarily driven by the gains on the sales of the HFS portfolios in the current year, as well as goodwill and technology impairment charges in the prior year. The increase in 2015 reflects the net gain from the GBT JV transaction in 2014 and the goodwill and technology impairment charges in 2015, partially offset by the reassessment of the functional currency of certain UK legal entities, other FX-related activity and a litigation reserve release in 2015. 2 Refer to footnote 1 on page 39 for details regarding foreign currency adjusted information. 40 Table of Contents INCOME TAXES The effective tax rate was 33.2 percent in 2016 compared to 35.0 percent in 2015 and 34.5 percent in 2014. The tax rates for 2016, 2015, and 2014 include benefits of $60 million, $33 million, and expenses of $40 million, respectively, related to the resolution of certain prior years’ items. The tax rate for 2015 also includes the impact of the nondeductible portion of the goodwill impairment charge mentioned previously. The changes in tax rates primarily reflected the level of pretax income in relation to recurring permanent tax benefits and the geographic mix of business.

We believe adjusted net interest income is useful to investors because it is a component of net interest yield on Card Member loans, which provides a measure of profitability of our Card Member loan portfolio. (b) Beginning December 1, 2015 through to the sale completion dates, for the purposes of the calculation of net interest yield on Card Member loans, average loans included the HFS loan portfolios. 44 Table of Contents BUSINESS SEGMENT RESULTS We consider a combination of factors when evaluating the composition of our reportable operating segments, including the results reviewed by the chief operating decision maker, economic characteristics, products and services offered, classes of customers, product distribution channels, geographic considerations (primarily United States versus outside the United States) and regulatory considerations. Refer to Note 25 to the “Consolidated Financial Statements” for additional discussion of the products and services by segment. Effective for the first quarter of 2016, we realigned our segment presentation to reflect the organizational changes announced during the fourth quarter of 2015. Prior periods have been restated to conform to the new reportable operating segments, which are as follows: • USCS, including the proprietary U.S. Consumer Card Services business and consumer travel services in the United States; • ICNS, including the proprietary International Consumer Card Services business, GNS business and consumer travel services outside the United States; • GCS, including the proprietary Global Corporate Payments (GCP) business, small business services businesses in the United States and internationally (collectively, GSBS), commercial financing products and foreign exchange services operations; and • GMS, including the Global Merchant Services business and global loyalty coalition businesses. Corporate functions and certain other businesses and operations, including our Prepaid Services business and the American Express Global Business Travel (GBT) operations up to June 30, 2014, and subsequent activities related to the GBT JV, are included in Corporate & Other. Results of the business segments generally treat each segment as a stand-alone business. The management reporting process that derives these results allocates revenue and expense using various methodologies as described below. TOTAL REVENUES NET OF INTEREST EXPENSE We allocate discount revenue and certain other revenues among segments using a transfer pricing methodology. Within the USCS, ICNS and GCS segments, discount revenue generally reflects the issuer component of the overall discount revenue generated by each segment’s Card Members; within the GMS segment, discount revenue generally reflects the network and acquirer component of the overall discount revenue. Net card fees and other fees and commissions are directly attributable to the segment in which they are reported. Interest and fees on loans and certain investment income is directly attributable to the segment in which it is reported. Interest expense represents an allocated funding cost based on a combination of segment funding requirements and internal funding rates. PROVISIONS FOR LOSSES The provisions for losses are directly attributable to the segment in which they are reported. EXPENSES Marketing and promotion expenses are included in each segment based on the actual expenses incurred. Global brand advertising is primarily reflected in Corporate & Other and may be allocated to the segments based on the actual expense incurred. Rewards and Card Member services expenses are included in each segment based on the actual expenses incurred within the segment. Salaries and employee benefits and other operating expenses reflect expenses such as professional services, occupancy and equipment and communications incurred directly within each segment. In addition, expenses related to support services, such as technology costs, are allocated to each segment primarily based on support service activities directly attributable to the segment. Other overhead expenses, such as staff group support functions, are allocated from Corporate & Other to the other segments based on a mix of each segment’s direct consumption of services and relative level of pretax income. CAPITAL Each business segment is allocated capital based on established business model operating requirements, risk measures and regulatory capital requirements.

TOTAL REVENUES NET OF INTEREST EXPENSE Non-interest revenues decreased $605 million or 7 percent in 2016 compared to 2015, primarily due to lower discount revenue, which decreased $632 million or 10 percent, reflecting lower Costco-related revenues and increases in contra-discount revenue, such as cash rebate rewards. The decrease in discount revenue was partially offset by an increase in net card fees, resulting from growth in the Platinum, Gold and Delta portfolios. Billed business decreased 7 percent in 2016 compared to 2015, primarily driven by lower Costco-related volumes. Net interest income decreased $164 million or 3 percent in 2016 compared to 2015, primarily driven by lower Costco cobrand loans and the associated interest income and higher interest expense primarily driven by higher cost of funds, all partially offset by modestly higher yields and an increase in average Card Member loans across other lending products. Total revenues net of interest expense increased $623 million or 5 percent in 2015 compared to 2014, primarily driven by higher discount revenue, as a result of 5 percent growth in billed business, partially offset by a decline in the average discount rate and increases in contra-discount revenues, such as cash rebate rewards. The increase also reflected higher net interest income, primarily driven by higher average Card Member loans, partially offset by higher interest expense. PROVISIONS FOR LOSSES Overall, Provisions for losses was relatively flat. Card Member loans provision for losses increased $16 million or 2 percent, primarily driven by strong momentum in our lending growth initiatives resulting in higher loan balances, increased net write-offs in the current year and a slight increase in delinquencies, partially offset by the impact of the HFS portfolios as the current year does not reflect the associated credit costs. Other provision for losses increased $15 million in 2016 as compared to 2015, due to growth in the non-card lending portfolio. Provisions for losses increased $34 million or 3 percent in 2015 compared to 2014, primarily due to a small increase in Card Member loan delinquency rates combined with an increase in loan balances, partially offset by a Charge card provision reserve release in 2015 versus a reserve build in 2014 and the impact related to transferring the HFS portfolios to Card Member loans and receivables HFS in December 2015. Refer to Table 10 for the charge card and lending write-off rates for 2016, 2015 and 2014. EXPENSES Marketing, promotion, rewards, Card Member services and other expenses was relatively flat in 2016 compared to 2015, reflecting lower Card Member rewards expenses, offset by increases in Marketing and promotion and Card Member services expenses. Card Member rewards expense decreased $311 million or 8 percent in 2016 compared to 2015, primarily driven by lower cobrand reward expense of $435 million, partially offset by an increase in Membership Rewards expense of $124 million. The decrease in cobrand reward expense was primarily driven by lower Costco-related expenses, partially offset by increased spending volumes across other 46 Table of Contents cobrand card products. The increase in Membership Rewards expense was primarily driven by an increase in new points earned as a result of higher spending volumes, recent enhancements to Platinum Card rewards and less of a decline in the WAC per point. Marketing and promotion expenses increased $279 million or 25 percent in 2016 compared to 2015, reflecting elevated levels of spending on growth initiatives. Card Member services and other expenses increased $66 million or 12 percent in 2016 compared to 2015, primarily driven by increased usage of new benefits. Salaries and employee benefits and other operating expenses decreased $1 billion or 33 percent in 2016 compared to 2015. The decrease primarily reflects the gains on the sales of the HFS portfolios in the current year, which were recognized as an expense reduction in Other expenses, partially offset by restructuring charges in the current year. Total expenses increased $414 million in 2015 compared to 2014, primarily driven by higher Marketing, promotion, rewards, Card Member services and other expenses, which reflected higher cobrand rewards expense due to higher spending volumes and rate increases (due in part to previously renewed cobrand partnership agreements). The increase also reflected higher Other expenses, primarily driven by higher spending on growth initiatives and the December 2015 valuation allowance adjustment related to the HFS portfolios mentioned previously, partially offset by lower card-related fraud losses in 2015 and a change in the estimated value of certain investments in our Community Reinvestment Act of 1977 (the CRA) portfolio in 2014.

It also provides travel services to consumers outside the United States. TOTAL REVENUES NET OF INTEREST EXPENSE Non-interest revenues increased $158 million or 3 percent in 2016 compared to 2015, primarily driven by higher discount revenue due to an increase in both proprietary and non-proprietary (i.e., GNS) billed business, as well as higher net card fees. The increase also reflected a contractual payment from a GNS partner in the second quarter of 2016. Total billed business increased 5 percent in 2016 compared to 2015, primarily due to increases in both proprietary and GNS cards-in-force and average spend per card. Refer to Tables 6 and 12 for additional information on billed business by region. Net interest income decreased $7 million or 1 percent in 2016 compared to 2015. Interest income decreased $23 million or 2 percent, while FX-adjusted interest income increased 8 percent, primarily driven by higher average FX-adjusted loan balances.3 Interest expense decreased $16 million or 7 percent, while FX-adjusted interest expense increased 4 percent driven by higher FX-adjusted funding costs.3 Total revenues net of interest expense decreased $517 million or 9 percent in 2015 compared to 2014, and FX-adjusted total revenues net of interest expense increased 4 percent.3 The increase was primarily driven by foreign exchange conversion fees and net revenues earned on cross-border Card Member spending, as well as higher net interest income and net card fees. The increase also reflected higher GNS revenues. PROVISIONS FOR LOSSES Provisions for losses increased $25 million or 8 percent in 2016 compared to 2015, driven primarily by higher net write-offs. Provisions for losses decreased $54 million or 15 percent (and decreased 1 percent on an FX-adjusted basis) in 2015 compared to 2014.3 Refer to Table 12 for Card Member loans and receivables write-off rates for 2016, 2015 and 2014. EXPENSES Marketing, promotion, rewards, Card Member services and other expenses increased $197 million or 10 percent in 2016 compared to 2015, primarily driven by higher levels of spending on growth initiatives. Total expenses decreased $480 million or 10 percent in 2015 compared to 2014, primarily driven by higher restructuring charges in 2014. Income tax provision decreased $57 million or 26 percent in 2016 compared to 2015 and increased $26 million or 13 percent in 2015 compared to 2014.

TOTAL REVENUES NET OF INTEREST EXPENSE Non-interest revenues were relatively flat in 2016 compared to 2015, reflecting lower Costco-related revenues. Billed business increased by 2 percent in 2016 compared to 2015. Net interest income remained flat in 2016 compared to 2015, reflecting lower Costco cobrand loans and the associated interest income and higher interest expense primarily due to increased cost of funds, offset by an increase in average Card Member loans across other lending products. Total revenues net of interest expense decreased $448 million or 4 percent in 2015 compared to 2014, primarily due to the gain on the sale of our investment in Concur in 2014, partially offset by higher net interest income as a result of an increase in average Card Member loans (including Card Member loans HFS), and higher discount revenue primarily from higher U.S. small business billed business. PROVISIONS FOR LOSSES Provisions for losses increased $16 million or 3 percent in 2016 compared to 2015, and $19 million or 3 percent in 2015 compared to 2014, primarily driven in both periods by growth in the commercial financing portfolio resulting in higher net write-offs. EXPENSES Marketing, promotion, rewards, Card Member services and other expenses increased $256 million or 8 percent in 2016 compared to 2015, primarily driven by both increased Marketing and promotion expenses as a result of higher levels of spending on growth initiatives, and higher Card Member rewards expenses resulting from higher spending volumes, partially offset by lower Costco-related rewards expenses. Salaries and employee benefits and other operating expenses remained relatively flat in 2016 compared to 2015, reflecting restructuring charges and higher operating expenses, including technology development and professional fees, offset by the gains recognized in the segment on the sales of the HFS portfolios. Total expenses increased $92 million or 2 percent in 2015 compared to 2014, primarily due to higher spending on growth initiatives, including marketing and promotion expenses, technology development and higher professional services costs, partially offset by a restructuring charge taken in 2014. 50 Table of Contents TABLE 14: GCS SELECTED STATISTICAL INFORMATION As of or for the Years Ended December 31, Change Change (Millions, except percentages and where indicated) 2016 2015 2014 2016 vs. 2015 2015 vs. 2014 Card billed business (billions) $ 408.0 $ 398.6 $ 394.6 2 % 1 % Total cards-in-force 13.6 15.1 14.8 (10) 2 Basic cards-in-force 13.6 15.1 14.8 (10) 2 Average basic Card Member spending (dollars) $ 28,515 $ 26,860 $ 26,731 6 — Total segment assets (billions) $ 46.5 $ 45.1 $ 44.2 3 2 Segment capital (billions) $ 7.0 $ 7.0 $ 6.9 — 1 Return on average segment capital (a) 26.4 % 28.7 % 34.9 % Card Member loans (billions) $ 9.5 $ 8.0 $ 9.6 19 (17) Card Member receivables (billions) $ 29.0 $ 26.7 $ 26.8 9 — Card Member loans:(b) Total loans - GSBS (billions) $ 9.5 $ 8.0 $ 9.5 19 (16) Average loans - GSBS (billions) $ 8.6 $ 9.7 $ 9.1 (11)% 7 % Net write-off rate (principal only) - GSBS(c) 1.4 % 1.3 % 1.5 % Net write-off rate (principal, interest and fees) - GSBS(c) 1.7 % 1.5 % 1.8 % 30+ days past due as a % of total - GSBS 1.1 % 1.1 % 1.0 % Calculation of Net Interest Yield on Card Member Loans: Net interest income $ 809 $ 810 $ 617 Exclude: Interest expense not attributable to ourCard Member loan portfolio 312 286 337 Interest income not attributable to ourCard Member loan portfolio (111) (94) (50) Adjusted net interest income(d) $ 1,010 $ 1,002 $ 904 Average loans including HFS loan portfolios (billions)(e) $ 9.7 $ 9.9 $ 9.1 Net interest income divided by average loans 8.3 % 8.2 % 6.8 % Net interest yield on Card Member loans(d) 10.4 % 10.1 % 9.9 % Card Member receivables:(b) Total receivables - GCP (billions) $ 14.8 $ 13.8 $ 14.6 7 % (5)% 90 days past billing as a % of total - GCP(f) 0.9 % 0.9 % 0.8 % Net loss ratio (as a % of charge volume) - GCP 0.09 % 0.09 % 0.09 % Total receivables - GSBS (billions) $ 14.3 $ 12.9 $ 12.2 11 % 6 % Net write-off rate (principal only) - GSBS(c) 1.5 % 1.8 % 1.6 % Net write-off rate (principal, interest and fees) - GSBS(c) 1.7 % 2.1 % 1.8 % 30+ days past due as a % of total - GSBS 1.6 % 1.7 % 1.8 % (a) Return on average segment capital is calculated by dividing (i) one-year period segment income ($1.9 billion, $2.0 billion and $2.3 billion for 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively) by (ii) one-year average segment capital ($7.2 billion, $7.0 billion and $6.7 billion for 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively).

TOTAL REVENUES NET OF INTEREST EXPENSE Non-interest revenues decreased $236 million or 5 percent in 2016 compared to 2015, as a result of lower Costco-related revenues, as well as higher contra-revenues in the current year. Net interest income increased $26 million or 12 percent in 2016 compared to 2015, reflecting a higher interest expense credit relating to internal transfer pricing and funding rates, which resulted in a net benefit for GMS due to its merchant payables. Total revenues net of interest expense decreased $177 million or 4 percent in 2015 compared to 2014, primarily due to a decrease in non-interest revenues, reflecting the impact of changes in FX rates year-over-year, as well as a reduction in the interest expense credit. PROVISIONS FOR LOSSES Provisions for losses decreased $6 million or 19 percent in 2016 compared to 2015, and decreased $48 million or 61 percent in 2015 compared to 2014. The decrease in 2016 was primarily driven by lower net write-offs. The decrease in 2015 was primarily due to a merchant-related charge in the fourth quarter of 2014. EXPENSES Marketing, promotion, rewards, Card Member services and other expenses decreased $62 million or 21 percent in 2016 compared to 2015, primarily driven by higher Marketing and promotion expenses related to our global loyalty coalition businesses in the prior year. Salaries and employee benefits and other operating expenses decreased $56 million or 3 percent in 2016 compared to 2015, primarily driven by growth of the OptBlue program, which does not entail merchant acquirer payments, combined with lower fraud expenses. Total expenses decreased $180 million or 7 percent in 2015 compared to 2014, primarily driven by a litigation reserve release in the third quarter of 2015, and a restructuring charge taken in 2014. 52 Table of Contents TABLE 16: GMS SELECTED STATISTICAL INFORMATION As of or for the Years Ended December 31, Change Change (Millions, except percentages and where indicated) 2016 2015 2014 2016 vs. 2015 2015 vs. 2014 Loyalty Coalition revenue $ 410 $ 378 $ 383 8 % (1)% Average discount rate 2.45 % 2.46 % 2.48 % Total segment assets (billions) $ 24.3 $ 23.5 $ 17.8 3 32 Segment capital (billions) $ 2.5 $ 2.4 $ 2.1 4 % 14 % Return on average segment capital (a) 60.2 % 64.8 % 69.6 % (a) Return on average segment capital is calculated by dividing (i) one-year period segment income ($1.5 billion for each of 2016, 2015 and 2014) by (ii) one-year average segment capital ($2.4 billion, $2.3 billion and $2.1 billion for 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively). CORPORATE & OTHER Corporate functions and certain other businesses, including our Prepaid Services business and other operations, are included in Corporate & Other. Corporate & Other net expense was $1.1 billion, $1.4 billion and $827 million in 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively. The decrease in 2016 compared to 2015 was primarily driven by the previously mentioned impairment charges in the prior year and higher income from our Prepaid Services business in the current year, all partially offset by restructuring charges in the current year and the benefit in the prior year from the reassessment of the functional currency of certain UK legal entities and other FX-related activity. The increase in 2015 was driven by the impairment charges, plus restructuring charges. These 2015 charges were partially offset by higher restructuring charges in 2014 and the benefit from the reassessment of the functional currency of certain UK legal entities in 2015. Results for all periods included net interest expense related to maintaining the liquidity requirements discussed in “Consolidated Capital Resources and Liquidity – Liquidity Management,” as well as interest expense related to other corporate indebtedness. 53 Table of Contents CONSOLIDATED CAPITAL RESOURCES AND LIQUIDITY Our balance sheet management objectives are to maintain: • A solid and flexible equity capital profile; • A broad, deep and diverse set of funding sources to finance our assets and meet operating requirements; and • Liquidity programs that enable us to continuously meet expected future financing obligations and business requirements for at least a twelve-month period, even in the event we are unable to continue to raise new funds under our traditional funding programs during a substantial weakening in economic conditions. CAPITAL STRATEGY Our objective is to retain sufficient levels of capital generated through earnings and other sources to maintain a solid equity capital base and to provide flexibility to support future business growth. We believe capital allocated to growing businesses with a return on risk-adjusted equity in excess of our costs will generate shareholder value. The level and composition of our consolidated capital position are determined through our Internal Capital Adequacy Assessment Process, which takes into account our business activities, as well as marketplace conditions and requirements or expectations of credit rating agencies, regulators and shareholders, among others. Our consolidated capital position is also influenced by subsidiary capital requirements. As a bank holding company, we are also subject to regulatory requirements administered by the U.S. federal banking agencies. The Federal Reserve has established specific capital adequacy guidelines that involve quantitative measures of assets, liabilities and certain off-balance sheet items. We report our capital ratios using the Basel III capital definitions, inclusive of transition provisions, and the Basel III standardized approach for calculating risk-weighted assets (see section on Transitional Basel III). The Basel III standards will be fully phased in by January 1, 2019 (see section on Fully Phased-in Basel III). We also report capital adequacy standards on a parallel basis to regulators under Basel requirements for advanced approaches institutions. The parallel period will continue until we receive regulatory approval to exit parallel reporting, at which point we will begin publicly disclosing regulatory risk-based capital ratios using both the standardized and advanced approaches, and will be required to use the lower of the regulatory risk-based capital ratios based on the standardized or advanced approaches to determine whether we are in compliance with minimum capital requirements. The following table presents our regulatory risk-based capital ratios and leverage ratios and those of our significant bank subsidiaries, American Express Centurion Bank (Centurion Bank) and American Express Bank, FSB (American Express Bank), as of December 31, 2016.

We seek to maintain capital levels and ratios in excess of the minimum regulatory requirements and finance such capital in a cost efficient manner; failure to maintain minimum capital levels could affect our status as a financial holding company and cause the regulatory agencies with oversight of American Express, Centurion Bank and American Express Bank to take actions that could limit our business operations. Our primary source of equity capital has been the generation of net income. Historically, capital generated through net income and other sources, such as the exercise of stock options by employees, has exceeded the annual growth in our capital requirements. To the extent capital has exceeded business, regulatory and rating agency requirements, we have historically returned excess capital to shareholders through our regular common share dividend and share repurchase program. We maintain certain flexibility to shift capital across our businesses as appropriate. For example, we may infuse additional capital into subsidiaries to maintain capital at targeted levels in consideration of debt ratings and regulatory requirements. These infused amounts can affect the capital profile and liquidity levels at the American Express parent company level. We do not currently intend or foresee a need to shift capital from non-U.S. subsidiaries with permanently reinvested earnings to a U.S. parent company. The following are definitions for our regulatory risk-based capital ratios and leverage ratio, which are calculated as per standard regulatory guidance: Risk-Weighted Assets — Assets are weighted for risk according to a formula used by the Federal Reserve to conform to capital adequacy guidelines. On- and off-balance sheet items are weighted for risk, with off-balance sheet items converted to balance sheet equivalents, using risk conversion factors, before being allocated a risk-adjusted weight. Off-balance sheet exposures comprise a minimal part of the total risk-weighted assets. Common Equity Tier 1 Risk-Based Capital Ratio — Calculated as Common Equity Tier 1 capital (CET1), divided by risk-weighted assets. CET1 is the sum of common shareholders’ equity, adjusted for ineligible goodwill and intangible assets, certain deferred tax assets, as well as certain other comprehensive income items as follows: net unrealized gains/losses on securities and derivatives, and net unrealized pension and other postretirement benefit/losses, all net of tax and subject to transition provisions. Tier 1 Risk-Based Capital Ratio — Calculated as Tier 1 capital divided by risk-weighted assets. Tier 1 capital is the sum of CET1, our perpetual preferred stock and third-party non-controlling interests in consolidated subsidiaries adjusted for capital to be held by insurance subsidiaries and deferred tax assets from net operating losses not deducted from CET1. The minimum requirement for the Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio is 1.5 percent higher than the minimum for the CET1 risk-based capital ratio. We have $1.6 billion of preferred shares outstanding to help address a portion of the Tier 1 capital requirements in excess of common equity requirements. Total Risk-Based Capital Ratio — Calculated as the sum of Tier 1 capital and Tier 2 capital, divided by risk-weighted assets. Tier 2 capital is the sum of the allowance for loan and receivable losses (limited to 1.25 percent of risk-weighted assets), a portion of the unrealized gains on equity securities, and $600 million of subordinated notes adjusted for capital held by insurance subsidiaries. Tier 1 Leverage Ratio — Calculated by dividing Tier 1 capital by our average total consolidated assets for the most recent quarter. Supplementary Leverage Ratio — Calculated by dividing Tier 1 capital by total leverage exposure under Basel III. Leverage exposure, which reflects average total consolidated assets with adjustments for Tier 1 capital deductions, average off-balance sheet derivatives exposures, securities purchased under agreements to resell and credit equivalents of undrawn commitments that are both conditionally and unconditionally cancellable. 55 Table of Contents FULLY PHASED-IN BASEL III Basel III, when fully phased in, will require bank holding companies and their bank subsidiaries to maintain more capital than prior requirements, with a greater emphasis on common equity. The following table presents our estimates for our regulatory risk-based capital ratios and leverage ratios had Basel III been fully phased in as of December 31, 2016. These ratios are calculated using the standardized approach for determining risk-weighted assets. As noted previously, we are currently taking steps toward Basel III advanced approaches implementation in the United States. We believe the presentation of these ratios is helpful to investors by showing the impact of future regulatory capital standards on our capital and leverage ratios.

Refer to Table 20 for a reconciliation of Common Equity Tier 1 and Tier 1 capital under Fully Phased-in Basel III rules to Common Equity Tier 1 and Tier 1 capital under Transitional Basel III rules. (b) The Fully Phased-in Basel III Tier 1 and supplementary leverage ratios, non-GAAP measures, are calculated by dividing Fully Phased-in Basel III Tier 1 capital by our average total assets and Fully Phased-in total leverage exposure for supplementary leverage ratio purposes under Fully Phased-in Basel III, respectively. (c) Estimated Fully Phased-in Basel III risk-weighted assets, a non-GAAP measure, reflect our Basel III risk-weighted assets, with all transition provisions fully phased in. This includes incremental risk weighting applied to deferred tax assets and significant investments in unconsolidated financial institutions, as well as exposures to past due accounts, equities and sovereigns. (d) Estimated Fully Phased-in Basel III Leverage Exposure, a non-GAAP measure, reflects average total consolidated assets with adjustments for Tier 1 capital deductions on a fully phased-in basis, off-balance sheet derivatives, undrawn conditionally and unconditionally cancellable commitments and other off-balance sheet liabilities. The following table presents a comparison of our CET1 and Tier 1 risk-based capital under Transitional Basel III rules to our estimated CET1 and Tier 1 risk-based capital under Fully Phased-in Basel III rules as of December 31, 2016.

Fully Phased-in Basel III Supplementary Leverage Ratio — Calculated by dividing Fully Phased-in Basel III Tier 1 capital by our Fully Phased-in total leverage exposure for supplementary leverage ratio purposes under Fully Phased-in Basel III. SHARE REPURCHASES AND DIVIDENDS We return capital to common shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. The share repurchases reduce common shares outstanding and more than offset the issuance of new shares as part of employee compensation plans. During the year ended December 31, 2016, we returned $5.5 billion to our shareholders in the form of common stock dividends ($1.1 billion) and share repurchases ($4.4 billion). We repurchased 70 million common shares at an average price of $63.11 in 2016. These dividend and share repurchase amounts collectively represent approximately 99 percent of total capital generated during the year. 56 Table of Contents In addition, during the year ended December 31, 2016, we had $750 million of non-cumulative perpetual preferred shares (the “Series B Preferred Shares”) and $850 million of non-cumulative perpetual preferred shares (the “Series C Preferred Shares”) outstanding. Dividends declared and paid on Series B and Series C Preferred Shares during 2016 were $39 million and $41 million, respectively. For additional information on our preferred shares, refer to Note 17 “Common and Preferred Shares” and Note 22 “Earnings per Common Share (EPS); Preferred Shares” to the “Consolidated Financial Statements.” FUNDING STRATEGY Our principal funding objective is to maintain broad and well-diversified funding sources to allow us to meet our maturing obligations, cost-effectively finance current and future asset growth in our global businesses as well as to maintain a strong liquidity profile. The diversity of funding sources by type of instrument, by maturity and by investor base, among other factors, provides additional insulation from the impact of disruptions in any one type of instrument, maturity or investor. The mix of our funding in any period will seek to achieve cost efficiency consistent with both maintaining diversified sources and achieving our liquidity objectives. Our funding strategy and activities are integrated into our asset-liability management activities. We have in place a funding policy covering American Express Company and all of our subsidiaries. Our proprietary card businesses are the primary asset-generating businesses, with significant assets in both domestic and international Card Member lending and receivable activities. Our financing needs are in large part a consequence of our proprietary card-issuing businesses and the maintenance of a liquidity position to support all of our business activities, such as merchant payments. We generally pay merchants for card transactions prior to reimbursement by Card Members and therefore fund the merchant payments during the period Card Member loans and receivables are outstanding. We also have additional financing needs associated with general corporate purposes, including acquisition activities. FUNDING PROGRAMS AND ACTIVITIES We meet our funding needs through a variety of sources, including direct and third-party distributed deposits and debt instruments, such as senior unsecured debentures, asset securitizations, borrowings through secured borrowing facilities and a long-term committed bank borrowing facility. We had the following consolidated debt and customer deposits outstanding as of December 31: TABLE 21: SUMMARY OF CONSOLIDATED DEBT AND CUSTOMER DEPOSITS (Billions) 2016 2015 Short-term borrowings $ 5.6 $ 4.8 Long-term debt 47.0 48.1 Total debt 52.6 52.9 Customer deposits 53.0 55.0 Total debt and customer deposits $ 105.6 $ 107.9 Management does not currently expect to make any significant changes to our funding programs in order to satisfy Basel III’s Liquidity Coverage Ratio (LCR) standard based upon our current understanding of the requirements, which may be subject to change as we receive additional clarification and implementation guidance from regulators relating to the requirements and as the interpretation of requirements evolves over time. Our funding plan for the full year 2017 includes, among other sources, approximately $7 billion to $15 billion of unsecured term debt issuance and approximately $5 billion to $12 billion of secured term debt issuance. Our funding plans are subject to various risks and uncertainties, such as future business growth, the impact of global economic, political and other events on market capacity, demand for securities offered by us, regulatory changes, ability to securitize and sell receivables, and the performance of receivables previously sold in securitization transactions. Many of these risks and uncertainties are beyond our control. Our equity capital and funding strategies are designed, among other things, to maintain appropriate and stable unsecured debt ratings from the major credit rating agencies: Moody’s Investor Services (Moody’s), Standard & Poor’s (S&P), Fitch Ratings (Fitch) and Dominion Bond Rating Services (DBRS). Such ratings help support our access to cost-effective unsecured funding as part of our overall funding strategy. Our asset securitization activities are rated separately. TABLE 22: UNSECURED DEBT RATINGS Credit Agency American Express Entity Short-Term Ratings Long-Term Ratings Outlook DBRS All rated entities R-1 (middle) A (high) Stable Fitch All rated entities F1 A Negative Moody’s TRS and rated operating subsidiaries(a) Prime-1 A2 Stable Moody’s American Express Company Prime-2 A3 Stable S&P TRS(a) N/A A- Stable S&P Other rated operating subsidiaries A-2 A- Stable S&P American Express Company A-2 BBB+ Stable (a) American Express Travel Related Services Company, Inc. 57 Table of Contents Downgrades in the ratings of our unsecured debt or asset securitization program securities could result in higher funding costs, as well as higher fees related to borrowings under our unused lines of credit. Declines in credit ratings could also reduce our borrowing capacity in the unsecured debt and asset securitization capital markets. We believe our funding mix, including the proportion of U.S. retail deposits insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC), should reduce the impact that credit rating downgrades would have on our funding capacity and costs. SHORT-TERM FUNDING PROGRAMS Short-term borrowings, such as commercial paper, are defined as any debt with an original maturity of twelve months or less, as well as interest-bearing overdrafts with banks. Our short-term funding programs are used primarily to meet working capital needs, such as managing seasonal variations in receivables balances. The amount of short-term borrowings issued in the future will depend on our funding strategy, our needs and market conditions. As of December 31, 2016, we had $3.0 billion in commercial paper outstanding and we had an average of $0.5 billion in commercial paper outstanding during 2016. Refer to Note 9 to the “Consolidated Financial Statements” for a further description of these borrowings. DEPOSIT PROGRAMS We offer deposits within our Centurion Bank and American Express Bank subsidiaries. These funds are currently insured up to $250,000 per account holder through the FDIC. Our ability to obtain deposit funding and offer competitive interest rates is dependent on the capital levels of Centurion Bank and American Express Bank. We, through American Express Bank, have a direct retail deposit program, Personal Savings from American Express, to supplement our distribution of deposit products sourced through third-party distribution channels. The direct retail program makes FDIC-insured certificates of deposit (CDs) and high-yield savings account products available directly to consumers. As of December 31, 2016 we had $53.0 billion in customer deposits. Refer to Note 8 to the “Consolidated Financial Statements” for a further description of these deposits. LONG-TERM DEBT PROGRAMS As of December 31, 2016 we had $47.0 billion in long-term debt outstanding. During 2016, we and our subsidiaries issued $3.8 billion of unsecured debt with maturities ranging from 3 to 5 years. Refer to Note 9 to the “Consolidated Financial Statements” for a further description of these borrowings. Our 2016 debt issuances were as follows: TABLE 23: DEBT ISSUANCES (Billions) 2016 American Express Credit Corporation: Fixed Rate Senior Notes (weighted-average coupon of 1.65%) $ 3.5 Floating Rate Senior Notes (3-month LIBOR plus 57 basis points on average) 0.3 Total $ 3.8 ASSET SECURITIZATION PROGRAMS We periodically securitize Card Member loans and receivables arising from our card business, as the securitization market provides us with cost-effective funding. Securitization of Card Member loans and receivables is accomplished through the transfer of those assets to a trust, which in turn issues securities collateralized by the transferred assets to third-party investors. The proceeds from issuance are distributed to us, through our wholly owned subsidiaries, as consideration for the transferred assets. The loans and receivables being securitized are reported as Card Member loans and receivables on our “Consolidated Balance Sheets,” and the related securities issued to third-party investors are reported as long-term debt. Under the respective terms of the securitization trust agreements, the occurrence of certain triggering events associated with the performance of the assets of each trust could result in payment of trust expenses, establishment of reserve funds, or in a worst-case scenario, early amortization of debt securities. During the twelve months ended December 31, 2016, no such triggering events occurred. LIQUIDITY MANAGEMENT We incur liquidity risk that arises in the course of offering our products and services. Our liquidity objective is to maintain access to a diverse set of on- and off-balance sheet liquidity sources. We seek to maintain liquidity sources, even in the event we are unable to raise new funds under our regular funding programs during a substantial weakening in economic conditions, in amounts sufficient to meet our expected future financial obligations and business requirements for liquidity for a period of at least twelve months. Our liquidity risk policy sets out our objectives and approach to managing liquidity risk. The liquidity risks that we are exposed to could arise from a wide variety of scenarios. Our liquidity management strategy thus 58 Table of Contents includes a number of elements, including, but not limited to: • Maintaining diversified funding sources (refer to the “Funding Strategy” section for more details); • Maintaining unencumbered liquid assets and off-balance sheet liquidity sources; • Projecting cash inflows and outflows under a variety of economic and market scenarios; • Establishing clear objectives for liquidity risk management, including compliance with regulatory requirements; or • Incorporating liquidity risk management as appropriate into our capital adequacy framework. We seek to maintain access to a diverse set of on-balance sheet and off-balance sheet liquidity sources, including cash and other liquid assets, committed bank credit facilities and asset securitization conduit facilities. Through our U.S. bank subsidiaries, Centurion Bank and American Express Bank, we also hold collateral eligible for use at the Federal Reserve’s discount window. The amount and type of liquidity resources we maintain can vary over time, based upon the results of stress scenarios required under Dodd-Frank and other regulatory measures of liquidity, such as the LCR, as well as additional stress scenarios required under our liquidity risk policy. These stress scenarios possess distinct characteristics, varying by cash flow assumptions, time horizon and qualifying liquidity sources, among other factors. Scenarios under our liquidity risk policy include market-wide, firm-specific and combined liquidity stresses. The LCR rule prescribes cash flow assumptions over a 30-day period and establishes qualifying criteria for high-quality liquid assets. We consider other factors in determining the amount and type of liquidity we maintain, such as economic and financial market conditions, seasonality in business operations, growth in our businesses, potential acquisitions or dispositions, the cost and availability of alternative liquidity sources and credit rating agency guidelines and requirements. We were in compliance with the liquidity requirements to which we were subject, including the LCR, for the year ended December 31, 2016. The investment income we receive on liquidity resources, such as cash, is less than the interest expense on the sources of funding for these balances. The net interest costs to maintain these resources have been substantial. The level of future net interest costs depends on the amount of liquidity resources we maintain and the difference between our cost of funding these amounts and their investment yields. Securitized Borrowing Capacity As of December 31, 2016, we maintained our committed, revolving, secured borrowing facility, with a maturity date of July 16, 2018, that gives us the right to sell up to $3.0 billion face amount of eligible AAA notes from the American Express Issuance Trust II (the Charge Trust). We also maintained our committed, revolving, secured borrowing facility, with a maturity date of September 17, 2018, that gives us the right to sell up to $2.0 billion face amount of eligible AAA certificates from the American Express Credit Account Master Trust (the Lending Trust). Both facilities are used in the ordinary course of business to fund seasonal working capital needs, as well as to further enhance our contingent funding resources. As of December 31, 2016, $3.0 billion was drawn on the Charge Trust facility, which was subsequently reduced to $0.7 billion on January 17, 2017. No amounts were drawn on the Lending Trust facility. Federal Reserve Discount Window As insured depository institutions, Centurion Bank and American Express Bank may borrow from the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco, subject to the amount of qualifying collateral that they may pledge. The Federal Reserve has indicated that both credit and charge card receivables are a form of qualifying collateral for secured borrowings made through the discount window. Whether specific assets will be considered qualifying collateral and the amount that may be borrowed against the collateral, remain at the discretion of the Federal Reserve. We had approximately $57.0 billion as of December 31, 2016 in U.S. credit card loans and charge card receivables that could be sold over time through our securitization trusts or pledged in return for secured borrowings to provide further liquidity, subject in each case to applicable market conditions and eligibility criteria. Committed Bank Credit Facility In addition to the secured borrowing facilities described earlier in this section, we maintained a committed syndicated bank credit facility as of December 31, 2016 of $3.0 billion, which expires on December 9, 2018. The availability of this credit line is subject to our compliance with certain financial covenants, principally the maintenance by American Express Credit Corporation (Credco) of a certain ratio of combined earnings and fixed charges to fixed charges. As of December 31, 2016, we were in compliance with each of our 59 Table of Contents covenants. As of December 31, 2016, no amounts were drawn on the committed credit facility. The capacity of the facility mainly served to further enhance our contingent funding resources. Our committed bank credit facility does not contain a material adverse change clause, which might otherwise preclude borrowing under the credit facility, nor is it dependent on our credit rating. CASH FLOWS The following table summarizes our cash flow activity, followed by a discussion of the major drivers impacting operating, investing and financing cash flows. TABLE 24: CASH FLOWS (Billions) 2016 2015 2014 Total cash provided by (used in): Operating activities $ 8.2 $ 10.6 $ 11.0 Investing activities 1.9 (8.2) (8.0) Financing activities (7.5) (1.7) — Effect of foreign currency exchange rates on cash and cash equivalents and other (0.2) (0.2) (0.2) Net increase in cash and cash equivalents $ 2.4 $ 0.5 $ 2.8 Cash Flows from Operating Activities Our cash flows from operating activities primarily include net income adjusted for (i) non-cash items included in net income and (ii) changes in the balances of operating assets and liabilities, which can vary significantly in the normal course of business due to the amount and timing of payments. For December 31, 2016 and 2015, net cash provided by operating activities was $8.2 billion and $10.6 billion, respectively, driven by net income of $5.4 billion and $5.2 billion, respectively, adjusted for non-cash items including changes in provisions for losses, depreciation and amortization, deferred taxes, and stock-based compensation. The current period net income includes gains of $1.2 billion on the sales of the HFS portfolios, which is presented in Net decrease (increase) in Card Member receivables and loans, including held for sale, within Cash flows from investing activities. The decrease during the periods of comparison was also driven primarily by impacts from movements in Other assets as a result of normal business operating activities. Cash Flows from Investing Activities Our cash flows from investing activities primarily include changes in Card Member receivables and loans, including Card Member loans and receivables HFS, along with gains on sales related thereto, as well as changes in our available for sale investment securities portfolio. For the year ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, net cash provided by (used in) investing activities was $1.9 billion and ($8.2) billion, respectively. The increase in the current period, as compared to the year ended December 31, 2015, was primarily driven by the sales of the HFS portfolios, partially offset by increases in Card Member receivables and loans held for investment. Cash Flows from Financing Activities Our cash flows from financing activities primarily include issuing and repaying debt, changes in customer deposits, issuing and repurchasing our common shares, and paying dividends. For the year ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, net cash used in financing activities was $7.5 billion and $1.7 billion, respectively. The increase in the current period, as compared to the year ended December 31, 2015, primarily resulted from a net decrease in customer deposits and short-term borrowings, partially offset by lower net repayments of long-term debt in the current year, as compared to the prior year. 60 Table of Contents OFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS AND CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS We have identified both on- and off-balance sheet transactions, arrangements, obligations and other relationships that may have a material current or future effect on our financial condition, changes in financial condition, results of operations, or liquidity and capital resources. CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS The table below identifies transactions that represent our contractually committed future obligations. Purchase obligations include our agreements to purchase goods and services that are enforceable and legally binding and that specify significant terms, including: fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased; fixed, minimum or variable price provisions; and the approximate timing of the transaction. TABLE 25: COMMITTED FUTURE OBLIGATIONS BY YEAR Payments due by year(a) (Millions) 2017 2018-2019 2020-2021 2022 and thereafter Total Long-term debt $ 15,724 $ 22,042 $ 6,957 $ 3,158 $ 47,881 Interest payments on long-term debt(b) 913 797 324 1,267 3,301 Certificates of deposit 3,750 5,833 2,648 — 12,231 Other long-term liabilities(c) (d) 224 103 23 15 365 Operating lease obligations 127 199 118 788 1,232 Purchase obligations(e) 456 269 126 63 914 Cobrand obligations(f) 72 104 202 10 388 Total $ 21,266 $ 29,347 $ 10,398 $ 5,301 $ 66,312 (a) The table above excludes approximately $1.0 billion of tax liabilities related to the uncertainty in income taxes as inherent complexities and the number of tax years currently open for examination in multiple jurisdictions do not permit reasonable estimates of payments, if any, to be made over a range of years. Refer to Note 21 to the “Consolidated Financial Statements” for additional information. (b) Estimated interest payments were calculated using the effective interest rate in place as of December 31, 2016, and includes the effect of existing interest rate swaps. Actual cash flows may differ from estimated payments. (c) As of December 31, 2016, there were no minimum required contributions, and no contributions are currently planned, for the U.S. American Express Retirement Plan. For the U.S. American Express Retirement Restoration Plan and non-U.S. defined benefit pension and postretirement benefit plans, contributions in 2017 are anticipated to be approximately $34 million, and this amount has been included within other long-term liabilities. Remaining obligations under defined benefit pension and postretirement benefit plans aggregating $666 million have not been included in the table above as the timing of such obligations is not determinable. Additionally, other long-term liabilities do not include $7.1 billion of Membership Rewards liabilities, which are not considered long-term liabilities as Card Members in good standing can redeem points immediately, without restrictions, and because the timing of point redemption is not determinable. (d) As of December 31, 2016, we had committed to provide funding related to certain tax credit investments resulting in a $266 million unfunded commitment included in other long-term liabilities. In addition to this amount, there was a further $151 million of contractual off-balance sheet obligations which have not been included in the table above as the timing of such obligations is not determinable. Refer to Note 6 to the “Consolidated Financial Statements” for additional information. (e) The purchase obligation amounts represent either the early termination fees or non-cancelable minimum contractual obligations, as applicable, by period under contracts that were in effect as of December 31, 2016. (f) Represents obligations to make payments under contractual agreements with certain cobrand partners, based primarily on the amount of Card Member spending and corresponding rewards earned on such spending and, under certain arrangements, on the number of accounts acquired and retained. Such cobrand agreements are entered into for a fixed period, generally ranging from five to eight years. We expect to fully satisfy these obligations over the remaining term of these agreements as part of the ongoing operations of our business. In addition to the contractual obligations noted in Table 25, we have off-balance sheet arrangements that include guarantees, indemnifications and certain other off-balance sheet arrangements. GUARANTEES Our principal guarantees are associated with Card Member services to enhance the value of owning an American Express card. As of December 31, 2016, we had guarantees totaling approximately $48 billion related to Card Member protection plans, as well as other guarantees and indemnifications provided in the ordinary course of business. Refer to Note 16 to the “Consolidated Financial Statements” for further discussion regarding our guarantees. CERTAIN OTHER OFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS As of December 31, 2016, we had approximately $242 billion of unused credit outstanding as part of established lending product agreements. Total unused credit does not represent potential future cash requirements, as a significant portion of this unused credit will likely not be drawn. Our charge card products generally have no pre-set limit, and therefore are not reflected in unused credit available to Card Members. To mitigate counterparty credit risk related to derivatives, we accepted non-cash collateral in the form of security interests in U.S. Treasury securities from our derivatives counterparties with a fair value of $18 million and nil as of December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively, none of which was sold or repledged. Refer to Notes 7 and 13 to the “Consolidated Financial Statements” for discussion regarding our other off-balance sheet arrangements. 61 Table of Contents RISK MANAGEMENT GOVERNANCE We use our comprehensive Enterprise-wide Risk Management (ERM) program to identify, aggregate, monitor, and manage risks. The program also defines our risk appetite, governance, culture and capabilities. The implementation and execution of the ERM program is headed by our Chief Risk Officer. Risk management is overseen by our Board of Directors through three Board committees: the Risk Committee, the Audit and Compliance Committee, and the Compensation and Benefits Committee. Each committee consists entirely of independent directors and provides regular reports to the full Board regarding matters reviewed at their committee. The committees meet regularly in private sessions with our Chief Risk Officer, the Chief Compliance & Ethics Officer, the General Auditor and other senior management with regard to our risk management processes, controls, talent and capabilities. The Board monitors the “tone at the top,” our risk culture, and oversees emerging and strategic risks. The Risk Committee of our Board of Directors provides oversight of our enterprise-wide risk management framework, processes and methodologies. The Risk Committee approves our ERM policy. The ERM policy governs risk governance, risk oversight and risk appetite for risks, including individual credit risk, institutional credit risk, market risk, liquidity risk, operational risk, reputational risk, compliance risk, model risk, asset/liability risk and strategic and business risk. Risk appetite defines the authorized risk limits to control exposures within our risk capacity and risk tolerance, including stressed forward-looking scenarios. In addition, it establishes principles for risk taking in the aggregate and for each risk type, and is supported by a comprehensive system for monitoring limits, escalation triggers and assessing control programs. The Risk Committee reviews and concurs in the appointment, replacement, performance and compensation of our Chief Risk Officer and receives regular updates from the Chief Risk Officer on key risks, transactions and exposures. The Risk Committee reviews our risk profile against the tolerances specified in the Risk Appetite Framework, including significant risk exposures, risk trends in our portfolios and major risk concentrations. The Risk Committee also provides oversight of our compliance with Basel capital and liquidity standards, our Internal Capital Adequacy Assessment Process, including its Comprehensive Capital Analysis and Review (CCAR) submissions, and resolution planning. The Audit and Compliance Committee of our Board of Directors reviews and approves compliance policies, which include our Compliance Risk Tolerance Statement. In addition, the Audit and Compliance Committee reviews the effectiveness of our Corporate-wide Compliance Risk Management Program. More broadly, this committee is responsible for assisting the Board in its oversight responsibilities relating to the integrity of our financial statements and financial reporting process, internal and external auditing, including the qualifications and independence of the independent registered public accounting firm and the performance of our internal audit services function, and the integrity of our systems of internal accounting and financial controls. The Audit and Compliance Committee provides oversight of our Internal Audit Group. The Audit and Compliance Committee reviews and concurs in the appointment, replacement, performance and compensation of our General Auditor and approves Internal Audit’s annual audit plan, charter, policies and budget. The Audit and Compliance Committee also receives regular updates on the audit plan’s status and results including significant reports issued by Internal Audit and the status of our corrective actions. The Compensation and Benefits Committee of our Board of Directors works with the Chief Risk Officer to ensure our overall compensation programs, as well as those covering our business units and risk-taking employees, appropriately balance risk with business incentives and how business performance is achieved without taking imprudent or excessive risk. Our Chief Risk Officer is actively involved in setting goals, including for our business units. Our Chief Risk Officer also reviews the current and forward-looking risk profiles of each business unit, and provides input into performance evaluation. The Chief Risk Officer meets with the Compensation and Benefits Committee and attests whether performance goals and results have been achieved without taking imprudent risks. The Compensation and Benefits Committee uses a risk-balanced incentive compensation framework to decide on our bonus pools and the compensation of senior executives. There are several internal management committees, including the Enterprise-wide Risk Management Committee (ERMC), chaired by our Chief Risk Officer. The ERMC is the highest-level management committee to oversee all firm-wide risks and is responsible for risk governance, risk oversight and risk appetite. It maintains the enterprise-wide risk appetite framework and monitors compliance with limits and escalations defined in it. The ERMC oversees implementation of risk policies company-wide. The ERMC reviews key risk exposures, trends and concentrations, significant compliance matters, economic capital and Basel capital trends, and provides guidance on the steps to monitor, control and report major risks. As defined in the ERM policy, we follow the “three lines of defense” approach to risk management. The first line of defense comprises functions and management committees directly initiating risk taking. Business unit presidents, our Chief Credit Officer, Chief Market Risk Officer and Functional Risk Officer are part of the first line of defense. The second line comprises independent functions 62 Table of Contents overseeing risk-taking activities of the first line. The Chief Risk Officer, the Chief Compliance & Ethics Officer, the Chief Operational Risk Officer, the Corporate Controller and certain control groups, both at the enterprise level and within regulated entities, are part of the second line of defense. The global risk oversight team oversees the policies, strategies, frameworks, models, processes and capabilities deployed by the first line teams and provides challenges and independent assessments on how the first line of defense is managing risks. Our Internal Audit Group constitutes the third line of defense, and provides independent assessments and effective challenge of the first and second lines of defense. In addition, the Asset Liability Committee, chaired by our Chief Financial Officer, is responsible for managing market, liquidity, asset/liability risk and capital. CREDIT RISK MANAGEMENT PROCESS Credit risk is defined as loss due to obligor or counterparty default or changes in the credit quality of a security. Our credit risks are divided into two broad categories: individual and institutional. Each has distinct risk management capabilities, strategies, and tools. Business units that create individual or institutional credit risk exposures of significant importance are supported by dedicated risk management teams, each led by a Chief Credit Officer. INDIVIDUAL CREDIT RISK Individual credit risk arises principally from consumer and small business charge cards, credit cards, lines of credit, and loans. These portfolios consist of millions of customers across multiple geographies, industries and levels of net worth. We benefit from the high-quality profile of our customers, which is driven by our brand, premium customer servicing, product features and risk management capabilities, which span underwriting, customer management and collections. Externally, the risk in these portfolios is correlated to broad economic trends, such as unemployment rates and gross domestic product (GDP) growth, which can affect customer liquidity. The business unit leaders and their Chief Credit Officers take the lead in managing the individual credit risk process. These Chief Credit Officers are guided by the Individual Credit Risk Committee, which is responsible for implementation and enforcement of the Individual Credit Risk Management Policy. This policy is further supported by subordinate policies and operating manuals covering decision logic and processes of credit extension, including prospecting, new account approvals, point-of-sale authorizations, credit line management and collections. The subordinate risk policies and operating manuals are designed to ensure consistent application of risk management principles and standardized reporting of asset quality and loss recognition. Individual credit risk management is supported by sophisticated proprietary scoring and decision-making models that use the most up-to-date information on prospects and customers, such as spending and payment history and data feeds from credit bureaus. Additional data, such as commercial variables, are integrated to further mitigate small business risk. We have developed data-driven economic decision logic for customer interactions to better serve our customers. INSTITUTIONAL CREDIT RISK Institutional credit risk arises principally within our Global Commercial Services, Global Merchant Services, GNS, Prepaid Services and Foreign Exchange Services businesses, as well as investment and liquidity management activities. Unlike individual credit risk, institutional credit risk is characterized by a lower loss frequency but higher severity. It is affected both by general economic conditions and by client-specific events. The absence of large losses in any given year or over several years is not necessarily representative of the level of risk of institutional portfolios, given the infrequency of loss events in such portfolios. Similar to Individual Credit Risk, business units taking institutional credit risks are supported by Chief Credit Officers. These officers are guided by the Institutional Risk Management Committee (IRMC), which is responsible for implementation and enforcement of the Institutional Credit Risk Management Policy and for providing guidance to the credit officers of each business unit with substantial institutional credit risk exposures. The committee, along with the business unit Chief Credit Officers, makes investment decisions in core risk capabilities, ensures proper implementation of the underwriting standards and contractual rights of risk mitigation, monitors risk exposures, and determines risk mitigation actions. The IRMC formally reviews large institutional risk exposures to ensure compliance with ERMC guidelines and procedures and escalates them to the ERMC as appropriate. At the same time, the IRMC provides guidance to the business unit risk management teams to optimize risk-adjusted returns on capital. A centralized risk rating unit and a specialized airline risk group provide risk assessment of our institutional obligors. Exposure to the Airline Industry We have multiple important cobrand, rewards, merchant acceptance and corporate payments arrangements with airlines. The ERM program evaluates the risks posed by our airline partners and the overall airline strategy companywide through comprehensive business analysis of global airlines. Our largest airline partner is Delta, and this relationship includes exclusive cobrand credit card partnerships and other arrangements including Membership Rewards redemption, merchant acceptance, travel and corporate payments. See “Risk Factors.” 63 Table of Contents Debt Exposure As part of our ongoing risk management process, we monitor our financial exposure to both sovereign and non-sovereign customers and counterparties, and measure and manage concentrations of risk by geographic regions, as well as by economic sectors and industries. A primary focus area for monitoring is credit deterioration due to weaknesses in economic and fiscal profiles. We evaluate countries based on the market assessment of the riskiness of their sovereign debt and our assessment of our economic and financial outlook and closely monitor those deemed high risk. As of December 31, 2016, we considered our gross credit exposures to government entities, financial institutions and corporations in those countries deemed high risk to be individually and collectively not material. OPERATIONAL RISK MANAGEMENT PROCESS We define operational risk as the risk of not achieving business objectives due to inadequate or failed processes, people, or information systems, or the external environment, including failures to comply with laws and regulations. Operational risk is inherent in all business activities and can impact an organization through direct or indirect financial loss, brand damage, customer dissatisfaction, or legal and regulatory penalties. To appropriately measure and manage operational risk, we have implemented a comprehensive operational risk framework that is defined in the Operational Risk Management Policy approved by the Risk Committee. The Operational Risk Management Committee (ORMC), chaired by the Chief Operational Risk Officer, coordinates with all control groups on effective risk assessments and controls and oversees the preventive, responsive and mitigation efforts by Operational Excellence teams in the business units and staff groups. We use the operational risk framework to identify, measure, monitor and report inherent and emerging operational risks. This framework, supervised by the ORMC, consists of (a) operational risk event capture, (b) a project office to coordinate issue management and control enhancements, (c) key risk indicators such as customer complaints or pre-implementation test metrics, and (d) process and entity-level risk assessments. The framework requires the assessment of operational risk events to determine root causes, impact to customers and/or us, and resolution plan accountability to correct any defect, remediate customers, and enhance controls and testing to mitigate future issues. The impact is assessed from an operational, financial, brand, regulatory compliance and legal perspective. INFORMATION SECURITY, PRIVACY, AND DATA GOVERNANCE We have implemented an Information Security Program and Operating Model that is designed to protect information and information systems from unauthorized access, use, disclosure, disruption, modification or destruction. Our Information Security Program and Operating Model are based on the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) Cybersecurity Framework and cover different phases of security to identify, protect, detect, respond and recover from information security incidents. Chaired by the Chief Information Security Officer, our Information Security Risk Management Committee, a sub-committee of the ORMC, provides oversight and governance for our information security risk management program. In addition, the committee is responsible for establishing cyber risk tolerances and in managing cyber crisis preparedness. The Information Security Oversight team provides challenges and independent assessment of the information security program. Our Privacy Framework and Operating Model follow a similar structure. Chaired by the Global Head of Privacy and Information Security Oversight and attended by the Chief Privacy Officer, our Privacy Risk Management Committee, a sub-committee of the ORMC, provides oversight and governance for our privacy program. The committee is responsible for the governance over the collection, notice, use, sharing, transfer, confidentiality and retention of personal data. Our Enterprise Data Governance Framework and Policy defines governance and data standards for data used in regulatory reporting, risk management as well as other critical systems including big data capabilities. See “A significant operating disruption, a major information security incident or an increase in fraudulent activity using our cards could lead to reputational damage to our brand and significant legal, regulatory and financial exposure, and could reduce the use and acceptance of our charge and credit cards” under “Risk Factors” for additional information. COMPLIANCE RISK MANAGEMENT PROCESS We define compliance risk as the risk of legal or reputational harm, fines, monetary penalties and payment of damages or other forms of sanction as a result of non-compliance with applicable laws, regulations, rules or standards of conduct. We view our ability to effectively mitigate compliance risk as an important aspect of our business model. Our Global Compliance and Ethics organization is responsible for establishing and maintaining our corporate-wide Compliance Risk Management 64 Table of Contents Program. Pursuant to this program, we seek to manage and mitigate compliance risk by assessing, controlling, monitoring, measuring and reporting the regulatory risks to which we are exposed. We have a comprehensive Anti-Money Laundering program that monitors and reports suspicious activity to the appropriate government authorities. As part of that program, the Global Risk Oversight team provides independent risk assessment of the models and rules used by the Anti-Money Laundering team. In addition, the Internal Audit Group reviews the processes for practices consistent with regulatory guidance. REPUTATIONAL RISK MANAGEMENT PROCESS We define reputational risk as the risk that negative publicity regarding our products, services, business practices, management, clients and partners, whether perceived or real, could cause a decline in the customer base, costly litigation, or revenue reductions. We view protecting our reputation as core to our vision of becoming the world’s most respected service brand and fundamental to our long-term success. Our business leaders are responsible for ensuring that reputational risk implications of transactions, business activities and management practices are appropriately considered and relevant subject matter experts are engaged as needed. The ERMC and its sub-committees are responsible for reviewing decisions where reputational risk may exist and ensuring that reputational risk considerations are properly reflected. MARKET RISK MANAGEMENT PROCESS Market risk is the risk to earnings or asset and liability values resulting from movements in market prices. Our market risk exposures include: • Interest rate risk due to changes in the relationship between interest rates on our assets (such as loans, receivables and investment securities) and our interest rates on our liabilities (such as debt and deposits); and • Foreign exchange risk related to transactions, funding, investments and earnings in currencies other than the U.S. dollar. Our Asset-Liability Management (ALM) and Market Risk policies establish the framework that guides and governs market risk management, including quantitative limits and escalation triggers. These policies are approved by the Risk Committee of the Board of Directors. Market risk is managed by the Market Risk Management Committee. The Market Risk Oversight Officer provides an independent risk assessment and oversight over the policies and exposure management for market risk and ALM activities, as well as overseeing compliance with the Volcker Rule and other regulatory requirements. Market risk management is also guided and governed by policies covering the use of derivative financial instruments, funding, liquidity and investments. We analyze a variety of interest rate scenarios to inform us of the potential impacts from interest rate changes on earnings and the value of assets, liabilities and the economic value of equity. Our interest rate exposure can vary over time as a result of, among other things, the proportion of our total funding provided by variable-and fixed-rate debt and deposits compared to our Card Member loans and receivables. Interest rate swaps are used from time to time to effectively convert debt issuances to (or from) variable-rate, from (or to) fixed-rate. We generally do not engage in derivative financial instruments for trading purposes other than with respect to our Foreign Exchange International Payments business activities. Refer to Note 14 to the “Consolidated Financial Statements” for further discussion of our derivative financial instruments. As of December 31, 2016, a hypothetical, immediate 100 basis point increase in market interest rates would have a detrimental effect on our annual net interest income of approximately $193 million. This measure first projects net interest income over the following twelve-month time horizon considering forecasted business growth and anticipated future market interest rates. The detrimental impact from a rate increase is then measured by instantaneously increasing the anticipated future interest rates by 100 basis points. It is further assumed that our interest-rate sensitive assets and liabilities that reprice within the twelve-month horizon reprice by 100 basis points. Actual changes in our net interest income will depend on many factors. For example, the interest rate we pay on deposit balances within our high-yield savings accounts may not change at the same time or to the same degree as market interest rates. In addition to parallel rate changes, our net interest income is subject to changes in the relationship between market benchmark rates. For example, movements in Prime rate change the yield on a large portion of our variable-rate U.S. lending receivables and loans, while LIBOR rates determine the effective interest rate on a significant portion of our outstanding funding. Differences in the rate of change of these two benchmark indices, commonly referred to as basis risk, would thus impact our net interest income. The detrimental effect on our net interest income of a hypothetical 10 basis point decrease in the spread between Prime and one-month LIBOR over the next twelve months is estimated to be $35 million. We currently have approximately $36 billion of Prime-based, variable-rate U.S. lending receivables and loans and $35 billion of LIBOR-indexed debt, including asset securitizations. 65 Table of Contents Foreign exchange exposures arise in four principal ways: 1) Card Member spending in currencies that are not the billing currency, 2) cross-currency transactions and balances from our funding activities, 3) cross-currency investing activities, such as in the equity of foreign subsidiaries, and 4) revenues generated and expenses incurred in foreign currencies, which impact earnings. These foreign exchange risks are managed primarily by entering into foreign exchange spot transactions or hedged with foreign exchange forward contracts when the hedge costs are economically justified and in notional amounts designed to offset pretax impacts from currency movements in the period in which they occur. As of December 31, 2016 and 2015, foreign currency derivative instruments with total notional amounts of approximately $28 billion and $26 billion were outstanding, respectively. With respect to Card Member spending and cross-currency transactions, including related foreign exchange forward contracts outstanding, a hypothetical 10 percent strengthening of the U.S. dollar would result in an immaterial impact to projected earnings as of December 31, 2016. With respect to translation exposure of foreign subsidiary equity balances, including related foreign exchange forward contracts outstanding, a hypothetical 10 percent strengthening of the U.S. dollar would result in an immaterial reduction in other comprehensive income and equity as of December 31, 2016. With respect to earnings denominated in foreign currencies, the adverse impact on pretax income of a hypothetical 10 percent strengthening of the U.S. dollar related to anticipated overseas operating results for the next twelve months would be approximately $185 million as of December 31, 2016. To a much lesser extent, we are also subject to market risk arising from activities conducted by our Foreign Exchange International Payments business. We aim to minimize market risk from these activities through hedging, where appropriate, and the establishment of limits to define and protect the company from excessive exposure. The actual impact of interest rate and foreign exchange rate changes will depend on, among other factors, the timing of rate changes, the extent to which different rates do not move in the same direction or in the same direction to the same degree, changes in the cost, volume and mix of our hedging activities and changes in the volume and mix of our businesses. FUNDING & LIQUIDITY RISK MANAGEMENT PROCESS Liquidity risk is defined as our inability to meet our ongoing financial and business obligations as they become due at a reasonable cost. Our Board-approved Liquidity Risk Policy establishes the framework that guides and governs liquidity risk management. Liquidity risk is managed by the Funding and Liquidity Committee. In addition, the Market Risk Oversight Officer provides independent oversight of liquidity risk management. We manage liquidity risk by maintaining access to a diverse set of cash, readily-marketable securities and contingent sources of liquidity, such that we can continuously meet our business requirements and expected future financing obligations for at least a twelve-month period, even in the event we are unable to raise new funds under our regular funding programs during a substantial weakening in economic conditions. We consider the trade-offs between maintaining too much liquidity, which can be costly and limit financial flexibility, and having inadequate liquidity, which may result in financial distress during a liquidity event. Liquidity risk is managed at an aggregate consolidated level as well as at certain subsidiaries in order to ensure that sufficient and accessible liquidity resources are maintained. The Funding and Liquidity Committee reviews forecasts of our aggregate and subsidiary cash positions and financing requirements, approves funding plans designed to satisfy those requirements under normal and stressed conditions, establishes guidelines to identify the amount of liquidity resources required and monitors positions and determines any actions to be taken. MODEL RISK MANAGEMENT PROCESS We define model risk as the risk of adverse consequences, such as financial loss, poor business and strategic decision making, or damage to our reputation, from decisions based on incorrect or misused model outputs and reports. We manage model risk through a comprehensive model governance framework, including policies and procedures for model development, independent model validation and change management capabilities that seek to minimize erroneous model methodology, outputs and misuse. We also assess model performance on an ongoing basis. STRATEGIC AND BUSINESS RISK MANAGEMENT PROCESS Strategic and business risk is the risk related to our inability to achieve our business objectives due to poor strategic decisions, including decisions related to mergers, acquisitions, and divestitures, poor implementation of strategic decisions or declining demand for our products and services. Strategic decisions are reviewed and approved by business leaders and various committees and must be aligned with company policies. We seek to manage strategic and business risks through risk controls embedded in these processes as well as overall risk management oversight over business goals. Existing product performance is reviewed periodically by committees and business leaders. Mergers, acquisitions and divestitures can only be approved following Deal Committee due diligence, a comprehensive risk assessment by operational, market, credit and oversight leaders provided to the Chief Risk Officer and approval by either the Chief Risk Officer or appropriate risk committees. All new products and material changes in business processes are reviewed and approved by the New Products Committee and appropriate credit or risk committees. 66 Table of Contents CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES Refer to Note 1 to the “Consolidated Financial Statements” for a summary of our significant accounting policies. Certain of our accounting policies requiring significant management assumptions and judgments are as follows: RESERVES FOR CARD MEMBER LOSSES Reserves for Card Member losses represent our best estimate of the probable losses inherent in our outstanding portfolio of Card Member loans and receivables, as of the balance sheet date. In estimating these losses, we use statistical and analytical models that analyze portfolio performance and reflect our judgment regarding the quantitative components of the reserve. The models take into account several factors, including delinquency-based loss migration rates, loss emergence periods and average losses over an appropriate historical period, as well as expected future recoveries. We also consider whether to adjust the quantitative reserve for certain external and internal qualitative factors that may increase or decrease the reserves for losses on Card Member loans and receivables. The process of estimating these reserves requires a high degree of judgment. To the extent historical credit experience, updated for any external and internal qualitative factors such as environmental trends, is not indicative of future performance, actual losses could differ significantly from our judgments and expectations, resulting in either higher or lower future provisions for Card Member losses in any quarter. As of December 31, 2016, a 10 percent increase in our estimate of losses inherent in the outstanding portfolio of Card Member loans and receivables, evaluated collectively for impairment, would increase reserves for losses with a corresponding change to provisions for losses by approximately $169 million. This sensitivity analysis is provided as a hypothetical scenario to assess the sensitivity of the provisions for losses. It does not represent our expectations for losses in the future, nor does it include how other portfolio factors such as delinquency-based loss migration rates or recoveries, or the amount of outstanding balances, may impact the level of reserves for losses and the corresponding impact on the provisions for losses. LIABILITY FOR MEMBERSHIP REWARDS EXPENSE The Membership Rewards program is our largest card-based rewards program. Card Members can earn points for purchases charged on their enrolled card products. A significant portion of our cards, by their terms, allow Card Members to earn bonus points for purchases at merchants in particular industry categories. Membership Rewards points are redeemable for a broad variety of rewards, including travel, entertainment, retail certificates and merchandise. Points typically do not expire, and there is no limit on the number of points a Card Member may earn. Membership Rewards expense is driven by charge volume on enrolled cards, customer participation in the program and contractual arrangements with redemption partners. We record a Membership Rewards liability that represents the estimated cost of points earned that are expected to be redeemed by Card Members in the future. The Membership Rewards liability is impacted over time by enrollment levels, attrition, the volume of points earned and redeemed, and the associated redemption costs. We estimate the Membership Rewards liability by determining the URR and the WAC per point, which are applied to the points of current enrollees. Refer to Note 10 to the “Consolidated Financial Statements” for additional information. The URR assumption is used to estimate the number of points earned by current enrollees that will ultimately be redeemed in future periods. We use statistical and actuarial models to estimate the URR of points earned to date by current Card Members based on redemption trends, card product type, enrollment tenure, card spend levels and credit attributes. The WAC per point assumption is used to estimate future redemption costs and is primarily based on redemption choices made by Card Members, reward offerings by partners, and Membership Rewards program changes. The WAC per point is derived from the previous 12 months of redemptions and is adjusted as appropriate for certain changes in redemption costs that are not representative of future cost expectations. We periodically evaluate our liability estimation process and assumptions based on developments in redemption patterns, cost per point redeemed, partner contract changes and other factors. The process of estimating the Membership Rewards liability includes a high degree of judgment. Actual redemptions and associated redemption costs could differ significantly from our estimates, resulting in either higher or lower Membership Rewards expense. Changes in the Membership Rewards URR and WAC per point have the effect of either increasing or decreasing the liability through the current period Marketing, promotion, rewards and Card Member services expense by an amount estimated to cover the cost of all points previously earned but not yet redeemed by current enrollees as of the end of the reporting period. As of December 31, 2016, an increase in the estimated URR of current enrollees of 25 basis points would increase the Membership Rewards liability and corresponding rewards expense by approximately $92 million. Similarly, an increase in the WAC per point of 1 basis point would increase the Membership Rewards liability and corresponding rewards expense by approximately $89 million. 67 Table of Contents FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENT Our investment securities and derivative instruments are carried at fair value on the Consolidated Balance Sheets, which require management to make assumptions and apply judgments when assessing fair value. The objective of a fair value measurement is to determine the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability by utilizing the three-level hierarchy of inputs to valuation techniques used to measure fair value. When available, we use quoted market prices to determine fair value (Level 1). If quoted market prices are not available, we will measure fair value based on pricing models with significant observable inputs (Level 2). We do not have any financial instruments measured at fair value on a recurring basis using significant unobservable inputs (Level 3). For additional information on our fair value hierarchy, refer to Note 15 to the “Consolidated Financial Statements.” Investment Securities Our investment securities are mostly composed of fixed-income securities issued by states and municipalities in the United States, the U.S. Government and its Agencies and select foreign governments. The fair value of our investment securities, including investments comprising defined benefit pension plan assets, are obtained primarily from third-party pricing services. The fair values provided by the pricing services are estimated using pricing models, where the inputs to those models are based on observable market inputs or recent trades of similar securities. We did not apply any adjustments to prices received from the pricing services used as of December 31, 2016 and 2015. For additional information on our investment securities, refer to Note 5 to the “Consolidated Financial Statements.” Derivative Instruments Our primary derivative instruments are interest rate swaps and foreign currency forward agreements. The fair value of our derivative instruments is estimated by using either a third-party valuation service that uses proprietary pricing models, or by internal pricing models, where the inputs to those models are readily observable from actively quoted markets. For additional information on our derivatives and hedging activities, refer to Note 14 to the “Consolidated Financial Statements.” In the measurement of fair value for our investment securities and derivative instruments, although the underlying inputs used in the pricing models are based on observable markets inputs, the pricing models do entail a certain amount of subjectivity, and therefore differing judgments in the underlying inputs, or how they are modeled, could result in a different estimate of fair value. We reaffirm our understanding of the valuation techniques used by our third-party valuation services at least annually. GOODWILL RECOVERABILITY Goodwill represents the excess of acquisition cost of an acquired business over the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed. Goodwill is not amortized but is tested for impairment at the reporting unit level annually or when events or circumstances arise, such as adverse changes in the business climate, that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of the reporting unit below its carrying value. Our approach and methodology for conducting our goodwill impairment testing is fundamentally based on the measurement of fair value for our reporting units, which inherently entails the use of significant judgment. For valuation, we use a combination of the income approach (discounted cash flows) and market approach (market multiples) in estimating the fair value of our reporting units. When preparing discounted cash flow models under the income approach, we estimate future cash flows using the reporting unit’s internal multi-year forecast, and a terminal value calculated using a growth rate that we believe is appropriate in light of current and expected future economic conditions. To discount these cash flows we use our expected cost of equity, determined using a capital asset pricing model. When using the market method under the market approach, we apply comparable publicly traded companies’ multiples (e.g., earnings, revenues) to our reporting units’ actual results. The judgment in estimating forecasted cash flows, discount rates and market comparables is significant, and imprecision could materially affect the fair value of our reporting units. Refer to Note 2 to the “Consolidated Financial Statements” for additional information regarding the Prepaid Services goodwill impairment in 2015. We could be exposed to an increased risk of further goodwill impairment if future operating results or macroeconomic conditions differ significantly from management’s current assumptions. 68 Table of Contents INCOME TAXES We are subject to the income tax laws of the United States, its states and municipalities and those of the foreign jurisdictions in which we operate. These tax laws are complex, and the manner in which they apply to the taxpayer’s facts is sometimes open to interpretation. In establishing a provision for income tax expense, we must make judgments about the application of inherently complex tax laws. Unrecognized Tax Benefits We establish a liability for unrecognized tax benefits, which are the differences between a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return and the benefit recognized in the financial statements. In establishing a liability for an unrecognized tax benefit, assumptions may be made in determining whether, and the extent to which, a tax position should be sustained. A tax position is recognized only when it is more likely than not to be sustained upon examination by the relevant taxing authority, based on its technical merits. The amount of tax benefit recognized is the largest benefit that we believe is more likely than not to be realized on ultimate settlement. As new information becomes available, we evaluate our tax positions and adjust our unrecognized tax benefits, as appropriate. Tax benefits ultimately realized can differ from amounts previously recognized due to uncertainties, with any such differences generally impacting the provision for income tax. Deferred Tax Asset Realization Deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the differences between the financial statement and tax bases of assets and liabilities using the enacted tax rates expected to be in effect for the years in which the differences are expected to reverse. Since deferred taxes measure the future tax effects of items recognized in the Consolidated Financial Statements, certain estimates and assumptions are required to determine whether it is more likely than not that all or some portion of the benefit of a deferred tax asset will not be realized. In making this assessment, we analyze and estimate the impact of future taxable income, reversing temporary differences and available tax planning strategies. These assessments are performed quarterly, taking into account any new information. Changes in facts or circumstances can lead to changes in the ultimate realization of deferred tax assets due to uncertainties. 69 Table of Contents OTHER MATTERS RECENTLY ISSUED ACCOUNTING STANDARDS Refer to the Recently Issued Accounting Standards section of Note 1 to the “Consolidated Financial Statements.” GLOSSARY OF SELECTED TERMINOLOGY Adjusted net interest income — A non-GAAP measure that represents net interest income attributable to our Card Member loans and loans HFS (which includes, on a GAAP basis, interest that is deemed uncollectible), excluding the impact of interest expense and interest income not attributable to our Card Member loans. We believe adjusted net interest income is useful to investors because it is a component of net interest yield on Card Member loans. Asset securitizations — Asset securitization involves the transfer and sale of loans or receivables to a special-purpose entity created for the securitization activity, typically a trust. The trust, in turn, issues securities, commonly referred to as asset-backed securities that are secured by the transferred loans and receivables. The trust uses the proceeds from the sale of such securities to pay the purchase price for the underlying loans or receivables. The loans and receivables of our Lending Trust and Charge Trust securitized are reported as assets and the securities issued by the Trusts are reported as liabilities on our “Consolidated Balance Sheets.” Average discount rate — This calculation is generally designed to reflect pricing at merchants accepting general-purpose American Express cards. It represents the percentage of billed business (generated from both proprietary and GNS Card Member spending) retained by us from merchants we acquire, or for merchants acquired by a third party on our behalf, net of amounts retained by such third party. Basic cards-in-force — Proprietary basic consumer cards-in-force includes basic cards issued to the primary account owner, (i.e., not including additional supplemental cards issued on accounts). Proprietary basic small business and corporate cards-in-force includes both basic and supplemental cards issued. Non-proprietary basic cards-in-force includes cards that are issued and outstanding under network partnership agreements, except for supplemental cards and retail cobrand Card Member accounts which have had no out-of-store spending activity during the prior twelve-month period. Billed business — Includes activities (including cash advances) related to proprietary cards, cards issued under network partnership agreements (non-proprietary billed business), corporate payment services and certain insurance fees charged on proprietary cards. In-store spending activity within retail cobrand portfolios in GNS, from which we earn no revenue, is not included in non-proprietary billed business. Card billed business is included in the United States or outside the United States based on where the issuer is located. Capital ratios — Represents the minimum standards established by the regulatory agencies as a measure to determine whether the regulated entity has sufficient capital to absorb on- and off-balance sheet losses beyond current loss accrual estimates. Refer to the Capital Strategy section under “Consolidated Capital Resources and Liquidity” for further related definitions under Transitional Basel III and Fully Phased-in Basel III. Card Member — The individual holder of an issued American Express-branded charge, credit and certain prepaid cards. Card Member loans — Represents the outstanding amount due from Card Members for charges made on their American Express credit cards, as well as any interest charges and card-related fees. Card Member loans also include revolving balances on certain American Express charge card products. Card Member loans and receivables HFS — Beginning as of December 1, 2015 and continuing until the sales were completed, represents Card Member loans and receivables related to our cobrand partnerships with Costco in the United States and JetBlue. The JetBlue and Costco portfolio sales were completed on March 18 and June 17, 2016, respectively. Card Member receivables — Represents the outstanding amount due from Card Members for charges made on their American Express charge cards, as well as any card-related fees. Charge cards — Represents cards that generally carry no pre-set spending limits and are primarily designed as a method of payment and not as a means of financing purchases. Charge Card Members generally must pay the full amount billed each month. No finance charges are assessed on charge cards. Each charge card transaction is authorized based on its likely economics reflecting a Card Member’s most recent credit information and spend patterns. Some charge card accounts have additional Pay Over Time feature(s) that allow revolving of certain balances. Cobrand cards — Cards issued under cobrand agreements with selected commercial firms. Pursuant to the cobrand agreements, we make payments to our cobrand partners, which can be significant, based primarily on the amount of Card Member spending and corresponding rewards earned on such spending and, under certain arrangements, on the number of accounts acquired and retained. In some cases, the partner is liable for providing rewards to the Card Member under the cobrand partner’s own loyalty program. Credit cards — Represents cards that have a range of revolving payment terms, grace periods, and rate and fee structures. 70 Table of Contents Discount revenue — Represents revenue earned from fees generally charged to merchants who have entered into a card acceptance agreement. The discount fee generally is deducted from our payment for Card Member purchases. Discount revenue is reduced by incentive payments made to merchants, payments to third-party card issuing partners, cash-back reward costs and statement credits, corporate incentive payments and other similar items. Interest expense — Includes interest incurred primarily to fund Card Member loans and receivables, general corporate purposes and liquidity needs, and is recognized as incurred. Interest expense is divided principally into two categories: (i) deposits, which primarily relates to interest expense on deposits taken from customers and institutions, and (ii) debt, which primarily relates to interest expense on our long-term financing and short-term borrowings, (e.g., commercial paper, federal funds purchased, bank overdrafts and other short-term borrowings), as well as the realized impact of derivatives hedging interest rate risk on our long-term debt. Interest income — Includes (i) interest on loans, (ii) interest and dividends on investment securities and (iii) interest income on deposits with banks and other. Interest on loans — Assessed using the average daily balance method for Card Member loans and loans HFS. Unless the loan is classified as non-accrual, interest is recognized based upon the principal amount outstanding in accordance with the terms of the applicable account agreement until the outstanding balance is paid or written off. Interest and dividends on investment securities — Primarily relates to our performing fixed-income securities. Interest income is recognized as earned using the effective interest method, which adjusts the yield for security premiums and discounts, fees and other payments, so a constant rate of return is recognized on the outstanding balance of the related investment security throughout its term. Amounts are recognized until securities are in default or when it is likely that future interest payments will not be made as scheduled. Interest income on deposits with banks and other — Recognized as earned, and primarily relates to the placement of cash in excess of near-term funding requirements in interest-bearing time deposits, overnight sweep accounts, and other interest-bearing demand and call accounts. Liquidity Coverage Ratio — Represents the minimum standards established by the regulatory agencies as a measure to determine whether the regulated entity has sufficient liquidity to meet liquidity needs in periods of financial and economic stress. Merchant acquisition — Represents our process of entering into agreements with merchants to accept American Express-branded cards. Net card fees — Represents the card membership fees earned during the period. These fees are recognized as revenue over the covered card membership period (typically one year), net of the provision for projected refunds for Card Membership cancellation and deferred acquisition costs. Net interest yield on Card Member loans — A non-GAAP measure that is computed by dividing adjusted net interest income by average loans, computed on an annualized basis. Reserves and net write-offs related to uncollectible interest are recorded through provisions for losses, and are thus not included in the net interest yield calculation. We believe net interest yield on Card Member loans is useful to investors because it provides a measure of profitability of our Card Member loan portfolio. Net loss ratio — Represents the ratio of GCP charge card write-offs, consisting of principal (resulting from authorized transactions) and fee components, less recoveries, on Card Member receivables expressed as a percentage of gross amounts billed to corporate Card Members. Net write-off rate — principal only — Represents the amount of proprietary consumer or small business Card Member loans or receivables written off, consisting of principal (resulting from authorized transactions), less recoveries, as a percentage of the average loan or receivables balance during the period. Net write-off rate — principal, interest and fees — Includes, in the calculation of the net write-off rate, amounts for interest and fees in addition to principal for Card Member loans and fees in addition to principal for Card Member receivables. Operating expenses — Represents salaries and employee benefits, professional services, occupancy and equipment, and other expenses. Return on average equity — Calculated by dividing one-year period net income by one-year average total shareholders’ equity. Return on average segment capital — Calculated by dividing one-year period segment income by one-year average segment capital. Segment capital — Represents the capital allocated to a segment based upon specific business operational needs, risk measures, and regulatory capital requirements. Total cards-in-force — Represents the total number of charge and credit cards that are issued and outstanding and accepted on our network. Non-proprietary cards-in-force includes all charge and credit cards that are issued and outstanding under network partnership agreements, except for retail cobrand Card Member accounts which have no out-of-store spending activity during the prior twelve-month period. 71 Table of Contents CAUTIONARY NOTE REGARDING FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS This report includes forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, which are subject to risks and uncertainties. The forward-looking statements, which address our expected business and financial performance, among other matters, contain words such as “believe,” “expect,” “estimate,” “anticipate,” “intend,” “plan,” “aim,” “will,” “may,” “should,” “could,” “would,” “likely,” and similar expressions. Readers are cautioned not to place undue reliance on these forward-looking statements, which speak only as of the date on which they are made. We undertake no obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statements. Factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from these forward-looking statements, include, but are not limited to, the following: • our ability to grow in the future, which will depend in part on the following: revenues growing consistently with current expectations, which could be impacted by, among other things, weakening economic conditions in the United States or internationally, a decline in consumer confidence impacting the willingness and ability of Card Members to sustain and grow spending, a further strengthening of the U.S. dollar, a greater erosion of the average discount rate than expected, a greater impact on discount revenue from cash back and cobrand partner and client incentive payments, more cautious spending by large and global corporate Card Members, lower spending on new cards acquired than estimated and our inability to capitalize on investment momentum, capabilities and efficiencies as we moderate marketing and promotion spend; our success in addressing competitive pressures and implementing strategies and business initiatives, including growing profitable spending from new and existing Card Members, increasing penetration among middle market and small business clients, expanding our international footprint and increasing merchant acceptance; the level of spend in bonus categories on rewards-based and/or cash-back cards and redemptions of Card Member rewards and offers; the impact of any future restructuring charges or other contingencies, including, but not limited to, litigation-related settlements, judgments or expenses, impairments, the imposition of fines or civil money penalties, an increase in Card Member reimbursements and changes in reserves; write-downs of deferred tax assets as a result of tax law or other changes; credit performance remaining consistent with current expectations; continued growth of Card Member loans; the ability to continue to realize benefits from restructuring actions and operating leverage at levels consistent with current expectations; the amount we spend on growth initiatives and our ability to drive growth from such investments; changes in interest rates beyond current expectations (including the impact of hedge ineffectiveness); the impact of regulation and litigation, which could affect the profitability of our business activities, limit our ability to pursue business opportunities, require changes to business practices or alter our relationships with partners, merchants and Card Members; our tax rate remaining in line with current expectations, which could be impacted by, among other things, our geographic mix of income being weighted more to higher tax jurisdictions than expected, changes in tax laws and regulation and unfavorable tax audits and other unanticipated tax items; the impact of accounting changes and reclassifications; and our ability to continue executing the share repurchase program; • changes in the substantial and increasing worldwide competition in the payments industry, including competitive pressure that may impact the prices we charge merchants that accept our cards, competition for cobrand relationships and the success of marketing, promotion or rewards programs; • the actual amount to be spent on marketing and promotion, as well as the timing of any such spending, which will be based in part on management’s assessment of competitive opportunities; overall business performance; contractual obligations with business partners and other fixed costs and prior commitments; management’s ability to identify attractive investment opportunities and make such investments, which could be impacted by business, regulatory or legal complexities; and our ability to realize efficiencies, optimize investment spending and control expenses to fund such spending; • rewards expense and cost of Card Member services growing faster or slower than expectations, which will depend in part on Card Member behavior as it relates to their spending patterns and actual usage and redemption of rewards, as well as the degree of interest of Card Members in the value proposition we offer; increasing competition, which could result in greater rewards offerings; our ability to enhance card products and services to make them attractive to Card Members; and the amount we spend on the promotion of enhanced services and rewards categories and the success of such promotion; • our ability to reduce our overall cost base, which will depend in part on the timing and financial impact of reengineering plans, which could be impacted by factors such as our inability to mitigate the operational and other risks posed by potential staff reductions, our inability to develop and implement technology resources to realize cost savings and underestimating hiring and other employee needs; our ability to reduce annual operating expenses, which could be impacted by, among other things, the factors identified below; and our ability to optimize and lower marketing and promotion expenses, which could be impacted by higher advertising and Card Member acquisition costs, competitive pressures that may require additional expenditures or limit our ability to reduce costs, an inability to shift acquisition to digital channels, the availability of opportunities to invest at a higher level due to favorable business results and changes in macroeconomic conditions; • the ability to reduce annual operating expenses, which could be impacted by the need to increase significant categories of operating expenses, such as consulting or professional fees, including as a result of increased litigation, compliance or regulatory-related costs, or fraud costs; our ability to develop, implement and achieve substantial benefits from reengineering plans; higher than expected employee levels; the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates on costs; the payment of civil money penalties, disgorgement, restitution, non-income tax assessments and litigation-related settlements; impairments of goodwill or other assets; management’s decision to increase or decrease spending in such areas as technology, business and product development and sales forces depending on overall business performance; greater than expected inflation or merit increases; our ability to balance expense control and investments in the business; the impact of accounting changes and reclassifications; and the level of M&A activity and related expenses; 72 Table of Contents • our lending delinquency and write-off rates and growth of provision expense being higher than current expectations, which will depend in part on changes in the level of loan balances, delinquency rates, mix of loan balances, loans related to new Card Members and other borrowers performing as expected, unemployment rates, the volume of bankruptcies and recoveries of previously written-off loans; • our ability to execute against our lending strategy to grow loans, which may be affected by increasing competition, brand perceptions and reputation, our ability to manage risk in a growing Card Member loan portfolio, and the behavior of Card Members and their actual spending and borrowing patterns, which in turn may be driven by our ability to issue new and enhanced card products, offer attractive non-card lending products, capture a greater share of existing Card Members’ spending and borrowings, reduce Card Member attrition and attract new customers; • the possibility that we will not fully execute on our plans for OptBlue to significantly increase merchant coverage, which will depend in part on the success of OptBlue merchant acquirers in signing merchants to accept American Express, which could be impacted by the pricing set by the merchant acquirers, the value proposition offered to small merchants and the efforts of OptBlue merchant acquirers to sign merchants for American Express acceptance, as well as the awareness and willingness of Card Members to use American Express cards at small merchants and of those merchants to accept American Express cards; • changes affecting our ability or desire to return capital to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases, which will depend on factors such as approval of our capital plans by our primary regulators, the amount we spend on acquisitions of companies and our results of operations and capital needs in any given period; • changes in global economic and business conditions, consumer and business spending, the availability and cost of capital, unemployment rates, geopolitical conditions (including potential impacts resulting from the U.S. Administration and the proposed exit of the United Kingdom from the European Union), foreign currency rates and interest rates, all of which may significantly affect demand for and spending on American Express cards, delinquency rates, loan balances and other aspects of our business and results of operations; • changes in capital and credit market conditions, including sovereign creditworthiness, which may significantly affect our ability to meet our liquidity needs, expectations regarding capital and liquidity ratios, access to capital and cost of capital, including changes in interest rates; changes in market conditions affecting the valuation of our assets; or any reduction in our credit ratings or those of our subsidiaries, which could materially increase the cost and other terms of our funding, restrict our access to the capital markets or result in contingent payments under contracts; • legal and regulatory developments, including with regard to actions by the CFPB and other regulators, broad payment system regulatory regimes and the stricter regulation of financial institutions, which could require us to make fundamental changes to many of our business practices; result in increased costs related to regulatory oversight, litigation-related settlements, judgments or expenses, restitution to Card Members or the imposition of fines or civil money penalties; materially affect our capital or liquidity requirements, results of operations or ability to pay dividends or repurchase our stock; result in harm to the American Express brand; potential actions by the FDIC and credit rating agencies applicable to securitization trusts, which could impact our asset securitization program; or potential changes to the taxation of our businesses, the allowance of deductions for significant expenses, or the incidence of consumption taxes on our transactions, products and services; • changes in the financial condition and creditworthiness of our business partners, such as bankruptcies, restructurings or consolidations, including merchants that represent a significant portion of our business, such as the airline industry, or our partners in GNS or financial institutions that we rely on for routine funding and liquidity, which could materially affect our financial condition or results of operations; and • factors beyond our control such as fire, power loss, disruptions in telecommunications, severe weather conditions, natural disasters, health pandemics, terrorism, cyberattacks or fraud, which could significantly affect demand for and spending on American Express cards, delinquency rates, loan balances and results of operations or disrupt our global network systems and ability to process transactions. A further description of these uncertainties and other risks can be found in “Risk Factors” above and our other reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. 73 Table of Contents ITEM 7A.
