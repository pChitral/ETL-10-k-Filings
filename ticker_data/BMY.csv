14272,BMY,BRISTOL MYERS SQUIBB CO,2001,"Item 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS. Summary In September 2000, the Company announced the planned divestitures of the Zimmer and Clairol businesses. Accordingly, their results have been reported as discontinued operations and excluded from consolidated sales and expenses for all years. In February 2001, the Company announced its intention to separate the Zimmer business in a tax-free spin-off to shareholders. This transaction is expected to be completed by the end of the third quarter of 2001. In 2000, Bristol-Myers Squibb reported $18.2 billion in annual global sales, an increase of 8% (11% excluding foreign exchange) over 1999. Domestic sales, representing 67% of worldwide sales, increased 14% to $12.1 billion, while international sales decreased 2% (a 5% increase excluding foreign exchange) to $6.1 billion. Sales growth resulted from an 8% increase due to volume, a 3% increase from changes in selling prices and a 3% decrease due to exchange rate fluctuations. Total Company sales including discontinued operations increased 5% (8% excluding foreign exchange) to $21.3 billion. The Company's most important product lines made significant contributions to the Company's sales growth, many of which experienced double-digit growth on a worldwide basis. Three products, PRAVACHOL*, TAXOL* (paclitaxel) and GLUCOPHAGE, each exceeded $1.5 billion in annual sales, while five additional products exceeded $500 million in annual sales. Bristol-Myers Squibb had 54 product lines with more than $50 million in annual sales, including 31 with more than $100 million in annual sales. Total Company earnings (continuing and discontinued operations) before income taxes increased 12% to $6.5 billion from $5.8 billion in 1999. Net earnings increased 13% to $4.7 billion; basic and diluted earnings per share increased 14% to $2.40 and 15% to $2.36, respectively. Earnings from continuing operations before income taxes, excluding restructuring charges and gain on sales of businesses, increased 13% to $5.8 billion in 2000. Net earnings, on this basis, increased 14% to $4.3 billion; basic and diluted earnings per share increased 15% to $2.19 and 16% to $2.16, respectively. Over the past five years, net earnings and diluted earnings per share from continuing operations, excluding gains from sales of businesses and restructuring and special charges, have increased at a compound annual growth rate of 14%. This growth rate enabled the Company to achieve its goal of doubling 1993 earnings and earnings per share by the end of 2000. In 2000, consistent with the Company's mission to extend and enhance human life and to develop the highest quality products, the Company invested more than $1.9 billion in research and development, a 10% increase over the prior year. Research and development expenditure dedicated to pharmaceutical products increased 14% over 1999 with a compound annualized rate of 14% over the past five years. This significant investment has led to the discovery of innovative new products and the development of new indications for existing products leading, in 2000, to eight regulatory approvals and the filing of three dossiers in the US Notable approvals included GLUCOVANCE, a new oral combination drug, and GLUCOPHAGE XR Extended Release Tablets, a once-daily version of GLUCOPHAGE, both for diabetes; VANIQA*, a topical treatment for unwanted facial hair in women; and VIDEX* EC, a once-a-day, easier-to-digest, enteric-coated form of VIDEX* for HIV/AIDS. Also in 2000, the Company announced a number of research alliances, collaborations and commercialization agreements with other companies, including a global agreement (excluding Japan) with Novartis AG to codevelop and copromote tegaserod, Novartis's new investigational drug treatment for irritable bowel syndrome; and a drug discovery alliance in the field of genomics with 3-Dimensional Pharmaceuticals, Inc., under which the Company will receive worldwide rights to compounds discovered or developed through the collaboration. This agreement is one of more than a dozen major genomics agreements the Company has entered into over the past three years. _____________________________________________________________________________________________ 20 Bristol-Myers Squibb's financial position remains strong. At December 31, 2000, the Company held almost $3.4 billion in cash, time deposits and marketable securities. Cash provided by operating activities reached $4.7 billion, the highest in the past 10 years. Returns to shareholders included dividend distributions of $1.9 billion and stock repurchases of $2.3 billion. Dividends per common share were $.98 in 2000, increasing from $.86 per share paid in 1999. In December 2000, the Company announced a dividend increase, the 29th consecutive year that dividends have increased. The 2001 indicated annual payment is $1.10 per common share, a 12% increase over 2000. As further evidence of its strong financial position, Bristol-Myers Squibb is one of only seven US industrial companies to receive a triple-A credit rating from both Moody's and Standard & Poor's. Net Sales Sales increased 8% in 2000 to $18.2 billion, compared with increases of 12% and 10% in 1999 and 1998, respectively. The consolidated sales growth in 2000 resulted from an 8% increase due to volume, a 3% increase due to changes in selling prices and a 3% decrease due to foreign exchange rate fluctuations. In 1999, the 12% increase in sales reflected an 11% increase due to volume, a 2% increase due to changes in selling prices and a 1% decrease due to foreign exchange rate fluctuations. In 1998, the 10% increase in sales reflected an 11% increase due to volume, a 2% increase due to changes in selling prices and a 3% decrease due to foreign exchange rate fluctuations. Domestic sales increased 14% in 2000 and 19% in 1999, while international sales decreased 2% in 2000 (a 5% increase excluding foreign exchange) and increased 2% in 1999 (5% excluding foreign exchange). In general, the business of the Company is not seasonal. In 2000, worldwide pharmaceutical sales increased 11% with US pharmaceutical sales up 18% over the prior year. Key pharmaceutical product sales include: Sales of PRAVACHOL*, a cholesterol-lowering agent and the Company's largest selling product, increased 7% to $1,817 million primarily as a result of an increase in retail prescriptions. Domestic sales increased 9% to $1,127 million, while international sales increased 3% (14% excluding foreign exchange) to $690 million. GLUCOPHAGE sales increased 32% to $1,732 million. GLUCOPHAGE, the leading branded oral medication for treatment of non-insulin dependent (type 2) diabetes, had a market share of 33.4% in 2000, up from 31.3% in the prior year. The marketing exclusivity for GLUCOPHAGE expired in September 2000; however, no generic competition existed at the end of the year. During the year, the Company received FDA approval for GLUCOVANCE, an important advance in diabetes treatment, and for GLUCOPHAGE XR Extended Release tablets, a once-daily version of GLUCOPHAGE. Sales of GLUCOVANCE and GLUCOPHAGE XR since their launches were $110 million and $50 million, respectively. Sales of TAXOL*, the Company's leading anticancer agent, increased 7% to $1,592 million as the product continued to benefit from increased use in ovarian, breast and non-small cell lung cancer following standard chemotherapy. Generic paclitaxel became available in the US during the third quarter of 2000. Sales of PLAVIX, an anti-platelet medication, increased 65% to $903 million. Results of the landmark CURE trial (Clopidogrel in Unstable Angina to Prevent Recurrent Ischemic Events), jointly sponsored by the company and Sanofi-Synthelabo, were announced in March 2001. In this international trial of more than 12,500 patients with acute coronary syndromes (unstable angina or non-Q wave myocardial infarction), PLAVIX was significantly superior to standard therapies, including aspirin, in reducing a cluster of clinical events: heart attack, stroke and cardiovascular death. Sales of AVAPRO, an angiotensin II receptor blocker for the treatment of hypertension, increased 49% to $381 million. AVAPRO and PLAVIX are cardiovascular products that were launched from the Bristol-Myers Squibb and Sanofi-Synthelabo joint venture. _____________________________________________________________________________________________ 21 Sales of BUSPAR*, the Company's novel antianxiety agent, increased 17% to $709 million. The US anxiolytic use patent expired in June 2000. The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) granted the company an additional six months exclusivity based on its performance of pediatric studies. In November 2000, the Company received a patent covering the anxiolytic use of a BUSPAR* metabolite, a compound produced in the body by the oral administration of BUSPAR* and buspirone itself. The patent was subsequently de-listed during the course of litigation brought by generic manufacturers. On March 28, 2001, three generic manufacturers received final approval from the FDA for their respective Abbreviated New Drug Applications (ANDAs) for buspirone. Each of these three ANDAs covers a separate dosage strength of buspirone. FDA approvals of additional ANDAs for buspirone (of any dosage strength) can occur at any time beginning in September 2001. The litigation is on-going. Sales of SERZONE*, a novel antidepressant, increased 8% to $360 million. Sales of PARAPLATIN*, which is used in combination therapy for the treatment of ovarian cancer, increased 15% to $690 million. Sales of MEGACE* O/S, indicated for the treatment of anorexia and cachexia in patients with AIDS, increased 58% to $180 million. Sales of MAXIPIME*, a fourth-generation injectable cephalosporin antibiotic, increased 10% to $146 million. Sales of TEQUIN*, a quinolone antibiotic launched in December 1999, were $131 million. In November 2000, TEQUIN* became the first quinolone antibiotic to be prescribed for more than one million patients in the US after just 10 months on the market. Sales of DOVONEX*, an adult dermatological treatment, increased 20% from the prior year to $121 million. Sales of IFEX*, used in combination chemotherapy treatment, increased 23% to $108 million. Sales of captopril, an ACE inhibitor sold primarily under the trademark CAPOTEN*, declined 26% to $356 million due to generic competition. Sales from the Oncology Therapeutics Network, a specialty distributor of anticancer medicines and related products, were $1,080 million for the year, an increase of 21% over 1999. Nonpharmaceutical sales included sales of BUFFERIN*, which increased 10% (5% excluding foreign exchange) to $161 million due to increased sales in Japan, while sales of EFFERALGAN*, an effervescent analgesic sold primarily in France, increased 4% (20% excluding foreign exchange) to $172 million. Total infant formula sales decreased 2% to $1,212 million. Sales of ENFAMIL*, the Company's largest selling infant formula, remained at prior year levels of $732 million worldwide. Sales of ostomy products decreased 5% (a 1% increase excluding foreign exchange) to $428 million while sales of wound care products decreased 3% (a 3% increase excluding foreign exchange) to $232 million. _____________________________________________________________________________________________ 22 Earnings In 2000, earnings from continuing operations before income taxes, excluding the nonrecurring items described below, increased 13% to $5,826 million from $5,158 million in 1999. Net earnings, on this basis, increased 14% to $4,309 million compared with $3,789 million in 1999. Basic earnings per share increased 15% to $2.19 from $1.91 in the prior year and diluted earnings per share increased 16% to $2.16 from $1.87. Net earnings margins increased to 23.7% in 2000 from 22.4% in 1999. In 1999, net earnings were $3,789 million, an 18% increase over 1998, excluding the nonrecurring items described below. On this basis, basic earnings per share and diluted earnings per share both increased 18% over 1998 and net earnings margins increased to 22.4% in 1999 from 21.4% in 1998. The Company recorded certain nonrecurring items (""nonrecurring items"") in 2000 to earnings of continuing operations, including the gain on sales of businesses (three pharmaceutical products - Estrace Cream, Ovcon 35 and Ovcon 50 as well as its Sea Breeze brand in Japan) of $160 million before taxes, $116 million after taxes or $.06 per diluted share; as well as restructuring charges of $508 million before taxes, $329 million after taxes or $.17 per diluted share, in connection with workforce reductions and asset write-downs related to the consolidation and closure of plants and facilities and other expenses. In 1998, the Company recorded certain nonrecurring items to earnings of continuing operations, including the gain on sales of businesses (Ban, A/S GEA and Hexachimie) of $201 million before taxes, $125 million after taxes or $.06 per diluted share; as well as restructuring charges of $157 million before taxes, $98 million after taxes or $.05 per diluted share in connection with asset write-downs and employee-related costs related to the consolidation and closure of plants and facilities. Also, in 1998, the Company recorded a special charge of $800 million before taxes, $495 million after taxes, or $.24 per diluted share, to augment the reserve for breast implant liability and for prescription drug pricing litigation, offset by expected insurance recoveries. The effective income tax rate on earnings from continuing operations before income taxes was 25.2% in 2000, compared with 26.5% in 1999, and 24.4% in 1998. The effective income tax rate on earnings from continuing operations before income taxes, excluding the nonrecurring items, was 26.0% in 2000, compared with 26.5% in 1999, and 26.8% in 1998. The effective income tax rate has decreased since 1998 due to increased income in lower tax jurisdictions. Total Company earnings (continuing and discontinued operations) before taxes increased 12% to $6,486 million from $5,767 million in 1999. Net earnings increased 13% to $4,711 million compared with $4,167 million in 1999. Basic earnings per share increased 14% to $2.40 from $2.10 in the prior year and diluted earnings per share increased 15% to $2.36 from $2.06. In 1999, net earnings were $4,167 million, an increase of 15% from $3,636 million in 1998, excluding the special charge. On this basis, basic earnings per share were $2.10 and diluted earnings per share were $2.06, both increasing 15% over 1998. Expenses Total costs and expenses, excluding the nonrecurring items, as a percentage of sales, improved over the past three years to 68.0% in 2000 compared with 69.4% in 1999, and 70.8% in 1998. Cost of products sold, as a percentage of sales, improved to 26.1% in 2000 from 26.9% in 1999, principally due to manufacturing efficiencies. In 1999, cost of products sold as a percentage of sales increased to 26.9%, compared with 25.9% in 1998, principally due to sales growth of lower margin products from the Oncology Therapeutics Network. _____________________________________________________________________________________________ 23 Advertising and promotion expenses increased 8% over the prior year to $1,672 million in 2000, primarily as a result of a direct-to-consumer campaign for PRAVACHOL* and launch spending for GLUCOVANCE and TEQUIN*. In 1999, advertising and promotion expenses increased 2% from 1998 to $1,549 million. As a percentage of sales, advertising and promotion expenses remained at prior year levels of 9.2% and decreased from 10.1% in 1998, reflecting an improvement in the effectiveness of the advertising and promotion spending. Marketing, selling and administrative expenses, as a percentage of sales, decreased to 21.2% in 2000 from 22.4% in 1999 and 24.5% in 1998. This decreasing trend is a result of slower rates of increase in marketing, sales force and general administrative expenses compared with revenue increases in the same period. The Company's investment in research and development totaled $1,939 million in 2000, an increase of 10% over 1999, and to 10.6% in 2000, as a percentage of sales, compared with 10.4% in 1999 and 10.0% in 1998. This spending level reflects the Company's commitment to research over a broad range of therapeutic areas and to clinical development of new products. Over the past five years, research and development expenses have increased at a compound annual growth rate of 11%. In 2000, research and development spending dedicated to pharmaceutical products increased 14%, and was 13.0% of pharmaceutical sales compared with 12.6% and 12.4% in 1999 and 1998, respectively. As described in the notes to the financial statements, in the first quarter of 2000, the Company completed the sale of three pharmaceutical products - Estrace Cream, Ovcon 35 and Ovcon 50 as well as its Sea Breeze brand in Japan. In 1999, the Company acquired CAL-C-TOSE*, a leading nutritional milk modifier product in Mexico. Also, in 1999, the Company completed the sale of Laboratori Guieu, SpA, an Italian-based gynecological, pediatric and dermatological products business. In 1998, the Company acquired Dong-A Biotech Co., Ltd., a marketer and distributor of pharmaceutical products in South Korea. Also, in 1998, the Company divested its Ban brand of anti-perspirants and deodorants; A/S GEA, a Denmark-based generic drug business; and Hexachimie, a specialty chemical manufacturer based in France. Discontinued Operations Clairol sales decreased 6% to $1,894 million. Domestic sales decreased 4% while international sales decreased 9% (8% excluding foreign exchange). In 1999, Clairol sales increased 4% to $2,020 million from $1,940 million in 1998. Zimmer sales increased 9% to $1,053 million, led by an increase in sales of knee joint replacements of 10% to $416 million, of hip replacements of 14% to $329 million and of fracture management products of 15% to $145 million. In 1999, Zimmer sales increased 5% to $963 million from $919 million in 1998. As described in the notes to the financial statements, in the third quarter of 2000, the Company completed the sale of Matrix Essentials, Inc. (Matrix), an affiliate of Clairol. Matrix sales for the first six months of 2000 were $168 million and were $361 million for the full year in 1999. As described in Note 2 to the financial statements, in 2000 and 1998 the Company recorded restructuring charges to discontinued operations of $34 million and $44 million before taxes, respectively, primarily in connection with workforce reductions. In 2000, the Company recorded a pretax gain of $402 million ($240 million after taxes) on the sale of Matrix. The gain is included in the gain on disposal of discontinued operations. As a result of the restructuring charges, net earnings from discontinued operations were $375 million in 2000 and $391 million in 1998. Net earnings from discontinued operations, excluding the restructuring charges, increased 5% to $397 million in 2000 and decreased 10% to $378 million in 1999. _____________________________________________________________________________________________ 24 Geographic Areas Bristol-Myers Squibb products are available in virtually every country in the world; the Company's largest markets are the US, France, Japan, Germany and Canada. Sales in the United States increased 14% in 2000. Products with strong growth in the region included GLUCOPHAGE, PLAVIX, BUSPAR*, PARAPLATIN* and AVAPRO. In 1999, sales in the United States increased 19%, primarily due to growth of GLUCOPHAGE, TAXOL*, ENFAMIL*, BUSPAR*, PLAVIX, PARAPLATIN* and AVAPRO. Sales in Europe, Mid-East and Africa decreased 9% in 2000. Sales increased 3%, excluding foreign exchange, as a result of growth in France due to increased sales of PRAVACHOL* and EFFERALGAN*, partially offset by decreased sales of CAPOTEN* due to generic competition; in Italy due to increased sales of TAXOL* and AVAPRO; and in Spain due to increased sales of PRAVACHOL*, AVAPRO and PLAVIX. Excluding foreign exchange, sales in Germany were 2% below prior year levels due to increased emphasis on generics and governmental spending controls. In 1999, sales in Europe, Mideast and Africa increased 2% (4% excluding foreign exchange), due to sales growth of products including PRAVACHOL*, TAXOL*, PLAVIX and AVAPRO. These increases were partially offset by decreases in sales of ostomy supplies and of CAPOTEN* due to generic competition. Sales in Other Western Hemisphere countries increased 3% (6% excluding foreign exchange) in 2000 primarily as a result of growth in Canada due to increased sales of PLAVIX, AVAPRO and ENFAMIL*, and in Mexico due to growth of ENFAMIL* and CAL-C-TOSE*. In 1999, sales in Other Western Hemisphere countries decreased 9% (a 3% increase excluding foreign exchange) primarily resulting from decreases in sales of CAPOTEN* and PRAVACHOL*, partially offset by growth in ENFAMIL*, AVAPRO and PLAVIX. Sales in the Pacific region increased 12% in 2000 (11% excluding foreign exchange). Products with strong growth included BUFFERIN*, TAXOL* and PARAPLATIN* in Japan and nutritional products in the Philippines and Thailand. In 1999, Pacific region sales increased 18% (10% excluding foreign exchange) as a result of increases in BUFFERIN*, TAXOL* and PARAPLATIN*. The favorable effect from foreign exchange was experienced primarily in Japan. Financial Instruments Cash and cash equivalents, time deposits and marketable securities totaled almost $3.4 billion at December 31, 2000 compared with $3.0 billion and $2.5 billion at December 31, 1999 and 1998, respectively. Working capital continued to improve with $4.2 billion at December 31, 2000, compared with $3.7 billion and $3.0 billion at December 31, 1999 and 1998, respectively. Cash and cash equivalents, time deposits and marketable securities, in addition to the conversion of other working capital items are expected to fund near-term operations of the Company. The Company is exposed to market risk due to changes in currency exchange rates. To reduce this risk, the Company enters into certain derivative financial instruments when available on a cost-effective basis to hedge its underlying economic exposure. These instruments also are managed on a consolidated basis to efficiently net exposures and thus take advantage of any natural offsets. Derivative financial instruments are not used for trading purposes. Gains and losses on hedging transactions are offset by gains and losses on the underlying exposures being hedged. _____________________________________________________________________________________________ 25 Foreign exchange option contracts and, to a lesser extent, forward contracts are used to hedge anticipated transactions. The Company's primary foreign currency exposures in relation to the US dollar are the euro, Mexican peso, Canadian dollar, Brazilian real and Japanese yen. The table below summarizes the Company's outstanding foreign exchange option contracts as of December 31, 2000. The fair value of option contracts, which changes over time, is estimated by using the Black-Scholes model and is based on year-end currency rates. The fair value of option contracts should be viewed in relation to the fair value of the underlying hedged transactions and the overall reduction in exposure to adverse fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates.

These contracts related primarily to option contracts with the right to sell euros, Mexican pesos and Canadian dollars. Other contracts at December 31, 1999 included right-to-buy option contracts, primarily to buy Japanese yen for US dollars. These contracts had an aggregate notional amount and fair value of $141 million and $20 million, respectively, and no carrying value. The Company maintains cash and cash equivalents, time deposits and marketable securities with various financial institutions. These financial institutions are located primarily in the US and Europe. Company policy is designed to limit exposure to any one financial institution. Recently Issued Accounting Standards In June 1998, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 133, Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities. This statement requires that companies recognize all derivatives as either assets or liabilities on the balance sheet and measure these instruments at fair value. In June 1999, the FASB issued SFAS No. 137, Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities - Deferral of the effective date of FASB Statement No. 133. This statement deferred the effective date of SFAS No. 133 to fiscal years beginning after June 15, 2000. In June 2000, the FASB issued SFAS No. 138, Accounting for Certain Derivative Instruments and Certain Hedging Activities, which made minor amendments to SFAS No. 133. The Company adopted SFAS No. 133, as amended, on January 1, 2001. The adoption of this accounting requirement will not have a material effect on either the Company's consolidated financial statements or hedging programs. _____________________________________________________________________________________________ 26 Euro Conversion On January 1, 1999, certain members of the European Union established fixed conversion rates between their existing currencies and the European Union's common currency, known as the euro. It is planned that by July 1, 2002 the participating countries will withdraw all currencies and use the euro exclusively. The Company has committed resources to conduct assessments and to take corrective actions to ensure it is prepared for the introduction of the euro. The Company is actively addressing the many areas involved with the introduction of the euro, including information management, finance, legal and tax. This review includes the conversion of information technology, business and financial systems; evaluation of currency risk; and the effect on the Company's financial instruments, as well as the impact on the pricing and distribution of Company products. The Company believes the effect of introduction of the euro, as well as any related cost of conversion, will not have a material impact on the results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. Financial Position Cash and cash equivalents, time deposits and marketable securities at December 31, 2000 were denominated primarily in US dollar instruments with near-term maturities. The average interest yield on cash and cash equivalents was 5.9% at December 31, 2000, while interest yields on time deposits and marketable securities averaged 5.7% at December 31, 2000. Short-term borrowings and long-term debt at December 31, 2000 are denominated primarily in US dollars but also include Japanese yen long-term debt of $272 million. During the year the Company reduced short-term borrowings by $247 million primarily as a result of the paydown of the international commercial paper program. Internally generated cash provided by operations was $4.7 billion in 2000, $4.2 billion in 1999 and $3.8 billion in 1998. Cash provided by operations continued to be the Company's primary source of funds to finance operating needs and expenditures for new plants and equipment. As part of the Company's ongoing commitment to improve plant efficiency and maintain superior research facilities, the Company has invested $2.1 billion in capital expansion over the past three years. Cash flow from operations also included product liability payments, net of insurance recoverable receipts of $73 million in 2000, $667 million in 1999 and $519 million in 1998. Cash provided by operations also was used over the past three years to pay dividends of $5.2 billion, to finance $5.3 billion of the Company's share repurchase program and to fund business acquisitions, including the purchase of patents and trademarks, at a cost of $555 million. The Company's share repurchase program authorizes the Company to purchase common stock from time to time in the open market or through private transactions as market conditions permit. _____________________________________________________________________________________________ 27 During 2000, the Company purchased 40 million shares of common stock at a cost of $2.3 billion, bringing the total shares acquired since the program's inception to 340 million. In September 2000, the Company announced a $2 billion increase in the stock repurchase program authorization. During the past three years, the Company has repurchased 93 million shares at a cost of $5.3 billion. Employment levels for continuing operations of 44,004 at December 2000 decreased from prior year levels of 45,955. Sales per employee improved to $414 thousand in 2000 from $367 thousand in 1999 and $324 thousand in 1998. Return on Stockholders' Equity, excluding nonrecurring items, improved over the last three years and was 48.3% in 2000, 46.7% in 1999 and 43.5% in 1998.
