27419,TGT,TARGET CORP,2014,"Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of OperationsExecutive SummaryFiscal 2013 included the following notable items:•GAAP earnings per share were $3.07, including dilution of $1.13 related to the Canadian Segment.•Adjusted earnings per share were $4.38 on a comparable sales decrease of 0.4 percent.•We paid dividends of $1,006 million and repurchased 21.9 million of our shares for $1,474 million.•We opened 124 stores in Canada, marking the biggest single-year store opening cycle in the Company's history and first year of international retail operations.•We completed the sale of our U.S. consumer credit card portfolio to TD in March 2013 and recognized a gain of $391 million.•We used $1.4 billion of the net proceeds received from the sale of our U.S. consumer credit card portfolio to repurchase, at market value, $970 million of debt.Sales were $72,596 million for 2013, an increase of $636 million or 0.9 percent from the prior year. Consolidated earnings before interest expense and income taxes for 2013 decreased by $1,142 million or 21.3 percent from 2012 to $4,229 million. Cash flow provided by operations was $6,520 million, $5,325 million and $5,434 million for 2013, 2012 and 2011, respectively. In connection with the sale of our U.S. credit card receivables, we received cash of $5.7 billion. Of this amount, $2.7 billion is included in cash flow provided by operations and $3.0 billion is included in cash flow provided by investing activities.Earnings Per Share Percent Change 20132012 (a)20112013/20122012/2011GAAP diluted earnings per share$3.07$4.52$4.28(32.1)%5.6%Adjustments1.310.240.13 Adjusted diluted earnings per share$4.38$4.76$4.41(8.0)%7.9%Note: We have disclosed adjusted diluted earnings per share (""Adjusted EPS""), a non-GAAP metric, which excludes the impact of certain matters not related to our routine retail operations, including the impact of our Canadian market entry. Management believes that Adjusted EPS is meaningful in order to provide period-to-period comparisons of our operating results. A reconciliation of non-GAAP financial measures to GAAP measures is provided on page 25.(a) Consisted of 53 weeks.16Data BreachDescription of Event As previously disclosed, we experienced a data breach in which an intruder stole certain payment card and other guest information from our network (the Data Breach). Based on our investigation to date, we believe that the intruder accessed and stole payment card data from approximately 40 million credit and debit card accounts of guests who shopped at our U.S. stores between November 27 and December 15, 2013, through malware installed on our point-of-sale system in our U.S. stores. On December 15, we removed the malware from virtually all registers in our U.S. stores. Payment card data used in transactions made by 56 additional guests in the period between December 16 and December 17 was stolen prior to our disabling malware on one additional register that was disconnected from our system when we completed the initial malware removal on December 15. In addition, the intruder stole certain guest information, including names, mailing addresses, phone numbers or email addresses, for up to 70 million individuals. Our investigation of the matter is ongoing, and we are supporting law enforcement efforts to identify the responsible parties.Expenses Incurred and Amounts Accrued In the fourth quarter of 2013, we recorded $61 million of pretax Data Breach-related expenses, and expected insurance proceeds of $44 million, for net expenses of $17 million ($11 million after tax), or $0.02 per diluted share. These expenses were included in our Consolidated Statements of Operations as Selling, General and Administrative Expenses (SG&A), but were not part of our segment results. Expenses include costs to investigate the Data Breach, provide credit-monitoring services to our guests, increase staffing in our call centers, and procure legal and other professional services. The $61 million of fourth quarter expenses also includes an accrual related to the expected payment card networks’ claims by reason of the Data Breach. The ultimate amount of these claims will likely include amounts for incremental counterfeit fraud losses and non-ordinary course operating expenses (such as card reissuance costs) that the payment card networks believe they or their issuing banks have incurred. In order for us to have liability for such claims, we believe that a court would have to find among other things that (1) at the time of the Data Breach the portion of our network that handles payment card data was noncompliant with applicable data security standards in a manner that contributed to the Data Breach, and (2) the network operating rules around reimbursement of operating costs and counterfeit fraud losses are enforceable. While an independent third-party assessor found the portion of our network that handles payment card data to be compliant with applicable data security standards in the fall of 2013, we expect the forensic investigator working on behalf of the payment card networks nonetheless to claim that we were not in compliance with those standards at the time of the Data Breach. We base that expectation on our understanding that, in cases like ours where prior to a data breach the entity suffering the breach had been found by an independent third-party assessor to be fully compliant with those standards, the network-approved forensic investigator nonetheless regularly claims that the breached entity was not in fact compliant with those standards. As a result, we believe it is probable that the payment card networks will make claims against us. We expect to dispute the payment card networks’ anticipated claims, and we think it is likely that our disputes would lead to settlement negotiations consistent with the experience of other entities that have suffered similar payment card breaches. We believe such negotiations would effect a combined settlement of both the payment card networks' counterfeit fraud loss allegations and their non-ordinary course operating expense allegations. We based our year-end accrual on the expectation of reaching negotiated settlements of the payment card networks’ anticipated claims and not on any determination that it is probable we would be found liable on these claims were they to be litigated. Currently, we can only reasonably estimate a loss associated with settlements of the networks' expected claims for non-ordinary course operating expenses. The year-end accrual does not include any amounts associated with the networks' expected claims for alleged incremental counterfeit fraud losses because the loss associated with settling such claims, while probable in our judgment, is not reasonably estimable, in part because we have not yet received third-party fraud reporting from the payment card networks. We are not able to reasonably estimate a range of possible losses in excess of the year-end accrual related to the expected settlement of the payment card networks’ claims because the investigation into the matter is ongoing and there are significant factual and legal issues to be resolved. We believe that the ultimate amount paid on payment card network claims could be material to our results of operations in future periods.17Litigation and Governmental InvestigationsIn addition, more than 80 actions have been filed in courts in many states and other claims have been or may be asserted against us on behalf of guests, payment card issuing banks, shareholders or others seeking damages or other related relief, allegedly arising out of the Data Breach. State and federal agencies, including the State Attorneys General, the Federal Trade Commission and the SEC are investigating events related to the Data Breach, including how it occurred, its consequences and our responses. Although we are cooperating in these investigations, we may be subject to fines or other obligations, which may have an adverse effect on how we operate our business and our results of operations. While a loss from these matters is reasonably possible, we cannot reasonably estimate a range of possible losses because our investigation into the matter is ongoing, the proceedings remain in the early stages, alleged damages have not been specified, there is uncertainty as to the likelihood of a class or classes being certified or the ultimate size of any class if certified, and there are significant factual and legal issues to be resolved. Further, we do not believe that a loss from these matters is probable; therefore, we have not recorded a loss contingency liability for litigation, claims and governmental investigations in the fourth quarter. See Note 17 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data. Future CostsWe expect to incur significant investigation, legal and professional services expenses associated with the Data Breach in future periods. We will recognize these expenses as services are received. We also expect to incur additional expenses associated with incremental fraud and reissuance costs on Target REDcards.Insurance CoverageTo limit our exposure to Data Breach losses, we maintain $100 million of network-security insurance coverage, above a $10 million deductible. This coverage and certain other insurance coverage may reduce our exposure. We will pursue recoveries to the maximum extent available under the policies. As of February 1, 2014, we have recorded a $44 million receivable for costs we believe are reimbursable and probable of recovery under our insurance coverage, which partially offsets the $61 million of expense relating to the Data Breach.Future Capital InvestmentsWe plan to accelerate a previously planned investment of approximately $100 million to equip our proprietary REDcards and all of our U.S. store card readers with chip-enabled smart-card technology by the first quarter of 2015. In addition, we may accelerate or make additional investments in our information technology systems, but we are unable to estimate such investments because the nature and scope has not yet been determined. We do not expect such amounts to be material to any fiscal period.Effect on Sales and Guest LoyaltyWe believe the Data Breach adversely affected our fourth quarter U.S. Segment sales. Prior to our December 19, 2013 announcement of the Data Breach, our U.S. Segment fourth quarter comparable sales were positive, followed by meaningfully negative comparable sales results following the announcement. Comparable sales began to recover in January 2014. The collective interaction of year-over-year changes in the retail calendar (e.g., the number of days between Thanksgiving and Christmas), combined with the broad array of competitive, consumer behavioral and weather factors makes any quantification of the precise impact of the Data Breach on sales infeasible.Fourth quarter sales penetration on our REDcards was 20.9 percent, up 5.4 percentage points from 2012. While the rate of increase slowed following the Data Breach, year-over-year penetration continued to grow.We know our guests' confidence in Target and the broader U.S. payment system has been shaken. We are committed to, and actively engaged in, activities to restore their confidence. We cannot predict the length or extent of any ongoing impact to sales. Credit Card Receivables TransactionIn March 2013, we sold our entire U.S. consumer credit card portfolio to TD and recognized a gain of $391 million. This transaction was accounted for as a sale, and the receivables are no longer reported in our Consolidated Statements of Financial Position. Consideration received included cash of $5.7 billion, equal to the gross (par) value of the 18outstanding receivables at the time of closing, and a $225 million beneficial interest asset. The beneficial interest asset effectively represents a receivable for the present value of future profit-sharing we expect to receive on the receivables sold. Based on historical payment patterns, we estimate that the beneficial interest asset will be reduced over a four-year period following the sale, with larger reductions in the early years. As of February 1, 2014, a $127 million beneficial interest asset remained. Concurrent with the sale of the portfolio, we repaid the nonrecourse debt collateralized by credit card receivables (2006/2007 Series Variable Funding Certificate) at par of $1.5 billion, resulting in net cash proceeds of $4.2 billion. TD now underwrites, funds and owns Target Credit Card and Target Visa consumer receivables in the U.S. TD controls risk management policies and oversees regulatory compliance, and we perform account servicing and primary marketing functions. We earn a substantial portion of the profits generated by the Target Credit Card and Target Visa portfolios. Income from the TD profit-sharing arrangement and our related account servicing expenses are classified within SG&A expenses in the U.S. Segment.Beginning with the first quarter of 2013, we no longer report a U.S. Credit Card Segment.Analysis of Results of OperationsU.S. SegmentU.S. Segment Results Percent Change(dollars in millions)20132012 (a)20112013/20122012/2011Sales$71,279$71,960$68,466(0.9)%5.1 %Cost of sales50,03950,56847,860(1.0)5.7Gross margin21,24021,39220,606(0.7)3.8SG&A expenses (b)14,28513,75913,0793.85.2EBITDA6,9557,6337,527(8.9)1.4Depreciation and amortization1,9962,0442,084(2.4)(1.9)EBIT$4,959$5,589$5,443(11.3)%2.7 %Note: Prior period segment results have been revised to reflect the combination of our historical U.S. Retail Segment and U.S. Credit Card Segment into one U.S. Segment.

Compared with the historical U.S. Retail Segment results for the same period, segment results, as revised, reflect lower SG&A rates and increased EBIT and EBITDA margin rates resulting from the inclusion of credit card profits, net of expenses, within SG&A compared with historical U.S. Segment results for the same period.SalesSales include merchandise sales, net of expected returns, and gift card breakage. Refer to Note 2 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for a definition of gift card breakage. The decrease in sales in 2013 reflects the impact of an additional week in 2012 and a decline in comparable sales, partially offset by the contribution from new stores. Sales growth in 2012 resulted from higher comparable sales, the contribution from new stores and a 1.7 percentage point benefit from an additional week in the fiscal year. Inflation did not materially affect sales in any period presented.Comparable sales is a measure that highlights the performance of our existing stores and digital sales by measuring the change in sales for a period over the comparable, prior-year period of equivalent length. The method of calculating comparable sales varies across the retail industry. As a result, our comparable sales calculation is not necessarily comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies. Comparable sales include all sales, except sales from stores open less than thirteen months.Comparable Sales201320122011Comparable sales change(0.4)%2.7%3.0%Drivers of change in comparable sales: Number of transactions(2.7)%0.5%0.4%Average transaction amount2.3 %2.3%2.6%Selling price per unit1.6 %1.3%0.3%Units per transaction0.7 %1.0%2.3%U.S. Sales by Product CategoryPercentage of Sales 201320122011Household essentials (a)25%25%25%Hardlines (b)181819Apparel and accessories (c)191919Food and pet supplies (d)212019Home furnishings and décor (e)171818Total100%100%100%(a)Includes pharmacy, beauty, personal care, baby care, cleaning and paper products.(b)Includes electronics (including video game hardware and software), music, movies, books, computer software, sporting goods and toys.20(c)Includes apparel for women, men, boys, girls, toddlers, infants and newborns, as well as intimate apparel, jewelry, accessories and shoes.(d)Includes dry grocery, dairy, frozen food, beverages, candy, snacks, deli, bakery, meat, produce and pet supplies.(e)Includes furniture, lighting, kitchenware, small appliances, home décor, bed and bath, home improvement, automotive and seasonal merchandise such as patio furniture and holiday décor.The collective interaction of a broad array of macroeconomic, competitive and consumer behavioral factors, as well as sales mix, and transfer of sales to new stores makes further analysis of sales metrics infeasible.Credit is offered by TD to qualified guests through Target-branded credit cards: the Target Credit Card and the Target Visa Credit Card (Target Credit Cards). Additionally, we offer a branded proprietary Target Debit Card. Collectively, we refer to these products as REDcards®. Guests receive a 5 percent discount on virtually all purchases when they use a REDcard at Target. We monitor the percentage of sales that are paid for using REDcards (REDcard Penetration) because our internal analysis has indicated that a meaningful portion of incremental purchases on our REDcards are also incremental sales for Target.REDcard Penetration201320122011Target Credit Cards9.3%7.9%6.8%Target Debit Card9.95.72.5Total store REDcard Penetration19.3%13.6%9.3%Note: The sum of Target Credit Cards and Target Debit Card penetration may not equal Total store REDcard Penetration due to rounding.Gross Margin Rate Our gross margin rate was 29.8 percent in 2013, 29.7 percent in 2012 and 30.1 percent in 2011. The 2013 increase is primarily the result of a change in vendor contracts regarding payments received in support of marketing programs. Increases to the rate were offset by our integrated growth strategies of our 5 percent REDcard Rewards loyalty program and our store remodel program. The 2013 change to certain merchandise vendor contracts resulted in more vendor consideration being recognized as a reduction of our cost of sales rather than a reduction of SG&A. This change increased our gross margin rate for 2013, with an equal and offsetting increase in our SG&A rate, and has no impact on EBITDA or EBIT margin rates.21Selling, General and Administrative Expense Rate (a) Represents revised U.S. Segment results.Our SG&A expense rate was 20.0 percent in 2013, and 19.1 percent in both 2012 and 2011. The increase in 2013 resulted from a smaller contribution from our credit card portfolio, investments in technology and supply chain in support of multichannel initiatives, changes in merchandise vendor contracts described on the previous page, and other increases. Increases were partially offset by the benefit from our company-wide expense optimization efforts and favorable incentive compensation and store hourly payroll. During 2012, investments in technology and supply chain were offset by improvements in store hourly payroll and disciplined expense management across the Company.Store DataChange in Number of Stores20132012Beginning store count1,7781,763Opened1923Closed(4)(5)Relocated—(3)Ending store count1,7931,778Number of stores remodeled during the year100252Number of Stores andRetail Square FeetNumber of Stores Retail Square Feet (a)February 1, 2014February 2, 2013 February 1, 2014February 2, 2013Target general merchandise stores289391 33,84346,584Expanded food assortment stores1,2451,131 160,891146,249SuperTarget stores251251 44,50044,500CityTarget stores85 820514Total1,7931,778 240,054237,847(a) In thousands, reflects total square feet less office, distribution center and vacant space.22Canadian SegmentCanadian Segment Results Percent Change(dollars in millions)2013201220112013/20122012/2011Sales$1,317$—$—n/an/aCost of sales1,121——n/an/aGross margin196——n/an/aSG&A expenses 91027274234.9268.7EBITDA(714)(272)(74)162.6268.7Depreciation and amortization2279748133.6103.2EBIT$(941)$(369)$(122)155.0%203.5%Canadian Segment Rate Analysis2013Gross margin rate14.9 %SG&A expense rate69.1EBITDA margin rate(54.2)Depreciation and amortization expense rate17.3EBIT margin rate(71.5)Note: Rate analysis metrics are computed by dividing the applicable amount by sales.Due to the start-up nature of our Canadian Segment, the rates above may not be indicative of future results.SalesSales include merchandise sales, net of expected returns, and gift card breakage. Refer to Note 2 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for a definition of gift card breakage. We opened 124 Canadian Target general merchandise stores during 2013 with 14.2 million total retail square feet. Canadian sales of $1,317 million represent a partial year of operation, with approximately 55 percent of the stores opened during the first half of the year, 20 percent during the third quarter and the remaining 25 percent during the fourth quarter.Credit is offered to guests by Royal Bank of Canada (RBC) through our co-branded credit card: the Target RBC MasterCard. Additionally, we offer a proprietary Target Debit Card. Consistent with our branded payment products in the U.S., these payment products are referred to as REDcards. Guests receive a 5 percent discount on virtually all purchases when they use a REDcard at Target.

Selling, General and Administrative Expense RateIn addition to operating expenses during 2013, our Canadian Segment SG&A expense for 2013, 2012 and 2011 included start-up costs including compensation, benefits and third-party service expenses. 23Other Performance FactorsConsolidated Selling, General and Administrative ExpensesIn addition to our selling, general and administrative expenses recorded within our segments, we recorded certain other expenses during 2013. These expenses included a $23 million workforce-reduction charge primarily related to severance and benefits costs, a $22 million charge related to part-time team member health benefit changes, $19 million in impairment charges related to certain parcels of undeveloped land, and $17 million of Data Breach-related costs, net of expected insurance proceeds. Additional information about these items is provided within the Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Financial Measures to GAAP Measures on page 25.Net Interest ExpenseNet interest expense was $1,126 million in 2013. This increase of 47.7 percent, or $364 million, from 2012 was due to a $445 million loss on early retirement of debt in 2013, partially offset by the benefit from 2013 debt reductions. Net interest expense was $762 million for 2012. This decrease of 12.0 percent, or $104 million, from 2011 was primarily due to an $87 million loss on early retirement of debt in 2011.Provision for Income TaxesOur effective income tax rate increased to 36.5 percent in 2013, from 34.9 percent in 2012, which was driven by the net effect of increased losses related to Canadian operations combined with a lower year-over-year benefit from the favorable resolution of various income tax matters. The resolution of various income tax matters reduced tax expense by $16 million and $58 million in 2013 and 2012, respectively. A tax rate reconciliation is provided in Note 21 to our Consolidated Financial Statements.Our effective income tax rate increased to 34.9 percent in 2012, from 34.3 percent in 2011, primarily due to a lower benefit associated with the favorable resolution of various income tax matters, combined with the effect of increased losses related to Canadian operations. Various income tax matters were resolved in 2012 and 2011 which reduced tax expense by $58 million and $85 million, respectively.24Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Financial Measures to GAAP MeasuresTo provide additional transparency, we have disclosed non-GAAP adjusted diluted earnings per share, which excludes the impact of our 2013 Canadian market entry, the gain on receivables transaction, favorable resolution of various income tax matters, the loss on early retirement of debt and other matters presented below. We believe this information is useful in providing period-to-period comparisons of the results of our U.S. operations. This measure is not in accordance with, or an alternative for, generally accepted accounting principles in the United States. The most comparable GAAP measure is diluted earnings per share. Non-GAAP adjusted EPS should not be considered in isolation or as a substitution for analysis of our results as reported under GAAP. Other companies may calculate non-GAAP adjusted EPS differently than we do, limiting the usefulness of the measure for comparisons with other companies. 2013 2012 2011(millions, except per share data) Pretax Net of Tax Per Share Amounts Pretax Net of Tax Per Share Amounts Pretax Net of Tax Per Share AmountsGAAP diluted earnings per share $3.07 $4.52 $4.28Adjustments Total Canadian losses (a) $1,018 $723 $1.13 $447 $315 $0.48 $166 $119 $0.17Loss on early retirement of debt 445 270 0.42 — — — 87 55 0.08Gain on receivables transaction (b) (391) (247) (0.38) (152) (97) (0.15) — — —Reduction of beneficial interest asset 98 61 0.09 — — — — — —Other (c) 64 40 0.06 — — — — — —Data Breach related costs, net of insurance receivable (d) 17 11 0.02 — — — — — —Resolution of income tax matters — (16) (0.03) — (58) (0.09) — (85) (0.12)Adjusted diluted earnings per share $4.38 $4.76 $4.41Note: A non-GAAP financial measures summary is provided on page 16. The sum of the non-GAAP adjustments may not equal the total adjustment amounts due to rounding.(a) Total Canadian losses include interest expense of $77 million, $78 million and $44 million for 2013, 2012 and 2011, respectively. (b) 2013 adjustment represents consideration received in the first quarter from the sale of our U.S. credit card receivables in excess of the recorded amount of the receivables. Consideration included a beneficial interest asset of $225 million. The 2012 adjustment represents the gain on receivables held for sale. (c) Other includes a $23 million workforce-reduction charge primarily related to severance and benefits costs, a $22 million charge related to part-time team member health benefit changes and $19 million in impairment charges related to certain parcels of undeveloped land.(d) For 2013, we recorded $61 million of pretax Data Breach-related expenses, and expected insurance proceeds of $44 million, for net pretax expenses of $17 million.Analysis of Financial ConditionLiquidity and Capital ResourcesOur period-end cash and cash equivalents balance was $695 million compared with $784 million in 2012. Short-term investments (highly liquid investments with an original maturity of three months or less from the time of purchase) of $3 million and $130 million were included in cash and cash equivalents at the end of 2013 and 2012, respectively. Our investment policy is designed to preserve principal and liquidity of our short-term investments. This policy allows investments in large money market funds or in highly rated direct short-term instruments that mature in 60 days or less. We also place dollar limits on our investments in individual funds or instruments.Cash FlowsOur 2013 operations were funded by both internally generated funds and proceeds from the sale of our consumer credit card receivables portfolio. Cash flow provided by operations was $6,520 million in 2013 compared with $5,325 million in 2012. Our cash flows, combined with our prior year-end cash position, allowed us to pay current debt maturities, invest in the business, pay dividends and repurchase shares under our share repurchase program.Concurrent with the sale of our U.S. credit card portfolio described in Note 6 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, we repaid the nonrecourse debt collateralized by credit card receivables (2006/2007 Series Variable Funding Certificate) at par of $1.5 billion. Also 25during the first quarter of 2013, we used $1.4 billion of the net proceeds received from the sale to repurchase, at market value, $970 million of debt. We have applied additional proceeds from the sale to reduce our debt and repurchase shares.Year-end inventory levels increased from $7,903 million in 2012 to $8,766 million in 2013, about half of which was for our 2013 Canadian market entry. Accounts payable increased by $627 million, or 8.9 percent over the same period.Share RepurchasesDuring the first quarter of 2012, we completed a $10 billion share repurchase program authorized by our Board of Directors in November 2007, and began repurchasing shares under a new $5 billion program authorized by our Board of Directors in January 2012. During 2013, we repurchased 21.9 million shares of our common stock for a total investment of $1,474 million ($67.41 per share). We did not repurchase any shares during the second half of 2013 due to our performance and desire to maintain our strong investment grade credit ratings. During 2012, we repurchased 32.2 million shares of our common stock for a total investment of $1,900 million ($58.96 per share).DividendsWe paid dividends totaling $1,006 million in 2013 and $869 million in 2012, for an increase of 15.8 percent. We declared dividends totaling $1,051 million ($1.65 per share) in 2013, for an increase of 16.4 percent over 2012. We declared dividends totaling $903 million ($1.38 per share) in 2012, an increase of 16.2 percent over 2011. We have paid dividends every quarter since our 1967 initial public offering, and it is our intent to continue to do so in the future.Short-term and Long-term FinancingOur financing strategy is to ensure liquidity and access to capital markets, to manage our net exposure to floating interest rate volatility and to maintain a balanced spectrum of debt maturities. Within these parameters, we seek to minimize our borrowing costs. Our ability to access the long-term debt and commercial paper markets has provided us with ample sources of liquidity. Our continued access to these markets depends on multiple factors, including the condition of debt capital markets, our operating performance and maintaining strong debt ratings. As of February 1, 2014, our credit ratings were as follows:Credit RatingsMoody'sStandard and Poor'sFitchLong-term debtA2A+A-Commercial paperP-1A-1F2If our credit ratings were lowered, our ability to access the debt markets, our cost of funds and other terms for new debt issuances could be adversely impacted. Each credit rating agency reviews its rating periodically and there is no guarantee our current credit ratings will remain the same as described above. Our Standard and Poor’s rating currently carries a negative outlook, and we believe that our recent operating performance may cause Standard and Poor’s to lower their long-term debt rating by one level.As a measure of our financial condition, we monitor our interest coverage ratio, representing the ratio of pretax earnings before fixed charges to fixed charges. Fixed charges include interest expense and the interest portion of rent expense. Our interest coverage ratio was 4.7x in 2013, 6.1x in 2012 and 5.9x in 2011. Refer to Exhibit (12) for a description of how the gain on sale of our U.S. credit card receivable portfolio and loss on early retirement of debt affected the 2013 calculation.In 2013, we funded our peak sales season working capital needs through internally generated funds and the issuance of commercial paper. In 2012, we funded our peak sales season working capital needs through internally generated funds.26Commercial Paper (dollars in millions)201320122011Maximum daily amount outstanding during the year$1,465$970$1,211Average amount outstanding during the year408120244Amount outstanding at year-end80970—Weighted average interest rate0.13%0.16%0.11%We have additional liquidity through a committed $2.25 billion revolving credit facility obtained in October 2011, which was amended during 2013 to extend the expiration date to October 2018. No balances were outstanding at any time during 2013 or 2012 under this facility.Most of our long-term debt obligations contain covenants related to secured debt levels. In addition to a secured debt level covenant, our credit facility also contains a debt leverage covenant. We are, and expect to remain, in compliance with these covenants. Additionally, at February 1, 2014, no notes or debentures contained provisions requiring acceleration of payment upon a debt rating downgrade, except that certain outstanding notes allow the note holders to put the notes to us if within a matter of months of each other we experience both (i) a change in control; and (ii) our long-term debt ratings are either reduced and the resulting rating is non-investment grade, or our long-term debt ratings are placed on watch for possible reduction and those ratings are subsequently reduced and the resulting rating is non-investment grade.We believe our sources of liquidity will continue to be adequate to maintain operations, finance anticipated expansion and strategic initiatives, fund obligations incurred as a result of the Data Breach and any related future technology enhancements, pay dividends and continue purchases under our share repurchase program for the foreseeable future. We continue to anticipate ample access to commercial paper and long-term financing.Capital ExpendituresCapital Expenditures2013 2012 2011(millions)U.S.CanadaTotal U.S.CanadaTotal TotalNew stores$536$1,451$1,987 $673$417$1,090 $2,058Store remodels and expansions281—281 690—690 1,289Information technology, distribution and other1,0691161,185 9825151,497 1,021Total$1,886$1,567$3,453 $2,345$932$3,277 $4,368Capital expenditures increased in 2013 from the prior year due to Canadian expenditures in advance of 2013 store openings, partially offset by fewer remodels and new stores in the U.S . The decrease in capital expenditures in 2012 from the prior year was primarily driven by the 2011 purchase of Zellers leases in Canada and fewer 2012 U.S. store remodels, partially offset by continued investment in new stores in the U.S. and Canada and technology and multichannel investments. We expect approximately $2.4 to $2.7 billion of capital expenditures in 2014, reflecting an estimated $2.1 to $2.3 billion in our U.S. Segment, including the previously discussed acceleration of our investment in chip-enabled smart card technology, and approximately $0.3 to $0.4 billion in our Canadian Segment.27Commitments and ContingenciesContractual Obligations as ofPayments Due by PeriodFebruary 1, 2014 Less than 1-33-5After 5(millions)Total1 YearYearsYearsYearsRecorded contractual obligations: Long-term debt (a)$11,708$1,001$778$2,453$7,476Capital lease obligations (b)5,3132043903074,412Real estate liabilities (c)144144———Deferred compensation (d)5224699111266Tax contingencies (e)—————Loss contingencies (f)—————Unrecorded contractual obligations: Interest payments – long-term debt8,6185901,1459175,966Operating leases (b)4,1031873593303,227Real estate obligations (g)30528916——Purchase obligations (h)1,31782830161127Future contributions to retirement plans (i)—————Contractual obligations$32,030$3,289$3,088$4,179$21,474(a) Represents principal payments only, and excludes any fair market value adjustments recorded in long-term debt under derivative and hedge accounting rules. See Note 18 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further information.(b) Total contractual lease payments include $3,740 million and $2,105 million of capital and operating lease payments, respectively, related to options to extend the lease term that are reasonably assured of being exercised. These payments also include $80 million and $135 million of legally binding minimum lease payments for stores that are expected to open in 2014 or later for capital and operating leases, respectively. Capital lease obligations include interest. See Note 20 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further information.(c) Real estate liabilities include costs incurred but not paid related to the construction or remodeling of real estate and facilities.(d) Deferred compensation obligations include commitments related to our nonqualified deferred compensation plans. The timing of deferred compensation payouts is estimated based on payments currently made to former employees and retirees, forecasted investment returns, and the projected timing of future retirements.(e) Estimated tax contingencies of $241 million, including interest and penalties, are not included in the table above because we are not able to make reasonably reliable estimates of the period of cash settlement. See Note 21 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further information.(f) Estimated loss contingencies, including those related to the Data Breach, are not included in the table above because we are not able to make reasonably reliable estimates of the period of cash settlement. See Note 17 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further information. (g) Real estate obligations include commitments for the purchase, construction or remodeling of real estate and facilities.(h) Purchase obligations include all legally binding contracts such as firm minimum commitments for inventory purchases, merchandise royalties, equipment purchases, marketing-related contracts, software acquisition/license commitments and service contracts. (Note: we expect to extend certain merchandise contracts during the first quarter of 2014, which could increase our minimum purchase commitment by approximately $1,500 million.) We issue inventory purchase orders in the normal course of business, which represent authorizations to purchase that are cancelable by their terms. We do not consider purchase orders to be firm inventory commitments; therefore, they are excluded from the table above. If we choose to cancel a purchase order, we may be obligated to reimburse the vendor for unrecoverable outlays incurred prior to cancellation. We also issue trade letters of credit in the ordinary course of business, which are excluded from this table as these obligations are conditioned on terms of the letter of credit being met.(i) We have not included obligations under our pension and postretirement health care benefit plans in the contractual obligations table above because no additional amounts are required to be funded as of February 1, 2014. Our historical practice regarding these plans has been to contribute amounts necessary to satisfy minimum pension funding requirements, plus periodic discretionary amounts determined to be appropriate.Off Balance Sheet Arrangements: Other than the unrecorded contractual obligations above, we do not have any arrangements or relationships with entities that are not consolidated into the financial statements.Critical Accounting EstimatesOur analysis of operations and financial condition is based on our consolidated financial statements prepared in accordance with GAAP. Preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions affecting the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements, reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period and related disclosures of contingent assets 28and liabilities. In the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, we describe the significant accounting policies used in preparing the consolidated financial statements. Our estimates are evaluated on an ongoing basis and are drawn from historical experience and other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results could differ under other assumptions or conditions. However, we do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood that there will be a material change in future estimates or assumptions. Our senior management has discussed the development and selection of our critical accounting estimates with the Audit Committee of our Board of Directors. The following items in our consolidated financial statements require significant estimation or judgment:Inventory and cost of sales: We use the retail inventory method to account for the majority of our inventory and the related cost of sales. Under this method, inventory is stated at cost using the last-in, first-out (LIFO) method as determined by applying a cost-to-retail ratio to each merchandise grouping's ending retail value. The cost of our inventory includes the amount we pay to our suppliers to acquire inventory, freight costs incurred in connection with the delivery of product to our distribution centers and stores, and import costs, reduced by vendor income and cash discounts. The majority of our distribution center operating costs, including compensation and benefits, are expensed to cost of sales in the period incurred. Since inventory value is adjusted regularly to reflect market conditions, our inventory methodology reflects the lower of cost or market. We reduce inventory for estimated losses related to shrink and markdowns. Our shrink estimate is based on historical losses verified by physical inventory counts. Historically, our actual physical inventory count results have shown our estimates to be reliable. Markdowns designated for clearance activity are recorded when the salability of the merchandise has diminished. Inventory is at risk of obsolescence if economic conditions change, including changing consumer demand, guest preferences, changing consumer credit markets or increasing competition. We believe these risks are largely mitigated because our inventory typically turns in less than three months. Inventory was $8,766 million and $7,903 million at February 1, 2014 and February 2, 2013, respectively, and is further described in Note 10 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.Vendor income receivable: Cost of sales and SG&A expenses are partially offset by various forms of consideration received from our vendors. This ""vendor income"" is earned for a variety of vendor-sponsored programs, such as volume rebates, markdown allowances, promotions and advertising allowances, as well as for our compliance programs. We establish a receivable for the vendor income that is earned but not yet received. Based on the agreements in place, this receivable is computed by estimating when we have completed our performance and when the amount is earned. The majority of all year-end vendor income receivables are collected within the following fiscal quarter, and we do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood that the assumptions used in our estimate will change significantly. Historically, adjustments to our vendor income receivable have not been material. Vendor income receivable was $555 million and $621 million at February 1, 2014 and February 2, 2013, respectively, and is described further in Note 4 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.Long-lived assets: Long-lived assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amounts may not be recoverable. The evaluation is performed at the lowest level of identifiable cash flows independent of other assets. An impairment loss would be recognized when estimated undiscounted future cash flows from the operation and/or disposition of the assets are less than their carrying amount. Measurement of an impairment loss would be based on the excess of the carrying amount of the asset group over its fair value. Fair value is measured using discounted cash flows or independent opinions of value, as appropriate. We recorded impairments of $77 million, $37 million and $43 million in 2013, 2012 and 2011, respectively, and are described further in Note 12. As of February 1, 2014, a 10 percent decrease in the fair value of assets we intend to sell or close would result in additional impairment of $7 million in 2013. Historically, we have not realized material losses upon sale of long-lived assets.Insurance/self-insurance: We retain a substantial portion of the risk related to certain general liability, workers' compensation, property loss and team member medical and dental claims. However, we maintain stop-loss coverage to limit the exposure related to certain risks. Liabilities associated with these losses include estimates of both claims filed and losses incurred but not yet reported. We use actuarial methods which consider a number of factors to estimate our ultimate cost of losses. General liability and workers' compensation liabilities are recorded at our estimate of their net present value; other liabilities referred to above are not discounted. Our workers' compensation and general liability accrual was $576 million and $627 million at February 1, 2014 and February 2, 2013, respectively. We believe that the amounts accrued are appropriate; however, our liabilities could be significantly affected if future occurrences or loss developments differ from our assumptions. For example, a 5 percent increase or decrease in average claim costs would impact our self-insurance expense by $28 million in 2013. Historically, adjustments to our estimates have not been material. Refer to Item 7A, Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk, for further disclosure of the market risks associated with these exposures. We maintain insurance coverage to limit our exposure to certain events, including network security matters. As of February 1, 2014, we have recognized a $44 million insurance-recovery receivable relating to the Data Breach because we believe recovery is probable. However, it is possible that the insurance carriers could dispute our claims and that we may be unable to collect the recorded receivable.29Income taxes: We pay income taxes based on the tax statutes, regulations and case law of the various jurisdictions in which we operate. Significant judgment is required in determining the timing and amounts of deductible and taxable items, and in evaluating the ultimate resolution of tax matters in dispute with tax authorities. The benefits of uncertain tax positions are recorded in our financial statements only after determining it is likely the uncertain tax positions would withstand challenge by taxing authorities. We periodically reassess these probabilities, and record any changes in the financial statements as appropriate. Liabilities for uncertain tax positions, including interest and penalties, were $241 million and $280 million at February 1, 2014 and February 2, 2013, respectively. We believe the resolution of these matters will not have a material adverse impact on our consolidated financial statements. As of February 1, 2014 we had foreign net operating loss carryforwards of $1,466 million which are available to offset future income. These carryforwards are primarily related to the start-up operations of the Canadian Segment and expire between 2031 and 2033. We establish a valuation allowance for any portion of our deferred tax assets that we believe will not be realized. We have evaluated the positive and negative evidence and consider it more likely than not that these carryforwards will be fully utilized prior to expiration. Therefore, we have not established a valuation allowance. Income taxes are described further in Note 21 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.Pension and postretirement health care accounting: We maintain a funded qualified, defined benefit pension plan, as well as several smaller and unfunded nonqualified plans and a postretirement health care plan for certain current and retired team members. The costs for these plans are determined based on actuarial calculations using the assumptions described in the following paragraphs. Eligibility and the level of benefits varies depending on team members' full-time or part-time status, date of hire and/or length of service. The benefit obligation and related expense for these plans are determined based on actuarial calculations using assumptions about the expected long-term rate of return, the discount rate and compensation growth rates. The assumptions used to determine the period-end benefit obligation also establish the expense for the next year, with adjustments made for any significant plan or participant changes.Our expected long-term rate of return on plan assets of 8.0 percent is determined by the portfolio composition, historical long-term investment performance and current market conditions. Our compound annual rate of return on qualified plans' assets was 10.4 percent, 8.3 percent, 7.2 percent and 9.2 percent for the 5-year, 10-year, 15-year and 20-year periods, respectively. A one percentage point decrease in our expected long-term rate of return would increase annual expense by $29 million.The discount rate used to determine benefit obligations is adjusted annually based on the interest rate for long-term high-quality corporate bonds, using yields for maturities that are in line with the duration of our pension liabilities. Our benefit obligation and related expense will fluctuate with changes in interest rates. A 0.5 percentage point decrease to the weighted average discount rate would increase annual expense by $30 million.Based on our experience, we use a graduated compensation growth schedule that assumes higher compensation growth for younger, shorter-service pension-eligible team members than it does for older, longer-service pension-eligible team members.Pension and postretirement health care benefits are further described in Note 26 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.Legal and other contingencies: We are exposed to other claims and litigation arising in the ordinary course of business and use various methods to resolve these matters in a manner that we believe serves the best interest of our shareholders and other constituents. When a loss is probable, we record an accrual based on the reasonably estimable loss or range of loss. When no point of loss is more likely than another, we record the lowest amount in the estimated range of loss and disclose the estimated range. We do not record liabilities for reasonably possible loss contingencies, but do disclose a range of reasonably possible losses if they are material and we are able to estimate such a range. If we cannot provide a range of reasonably possible losses, we explain the factors that prevent us from determining such a range. Historically, adjustments to our estimates have not been material. We believe the accruals recorded in our consolidated financial statements properly reflect loss exposures that are both probable and reasonably estimable. With the exception of Data Breach-related loss exposures, we do not believe any of the currently identified claims or litigation will materially affect our results of operations, cash flows or financial condition. However, litigation is subject to inherent uncertainties, and unfavorable rulings could occur. If an unfavorable ruling were to occur, it may cause a material adverse impact on the results of operations, cash flows or financial condition for the period in which the ruling occurs, or future periods.For Data Breach-related exposures, we are unable to reasonably estimate a range of probable loss in excess of the recorded payment card network contingent losses. We believe that losses from the payment card networks in excess of the amounts recorded in fiscal 2013 are reasonably possible, and that these losses could be material to our results of operations in future periods, but we are unable to estimate a range of such reasonably possible 30losses. We are also unable to estimate a range of reasonably possible losses arising from Data Breach-related litigation and governmental investigations. See Item 7, Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations and Note 17 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data for further information on the Data Breach-related contingencies. New Accounting PronouncementsWe do not expect that any recently issued accounting pronouncements will have a material effect on our financial statements.Forward-Looking StatementsThis report contains forward-looking statements, which are based on our current assumptions and expectations. These statements are typically accompanied by the words ""expect,"" ""may,"" ""could,"" ""believe,"" ""would,"" ""might,"" ""anticipates,"" or words of similar import. The principal forward-looking statements in this report include: our financial performance, statements regarding the adequacy of and costs associated with our sources of liquidity, the fair value and amount of the beneficial interest asset, the continued execution of our share repurchase program, our expected capital expenditures, the impact of changes in the expected effective income tax rate on net income, the expected compliance with debt covenants, the expected impact of new accounting pronouncements, our intentions regarding future dividends, contributions and payments related to our pension and postretirement health care plans, the expected returns on pension plan assets, the effects of macroeconomic conditions, the adequacy of our reserves for general liability, workers' compensation and property loss, the expected outcome of, and adequacy of our reserves for, investigations, inquiries, claims and litigation, including those related to the Data Breach, expected insurance recoveries, expected changes to our contractual obligations, the expected ability to recognize deferred tax assets and liabilities, including foreign net operating loss carryforwards, and the resolution of tax matters.All such forward-looking statements are intended to enjoy the protection of the safe harbor for forward-looking statements contained in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, as amended. Although we believe there is a reasonable basis for the forward-looking statements, our actual results could be materially different. The most important factors which could cause our actual results to differ from our forward-looking statements are set forth on our description of risk factors in Item 1A to this Form 10-K, which should be read in conjunction with the forward-looking statements in this report. Forward-looking statements speak only as of the date they are made, and we do not undertake any obligation to update any forward-looking statement.Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market RiskAt February 1, 2014, our exposure to market risk was primarily from interest rate changes on our debt obligations, some of which are at a LIBOR-plus floating-rate. Our interest rate exposure is primarily due to the extent by which our floating rate debt obligations differ from our floating rate short term investments. At February 1, 2014, our floating rate debt exceeded our floating rate short term investments by approximately $1 billion. As a result, based on our balance sheet position at February 1, 2014, the annualized effect of a 0.1 percentage point increase in floating interest rates on our floating rate debt obligations, net of our short-term investments, would be to decrease earnings before income taxes by approximately $1 million. In general, we expect our floating rate debt to exceed our floating rate short-term investments over time, but that may vary in different interest rate environments. See further description of our debt and derivative instruments in Notes 18 and 19 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.We record our general liability and workers' compensation liabilities at net present value; therefore, these liabilities fluctuate with changes in interest rates. Periodically, in certain interest rate environments, we economically hedge a portion of our exposure to these interest rate changes by entering into interest rate forward contracts that partially mitigate the effects of interest rate changes. Based on our balance sheet position at February 1, 2014, the annualized effect of a 0.5 percentage point decrease in interest rates would be to decrease earnings before income taxes by $8 million.In addition, we are exposed to market return fluctuations on our qualified defined benefit pension plans. A 0.5 percentage point decrease to the weighted average discount rate would increase annual expense by $30 million. The value of our pension liabilities is inversely related to changes in interest rates. To protect against declines in interest rates, we hold high-quality, long-duration bonds and interest rate swaps in our pension plan trust. At year-end, we had hedged 50 percent of the interest rate exposure of our funded status.31As more fully described in Note 13 and Note 25 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, we are exposed to market returns on accumulated team member balances in our nonqualified, unfunded deferred compensation plans. We control the risk of offering the nonqualified plans by making investments in life insurance contracts and prepaid forward contracts on our own common stock that offset a substantial portion of our economic exposure to the returns on these plans. The annualized effect of a one percentage point change in market returns on our nonqualified defined contribution plans (inclusive of the effect of the investment vehicles used to manage our economic exposure) would not be significant.There have been no other material changes in our primary risk exposures or management of market risks since the prior year.32",2023-12-30 21:32:54.990462
27419,TGT,TARGET CORP,2015,"Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of OperationsExecutive SummaryFiscal 2014 included the following notable items:•GAAP earnings per share were $(2.56), including dilution of $(6.38) related to discontinued operations.•Adjusted earnings per share from continuing operations were $4.27.•Comparable sales grew 1.3 percent. Digital channel sales growth of more than 30 percent contributed 0.7 percentage points to 2014 comparable sales growth.•We paid dividends of $1,205 million in 2014, an increase of 19.8 percent above 2013.Sales from continuing operations were $72,618 million for 2014, an increase of $1,339 million or 1.9 percent from the prior year. Earnings from continuing operations before interest expense and income taxes in 2014 decreased by $636 million or 12.3 percent from 2013 to $4,535 million. Cash flow provided by continuing operations was $5,131 million, $7,519 million, and $5,568 million for 2014, 2013, and 2012, respectively. In connection with the sale of our U.S. credit card receivables, we received cash of $5.7 billion during 2013. Of this amount, $2.7 billion is included in operating cash flow provided by continuing operations and $3.0 billion is included in investing cash flow provided by continuing operations.15Earnings Per Share From Continuing Operations Percent Change201420132012 (a)2014/20132013/2012GAAP diluted earnings per share $3.83$4.20$5.00(8.8)%(16.1)%Adjustments0.440.18(0.23) Adjusted diluted earnings per share $4.27$4.38$4.76(2.6)%(7.9)%Note: Adjusted diluted earnings per share from continuing operations (Adjusted EPS), a non-GAAP metric, excludes the impact of certain matters not related to our routine retail operations and the impact of our discontinued Canadian operations. Management believes that Adjusted EPS is meaningful to provide period-to-period comparisons of our operating results. A reconciliation of non-GAAP financial measures to GAAP measures is provided on page 21.(a) Consisted of 53 weeks.Canada ExitOn January 14, 2015, following a comprehensive assessment of Canadian operations, our Board of Directors approved a plan to discontinue operating stores in Canada. As a result of this decision, on January 15, 2015, Target Canada Co. and certain other wholly owned subsidiaries of Target (collectively Canada Subsidiaries), filed for protection (the Filing) under the Companies' Creditors Arrangement Act (CCAA) with the Ontario Superior Court of Justice in Toronto (the Court). The Canada Subsidiaries comprise substantially all of our Canadian operations and our Canadian Segment. The Canada Subsidiaries have commenced an orderly liquidation process and stores in Canada will remain open during the liquidation. To assist with the exit plan, the Court approved the appointment of a monitor and certain other financial advisors.As a result of the Filing, we no longer have a controlling interest in the Canada Subsidiaries. For this reason, we deconsolidated the Canada Subsidiaries effective January 15, 2015, resulting in a pretax impairment loss on deconsolidation and other charges, collectively totaling $5.1 billion. The pretax loss on deconsolidation includes the derecognition of the carrying amounts of the Canada Subsidiaries' assets, liabilities and accumulated other comprehensive loss and the recording of our remaining interests at fair value.Subsequent to deconsolidation, we will use the cost method to account for our equity investment in the Canada Subsidiaries, which has been reflected as zero in our Consolidated Statement of Financial Position at January 31, 2015 based on the estimated fair value of the Canada Subsidiaries' net assets. Loans to and accounts receivable from the Canada Subsidiaries are recorded at an estimated fair value of $326 million. Our ultimate cash recovery on these claims is subject to the final liquidation value of the Canada Subsidiaries and could vary materially from our estimates.Our Canada exit represents a strategic shift in our business. For this reason, our Canadian Segment results for all periods prior to the January 15, 2015 deconsolidation and costs to exit are classified as discontinued operations.We have recognized a tax benefit of $1.6 billion in discontinued operations, which primarily relates to the loss on our investment in Canada and includes other tax benefits resulting from certain asset write-offs and liabilities paid or accrued to facilitate the liquidation. We have realized the majority of these tax benefits in the first quarter of 2015 and expect to realize substantially all of the remainder in 2015. The recorded expenses include an accrual for the estimated probable loss related to claims that may be asserted against us, primarily under guarantees in certain leases. Our probable loss estimate is based on the expectation that claims will be asserted against us and negotiated settlements will be reached, and not on any determination that it is probable we would be found liable were these claims to be litigated. Given the early stage of our exit and the Filing, our estimates involve significant judgment and are based on currently available information, an assessment of the validity of certain claims and estimated payments by the Canada Subsidiaries. We are not able to reasonably estimate a range of possible losses in excess of the year-end accrual because there are significant factual and legal issues to be resolved. We believe that it is reasonably possible that future changes to our estimates of loss and the ultimate amount paid on these claims could be material to our results of operations in future periods. Any such losses would be recorded in discontinued operations.We expect to incur severance, legal and professional services expenses associated with our Canadian exit. We will recognize these expenses within discontinued operations as services are received and liabilities are incurred. We currently cannot predict the timing of such expenses and associated cash disbursements; however, we do not expect these amounts to be material to our results in future periods.16See Note 6 of the Financial Statements for further information regarding our Canada exit.Data BreachIn the fourth quarter of 2013, we experienced a data breach in which an intruder stole certain payment card and other guest information from our network (the Data Breach). In 2014, we recorded $191 million of pretax Data Breach-related expenses and $46 million of expected insurance proceeds, for net expenses of $145 million. These expenses were included in our Consolidated Statements of Operations as Selling, General and Administrative Expenses (SG&A), but were not part of segment SG&A. Along with legal and other professional services, these expenses include an accrual for estimated probable losses for what we believe to be the vast majority of actual and potential breach-related claims, including claims by the payment card networks. Our probable loss estimate is based on the expectation of reaching negotiated settlements, and not on any determination that it is probable we would be found liable for the losses we have accrued were these claims to be litigated. As of January 31, 2015 we have incurred $252 million of cumulative Data Breach-related expenses, partially offset by $90 million of expected insurance recoveries, for net cumulative expenses of $162 million.For more information about the Data Breach, see Note 17 of the Financial Statements.Analysis of Results of OperationsSegment Results Percent Change(dollars in millions)201420132012 (a)2014/20132013/2012Sales$72,618$71,279$71,9601.9 %(0.9)%Cost of sales51,27850,03950,5682.5(1.0)Gross margin21,34021,24021,3920.5(0.7)SG&A expenses (b)14,45014,28513,7591.23.8EBITDA6,8906,9557,633(0.9)(8.9)Depreciation and amortization2,1291,9962,0446.7(2.4)EBIT$4,761$4,959$5,589(4.0)%(11.3)%Note: Effective January 15, 2015, we operate as a single segment which includes all of our continuing operations, excluding net interest expense, data breach related costs and certain other expenses which are discretely managed.

For 2014 and 2013, SG&A also includes $682 million and $653 million, respectively, of profit-sharing income from the arrangement with TD.Rate Analysis201420132012 (a)Gross margin rate29.4%29.8%29.7%SG&A expense rate19.920.019.1EBITDA margin rate9.59.810.6Depreciation and amortization expense rate2.92.82.8EBIT margin rate6.67.07.8Note: Rate analysis metrics are computed by dividing the applicable amount by sales.(a) Consisted of 53 weeks.17SalesSales include merchandise sales, net of expected returns, and gift card breakage. Refer to Note 2 of the Financial Statements for a definition of gift card breakage. The increase in 2014 sales reflects a 1.3 percent increase in comparable sales and the contribution from new stores. The sales decline in 2013 reflected the impact of an additional week in 2012 and a decline in comparable sales, partially offset by the contribution from new stores. Inflation did not materially affect sales in any period presented.Comparable sales is a measure that highlights the performance of our existing stores and digital channel sales by measuring the change in sales for a period over the comparable, prior-year period of equivalent length. Comparable sales include all sales from stores open at least 13 months. Digital channel sales include all sales initiated through mobile applications and our conventional websites, including those of acquired entities from the date of acquisition, and may be fulfilled through our distribution centers or our stores. Comparable sales measures vary across the retail industry. As a result, our comparable sales calculation is not necessarily comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies.

Additionally, we offer a branded proprietary Target Debit Card. Collectively, we refer to these products as REDcards®. Guests receive a 5 percent discount on virtually all purchases and free shipping when they use a REDcard at Target. We monitor the percentage of sales that are paid for using REDcards (REDcard Penetration) because our internal analysis has indicated that a meaningful portion of incremental purchases on our REDcards are also incremental sales for Target.18REDcard Penetration201420132012Target Credit Cards9.7%9.3%7.9%Target Debit Card11.29.95.7Total REDcard Penetration20.9%19.3%13.6%Note: The sum of Target Credit Cards and Target Debit Card penetration may not equal Total REDcard Penetration due to rounding.Gross Margin Rate Our gross margin rate was 29.4 percent in 2014, 29.8 percent in 2013, and 29.7 percent in 2012. The 2014 decrease is primarily due to promotional activity. The 2013 increase was primarily the result of a change in vendor contracts regarding payments received in support of marketing programs resulting in more vendor consideration being recognized as a reduction of our cost of sales rather than a reduction of SG&A. Increases to the rate were offset by our integrated growth strategies of our 5 percent REDcard Rewards loyalty program and our store remodel program.Selling, General and Administrative Expense Rate Our SG&A expense rate was 19.9 percent in 2014, 20.0 percent in 2013, and 19.1 percent in 2012. The decrease in 2014 primarily related to company-wide expense optimization efforts, partially offset by investments in technology and other initiatives, none of which were individually significant. The increase in 2013 resulted from a smaller contribution from our credit card portfolio, investments in technology and supply chain in support of multichannel initiatives, changes in merchandise vendor contracts described above, and other increases. Increases were partially offset by the benefit from our company-wide expense optimization efforts and favorable incentive compensation and store hourly payroll. 19Store DataChange in Number of Stores20142013Beginning store count1,7931,778Opened1619Closed(19)(4)Relocated——Ending store count1,7901,793Number of stores remodeled during the year39100Number of Stores andRetail Square FeetNumber of Stores Retail Square Feet (a)January 31, 2015February 1, 2014 January 31, 2015February 1, 2014Expanded food assortment stores1,2921,245 167,026160,891SuperTarget stores249251 44,15144,500Target general merchandise stores240289 27,94533,843CityTarget stores88 820820TargetExpress1— 21—Total1,7901,793 239,963240,054(a) In thousands, reflects total square feet less office, distribution center and vacant space.Other Performance FactorsOther Selling, General and Administrative ExpensesIn addition to segment selling, general and administrative expenses, we recorded certain other expenses during 2014 and 2013. For 2014, these expenses included $145 million of net Data Breach-related costs, $16 million of impairments related to undeveloped U.S. land and $13 million of costs related to previously announced plans to convert existing co-branded REDcards to MasterCard co-branded chip-and-PIN cards in 2015 to support the accelerated transition to chip-and-PIN-enabled REDcards. For 2013, these expenses included a $23 million workforce-reduction charge primarily related to severance and benefits costs, a $22 million charge related to part-time team member health benefit changes, $19 million in impairment charges related to undeveloped U.S. land, and $17 million of net Data Breach-related costs. Additional information about these items is provided within the Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Financial Measures to GAAP Measures on page 21.Net Interest ExpenseNet interest expense from continuing operations was $882 million, $1,049 million, and $684 million for 2014, 2013, and 2012, respectively. Net interest expense for 2014 and 2013 included a loss on early retirement of debt of $285 million and $445 million, respectively.Provision for Income TaxesOur effective income tax rate from continuing operations decreased to 33.0 percent in 2014, from 34.6 percent in 2013, driven primarily by the net tax effect of our global sourcing operations and the favorable resolution of various income tax matters. The resolution of various income tax matters reduced tax expense by $35 million and $16 million in 2014 and 2013, respectively. A tax rate reconciliation is provided in Note 21 to our Consolidated Financial Statements.Our effective income tax rate from continuing operations increased to 34.6 percent in 2013, from 34.4 percent in 2012, driven by a lower year-over-year benefit from the favorable resolution of various income tax matters. The resolution of various income tax matters reduced tax expense by $16 million and $58 million in 2013 and 2012, respectively.20Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Financial Measures to GAAP MeasuresTo provide additional transparency, we have disclosed non-GAAP adjusted diluted earnings per share from continuing operations (Adjusted EPS). This metric excludes the impact of the 2013 sale of our U.S. consumer credit card receivables portfolio, losses on early retirement of debt, net expenses related to the 2013 data breach and other matters presented below. We believe this information is useful in providing period-to-period comparisons of the results of our continuing operations. This measure is not in accordance with, or an alternative to, generally accepted accounting principles in the United States. The most comparable GAAP measure is diluted earnings per share from continuing operations. Adjusted EPS from continuing operations should not be considered in isolation or as a substitution for analysis of our results as reported under GAAP. Other companies may calculate non-GAAP adjusted EPS from continuing operations differently than we do, limiting the usefulness of the measure for comparisons with other companies. Prior year amounts have been revised to present Adjusted EPS on a continuing operations basis. 2014 2013 2012(millions, except per share data) Pretax Net of Tax Per Share Amounts Pretax Net of Tax Per Share Amounts Pretax Net of Tax Per Share AmountsGAAP diluted earnings per share from continuing operations $3.83 $4.20 $5.00Adjustments Loss on early retirement of debt $285 $173 $0.27 $445 $270 $0.42 $— $— $—Data Breach-related costs, net of insurance receivable (a) 145 94 0.15 17 11 0.02 — — —Reduction of beneficial interest asset (b) 53 32 0.05 98 61 0.09 — — —Other (c) 29 18 0.03 64 40 0.06 — — —Gain on receivables transaction (b) — — — (391) (247) (0.38) (152) (97) (0.15)Resolution of income tax matters — (35) (0.06) — (16) (0.03) — (58) (0.09)Adjusted diluted earnings per share from continuing operations $4.27 $4.38 $4.76Note: The sum of the non-GAAP adjustments may not equal the total adjustment amounts due to rounding.(a) Refer to Note 17 of the Financial Statements.(b) Refer to Note 7 of the Financial Statements.(c) 2014 includes impairments of $16 million related to undeveloped land in the U.S. and $13 million of expense related to converting co-branded card program to MasterCard. 2013 includes a $23 million workforce-reduction charge primarily related to severance and benefits costs, a $22 million charge related to part-time team member health benefit changes, and $19 million in impairment charges related to certain parcels of undeveloped land.Analysis of Financial ConditionLiquidity and Capital ResourcesOur period-end cash and cash equivalents balance was $2,210 million, compared with $670 million in 2013. Short-term investments of $1,520 million and $3 million were included in cash and cash equivalents at the end of 2014 and 2013, respectively. Our investment policy is designed to preserve principal and liquidity of our short-term investments. This policy allows investments in large money market funds or in highly rated direct short-term instruments that mature in 60 days or less. We also place dollar limits on our investments in individual funds or instruments.Cash FlowsOur 2014 operations were funded by both internally and externally generated funds. Operating cash flow provided by continuing operations was $5,131 million in 2014 compared with $7,519 million in 2013. Net cash flow provided by continuing operations for 2013 includes $5.7 billion of cash received in connection with the sale of our U.S. consumer credit card receivables, of which $2.7 billion is included in operating cash flow provided by continuing operations and $3.0 billion is included in investing cash flow provided by continuing operations. In June 2014, we issued $1 billion of unsecured debt that matures in June 2019 and $1 billion of unsecured debt that matures in July 2024. Combined with our prior year-end cash position, these cash flows allowed us to repurchase $725 million of debt at a market value of $1 billion, pay current debt maturities, invest in the business and pay dividends.Year-end inventory levels increased from $8,278 million in 2013 to $8,790 million in 2014. Accounts payable increased by $424 million, or 5.8 percent over the same period.21Share RepurchasesIn January 2012, we began repurchasing shares under a $5 billion program authorized by our Board of Directors. Since the second quarter of 2013, we have not repurchased any shares on the open market. However, as described in Note 23 of the Financial Statements, we reacquired 0.8 million shares during 2014 upon the noncash settlement of prepaid forward contracts related to nonqualified deferred compensation plans. During the first half of 2013, we repurchased 21.9 million shares of our common stock for a total investment of $1,474 million ($67.41 per share).DividendsWe paid dividends totaling $1,205 million in 2014 and $1,006 million in 2013, an increase of 19.8 percent. We declared dividends totaling $1,271 million ($1.99 per share) in 2014, a per share increase of 20.6 percent over 2013. We declared dividends totaling $1,051 million ($1.65 per share) in 2013, a per share increase of 19.6 percent over 2012. We have paid dividends every quarter since our 1967 initial public offering, and it is our intent to continue to do so in the future.Short-term and Long-term FinancingOur financing strategy is to ensure liquidity and access to capital markets, to manage our net exposure to floating interest rate volatility and to maintain a balanced spectrum of debt maturities. Within these parameters, we seek to minimize our borrowing costs. Our ability to access the long-term debt and commercial paper markets has provided us with ample sources of liquidity. Our continued access to these markets depends on multiple factors, including the condition of debt capital markets, our operating performance and maintaining strong debt ratings. As of January 31, 2015, our credit ratings were as follows:Credit RatingsMoody'sStandard and Poor'sFitchLong-term debtA2AA-Commercial paperP-1A-1F2If our credit ratings were lowered, our ability to access the debt markets, our cost of funds and other terms for new debt issuances could be adversely impacted. Each of the credit rating agencies reviews its rating periodically and there is no guarantee our current credit ratings will remain the same as described above. Standard and Poor's lowered our long-term debt rating from A+ to A during 2014, but maintained our A-1 commercial paper rating.As a measure of our financial condition, we monitor our ratio of earnings from continuing operations to fixed charges, which represents the ratio of pretax earnings from continuing operations before fixed charges to fixed charges. Fixed charges include interest expense and the interest portion of rent expense. Our ratio of earnings to fixed charges was 6.02x in 2014, 6.48x in 2013 and 7.10x in 2012. See Exhibit (12) for a description of how the gain on sale of our U.S. credit card receivable portfolio and loss on early retirement of debt affected the 2014, 2013 and 2012 calculations.In 2014 and 2013, we funded our peak sales season working capital needs through internally generated funds and the issuance of commercial paper. Commercial Paper (dollars in millions)201420132012Maximum daily amount outstanding during the year$590$1,465$970Average amount outstanding during the year129408120Amount outstanding at year-end—80970Weighted average interest rate0.11%0.13%0.16%We have additional liquidity through a committed $2.25 billion revolving credit facility that expires in October 2018. No balances were outstanding at any time during 2014 or 2013 under this facility.Most of our long-term debt obligations contain covenants related to secured debt levels. In addition to a secured debt level covenant, our credit facility also contains a debt leverage covenant. We are, and expect to remain, in compliance with these covenants. Additionally, at January 31, 2015, no notes or debentures contained provisions requiring 22acceleration of payment upon a debt rating downgrade, except that certain outstanding notes allow the note holders to put the notes to us if within a matter of months of each other we experience both (i) a change in control and (ii) our long-term debt ratings are either reduced and the resulting rating is non-investment grade, or our long-term debt ratings are placed on watch for possible reduction and those ratings are subsequently reduced and the resulting rating is non-investment grade.We believe our sources of liquidity will continue to be adequate to maintain operations, finance anticipated expansion and strategic initiatives, fund obligations incurred as a result of our exit from Canada, fund obligations incurred as a result of the Data Breach and any related future technology enhancements, pay dividends and execute purchases under our share repurchase program for the foreseeable future. We believe that our exit from Canada will increase our after-tax cash flows beginning in 2015. We continue to anticipate ample access to commercial paper and long-term financing.Capital ExpendituresCapital Expenditures2014 2013 2012(millions) Information technology, distribution and other$1,306 $1,069 $982New stores381 536 673Store remodels and expansions99 281 690Total$1,786 $1,886 $2,345Capital expenditures decreased in 2014 from the prior year due to fewer remodels and new stores, partially offset by technology investments to support of our omnichannel efforts and security enhancements. Capital expenditures decreased in 2013 from the prior year due to fewer remodels and new stores. We expect approximately $2.1 billion of capital expenditures in 2015, reflecting our focus on becoming a leading omnichannel retailer through investments in technology and supply chain, elevating signature categories and opening new stores, including urban formats. Capital expenditures related to our discontinued Canadian operations were $228 million, $1,567 million and $932 million for 2014, 2013 and 2012, respectively. 23Commitments and ContingenciesContractual Obligations as ofPayments Due by PeriodJanuary 31, 2015 Less than 1-33-5After 5(millions)Total1 YearYearsYearsYearsRecorded contractual obligations: Long-term debt (a)$11,982$27$3,002$1,203$7,750Capital lease obligations (b)1,4031231521091,019Deferred compensation (c)54147103115276Real estate liabilities (d)3939———Tax contingencies (e)—————Loss contingencies (f)—————Unrecorded contractual obligations: Interest payments – long-term debt7,3095921,0888094,820Operating leases (b)3,8271863483192,974Purchase obligations (g)2,411695855697164Real estate obligations (h)204167631—Future contributions to retirement plans (i)—————Contractual obligations$27,716$1,876$5,554$3,283$17,003(a) Represents principal payments only, and excludes any fair market value adjustments recorded in long-term debt under derivative and hedge accounting rules.

Capital lease obligations include interest. See Note 20 of the Financial Statements for further information.(c) Deferred compensation obligations include commitments related to our nonqualified deferred compensation plans. The timing of deferred compensation payouts is estimated based on payments currently made to former employees and retirees, forecasted investment returns, and the projected timing of future retirements.(d) Real estate liabilities include costs incurred but not paid related to the construction or remodeling of real estate and facilities.(e) Estimated tax contingencies of $195 million, including interest and penalties, are not included in the table above because we are not able to make reasonably reliable estimates of the period of cash settlement. See Note 21 of the Financial Statements for further information.(f) Estimated loss contingencies, including those related to the Canada Exit and the Data Breach, are not included in the table above because we are not able to make reasonably reliable estimates of the period of cash settlement. See Note 6 and Note 17 of the Financial Statements for further information. (g) Purchase obligations include all legally binding contracts such as firm minimum commitments for inventory purchases, merchandise royalties, equipment purchases, marketing-related contracts, software acquisition/license commitments and service contracts. We issue inventory purchase orders in the normal course of business, which represent authorizations to purchase that are cancelable by their terms. We do not consider purchase orders to be firm inventory commitments; therefore, they are excluded from the table above. If we choose to cancel a purchase order, we may be obligated to reimburse the vendor for unrecoverable outlays incurred prior to cancellation. We also issue trade letters of credit in the ordinary course of business, which are excluded from this table as these obligations are conditioned on terms of the letter of credit being met.(h) Real estate obligations include commitments for the purchase, construction or remodeling of real estate and facilities.(i) We have not included obligations under our pension and postretirement health care benefit plans in the contractual obligations table above because no additional amounts are required to be funded as of January 31, 2015. Our historical practice regarding these plans has been to contribute amounts necessary to satisfy minimum pension funding requirements, plus periodic discretionary amounts determined to be appropriate.Off Balance Sheet Arrangements: Other than the unrecorded contractual obligations noted above, we do not have any arrangements or relationships with entities that are not consolidated into the financial statements.Critical Accounting EstimatesOur analysis of operations and financial condition is based on our consolidated financial statements prepared in accordance with GAAP. Preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions affecting the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements, reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities. In the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, we describe the significant accounting policies used in preparing the consolidated financial statements. Our estimates are evaluated on an ongoing basis and are drawn from historical experience and other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. Actual 24results could differ under other assumptions or conditions. However, except as discussed below regarding Canada Exit and Data Breach-related costs, we do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood that there will be a material change in future estimates or assumptions. Our senior management has discussed the development and selection of our critical accounting estimates with the Audit Committee of our Board of Directors. The following items in our consolidated financial statements require significant estimation or judgment:Inventory and cost of sales: We use the retail inventory method to account for the majority of our inventory and the related cost of sales. Under this method, inventory is stated at cost using the last-in, first-out (LIFO) method as determined by applying a cost-to-retail ratio to each merchandise grouping's ending retail value. The cost of our inventory includes the amount we pay to our suppliers to acquire inventory, freight costs incurred in connection with the delivery of product to our distribution centers and stores, and import costs, reduced by vendor income and cash discounts. The majority of our distribution center operating costs, including compensation and benefits, are expensed to cost of sales in the period incurred. Since inventory value is adjusted regularly to reflect market conditions, our inventory methodology reflects the lower of cost or market. We reduce inventory for estimated losses related to shrink and markdowns. Our shrink estimate is based on historical losses verified by physical inventory counts. Historically, our actual physical inventory count results have shown our estimates to be reliable. Markdowns designated for clearance activity are recorded when the salability of the merchandise has diminished. Inventory is at risk of obsolescence if economic conditions change, including changing consumer demand, guest preferences, changing consumer credit markets or increasing competition. We believe these risks are largely mitigated because our inventory typically turns in less than three months. Inventory was $8,790 million and $8,278 million at January 31, 2015 and February 1, 2014, respectively, and is further described in Note 10 of the Financial Statements.Vendor income receivable: Cost of sales and SG&A expenses are partially offset by various forms of consideration received from our vendors (Vendor Income). Vendor Income is earned for a variety of programs, such as volume rebates, markdown allowances, promotions, advertising allowances and compliance programs. We establish a receivable for Vendor Income that is earned but not yet received. Based on the agreements in place, this receivable is computed by estimating when we have completed our performance and when the amount is earned. The majority of year-end Vendor Income receivables are collected within the following fiscal quarter, and we do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood that the assumptions used in our estimate will change significantly. Historically, adjustments to our Vendor Income receivable have not been material. Vendor Income receivable was $493 million and $536 million at January 31, 2015 and February 1, 2014, respectively, and is described further in Note 4 of the Financial Statements.Long-lived assets: Long-lived assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amounts may not be recoverable. The evaluation is performed at the lowest level of identifiable cash flows independent of other assets. An impairment loss would be recognized when estimated undiscounted future cash flows from the operation and/or disposition of the assets are less than their carrying amount. Measurement of an impairment loss would be based on the excess of the carrying amount of the asset group over its fair value. Fair value is measured using discounted cash flows or independent opinions of value, as appropriate. We recorded impairments of $124 million, $77 million, and $37 million in 2014, 2013, and 2012, respectively, which are described further in Note 12. As of January 31, 2015, a 10 percent decrease in the fair value of assets we intend to sell or close would result in additional impairment of $5 million in 2014. Historically, we have not realized material losses upon sale of long-lived assets.Investments in and receivables from Canada Subsidiaries: We determined the fair value and recoverability of our Canadian investments by comparing the estimated fair value of the underlying assets of the Canada Subsidiaries to estimated liabilities at the time of the Filing. We estimated the fair value of the major asset classes using estimated selling price less cost to sell, the income approach based on estimated market rents and capitalization rates, and discounted cash flow analysis of the differential between estimated market rent and contractual rent payments, as appropriate. We also applied an estimated liquidation discount to reflect the CCAA filing. Outstanding liabilities include accounts payable and other liabilities, forward commitments, unsubordinated related party payables, lease liabilities and other potential claims. Potential claims include an accrual for the estimated probable loss related to claims that may be asserted against the Canada Subsidiaries under certain contracts. Based on our estimates, the fair value of liabilities exceeds the fair value of assets. To assess the fair value and recoverability of amounts receivable from the Canada Subsidiaries, we estimated the fair value of the underlying net assets of the Canada Subsidiaries available for distribution to their creditors in relation to the estimated creditor claims and the priority of those claims.Our estimates involve significant judgment and are based on currently available information, an assessment of the validity of certain claims and estimated payments by the Canada Subsidiaries. Our ultimate recovery is subject to the 25final liquidation value of the Canada Subsidiaries and may vary significantly from our current estimates. See Note 6 of the Financial Statements for further information.Insurance/self-insurance: We retain a substantial portion of the risk related to certain general liability, workers' compensation, property loss and team member medical and dental claims. However, we maintain stop-loss coverage to limit the exposure related to certain risks. Liabilities associated with these losses include estimates of both claims filed and losses incurred but not yet reported. We use actuarial methods which consider a number of factors to estimate our ultimate cost of losses. General liability and workers' compensation liabilities are recorded at our estimate of their net present value; other liabilities referred to above are not discounted. Our workers' compensation and general liability accrual was $566 million and $576 million at January 31, 2015 and February 1, 2014, respectively. We believe that the amounts accrued are appropriate; however, our liabilities could be significantly affected if future occurrences or loss developments differ from our assumptions. For example, a 5 percent increase or decrease in average claim costs would impact our self-insurance expense by $28 million in 2014. Historically, adjustments to our estimates have not been material. Refer to Item 7A, Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk, for further disclosure of the market risks associated with these exposures. We maintain insurance coverage to limit our exposure to certain events, including network security matters. Since the Data Breach, we have recognized $90 million of expected insurance recoveries related to the Data Breach. As of January 31, 2015, we have a $60 million insurance-recovery receivable relating to the Data Breach because we believe recovery is probable. However, it is possible that the insurance carriers could dispute our claims and that we may be unable to collect the recorded receivable.Income taxes: We pay income taxes based on the tax statutes, regulations and case law of the various jurisdictions in which we operate. Significant judgment is required in determining the timing and amounts of deductible and taxable items, and in evaluating the ultimate resolution of tax matters in dispute with tax authorities. The benefits of uncertain tax positions are recorded in our financial statements only after determining it is likely the uncertain tax positions would withstand challenge by taxing authorities. We periodically reassess these probabilities, and record any changes in the financial statements as appropriate. Liabilities for uncertain tax positions, including interest and penalties, were $195 million and $241 million at January 31, 2015 and February 1, 2014, respectively. We believe the resolution of these matters will not have a material adverse impact on our consolidated financial statements. Income taxes are described further in Note 21 of the Financial Statements.Pension and postretirement health care accounting: We maintain a funded qualified, defined benefit pension plan, as well as several smaller and unfunded nonqualified plans and a postretirement health care plan for certain current and retired team members. The costs for these plans are determined based on actuarial calculations using the assumptions described in the following paragraphs. Eligibility and the level of benefits varies depending on team members' full-time or part-time status, date of hire and/or length of service. The benefit obligation and related expense for these plans are determined based on actuarial calculations using assumptions about the expected long-term rate of return, the discount rate and compensation growth rates. The assumptions used to determine the period-end benefit obligation also establish the expense for the next year, with adjustments made for any significant plan or participant changes.Our expected long-term rate of return on plan assets of 7.5 percent is determined by the portfolio composition, historical long-term investment performance and current market conditions. Our compound annual rate of return on qualified plans' assets was 12.1 percent, 8.3 percent, 7.0 percent and 9.7 percent for the 5-year, 10-year, 15-year and 20-year periods, respectively. A one percentage point decrease in our expected long-term rate of return would increase annual expense by $31 million.The discount rate used to determine benefit obligations is adjusted annually based on the interest rate for long-term high-quality corporate bonds, using yields for maturities that are in line with the duration of our pension liabilities. Our benefit obligation and related expense will fluctuate with changes in interest rates. A 0.5 percentage point decrease to the weighted average discount rate would increase annual expense by $29 million.Based on our experience, we use a graduated compensation growth schedule that assumes higher compensation growth for younger, shorter-service pension-eligible team members than it does for older, longer-service pension-eligible team members.Pension and postretirement health care benefits are further described in Note 26 of the Financial Statements.Legal and other contingencies: We are exposed to other claims and litigation arising in the ordinary course of business and use various methods to resolve these matters in a manner that we believe serves the best interest of our shareholders and other constituents. When a loss is probable, we record an accrual based on the reasonably estimable loss or range of loss. When no point of loss is more likely than another, we record the lowest amount in the estimated range of loss and disclose the estimated range. We do not record liabilities for reasonably possible loss contingencies, but do disclose a range of reasonably possible losses if they are material and we are able to estimate such a range. 26If we cannot provide a range of reasonably possible losses, we explain the factors that prevent us from determining such a range. Historically, adjustments to our estimates have not been material. We believe the accruals recorded in our consolidated financial statements properly reflect loss exposures that are both probable and reasonably estimable. With the exception of Canada Exit and Data Breach-related loss exposures, we do not believe any of the currently identified claims or litigation may materially affect our results of operations, cash flows or financial condition. However, litigation is subject to inherent uncertainties, and unfavorable rulings could occur. If an unfavorable ruling were to occur, it may cause a material adverse impact on the results of operations, cash flows or financial condition for the period in which the ruling occurs, or future periods. Refer to Notes 6 and 17 of the Financial Statements for further information on the Canada Exit and Data Breach-related contingencies, respectively.New Accounting PronouncementsWe do not expect that any recently issued accounting pronouncements will have a material effect on our financial statements.Forward-Looking StatementsThis report contains forward-looking statements, which are based on our current assumptions and expectations. These statements are typically accompanied by the words ""expect,"" ""may,"" ""could,"" ""believe,"" ""would,"" ""might,"" ""anticipates,"" or words of similar import. The principal forward-looking statements in this report include: our financial performance, statements regarding the adequacy of and costs associated with our sources of liquidity, the fair value and amount of the beneficial interest asset, the continued execution of our share repurchase program, our expected capital expenditures, the impact of changes in the expected effective income tax rate on net income, the expected compliance with debt covenants, the expected impact of new accounting pronouncements, our intentions regarding future dividends, contributions and payments related to our pension and postretirement health care plans, the expected returns on pension plan assets, the expected timing and recognition of compensation expenses, the effects of macroeconomic conditions, the adequacy of our reserves for general liability, workers' compensation and property loss, the expected outcome of, and adequacy of our reserves for investigations, inquiries, claims and litigation, including those related to the Data Breach and discontinuing our Canadian operations, expected insurance recoveries, expected changes to our contractual obligations and liabilities, the expected ability to recognize deferred tax assets and liabilities and the timing of such recognition, including net operating loss carryforwards and tax benefits related to discontinuing our Canadian operations, the process, timing and effects of discontinuing our Canadian operations, the resolution of tax matters, and changes in our assumptions and expectations.All such forward-looking statements are intended to enjoy the protection of the safe harbor for forward-looking statements contained in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, as amended. Although we believe there is a reasonable basis for the forward-looking statements, our actual results could be materially different. The most important factors which could cause our actual results to differ from our forward-looking statements are set forth on our description of risk factors in Item 1A to this Form 10-K, which should be read in conjunction with the forward-looking statements in this report. Forward-looking statements speak only as of the date they are made, and we do not undertake any obligation to update any forward-looking statement.Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market RiskAt January 31, 2015, our exposure to market risk was primarily from interest rate changes on our debt obligations, some of which are at a LIBOR-plus floating-rate. Our interest rate exposure is primarily due to differences between our floating rate debt obligations compared to our floating rate short term investments. At January 31, 2015, our floating rate short-term investments exceeded our floating rate debt by approximately $270 million. Based on our balance sheet position at January 31, 2015, the annualized effect of a 0.1 percentage point decrease in floating interest rates on our floating rate short-term investments, net of our debt obligations, would decrease earnings before income taxes by approximately $0.3 million. In general, we expect our floating rate debt to exceed our floating rate short-term investments over time, but that may vary in different interest rate environments. See further description of our debt and derivative instruments in Notes 18 and 19 of the Notes to Financial Statements.We record our general liability and workers' compensation liabilities at net present value; therefore, these liabilities fluctuate with changes in interest rates. Periodically, in certain interest rate environments, we economically hedge a portion of our exposure to these interest rate changes by entering into interest rate forward contracts that partially mitigate the effects of interest rate changes. Based on our balance sheet position at January 31, 2015, the annualized 27effect of a 0.5 percentage point decrease in interest rates would be to decrease earnings before income taxes by $9 million.In addition, we are exposed to market return fluctuations on our qualified defined benefit pension plans. The value of our pension liabilities is inversely related to changes in interest rates. A 0.5 percentage point decrease to the weighted average discount rate would increase annual expense by $29 million. To protect against declines in interest rates, we hold high-quality, long-duration bonds and interest rate swaps in our pension plan trust. At year-end, we had hedged 50 percent of the interest rate exposure of our funded status.As more fully described in Note 13 and Note 25 of the Financial Statements, we are exposed to market returns on accumulated team member balances in our nonqualified, unfunded deferred compensation plans. We control the risk of offering the nonqualified plans by making investments in life insurance contracts and prepaid forward contracts on our own common stock that offset a substantial portion of our economic exposure to the returns on these plans. The annualized effect of a one percentage point change in market returns on our nonqualified defined contribution plans (inclusive of the effect of the investment vehicles used to manage our economic exposure) would not be significant.There have been no other material changes in our primary risk exposures or management of market risks since the prior year.28",2023-12-30 21:32:52.992973
27419,TGT,TARGET CORP,2016,"Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of OperationsExecutive SummaryFiscal 2015 included the following notable items:•GAAP earnings per share were $5.31, including $0.07 related to discontinued operations.•Adjusted earnings per share from continuing operations were $4.69.•Comparable sales grew 2.1 percent. Digital channel sales growth of more than 30 percent contributed 0.8 percentage points to 2015 comparable sales growth.•We sold our pharmacy and clinic businesses to CVS, recognizing a pretax gain of $620 million.•We paid dividends of $1,362 million in 2015, an increase of 13.0 percent above 2014.•We returned cash through share repurchase for the first time since second quarter 2013, with purchases of $3,441 million of common stock at an average price of $77.07 per share.Sales were $73,785 million for 2015, an increase of $1,167 million or 1.6 percent from the prior year. Earnings from continuing operations before interest expense and income taxes in 2015 increased by $995 million or 22.0 percent from 2014 to $5,530 million. Operating cash flow provided by continuing operations was $5,140 million, $5,131 million, and $7,519 million for 2015, 2014, and 2013, respectively. Proceeds from the sale of our pharmacy and clinic businesses to CVS are included in investing cash flows provided by continuing operations. In 2013, operating cash flow provided by continuing operations includes $2.7 billion of proceeds from the sale of our U.S. credit card receivables.16Earnings Per Share From Continuing Operations Percent Change2015201420132015/20142014/2013GAAP diluted earnings per share $5.25$3.83$4.2037.2%(8.8)%Adjustments(0.56)0.390.09 Adjusted diluted earnings per share $4.69$4.22$4.2911.3%(1.7)%Note: Adjusted diluted earnings per share from continuing operations (Adjusted EPS), a non-GAAP metric, excludes the impact of certain matters not related to our routine retail operations and the impact of our discontinued Canadian operations. Management believes that Adjusted EPS is meaningful to provide period-to-period comparisons of our operating results. A reconciliation of non-GAAP financial measures to GAAP measures is provided on page 23.We report after-tax return on invested capital (ROIC) from continuing operations as we believe ROIC provides a meaningful measure of the effectiveness of our capital allocation over time. For the trailing twelve months ended January 30, 2016, ROIC was 16.0 percent, compared with 12.4 percent for the trailing twelve months ended January 31, 2015. Excluding the net gain on the sale of our pharmacy and clinic businesses, ROIC was 13.9 percent for the trailing twelve months ended January 30, 2016. A reconciliation of ROIC is provided on page 24. Pharmacies and Clinics Transaction In December 2015, we closed the previously announced sale of our pharmacy and clinic businesses to CVS for cash consideration of $1.9 billion. CVS now operates the pharmacy and clinic businesses in our stores under a perpetual operating agreement, subject to termination in limited circumstances. No profit-sharing arrangement exists, but CVS will make an annual, inflation-adjusted occupancy-related payment to us, starting at $20 million to $25 million in the first year of the agreement. We also entered into a development agreement with CVS through which we may jointly develop small-format stores.In connection with the sale, we recognized a pretax gain of $620 million, which we recorded outside of segment results and excluded from Adjusted EPS. We also recorded deferred income of $694 million, which we will amortize into income evenly over the 23-year weighted average remaining accounting useful life of our stores.During 2015, we used a portion of the $1.9 billion cash consideration to repurchase shares of our common stock and settle approximately $200 million of retained pharmacy and clinic net liabilities. We expect to use the remaining proceeds to pay approximately $500 million of related taxes and repurchase shares. Had this transaction closed prior to this year, our 2015 reported sales and cost of goods sold would have been lower by approximately $3.8 billion and $3.1 billion, respectively, with no notable effect on EBITDA or EBIT. This transaction is expected to be accretive to EPS in every period following the closing, and should add 50 basis points or more to ROIC over time. In addition, due to the lower sales base without a significant effect on profits, we expect the transaction to have a favorable impact on our EBITDA and EBIT margin rates. Refer to Note 6 of the Financial Statements for additional information about the transaction.17Analysis of Results of OperationsSegment Results Percent Change(dollars in millions)2015201420132015/20142014/2013Sales$73,785$72,618$71,2791.6 %1.9 %Cost of sales51,99751,27850,0391.42.5Gross margin21,78821,34021,2402.10.5SG&A expenses (a)14,44814,50314,383(0.4)0.8EBITDA7,3406,8376,8577.4(0.3)Depreciation and amortization2,2132,1291,9963.96.7EBIT$5,127$4,708$4,8618.9 %(3.1)%Note: Effective January 15, 2015, we operate as a single segment which includes all of our continuing operations, excluding net interest expense, data breach related costs, and certain other expenses which are discretely managed. Our segment operations are designed to enable guests to purchase products seamlessly in stores or through our digital sales channels. Beginning with the first quarter of 2015, segment EBIT includes the impact of the reduction of the beneficial interest asset. For comparison purposes, prior years' segment EBIT has been revised. See Note 30 of our Financial Statements for a reconciliation of our segment results to earnings before income taxes.(a) SG&A includes credit card revenues and expenses for all periods presented prior to the March 2013 sale of our U.S. consumer credit card portfolio to TD. For 2015, 2014, and 2013, SG&A also includes $641 million, $629 million, and $555 million, respectively, of net profit-sharing income from the arrangement with TD.Rate Analysis201520142013Gross margin rate29.5%29.4%29.8%SG&A expense rate19.620.020.2EBITDA margin rate9.99.49.6Depreciation and amortization expense rate3.02.92.8EBIT margin rate6.96.56.8Note: Rate analysis metrics are computed by dividing the applicable amount by sales.SalesSales include merchandise sales, net of expected returns, and gift card breakage. Refer to Note 2 of the Financial Statements for a definition of gift card breakage. The increase in 2015 and 2014 sales reflects an increase in comparable sales of 2.1 percent and 1.3 percent, respectively, and the contribution from new stores, partially offset by a decrease in 2015 of approximately $550 million due to the sale of our pharmacy and clinic businesses. Inflation did not materially affect sales in any period presented.Sales by Channel201520142013Stores96.6%97.4%98.0%Digital3.42.62.0Total100%100%100%Comparable sales is a measure that highlights the performance of our existing stores and digital channel sales by measuring the change in sales for a period over the comparable, prior-year period of equivalent length. Comparable sales include all sales, except sales from stores open less than 13 months, digital acquisitions operating less than one year, stores that have been closed, and digital acquisitions that we no longer operate. Pharmacy and clinic sales for the comparable period following the sale to CVS are excluded from the calculation. Comparable sales measures vary across the retail industry. As a result, our comparable sales calculation is not necessarily comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies. 18Comparable Sales201520142013Comparable sales change2.1 %1.3 %(0.4)%Drivers of change in comparable sales: Number of transactions1.3(0.2)(2.7)Average transaction amount0.81.52.3Selling price per unit3.33.21.6Units per transaction(2.4)(1.6)0.7Contribution to Comparable Sales Change201520142013Stores channel comparable sales change1.3%0.7%(0.7)%Digital channel contribution to comparable sales change0.80.70.3Total comparable sales change2.1%1.3%(0.4)%Note: Amounts may not foot due to rounding.Sales by Product CategoryPercentage of Sales 201520142013Household essentials (a)26%25%25%Hardlines (b)171818Apparel and accessories (c)191919Food and pet supplies (d)212121Home furnishings and décor (e)171717Total100%100%100%(a) Includes pharmacy, beauty, personal care, baby care, cleaning, and paper products.

Additionally, we offer a branded proprietary Target Debit Card. Collectively, we refer to these products as REDcards®. Guests receive a 5 percent discount on virtually all purchases and free shipping at Target.com when they use a REDcard. We monitor the percentage of sales that are paid for using REDcards (REDcard Penetration) because our internal analysis has indicated that a meaningful portion of incremental purchases on our REDcards are also incremental sales for Target.REDcard Penetration201520142013Target Debit Card12.1%11.2%9.9%Target Credit Cards10.19.79.3Total REDcard Penetration22.3%20.9%19.3%Note: Excluding pharmacy and clinic sales, total REDcard penetration would have been 23.2 percent, 21.9 percent, and 20.1 percent for 2015, 2014, and 2013, respectively. The sum of Target Credit Cards and Target Debit Card penetration may not equal Total REDcard Penetration due to rounding.19Gross Margin Rate Our gross margin rate was 29.5 percent in 2015, 29.4 percent in 2014, and 29.8 percent in 2013. The 2015 increase was primarily due to favorable category sales mix and lower promotional activity relative to the highly promotional period in 2014 following the 2013 data breach, partially offset by the impact of increased digital channel sales.The 2014 decrease was primarily due to promotional activity. Selling, General and Administrative Expense Rate Our SG&A expense rate was 19.6 percent in 2015, 20.0 percent in 2014, and 20.2 percent in 2013. The decrease in 2015 primarily resulted from cost saving initiatives and reduced marketing expense, partially offset by investments in other initiatives, none of which were individually significant. We will continue to seek efficiency savings to reinvest in our business; however, we do not expect the SG&A rate to continue to decline at the pace realized during 2014 and 2015. The decrease in 2014 was primarily related to cost savings initiatives, partially offset by investments in technology and other initiatives, none of which were individually significant. 20Store DataChange in Number of Stores20152014Beginning store count1,7901,793Opened1516Closed(13)(19)Relocated——Ending store count1,7921,790Number of stores remodeled during the year939Number of Stores andRetail Square FeetNumber of Stores Retail Square Feet (a)January 30, 2016January 31, 2015 January 30, 2016January 31, 2015170,000 or more sq. ft.278280 49,68850,03750,000 to 169,999 sq. ft.1,5051,509 189,677189,9050 to 49,999 sq. ft.91 17421Total1,7921,790 239,539239,963(a) In thousands, reflects total square feet less office, distribution center and vacant space.Other Performance FactorsOther Selling, General and Administrative ExpensesWe recorded $216 million, $174 million, and $81 million of selling, general and administrative expenses outside of the segment during 2015, 2014, and 2013, respectively. Additional information about these items is provided within the Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Financial Measures to GAAP Measures on page 23 and Note 30 of the Financial Statements.Net Interest ExpenseNet interest expense from continuing operations was $607 million, $882 million, and $1,049 million for 2015, 2014, and 2013, respectively. Net interest expense for 2014 and 2013 included a loss on early retirement of debt of $285 million and $445 million, respectively.Provision for Income TaxesOur effective income tax rate from continuing operations decreased to 32.5 percent in 2015, from 33.0 percent in 2014, driven primarily by the $112 million tax benefit that resulted from releasing the valuation allowance on a capital loss related to our Canada exit. This benefit is recorded in continuing operations as the release of the valuation allowance is attributable to a capital gain generated by the CVS transaction. The tax rate benefit from this valuation allowance release was partially offset by a year-over-year decrease in the favorable resolution of various income tax matters and the rate impact of higher pretax earnings. The resolution of various income tax matters reduced tax expense by $8 million and $35 million in 2015 and 2014, respectively. Note 23 of the Financial Statements provides a tax rate reconciliation.Our effective income tax rate from continuing operations decreased to 33.0 percent in 2014, from 34.6 percent in 2013, driven primarily by the net tax effect of our global sourcing operations and the favorable resolution of various income tax matters. The resolution of various income tax matters reduced tax expense by $35 million and $16 million in 2014 and 2013, respectively.21Discontinued OperationsOn January 15, 2015, Target Canada Co. and certain other wholly owned subsidiaries of Target (collectively Canada Subsidiaries), comprising substantially all of our former Canadian operations and our former Canadian Segment, filed for protection (the Filing) under the Companies' Creditors Arrangement Act (CCAA) with the Ontario Superior Court of Justice in Toronto (the Court) and were deconsolidated. As a result, we recorded a pretax impairment loss on deconsolidation and other charges, collectively totaling $5.1 billion. The Canada Subsidiaries are executing a liquidation through the CCAA process. Income from discontinued operations, net of tax, was $42 million during 2015. In the fourth quarter of 2015, we reached settlements with two entities that controlled guaranteed leases representing approximately 46 percent of the recorded accrual at that time. Under the settlement terms, these entities have subrogated to us their claims against the Canada Subsidiaries. The settlement amounts were materially consistent with our previously recorded accruals. As part of a March 2016 settlement between the Canada Subsidiaries and all of their former landlords, we have agreed to subordinate a portion of our intercompany claims and make certain cash contributions to the estate in exchange for a full release from obligations under guarantees of certain leases. This agreement remains subject to creditor and Court approval. The financial impact of this agreement is materially consistent with amounts recorded in our financial statements.For more information about our Canada exit, see Note 7 of the Financial Statements.22Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Financial Measures to GAAP MeasuresTo provide additional transparency, we have disclosed non-GAAP adjusted diluted earnings per share from continuing operations (Adjusted EPS). This metric excludes the impact of the 2015 sale of our pharmacy and clinic businesses, the 2013 sale of our U.S. consumer credit card receivables portfolio, losses on early retirement of debt, net expenses related to the 2013 data breach, and other matters presented below. We believe this information is useful in providing period-to-period comparisons of the results of our continuing operations. This measure is not in accordance with, or an alternative to, generally accepted accounting principles in the United States (GAAP). The most comparable GAAP measure is diluted earnings per share from continuing operations. Adjusted EPS from continuing operations should not be considered in isolation or as a substitution for analysis of our results as reported under GAAP. Other companies may calculate non-GAAP adjusted EPS from continuing operations differently than we do, limiting the usefulness of the measure for comparisons with other companies. Prior year amounts have been revised to present Adjusted EPS on a continuing operations basis. 2015 2014 2013(millions, except per share data) Pretax Net of Tax Per Share Amounts Pretax Net of Tax Per Share Amounts Pretax Net of Tax Per Share AmountsGAAP diluted earnings per share from continuing operations $5.25 $3.83 $4.20Adjustments Gain on sale (a) $(620) $(487) $(0.77) $— $— $— $(391) $(247) $(0.38)Restructuring costs (b) 138 87 0.14 — — — — — —Loss on early retirement of debt — — — 285 173 0.27 445 270 0.42Data breach-related costs, net of insurance (c) 39 28 0.04 145 94 0.15 17 11 0.02Other (d) 39 29 0.05 29 18 0.03 64 40 0.06Resolution of income tax matters — (8) (0.01) — (35) (0.06) — (16) (0.03)Adjusted diluted earnings per share from continuing operations $4.69 $4.22 $4.29Note: The sum of the non-GAAP adjustments may not equal the total adjustment amounts due to rounding.(a) For 2015, includes the gain on the pharmacies and clinics transaction.

Operating leases are capitalized as part of the ROIC calculation to control for differences in capital structure between us and our competitors. We believe this metric provides a meaningful measure of the effectiveness of our capital allocation over time. Other companies may calculate ROIC differently than we do, limiting the usefulness of the measure for comparisons with other companies.

Due to the timing of the sale late in 2015, we did not fully deploy the net proceeds by the end of 2015. Short-term investments of $3,008 million and $1,520 million were included in cash and cash equivalents at the end of 2015 and 2014, respectively. Our investment policy is designed to preserve principal and liquidity of our short-term investments. This policy allows investments in large money market funds or in highly rated direct short-term instruments that mature in 60 days or less. We also place dollar limits on our investments in individual funds or instruments.Cash FlowsOur 2015 operations were funded by internally generated funds. Operating cash flow provided by continuing operations was $5,140 million in 2015 compared with $5,131 million in 2014. Proceeds from the sale of our pharmacy and clinic businesses to CVS are included in investing cash flows provided by continuing operations. These cash flows, combined with period year-end cash position, allowed us to invest in the business, pay dividends and repurchase shares under our share repurchase program.InventoryYear-end inventory was $8,601 million, compared with $8,282 million in 2014. The increase was due to investments to drive growth in certain merchandise categories, improve in-stocks, and earlier receipts of certain merchandise.Share RepurchasesIn June 2015, our Board of Directors authorized a $5 billion expansion of our existing share repurchase program to $10 billion. Under this program, we have repurchased 94.6 million shares of common stock through January 30, 2016, at an average price of $69.57, for a total investment of $6.6 billion.During 2015, we repurchased 44.7 million shares of our common stock, for a total investment of $3,441 million ($77.07 per share), including shares repurchased under accelerated share repurchase agreements. We did not repurchase any shares on the open market during 2014. However, as described in Note 25 to the Financial Statements, we reacquired 0.8 million shares upon the noncash settlement of prepaid forward contracts related to nonqualified deferred compensation plans.DividendsWe paid dividends totaling $1,362 million in 2015 and $1,205 million in 2014, an increase of 13.0 percent. We declared dividends totaling $1,378 million ($2.20 per share) in 2015, a per share increase of 10.6 percent over 2014. We declared dividends totaling $1,271 million ($1.99 per share) in 2014, a per share increase of 20.6 percent over 2013. We have paid dividends every quarter since our 1967 initial public offering, and it is our intent to continue to do so in the future.Short-term and Long-term FinancingOur financing strategy is to ensure liquidity and access to capital markets, to manage our net exposure to floating interest rate volatility, and to maintain a balanced spectrum of debt maturities. Within these parameters, we seek to minimize our borrowing costs. Our ability to access the long-term debt and commercial paper markets has provided us with ample sources of liquidity. Our continued access to these markets depends on multiple factors, including the condition of debt capital markets, our operating performance, and maintaining strong credit ratings. As of January 30, 2016, our credit ratings were as follows:Credit RatingsMoody'sStandard and Poor'sFitchLong-term debtA2AA-Commercial paperP-1A-1F225If our credit ratings were lowered, our ability to access the debt markets, our cost of funds, and other terms for new debt issuances could be adversely impacted. Each of the credit rating agencies reviews its rating periodically and there is no guarantee our current credit ratings will remain the same as described above. In 2015, we funded our peak holiday sales period working capital needs through internally generated funds. In 2014, we funded our peak holiday sales period working capital needs through internally generated funds and the issuance of commercial paper.

No balances were outstanding at any time during 2015, 2014, or 2013 under this facility.Most of our long-term debt obligations contain covenants related to secured debt levels. In addition to a secured debt level covenant, our credit facility also contains a debt leverage covenant. We are, and expect to remain, in compliance with these covenants. Additionally, at January 30, 2016, no notes or debentures contained provisions requiring acceleration of payment upon a credit rating downgrade, except that certain outstanding notes allow the note holders to put the notes to us if within a matter of months of each other we experience both (i) a change in control and (ii) our long-term credit ratings are either reduced and the resulting rating is non-investment grade, or our long-term credit ratings are placed on watch for possible reduction and those ratings are subsequently reduced and the resulting rating is non-investment grade.We believe our sources of liquidity will continue to be adequate to maintain operations, finance anticipated expansion and strategic initiatives, fund obligations incurred as a result of our exit from Canada, pay dividends, and execute purchases under our share repurchase program for the foreseeable future. Our exit from Canada increased our after-tax cash flows beginning in 2015. We continue to anticipate ample access to commercial paper and long-term financing.Capital ExpendituresCapital Expenditures2015 2014 2013(millions) Information technology, distribution and other$1,289 $1,306 $1,069New stores115 381 536Store remodels and expansions34 99 281Total$1,438 $1,786 $1,886Capital expenditures decreased in 2015 from the prior year as we opened fewer large-format stores and realized efficiency gains in technology, partially offset by increased guest experience and supply chain investments. Capital expenditures were less than our initial expectations reflecting efficiency gains in technology combined with the impact of project timing shifts as we aligned investments against specific initiatives to drive growth, invest in our supply chain, and build out our omnichannel capabilities. Capital expenditures decreased in 2014 from the prior year due to fewer remodels and new stores, partially offset by increased technology investments to support our omnichannel efforts and security enhancements. We expect capital expenditures in 2016 to return to a level comparable with 2013 and 2014.26Commitments and ContingenciesContractual Obligations as ofPayments Due by PeriodJanuary 30, 2016 Less than 1-33-5After 5(millions)Total1 YearYearsYearsYearsRecorded contractual obligations: Long-term debt (a)$11,955$751$2,453$2,095$6,656Capital lease obligations (b)1,6901301441391,277Deferred compensation (c)49957118125199Real estate liabilities (d)5252———Tax contingencies (e)—————Loss contingencies (f)—————Unrecorded contractual obligations: Interest payments – long-term debt6,7175699367534,459Operating leases (b)3,7131863613242,842Purchase obligations (g)1,950605801379165Real estate obligations (h)22719235——Future contributions to retirement plans (i)—————Contractual obligations$26,803$2,542$4,848$3,815$15,598(a) Represents principal payments only. See Note 20 of the Financial Statements for further information.(b) These payments also include $311 million and $90 million of legally binding minimum lease payments for stores that are expected to open in 2016 or later for capital and operating leases, respectively. Capital lease obligations include interest. See Note 22 of the Financial Statements for further information.(c) Deferred compensation obligations include commitments related to our nonqualified deferred compensation plans. The timing of deferred compensation payouts is estimated based on payments currently made to former employees and retirees, forecasted investment returns, and the projected timing of future retirements.(d) Real estate liabilities include costs incurred but not paid related to the construction or remodeling of real estate and facilities.(e) Estimated tax contingencies of $215 million, including interest and penalties and primarily related to continuing operations, are not included in the table above because we are not able to make reasonably reliable estimates of the period of cash settlement. See Note 23 of the Financial Statements for further information.(f) Estimated loss contingencies, including those related to the Canada Exit and the 2013 data breach, are not included in the table above because we are not able to make reasonably reliable estimates of the period of cash settlement. See Note 7 and Note 19 of the Financial Statements for further information. (g) Purchase obligations include all legally binding contracts such as firm minimum commitments for inventory purchases, merchandise royalties, equipment purchases, marketing-related contracts, software acquisition/license commitments, and service contracts. We issue inventory purchase orders in the normal course of business, which represent authorizations to purchase that are cancelable by their terms. We do not consider purchase orders to be firm inventory commitments; therefore, they are excluded from the table above. If we choose to cancel a purchase order, we may be obligated to reimburse the vendor for unrecoverable outlays incurred prior to cancellation. We also issue trade letters of credit in the ordinary course of business, which are excluded from this table as these obligations are conditioned on terms of the letter of credit being met.(h) Real estate obligations include commitments for the purchase, construction, or remodeling of real estate and facilities.(i) We have not included obligations under our pension plans in the contractual obligations table above because no additional amounts are required to be funded as of January 30, 2016. Our historical practice regarding these plans has been to contribute amounts necessary to satisfy minimum pension funding requirements, plus periodic discretionary amounts determined to be appropriate.Off Balance Sheet Arrangements: Other than the unrecorded contractual obligations noted above, we do not have any arrangements or relationships with entities that are not consolidated into the financial statements.Critical Accounting EstimatesOur analysis of operations and financial condition is based on our consolidated financial statements prepared in accordance with GAAP. Preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions affecting the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements, reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period, and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities. In the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, we describe the significant accounting policies used in preparing the consolidated financial statements. Our estimates are evaluated on an ongoing basis and are drawn from historical experience and other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results could differ under other assumptions or conditions. However, except as discussed below regarding Canada Exit-related costs, we do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood that there will be a material change in future 27estimates or assumptions. Our senior management has discussed the development and selection of our critical accounting estimates with the Audit & Finance Committee of our Board of Directors. The following items in our consolidated financial statements require significant estimation or judgment:Inventory and cost of sales: We use the retail inventory method to account for the majority of our inventory and the related cost of sales. Under this method, inventory is stated at cost using the last-in, first-out (LIFO) method as determined by applying a cost-to-retail ratio to each merchandise grouping's ending retail value. The cost of our inventory includes the amount we pay to our suppliers to acquire inventory, freight costs incurred in connection with the delivery of product to our distribution centers and stores, and import costs, reduced by vendor income and cash discounts. The majority of our distribution center operating costs, including compensation and benefits, are expensed to cost of sales in the period incurred. Since inventory value is adjusted regularly to reflect market conditions, our inventory methodology reflects the lower of cost or market. We reduce inventory for estimated losses related to shrink and markdowns. Our shrink estimate is based on historical losses verified by physical inventory counts. Historically, our actual physical inventory count results have shown our estimates to be reliable. Markdowns designated for clearance activity are recorded when the salability of the merchandise has diminished. Inventory is at risk of obsolescence if economic conditions change, including changing consumer demand, guest preferences, changing consumer credit markets, or increasing competition. We believe these risks are largely mitigated because our inventory typically turns in less than three months. Inventory was $8,601 million and $8,282 million at January 30, 2016 and January 31, 2015, respectively, and is further described in Note 12 of the Financial Statements.Vendor income receivable: Cost of sales and SG&A expenses are partially offset by various forms of consideration received from our vendors (Vendor Income). Vendor Income is earned for a variety of programs, such as volume rebates, markdown allowances, promotions, advertising allowances, and compliance programs. We establish a receivable for Vendor Income that is earned but not yet received. Based on the agreements in place, this receivable is computed by estimating when we have completed our performance and when the amount is earned. The majority of year-end Vendor Income receivables are collected within the following fiscal quarter, and we do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood that the assumptions used in our estimate will change significantly. Historically, adjustments to our Vendor Income receivable have not been material. Excluding pharmacy-related receivables, which were insignificant at period-end, Vendor Income receivable was $379 million and $426 million at January 30, 2016 and January 31, 2015, respectively. The Vendor Income receivable balance is described further in Note 4 of the Financial Statements.Long-lived assets: Long-lived assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amounts may not be recoverable. The evaluation is performed at the lowest level of identifiable cash flows independent of other assets. An impairment loss would be recognized when estimated undiscounted future cash flows from the operation and/or disposition of the assets are less than their carrying amount. Measurement of an impairment loss would be based on the excess of the carrying amount of the asset group over its fair value. Fair value is measured using discounted cash flows or independent opinions of value, as appropriate. We recorded impairments of $54 million, $124 million, and $77 million in 2015, 2014, and 2013, respectively, which are described further in Note 14. As of January 30, 2016, a 10 percent decrease in the fair value of assets we intend to sell or close would result in additional impairment of $7 million in 2015. Historically, we have not realized material losses upon sale of long-lived assets.Investments in and receivables from Canada Subsidiaries: We determined the fair value and recoverability of our Canadian investments by comparing the estimated fair value of the underlying assets of the Canada Subsidiaries to estimated liabilities. We estimated the fair value of the major asset classes using estimated selling price less cost to sell, the income approach based on estimated market rents and capitalization rates, and discounted cash flow analysis of the differential between estimated market rent and contractual rent payments, as appropriate. We also applied an estimated liquidation discount to reflect the CCAA filing. Outstanding liabilities include accounts payable and other liabilities, forward commitments, unsubordinated related party payables, lease liabilities, and other potential claims. Potential claims include an accrual for the estimated probable loss related to claims that may be asserted against the Canada Subsidiaries under certain contracts. Based on our estimates, the fair value of liabilities exceeds the fair value of assets. To assess the fair value and recoverability of amounts receivable from the Canada Subsidiaries, we estimated the fair value of the underlying net assets of the Canada Subsidiaries available for distribution to their creditors in relation to the estimated creditor claims and the priority of those claims.28Our estimates involve significant judgment and are based on currently available information, an assessment of the validity of certain claims, and estimated payments by the Canada Subsidiaries. Our ultimate recovery is subject to the final liquidation value of the Canada Subsidiaries and may vary significantly from our current estimates. See Note 7 of the Financial Statements for further information.Insurance/self-insurance: We retain a substantial portion of the risk related to certain general liability, workers' compensation, property loss, and team member medical and dental claims. However, we maintain stop-loss coverage to limit the exposure related to certain risks. Liabilities associated with these losses include estimates of both claims filed and losses incurred but not yet reported. We use actuarial methods which consider a number of factors to estimate our ultimate cost of losses. General liability and workers' compensation liabilities are recorded at our estimate of their net present value; other liabilities referred to above are not discounted. Our workers' compensation and general liability accrual was $498 million and $566 million at January 30, 2016 and January 31, 2015, respectively. We believe that the amounts accrued are appropriate; however, our liabilities could be significantly affected if future occurrences or loss developments differ from our assumptions. For example, a five percent increase or decrease in average claim costs would impact our self-insurance expense by $25 million in 2015. Historically, adjustments to our estimates have not been material. Refer to Item 7A, Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk, for further disclosure of the market risks associated with these exposures. We maintain insurance coverage to limit our exposure to certain events, including network security matters. Income taxes: We pay income taxes based on the tax statutes, regulations, and case law of the various jurisdictions in which we operate. Significant judgment is required in determining the timing and amounts of deductible and taxable items, and in evaluating the ultimate resolution of tax matters in dispute with tax authorities. The benefits of uncertain tax positions are recorded in our financial statements only after determining it is likely the uncertain tax positions would withstand challenge by taxing authorities. We periodically reassess these probabilities, and record any changes in the financial statements as appropriate. Liabilities for uncertain tax positions, including interest and penalties, were $215 million and $195 million at January 30, 2016 and January 31, 2015, respectively, and primarily relate to continuing operations. We believe the resolution of these matters will not have a material adverse impact on our consolidated financial statements. Income taxes are described further in Note 23 of the Financial Statements.Pension accounting: We maintain a funded qualified, defined benefit pension plan, as well as several smaller and unfunded nonqualified plans for certain current and retired team members. The costs for these plans are determined based on actuarial calculations using the assumptions described in the following paragraphs. Eligibility and the level of benefits varies depending on team members' full-time or part-time status, date of hire, and/or length of service. The benefit obligation and related expense for these plans are determined based on actuarial calculations using assumptions about the expected long-term rate of return, the discount rate, and compensation growth rates. The assumptions, with adjustments made for any significant plan or participant changes, are used to determine the period-end benefit obligation and establish expense for the next year.Our 2015 expected long-term rate of return on plan assets of 7.5 percent is determined by the portfolio composition, historical long-term investment performance, and current market conditions. Our compound annual rate of return on qualified plans' assets was 8.4 percent, 7.2 percent, 6.8 percent, and 8.5 percent for the 5-year, 10-year, 15-year, and 20-year periods, respectively. A one percentage point decrease in our expected long-term rate of return would increase annual expense by $35 million. Based on a change in our asset allocation policy in late 2015, our expected long-term rate of return is 6.8 percent for 2016. The discount rate used to determine benefit obligations is adjusted annually based on the interest rate for long-term high-quality corporate bonds, using yields for maturities that are in line with the duration of our pension liabilities. Our benefit obligation and related expense will fluctuate with changes in interest rates. A 0.5 percentage point decrease to the weighted average discount rate would increase annual expense by $32 million.Based on our experience, we use a graduated compensation growth schedule that assumes higher compensation growth for younger, shorter-service pension-eligible team members than it does for older, longer-service pension-eligible team members.Pension benefits are further described in Note 28 of the Financial Statements.Legal and other contingencies: We are exposed to other claims and litigation arising in the ordinary course of business and use various methods to resolve these matters in a manner that we believe serves the best interest of our shareholders and other constituents. When a loss is probable, we record an accrual based on the reasonably estimable loss or range of loss. When no point of loss is more likely than another, we record the lowest amount in the estimated 29range of loss and disclose the estimated range. We do not record liabilities for reasonably possible loss contingencies, but do disclose a range of reasonably possible losses if they are material and we are able to estimate such a range. If we cannot provide a range of reasonably possible losses, we explain the factors that prevent us from determining such a range. Historically, adjustments to our estimates have not been material. We believe the accruals recorded in our consolidated financial statements properly reflect loss exposures that are both probable and reasonably estimable. With the exception of Canada Exit-related loss exposures, we do not believe any of the currently identified claims or litigation may materially affect our results of operations, cash flows, or financial condition. However, litigation is subject to inherent uncertainties, and unfavorable rulings could occur. If an unfavorable ruling were to occur, it may cause a material adverse impact on the results of operations, cash flows, or financial condition for the period in which the ruling occurs, or future periods. Refer to Note 7 of the Financial Statements for further information on the Canada Exit-related contingencies, respectively.New Accounting PronouncementsIn February 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-02, Leases, to require organizations that lease assets to recognize the rights and obligations created by those leases on the balance sheet. The new standard is effective in 2019, with early adoption permitted. We are currently evaluating the effect the new standard will have on our financial statements.We do not expect that any other recently issued accounting pronouncements will have a material effect on our financial statements.Forward-Looking StatementsThis report contains forward-looking statements, which are based on our current assumptions and expectations. These statements are typically accompanied by the words ""expect,"" ""may,"" ""could,"" ""believe,"" ""would,"" ""might,"" ""anticipates,"" or words of similar import. The principal forward-looking statements in this report include: our financial performance, statements regarding the adequacy of and costs associated with our sources of liquidity, the expected impact of the pharmacies and clinics sale transaction on our financial performance and the anticipated use of proceeds, the continued execution of our share repurchase program, our expected capital expenditures, the impact of changes in the expected effective income tax rate on net income, the expected compliance with debt covenants, the expected impact of new accounting pronouncements, our intentions regarding future dividends, contributions and payments related to our pension plan, the expected returns on pension plan assets, the timing and financial impact of discontinuing postretirement health care benefits that were offered to team members upon early retirement and prior to Medicare eligibility, the expected timing and recognition of compensation expenses, the effects of macroeconomic conditions, the adequacy of our reserves for general liability, workers' compensation and property loss, the expected outcome of, and adequacy of our reserves for investigations, inquiries, claims and litigation, including those related to the 2013 data breach and discontinuing our Canadian operations, expected changes to our contractual obligations and liabilities, the expected ability to recognize deferred tax assets and liabilities and the timing of such recognition, the process, timing and effects of discontinuing our Canadian operations, the resolution of tax matters, changes in our assumptions and expectations, and the expected benefits and timing of cash disbursements related to restructuring activities.All such forward-looking statements are intended to enjoy the protection of the safe harbor for forward-looking statements contained in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, as amended. Although we believe there is a reasonable basis for the forward-looking statements, our actual results could be materially different. The most important factors which could cause our actual results to differ from our forward-looking statements are set forth on our description of risk factors in Item 1A to this Form 10-K, which should be read in conjunction with the forward-looking statements in this report. Forward-looking statements speak only as of the date they are made, and we do not undertake any obligation to update any forward-looking statement.30Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market RiskAt January 30, 2016, our exposure to market risk was primarily from interest rate changes on our debt obligations, some of which are at a LIBOR-plus floating-rate. Our interest rate exposure is primarily due to differences between our floating rate debt obligations compared to our floating rate short term investments. At January 30, 2016, our floating rate short-term investments exceeded our floating rate debt by approximately $1,758 million. Based on our balance sheet position at January 30, 2016, the annualized effect of a 0.1 percentage point decrease in floating interest rates on our floating rate short-term investments, net of our debt obligations, would decrease earnings before income taxes by approximately $2 million. In general, we expect our floating rate debt to exceed our floating rate short-term investments over time, but that may vary in different interest rate environments. See further description of our debt and derivative instruments in Notes 20 and 21 of the Notes to Financial Statements.We record our general liability and workers' compensation liabilities at net present value; therefore, these liabilities fluctuate with changes in interest rates. Based on our balance sheet position at January 30, 2016, the annualized effect of a 0.5 percentage point decrease in interest rates would be to decrease earnings before income taxes by $9 million.In addition, we are exposed to market return fluctuations on our qualified defined benefit pension plans. The value of our pension liabilities is inversely related to changes in interest rates. A 0.5 percentage point decrease to the weighted average discount rate would increase annual expense by $32 million. To protect against declines in interest rates, we hold high-quality, long-duration bonds and interest rate swaps in our pension plan trust. At year-end, we had hedged 55 percent of the interest rate exposure of our funded status.As more fully described in Note 15 and Note 27 of the Financial Statements, we are exposed to market returns on accumulated team member balances in our nonqualified, unfunded deferred compensation plans. We control the risk of offering the nonqualified plans by making investments in life insurance contracts and prepaid forward contracts on our own common stock that offset a substantial portion of our economic exposure to the returns on these plans. The annualized effect of a one percentage point change in market returns on our nonqualified defined contribution plans (inclusive of the effect of the investment vehicles used to manage our economic exposure) would not be significant.There have been no other material changes in our primary risk exposures or management of market risks since the prior year.31",2023-12-30 21:32:54.843231
27419,TGT,TARGET CORP,2017,"Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of OperationsExecutive SummaryFiscal 2016 included the following notable items:•GAAP earnings per share from continuing operations were $4.58.•Adjusted earnings per share were $5.01.•Comparable sales decreased 0.5 percent, reflecting a 0.8 percent decrease in traffic. •Comparable digital channel sales growth of 27 percent contributed 1.0 percentage points of comparable sales growth.•We returned $5.0 billion to shareholders through dividends and share repurchase.Sales were $69,495 million for 2016, a decrease of $4,290 million or 5.8 percent from the prior year, primarily due to the Pharmacy Transaction. Earnings from continuing operations before interest expense and income taxes in 2016 decreased by $561 million or 10.1 percent from 2015 to $4,969 million, primarily due to the 2015 gain on the Pharmacy Transaction. Operating cash flow provided by continuing operations was $5,329 million, $5,254 million, and $5,157 million for 2016, 2015, and 2014, respectively. In 2015, proceeds from the Pharmacy Transaction are included in investing cash flows provided by continuing operations. Refer to Note 6 of the Financial Statements for additional information about the transaction. 16Earnings Per Share From Continuing Operations Percent Change2016201520142016/20152015/2014GAAP diluted earnings per share $4.58$5.25$3.83(12.7)%37.2%Adjustments0.42(0.56)0.39 Adjusted diluted earnings per share $5.01$4.69$4.226.7 %11.3%Note: Amounts may not foot due to rounding. Adjusted diluted earnings per share from continuing operations (Adjusted EPS), a non-GAAP metric, excludes the impact of certain items not related to our routine retail operations. Management believes that Adjusted EPS is meaningful to provide period-to-period comparisons of our operating results. A reconciliation of non-GAAP financial measures to GAAP measures is provided on page 21.We report after-tax return on invested capital (ROIC) from continuing operations because we believe ROIC provides a meaningful measure of our capital-allocation effectiveness over time. For the trailing twelve months ended January 28, 2017, ROIC was 15.0 percent, compared with 16.0 percent for the trailing twelve months ended January 30, 2016. Excluding the net gain on the Pharmacy Transaction, ROIC was 13.9 percent for the trailing twelve months ended January 30, 2016. A reconciliation of ROIC is provided on page 22.

Refer to Note 2 of the Financial Statements for a definition of gift card breakage. Digital channel sales include all sales initiated through mobile applications and our conventional websites. Digital channel sales may be fulfilled through our distribution centers, our vendors, or our stores. The decrease in 2016 sales reflects a decrease of approximately $3,815 million due to the Pharmacy Transaction and a comparable sales decrease of 0.5 percent, partially offset by the contribution from new stores. The increase in 2015 sales reflects an increase in comparable sales of 2.1 percent and the contribution from new stores, partially offset by a decrease of approximately $550 million due to the Pharmacy Transaction.

Comparable sales include all sales, except sales from stores open less than 13 months, digital acquisitions we have owned less than 13 months, stores that have been closed, and digital acquisitions that we no longer operate. We removed pharmacy and clinic sales from the 2015 sales amounts when calculating 2016 comparable sales. Comparable sales measures vary across the retail industry. As a result, our comparable sales calculation is not necessarily comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies.

Additionally, we offer a branded proprietary Target Debit Card. Collectively, we refer to these products as REDcards®. Guests receive a 5 percent discount on virtually all purchases and free shipping at Target.com when they use a REDcard. We monitor the percentage of sales that are paid for using REDcards (REDcard Penetration) because our internal analysis has indicated that a meaningful portion of incremental purchases on our REDcards are also incremental sales for Target.REDcard Penetration201620152014Target Debit Card12.8%12.1%11.2%Target Credit Cards11.210.19.7Total REDcard Penetration24.0%22.3%20.9%Note: Excluding pharmacy and clinic sales, total REDcard penetration would have been 23.2 percent and 21.9 percent for 2015 and 2014, respectively. The sum of Target Credit Cards and Target Debit Card penetration may not equal Total REDcard Penetration due to rounding.Gross Margin Rate Our gross margin rate was 29.7 percent in 2016, 29.5 percent in 2015, and 29.4 percent in 2014. The 2016 increase was primarily due to the Pharmacy Transaction and favorable category sales mix, partially offset by increased shipping and digital fulfillment costs. Cost of goods savings helped offset the impact of a competitive promotional environment.19The 2015 increase was primarily due to favorable category sales mix and lower promotional activity relative to the highly promotional period in 2014 following the 2013 data breach, partially offset by the impact of increased digital channel sales.Selling, General and Administrative Expense Rate Our SG&A expense rate was 19.2 percent in 2016, 19.6 percent in 2015, and 20.0 percent in 2014. The decrease in 2016 primarily resulted from the benefit of the Pharmacy Transaction and technology-related cost savings, partially offset by increased stores hourly payroll.The decrease in 2015 primarily resulted from cost saving initiatives and reduced marketing expense, partially offset by investments in other initiatives, none of which were individually significant.Store DataChange in Number of Stores20162015Beginning store count1,7921,790Opened1515Closed(5)(13)Ending store count1,8021,792Number of Stores andRetail Square FeetNumber of Stores Retail Square Feet (a)January 28, 2017January 30, 2016 January 28, 2017January 30, 2016170,000 or more sq. ft.276278 49,32849,68850,000 to 169,999 sq. ft.1,5041,505 189,620189,67749,999 or less sq. ft.229 554174Total1,8021,792 239,502239,539(a) In thousands, reflects total square feet less office, distribution center and vacant space.Other Performance FactorsOther Selling, General and Administrative ExpensesWe recorded $(4) million, $216 million, and $174 million of selling, general and administrative expenses outside of the segment during 2016, 2015, and 2014, respectively, because they relate to discretely managed matters. Additional information about these discretely managed items is provided within Note 30 of the Financial Statements.20Net Interest ExpenseNet interest expense from continuing operations was $1,004 million, $607 million, and $882 million for 2016, 2015, and 2014, respectively. Net interest expense for 2016 and 2014 included a loss on early retirement of debt of $422 million and $285 million, respectively.Provision for Income TaxesOur 2016 effective income tax rate from continuing operations increased to 32.7 percent, from 32.5 percent in 2015, driven primarily by the 2015 rate impact of the $112 million tax benefit from releasing the valuation allowance on a capital loss. This comparative rate impact was partially offset by $27 million of excess tax benefit in 2016 related to shared-based payments after the adoption of Accounting Standards Update (ASU) No. 2016-09, Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting, and lower pretax earnings. Note 23 of the Financial Statements provides a tax rate reconciliation.Our 2015 effective income tax rate from continuing operations decreased to 32.5 percent, from 33.0 percent in 2014, driven primarily by the $112 million tax benefit from releasing the valuation allowance on a capital loss. This benefit was partially offset by a year-over-year decrease in the favorable resolution of various income tax matters and the rate impact of higher pretax earnings. The resolution of various income tax matters reduced tax expense by $8 million and $35 million in 2015 and 2014, respectively.Discontinued OperationsSee Note 7 of the Financial Statements for information about our Canada exit.Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Financial Measures to GAAP MeasuresTo provide additional transparency, we have disclosed non-GAAP adjusted diluted earnings per share from continuing operations (Adjusted EPS). This metric excludes certain items presented below. We believe this information is useful in providing period-to-period comparisons of the results of our continuing operations. This measure is not in accordance with, or an alternative to, generally accepted accounting principles in the United States (GAAP). The most comparable GAAP measure is diluted earnings per share from continuing operations. Adjusted EPS should not be considered in isolation or as a substitution for analysis of our results as reported under GAAP. Other companies may calculate Adjusted EPS differently than we do, limiting the usefulness of the measure for comparisons with other companies. 2016 2015 2014(millions, except per share data) Pretax Net of Tax Per Share Amounts Pretax Net of Tax Per Share Amounts Pretax Net of Tax Per Share AmountsGAAP diluted earnings per share from continuing operations $4.58 $5.25 $3.83Adjustments Loss on early retirement of debt $422 $257 $0.44 $— $— $— $285 $173 $0.27Gain on sale (a) — — — (620) (487) (0.77) — — —Restructuring costs (b) — — — 138 87 0.14 — — —Data breach-related costs, net of insurance (c) — — — 39 28 0.04 145 94 0.15Other (d) (4) (2) — 39 29 0.05 29 18 0.03Resolution of income tax matters — (7) (0.01) — (8) (0.01) — (35) (0.06)Adjusted diluted earnings per share from continuing operations $5.01 $4.69 $4.22Note: Amounts may not foot due to rounding.(a) Refer to Note 6 of the Financial Statements.

The 2014 amounts include impairments of $16 million related to undeveloped land in the U.S. and $13 million of expense related to converting co-branded card program to MasterCard. 21We have also disclosed after-tax return on invested capital for continuing operations (ROIC), which is a ratio based on GAAP information, with the exception of adjustments made to capitalize operating leases. Operating leases are capitalized as part of the ROIC calculation to control for differences in capital structure between us and our competitors. We believe this metric provides a meaningful measure of the effectiveness of our capital allocation over time. Other companies may calculate ROIC differently than we do, limiting the usefulness of the measure for comparisons with other companies.

Capitalized operating lease obligations and operating lease interest should not be considered in isolation or as a substitution for analysis of our results as reported under GAAP. 22Reconciliation of Capitalized Operating Leases Trailing Twelve Months(dollars in millions) January 28, 2017 January 30, 2016 January 31, 2015Total rent expense $148 $182 $186Capitalized operating lease obligations (total rent expense x 8) 1,187 1,457 1,490Operating lease interest (capitalized operating lease obligations x 6%) 71 87 n/aAnalysis of Financial ConditionLiquidity and Capital ResourcesOur period-end cash and cash equivalents balance decreased to $2,512 million from $4,046 million in 2015, primarily reflecting deployment during 2016 of proceeds from the Pharmacy Transaction and payment of related taxes. Due to the timing of the sale late in 2015, we did not fully deploy the net proceeds by the end of 2015. Short-term investments of $1,110 million and $3,008 million were included in cash and cash equivalents at the end of 2016 and 2015, respectively. Our investment policy is designed to preserve principal and liquidity of our short-term investments. This policy allows investments in large money market funds or in highly rated direct short-term instruments that mature in 60 days or less. We also place dollar limits on our investments in individual funds or instruments.Capital AllocationWe follow a disciplined and balanced approach to capital allocation based on the following priorities, ranked in order of importance: first, we fully invest in opportunities to profitably grow our business, create sustainable long-term value, and maintain our current operations and assets; second, we maintain a competitive quarterly dividend and seek to grow it annually; and finally, we return any excess cash to shareholders by repurchasing shares within the limits of our credit rating goals.Cash FlowsOur 2016 operations were funded by internally and externally generated funds. Operating cash flow provided by continuing operations was $5,329 million in 2016 compared with $5,254 million in 2015. These cash flows, combined with period year-end cash position, allowed us to invest in the business, fund early debt retirement and maturities, pay dividends, and repurchase shares under our share repurchase program. Proceeds from the Pharmacy Transaction are included in investing cash flows provided by continuing operations during 2015. InventoryYear-end inventory was $8,309 million, compared with $8,601 million in 2015. The decrease was due to our alignment of inventory levels with the slowing sales trend while appropriately supporting instocks.Share RepurchasesDuring 2016, 2015, and 2014 we returned $3,686 million, $3,441 million, and $41 million, respectively, to shareholders through share repurchase. See Part II, Item 5 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K and Note 25 to the Financial Statements for more information.DividendsWe paid dividends totaling $1,348 million ($2.32 per share) in 2016 and $1,362 million ($2.16 per share) in 2015, a per share increase of 7.4 percent. We declared dividends totaling $1,359 million ($2.36 per share) in 2016, a per share increase of 7.3 percent over 2015. We declared dividends totaling $1,378 million ($2.20 per share) in 2015, a per share increase of 10.6 percent over 2014. We have paid dividends every quarter since our 1967 initial public offering, and it is our intent to continue to do so in the future.23Short-term and Long-term FinancingOur financing strategy is to ensure liquidity and access to capital markets, maintain a balanced spectrum of debt maturities, and manage our net exposure to floating interest rate volatility. Within these parameters, we seek to minimize our borrowing costs. Our ability to access the long-term debt and commercial paper markets has provided us with ample sources of liquidity. Our continued access to these markets depends on multiple factors, including the condition of debt capital markets, our operating performance, and maintaining strong credit ratings. As of January 28, 2017, our credit ratings were as follows:Credit RatingsMoody'sStandard and Poor'sFitchLong-term debtA2AA-Commercial paperP-1A-1F2If our credit ratings were lowered, our ability to access the debt markets, our cost of funds, and other terms for new debt issuances could be adversely impacted. Each of the credit rating agencies reviews its rating periodically and there is no guarantee our current credit ratings will remain the same as described above. In 2016, we funded our peak holiday sales period working capital needs through internally generated funds and the issuance of commercial paper. In 2015, we funded our peak holiday sales period working capital needs through internally generated funds. Commercial Paper (dollars in millions)201620152014Maximum daily amount outstanding during the year$89$—$590Average amount outstanding during the year1—129Amount outstanding at year-end———Weighted average interest rate0.43%—%0.11%We have additional liquidity through a committed $2.5 billion revolving credit facility obtained through a group of banks in October 2016 which expires in October 2021. This new unsecured revolving credit facility replaced a $2.25 billion unsecured revolving credit facility that was scheduled to expire in October 2018. No balances were outstanding under either credit facility at any time during 2016, 2015, or 2014.Most of our long-term debt obligations contain covenants related to secured debt levels. In addition to a secured debt level covenant, our credit facility also contains a debt leverage covenant. We are, and expect to remain, in compliance with these covenants. Additionally, at January 28, 2017, no notes or debentures contained provisions requiring acceleration of payment upon a credit rating downgrade, except that certain outstanding notes allow the note holders to put the notes to us if within a matter of months of each other we experience both (i) a change in control and (ii) our long-term credit ratings are either reduced and the resulting rating is non-investment grade, or our long-term credit ratings are placed on watch for possible reduction and those ratings are subsequently reduced and the resulting rating is non-investment grade.We believe our sources of liquidity will continue to be adequate to maintain operations, finance anticipated expansion and strategic initiatives, fund debt maturities, pay dividends, and execute purchases under our share repurchase program for the foreseeable future. We continue to anticipate ample access to commercial paper and long-term financing.24Capital Expenditures(a) In addition to these cash investments, we entered into leases related to new stores in 2016, 2015, and 2014 with total future minimum lease payments of $550 million, $338 million, and $85 million, respectively. Capital expenditures increased in 2016 from the prior year because we increased our investments in existing stores, including remodels and guest experience enhancements. These increases were partially offset by continued efficiency gains in technology. Capital expenditures decreased in 2015 from the prior year as we opened fewer large-format stores and realized efficiency gains in technology, partially offset by increased guest experience and supply chain investments. As noted in the footnote to the chart presented above, we substantially increased our investments in leases in 2016 and 2015.We expect capital expenditures in 2017 to increase to approximately $2.0 billion to $2.5 billion as we accelerate the rate of store remodels and flexible-format store openings, and continue to make supply chain investments. We also expect our rate of investment in store leases to continue to increase. 25Commitments and ContingenciesContractual Obligations as ofPayments Due by PeriodJanuary 28, 2017 Less than 1-33-5After 5(millions)Total1 YearYearsYearsYearsRecorded contractual obligations: Long-term debt (a)$11,814$1,683$1,203$2,150$6,778Capital lease obligations (b)1,963821741781,529Deferred compensation (c)51556114121224Real estate liabilities (d)5252———Tax contingencies (e)—————Unrecorded contractual obligations: Interest payments – long-term debt6,3085108197104,269Operating leases (b)3,8761983983642,916Purchase obligations (f)1,762609814107232Real estate obligations (g)21618531——Future contributions to retirement plans (h)—————Contractual obligations$26,506$3,375$3,553$3,630$15,948(a) Represents principal payments only. See Note 20 of the Financial Statements for further information.(b) These payments also include $348 million and $269 million of legally binding minimum lease payments for stores that are expected to open in 2017 or later for capital and operating leases, respectively. See Note 22 of the Financial Statements for further information.(c) The timing of deferred compensation payouts is estimated based on payments currently made to former employees and retirees, forecasted investment returns, and the projected timing of future retirements.(d) Real estate liabilities include costs incurred but not paid related to the construction or remodeling of real estate and facilities.(e) Estimated tax contingencies of $222 million, including interest and penalties and primarily related to continuing operations, are not included in the table above because we are not able to make reasonably reliable estimates of the period of cash settlement. See Note 23 of the Financial Statements for further information.(f) Purchase obligations include all legally binding contracts such as firm minimum commitments for inventory purchases, merchandise royalties, equipment purchases, marketing-related contracts, software acquisition/license commitments, and service contracts. We issue inventory purchase orders in the normal course of business, which represent authorizations to purchase that are cancelable by their terms. We do not consider purchase orders to be firm inventory commitments; therefore, they are excluded from the table above. If we choose to cancel a purchase order, we may be obligated to reimburse the vendor for unrecoverable outlays incurred prior to cancellation. We also issue trade letters of credit in the ordinary course of business, which are excluded from this table as these obligations are conditioned on terms of the letter of credit being met.(g) Real estate obligations include commitments for the purchase, construction, or remodeling of real estate and facilities.(h) We have not included obligations under our pension plans in the contractual obligations table above because no additional amounts are required to be funded as of January 28, 2017. Our historical practice regarding these plans has been to contribute amounts necessary to satisfy minimum pension funding requirements, plus periodic discretionary amounts determined to be appropriate.Off Balance Sheet Arrangements: Other than the unrecorded contractual obligations noted above, we do not have any arrangements or relationships with entities that are not consolidated into the financial statements.Critical Accounting EstimatesOur consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with GAAP, which requires us to make estimates and apply judgments that affect the reported amounts. In the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, we describe the significant accounting policies used in preparing the consolidated financial statements. Our management has discussed the development, selection, and disclosure of our critical accounting estimates with the Audit & Finance Committee of our Board of Directors. The following items require significant estimation or judgment:Inventory and cost of sales: Our inventory is valued at the lower of cost or market. We reduce inventory for estimated losses related to shrink and markdowns. Our shrink estimate is based on historical losses verified by physical inventory counts. Historically, our actual physical inventory count results have shown our estimates to be reliable. Market adjustments for markdowns are recorded when the salability of the merchandise has diminished. We believe the risk of inventory obsolescence is largely mitigated because our inventory typically turns in less than three months. Inventory was $8,309 million and $8,601 million at January 28, 2017 and January 30, 2016, respectively, and is further described in Note 12 of the Financial Statements.26Vendor income: We receive various forms of consideration from our vendors (vendor income), principally earned as a result of volume rebates, markdown allowances, promotions, and advertising allowances. Substantially all vendor income is recorded as a reduction of cost of sales.We establish a receivable for vendor income that is earned but not yet received. Based on the agreements in place, this receivable is computed by estimating when we have completed our performance and when the amount is earned. The majority of the year-end vendor income receivables are collected within the following fiscal quarter, and we do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood that the assumptions used in our estimate will change significantly. Historically, adjustments to our vendor income receivable have not been material. Vendor income receivable was $385 million and $384 million at January 28, 2017 and January 30, 2016, respectively. Vendor income is described further in Note 4 of the Financial Statements.Long-lived assets: Long-lived assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amounts may not be recoverable. The evaluation is performed at the lowest level of identifiable cash flows independent of other assets. An impairment loss would be recognized when estimated undiscounted future cash flows from the operation and/or disposition of the assets are less than their carrying amount. Measurement of an impairment loss would be based on the excess of the carrying amount of the asset group over its fair value. Fair value is measured using discounted cash flows or independent opinions of value, as appropriate. We recorded impairments of $43 million, $54 million, and $124 million in 2016, 2015, and 2014, respectively, which are described further in Note 14 of the Financial Statements. Insurance/self-insurance: We retain a substantial portion of the risk related to certain general liability, workers' compensation, property loss, and team member medical and dental claims. However, we maintain stop-loss coverage to limit the exposure related to certain risks. Liabilities associated with these losses include estimates of both claims filed and losses incurred but not yet reported. We use actuarial methods which consider a number of factors to estimate our ultimate cost of losses. General liability and workers' compensation liabilities are recorded at our estimate of their net present value; other liabilities referred to above are not discounted. Our workers' compensation and general liability accrual was $447 million and $498 million at January 28, 2017 and January 30, 2016, respectively. We believe that the amounts accrued are appropriate; however, our liabilities could be significantly affected if future occurrences or loss developments differ from our assumptions. For example, a five percent increase or decrease in average claim costs would impact our self-insurance expense by $22 million in 2016. Historically, adjustments to our estimates have not been material. Refer to Item 7A, Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk, for further disclosure of the market risks associated with these exposures. We maintain insurance coverage to limit our exposure to certain events, including network security matters. Income taxes: We pay income taxes based on the tax statutes, regulations, and case law of the various jurisdictions in which we operate. Significant judgment is required in determining the timing and amounts of deductible and taxable items, and in evaluating the ultimate resolution of tax matters in dispute with tax authorities. The benefits of uncertain tax positions are recorded in our financial statements only after determining it is likely the uncertain tax positions would withstand challenge by taxing authorities. We periodically reassess these probabilities and record any changes in the financial statements as appropriate. Liabilities for uncertain tax positions, including interest and penalties, were $222 million and $215 million at January 28, 2017 and January 30, 2016, respectively, and primarily relate to continuing operations. We believe the resolution of these matters will not have a material adverse impact on our consolidated financial statements. Income taxes are described further in Note 23 of the Financial Statements.Pension accounting: We maintain a funded qualified, defined benefit pension plan, as well as several smaller and unfunded nonqualified plans for certain current and retired team members. The costs for these plans are determined based on actuarial calculations using the assumptions described in the following paragraphs. Eligibility and the level of benefits varies depending on team members' full-time or part-time status, date of hire, age, and/or length of service. The benefit obligation and related expense for these plans are determined based on actuarial calculations using assumptions about the expected long-term rate of return, the discount rate, and compensation growth rates. The assumptions, with adjustments made for any significant plan or participant changes, are used to determine the period-end benefit obligation and establish expense for the next year.Our 2016 expected long-term rate of return on plan assets of 6.8 percent is determined by the portfolio composition, historical long-term investment performance, and current market conditions. A one percentage point decrease in our expected long-term rate of return would increase annual expense by $37 million. The discount rate used to determine benefit obligations is adjusted annually based on the interest rate for long-term high-quality corporate bonds, using yields for maturities that are in line with the duration of our pension liabilities. Our 27benefit obligation and related expense will fluctuate with changes in interest rates. A 0.5 percentage point decrease to the weighted average discount rate would increase annual expense by $30 million.Based on our experience, we use a graduated compensation growth schedule that assumes higher compensation growth for younger, shorter-service pension-eligible team members than it does for older, longer-service pension-eligible team members.Pension benefits are further described in Note 28 of the Financial Statements.Legal and other contingencies: We believe the accruals recorded in our consolidated financial statements properly reflect loss exposures that are both probable and reasonably estimable. We do not believe any of the currently identified claims or litigation may materially affect our results of operations, cash flows, or financial condition. However, litigation is subject to inherent uncertainties, and unfavorable rulings could occur. If an unfavorable ruling were to occur, it may cause a material adverse impact on the results of operations, cash flows, or financial condition for the period in which the ruling occurs, or future periods. Refer to Note 19 of the Financial Statements for further information on contingencies.New Accounting PronouncementsRefer to Note 2 and Note 22 of the Financial Statements for a description of new accounting pronouncements related to revenues and leases, respectively. We do not expect any other recently issued accounting pronouncements will have a material effect on our financial statements.Forward-Looking StatementsThis report contains forward-looking statements, which are based on our current assumptions and expectations. These statements are typically accompanied by the words ""expect,"" ""may,"" ""could,"" ""believe,"" ""would,"" ""might,"" ""anticipates,"" or words of similar import. The principal forward-looking statements in this report include: our financial performance, statements regarding the adequacy of and costs associated with our sources of liquidity, the expected impact of the Pharmacy Transaction on our financial performance, the continued execution of our share repurchase program, our expected capital expenditures and new lease commitments, the impact of changes in the expected effective income tax rate on net income, the expected compliance with debt covenants, the expected impact of new accounting pronouncements, our intentions regarding future dividends, contributions and payments related to our pension plan, the expected returns on pension plan assets, the expected timing and recognition of compensation expenses, the effects of macroeconomic conditions, the adequacy of our reserves for general liability, workers' compensation and property loss, the expected outcome of, and adequacy of our reserves for investigations, inquiries, claims and litigation, including those related to the 2013 data breach, expected changes to our contractual obligations and liabilities, the expected ability to recognize deferred tax assets and liabilities and the timing of such recognition, the process, timing and effects of discontinuing our Canadian operations, the resolution of tax matters, changes in our assumptions and expectations, and the expected benefits of restructuring activities.All such forward-looking statements are intended to enjoy the protection of the safe harbor for forward-looking statements contained in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, as amended. Although we believe there is a reasonable basis for the forward-looking statements, our actual results could be materially different. The most important factors which could cause our actual results to differ from our forward-looking statements are set forth on our description of risk factors in Item 1A to this Form 10-K, which should be read in conjunction with the forward-looking statements in this report. Forward-looking statements speak only as of the date they are made, and we do not undertake any obligation to update any forward-looking statement.28Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market RiskAt January 28, 2017, our exposure to market risk was primarily from interest rate changes on our debt obligations, some of which are at a LIBOR-plus floating-rate. Our interest rate exposure is primarily due to differences between our floating rate debt obligations compared to our floating rate short term investments. At January 28, 2017, our floating rate debt exceeded our floating rate short-term investments by approximately $140 million. Based on our balance sheet position at January 28, 2017, the annualized effect of a 0.1 percentage point increase in floating interest rates on our floating rate debt obligations, net of our floating rate short-term investments, would not be significant. In general, we expect our floating rate debt to exceed our floating rate short-term investments over time, but that may vary in different interest rate environments. See further description of our debt and derivative instruments in Notes 20 and 21 to the Financial Statements.We record our general liability and workers' compensation liabilities at net present value; therefore, these liabilities fluctuate with changes in interest rates. Based on our balance sheet position at January 28, 2017, the annualized effect of a 0.5 percentage point decrease in interest rates would be to decrease earnings before income taxes by $7 million.In addition, we are exposed to market return fluctuations on our qualified defined benefit pension plans. The value of our pension liabilities is inversely related to changes in interest rates. A 0.5 percentage point decrease to the weighted average discount rate would increase annual expense by $30 million. To protect against declines in interest rates, we hold high-quality, long-duration bonds and interest rate swaps in our pension plan trust. At year-end, we had hedged 55 percent of the interest rate exposure of our funded status.As more fully described in Notes 15 and 27 to the Financial Statements, we are exposed to market returns on accumulated team member balances in our nonqualified, unfunded deferred compensation plans. We control the risk of offering the nonqualified plans by making investments in life insurance contracts and prepaid forward contracts on our own common stock that offset a substantial portion of our economic exposure to the returns on these plans. The annualized effect of a one percentage point change in market returns on our nonqualified defined contribution plans (inclusive of the effect of the investment vehicles used to manage our economic exposure) would not be significant.There have been no other material changes in our primary risk exposures or management of market risks since the prior year.29",2023-12-30 21:32:53.563383
27419,TGT,TARGET CORP,2018,"Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of OperationsExecutive SummaryFiscal 2017 (a 53-week year) included the following notable items:•GAAP earnings per share from continuing operations were $5.32, including discrete benefits related to the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the Tax Act).•Adjusted earnings per share were $4.71, which excludes discrete benefits related to the Tax Act and other items described on page 22.•Comparable sales increased 1.3 percent, driven by a 1.6 percent increase in traffic. •Comparable digital channel sales growth of 27 percent contributed 1.2 percentage points of comparable sales growth.•We returned $2.4 billion to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases.•We made several investments to improve and expand our delivery capabilities; most notably, we purchased Shipt, an online same-day delivery company, for approximately $550 million.Sales were $71,879 million for 2017, an increase of $2,384 million or 3.4 percent from the prior year, due to a comparable sales increase of 1.3 percent, the extra week in 2017, and the contribution from new stores. Earnings from continuing operations before interest expense and income taxes in 2017 decreased by $657 million or 13.2 percent from 2016 to $4,312 million. The Analysis of Results of Operations discussion provides more information. Operating cash flow provided by continuing operations was $6,849 million for 2017, an increase of $1,520 million, or 28.5 percent from $5,329 million for 2016. Refer to the Cash Flows discussion within the Liquidity and Capital Resources section of MD&A on page 25 for additional information.16Earnings Per Share From Continuing Operations Percent Change2017 (a)201620152017/20162016/2015GAAP diluted earnings per share $5.32$4.58$5.2516.2 %(12.7)%Adjustments(0.61)0.42(0.56) Adjusted diluted earnings per share $4.71$5.01$4.69(5.9)%6.7 %Note: Amounts may not foot due to rounding. Adjusted diluted earnings per share from continuing operations (Adjusted EPS), a non-GAAP metric, excludes the impact of certain items not related to our routine retail operations. Management believes that Adjusted EPS is meaningful to provide period-to-period comparisons of our operating results. A reconciliation of non-GAAP financial measures to GAAP measures is provided on page 22.(a) Consisted of 53 weeks.We report after-tax return on invested capital (ROIC) from continuing operations because we believe ROIC provides a meaningful measure of our capital-allocation effectiveness over time. For the trailing twelve months ended February 3, 2018, ROIC was 15.9 percent, compared with 15.0 percent for the trailing twelve months ended January 28, 2017. Excluding the discrete impacts of the Tax Act, ROIC was 14.0 percent for the trailing twelve months ended February 3, 2018.

Note 2 of the Financial Statements provides a gift card ""breakage"" definition. Digital channel sales include all sales initiated through mobile applications and our websites. Digital channel sales may be fulfilled through our stores, our distribution centers, our vendors, or other delivery options, including store drive-up and delivery via our wholly own subsidiary, Shipt.The increase in 2017 sales is due to a comparable sales increase of 1.3 percent, the extra week in 2017, and the contribution from new stores. The extra week contributed $1,167 million of sales, or 1.7 percentage points of increase over 2016. The decrease in 2016 sales compared to 2015 reflects a decrease of approximately $3,815 million due to the Pharmacy Transaction and a 0.5 percent comparable sales decrease, partially offset by the contribution from new stores. Inflation did not materially affect sales in any period presented.Sales by Channel201720162015 (a)Stores94.5%95.6%96.6%Digital5.54.43.4Total100%100%100%(a) Excluding sales of our former pharmacy and clinic businesses, stores and digital channels sales were 96.4 percent and 3.6 percent of total sales, respectively, for 2015.Comparable sales is a measure that highlights the performance of our stores and digital channel sales by measuring the change in sales for a period over the comparable, prior-year period of equivalent length. Comparable sales include all sales, except sales from stores open less than 13 months, digital acquisitions we have owned less than 13 months, stores that have been closed, and digital acquisitions that we no longer operate. We removed pharmacy and clinic sales from the 2015 sales amounts when calculating 2016 comparable sales. Comparable sales measures vary across the retail industry. As a result, our comparable sales calculation is not necessarily comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies.

Additionally, we offer a branded proprietary Target Debit Card. Collectively, we refer to these products as REDcards®. Guests receive a 5 percent discount on virtually all purchases and free shipping when they use a REDcard. We monitor the percentage of sales that are paid for using REDcards (REDcard Penetration) because our internal analysis has indicated that a meaningful portion of incremental purchases on our REDcards are also incremental sales for Target.REDcard Penetration201720162015Target Debit Card13.0%12.8%12.1%Target Credit Cards11.311.210.1Total REDcard Penetration24.3%24.0%22.3%Note: Excluding pharmacy and clinic sales, total REDcard penetration would have been 23.2 percent for 2015. The sum of Target Credit Cards and Target Debit Card penetration may not equal Total REDcard Penetration due to rounding.Gross Margin Rate Our gross margin rate was 28.9 percent in 2017, 29.3 percent in 2016, and 29.2 percent in 2015. The 2017 decrease was primarily due to increased digital fulfillment costs. Benefits from cost savings initiatives were offset by net investments in pricing and promotions.19The 2016 increase was primarily due to the Pharmacy Transaction and favorable category sales mix, partially offset by increased digital fulfillment costs. Cost of goods savings helped offset the impact of a competitive promotional environment.Selling, General and Administrative Expense Rate Our SG&A expense rate was 19.8 percent in 2017, 19.2 percent in 2016, and 19.6 percent in 2015. The increase in 2017 was primarily due to higher compensation costs, including both bonus expense and store wages, partially offset by cost savings primarily driven by efficiency in our technology operations.The decrease in 2016 primarily resulted from the benefit of the Pharmacy Transaction and technology-related cost savings, partially offset by increased stores hourly payroll.Depreciation and Amortization Expense RateOur depreciation and amortization (exclusive of depreciation included in cost of sales) expense rate was 3.1 percent in 2017, 2.9 percent in 2016, and 2.7 percent in 2015. The 2017 increase was primarily due to higher accelerated depreciation for planned store remodels, partially offset by the rate impact of the 53rd week of sales. The 2016 increase was due to the rate impact of lower sales in 2016 than 2015.Store DataChange in Number of Stores20172016Beginning store count1,8021,792Opened3215Closed(12)(5)Ending store count1,8221,802Number of Stores andRetail Square FeetNumber of Stores Retail Square Feet (a)February 3, 2018January 28, 2017 February 3, 2018January 28, 2017170,000 or more sq. ft.274276 48,96649,32850,000 to 169,999 sq. ft.1,5001,504 189,030189,62049,999 or less sq. ft.4822 1,359554Total1,8221,802 239,355239,502(a) In thousands, reflects total square feet less office, distribution center and vacant space.20Other Performance FactorsOther Selling, General and Administrative ExpensesWe recorded $(4) million and $216 million of selling, general and administrative expenses outside of the segment during 2016 and 2015, respectively, because they relate to discretely managed matters. Additional information about these discretely managed items is provided within Note 30 of the Financial Statements.Net Interest ExpenseNet interest expense from continuing operations was $666 million, $1,004 million, and $607 million for 2017, 2016, and 2015, respectively. Net interest expense for 2017 and 2016 included losses on early retirement of debt of $123 million and $422 million, respectively.Provision for Income TaxesOur 2017 effective income tax rate from continuing operations decreased to 19.7 percent, from 32.7 percent in 2016, driven primarily by the impact of the Tax Act, which among other matters reduced the U.S. corporate income tax rate from 35 percent to 21 percent effective January 1, 2018. The Tax Act reduced our 2017 income tax expense by $388 million, comprised of the following:•The new lower tax rate reduced tax expense by $36 million. Target’s U.S. federal statutory tax rate was 33.7 percent for 2017, which reflects a blended federal statutory rate of 35% for approximately 11 months and 21% for approximately 1 month. •We recognized a provisional net tax benefit of $352 million related to remeasurement of our net deferred tax liabilities, including $381 million of benefit from the new lower rate, partially offset by $29 million of deferred income tax expense from our foreign operations. In 2017, due to changes effected by the Tax Act and other reasons, we have not asserted indefinite reinvestment in our foreign operations.Certain other provisions of the Tax Act not expected to have a material impact on net income are as follows:•Through 2022, the Tax Act allows companies to immediately deduct the cost of certain capital expenditures from taxable income instead of deducting the costs over time. This provision phases out over 2023-2027. •The Tax Act implements a territorial tax system and imposes a one-time repatriation tax on deemed repatriated accumulated foreign earnings as of December 31, 2017. The one-time repatriation tax did not materially affect our net tax expense because in the aggregate our foreign entities have an accumulated earnings deficit, driven by our discontinued operations. •Although the Tax Act generally eliminates U.S. federal income tax on dividends from foreign subsidiaries, it creates a new requirement that certain income referred to as global intangible low-taxed income earned by controlled foreign corporations must be included currently in the gross income of the entity's U.S. shareholder. •The Tax Act limits the deductibility of interest, executive compensation, and certain other expenses. As described in Note 23 of the Financial Statements, certain aspects of our 2017 income tax provision related to the Tax Act amounts are provisional.We expect a 2018 effective tax rate of 22 percent to 25 percent. We expect a corresponding 2018 operating cash flow benefit from the lower rate and, to a lesser degree, additional operating cash flow benefits from the immediate deductibility provision described above. 21Our 2016 effective income tax rate from continuing operations increased to 32.7 percent, from 32.5 percent in 2015, driven primarily by the 2015 rate impact of the $112 million tax benefit from releasing the valuation allowance on a capital loss carryforward. This comparative rate impact was partially offset by $27 million of excess tax benefit in 2016 related to shared-based payments after the adoption of Accounting Standards Update (ASU) No. 2016-09, Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting, and lower pretax earnings. Note 23 of the Financial Statements provides additional information.Discontinued OperationsSee Note 7 of the Financial Statements for information about our Canada exit.Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Financial Measures to GAAP MeasuresTo provide additional transparency, we have disclosed non-GAAP adjusted diluted earnings per share from continuing operations (Adjusted EPS). This metric excludes certain items presented below. We believe this information is useful in providing period-to-period comparisons of the results of our continuing operations. This measure is not in accordance with, or an alternative to, generally accepted accounting principles in the United States (GAAP). The most comparable GAAP measure is diluted earnings per share from continuing operations. Adjusted EPS should not be considered in isolation or as a substitution for analysis of our results as reported under GAAP. Other companies may calculate Adjusted EPS differently than we do, limiting the usefulness of the measure for comparisons with other companies. 2017 (a) 2016 2015(millions, except per share data) Pretax Net of Tax Per Share Amounts Pretax Net of Tax Per Share Amounts Pretax Net of Tax Per Share AmountsGAAP diluted earnings per share from continuing operations $5.32 $4.58 $5.25Adjustments Tax Act (b) $— $(352) $(0.64) $— $— $— $— $— $—Loss on early retirement of debt 123 75 0.14 422 257 0.44 — — —Gain on sale (c) — — — — — — (620) (487) (0.77)Restructuring costs (d) — — — — — — 138 87 0.14Data breach-related costs, net of insurance (e) (5) (3) (0.01) — — — 39 28 0.04Other (f) — — — (4) (2) — 39 29 0.05Resolution of income tax matters — (57) (0.10) — (7) (0.01) — (8) (0.01)Adjusted diluted earnings per share from continuing operations $4.71 $5.01 $4.69Note: Amounts may not foot due to rounding.(a) Consisted of 53 weeks.(b) Represents discrete items related to the Tax Act.

These measures are not in accordance with, or an alternative for, GAAP. The most comparable GAAP measure is net earnings from continuing operations. Consolidated EBIT and EBITDA should not be considered in isolation or as a substitution for analysis of our results as reported under GAAP. Other companies may calculate consolidated EBIT and EBITDA differently, limiting the usefulness of the measure for comparisons with other companies.

Operating leases are capitalized as part of the ROIC calculation to control for differences in capital structure across companies. This metric provides a measure of the effectiveness of our capital allocation over time. Other companies may calculate ROIC differently, limiting the usefulness of the measure.After-Tax Return on Invested Capital Numerator Trailing Twelve Months (dollars in millions) February 3, 2018 (a) January 28, 2017 Earnings from continuing operations before interest expense and income taxes $4,312 $4,969 + Operating lease interest (b)(c) 80 71 Adjusted earnings from continuing operations before interest expense and income taxes 4,392 5,040 - Income taxes (d) 864 1,648 Net operating profit after taxes $3,528 $3,392 Denominator(dollars in millions) February 3, 2018 January 28, 2017 January 30, 2016Current portion of long-term debt and other borrowings $270 $1,718 $815+ Noncurrent portion of long-term debt 11,317 11,031 11,945+ Shareholders' equity 11,709 10,953 12,957+ Capitalized operating lease obligations (c)(e) 1,339 1,187 1,457- Cash and cash equivalents 2,643 2,512 4,046- Net assets of discontinued operations (f) 2 62 226Invested capital $21,990 $22,315 $22,902Average invested capital (g) $22,152 $22,608 After-tax return on invested capital 15.9%(d) 15.0% (a) Consisted of 53 weeks.(b) Represents the add-back to operating income driven by the hypothetical interest expense we would incur if the property under our operating leases were owned or accounted for as capital leases, using eight times our trailing twelve months rent expense and an estimated interest rate of six percent.(c) See the following Reconciliation of Capitalized Operating Leases table for the adjustments to our GAAP total rent expense to obtain the hypothetical capitalization of operating leases and related operating lease interest.

The effective tax rate for the trailing twelve months ended February 3, 2018 includes discrete tax benefits related to the Tax Act and the impact of the new lower U.S. corporate income tax rate. Excluding the discrete impacts of the Tax Act, ROIC was 14.0 percent for the trailing twelve months ended February 3, 2018.(e) Calculated as eight times our trailing twelve months rent expense.

Capitalized operating lease obligations and operating lease interest should not be considered in isolation or as a substitution for analysis of our results as reported under GAAP. 24Reconciliation of Capitalized Operating Leases Trailing Twelve Months(dollars in millions) February 3, 2018 January 28, 2017 January 30, 2016Total rent expense $167 $148 $182Capitalized operating lease obligations (total rent expense x 8) 1,339 1,187 1,457Operating lease interest (capitalized operating lease obligations x 6%) 80 71 n/aOur calculation of after-tax ROIC will change when we adopt ASU No. 2016-02, Leases in the first quarter of 2018, primarily resulting from replacing calculated operating lease obligations with GAAP operating lease obligations and an interest adjustment specific to the lease portfolio. We expect these changes to result in an ROIC decrease of approximately 0.2-0.5 percentage points for all periods presented. Refer to Note 22 to the Financial Statements for additional information.Analysis of Financial ConditionLiquidity and Capital ResourcesOur period-end cash and cash equivalents balance increased to $2,643 million from $2,512 million in 2016. As of February 3, 2018, $808 million of cash and cash equivalents were held at entities located outside the United States. There are no substantial taxes or restrictions to repatriate these holdings for domestic use. Our investment policy is designed to preserve principal and liquidity of our short-term investments. This policy allows investments in large money market funds or in highly rated direct short-term instruments that mature in 60 days or less. We also place dollar limits on our investments in individual funds or instruments.Capital AllocationWe follow a disciplined and balanced approach to capital allocation based on the following priorities, ranked in order of importance: first, we fully invest in opportunities to profitably grow our business, create sustainable long-term value, and maintain our current operations and assets; second, we maintain a competitive quarterly dividend and seek to grow it annually; and finally, we return any excess cash to shareholders by repurchasing shares within the limits of our credit rating goals.Operating Cash FlowsOperating cash flow provided by continuing operations was $6,849 million in 2017 compared with $5,329 million in 2016. The operating cash flow increase is due to increased payables leverage primarily driven by changes in vendor payment terms in 2017, partially offset by an inventory increase in 2017 compared to a decrease during 2016. The operating cash flow increase is also partially due to the payment of approximately $500 million of taxes during 2016 related to the Pharmacy Transaction.InventoryYear-end inventory was $8,657 million, compared with $8,309 million in 2016. We increased inventory in 2017 to support higher sales.25Capital Expenditures(a) In addition to these cash investments, we entered into leases related to new stores in 2017, 2016, and 2015 with total future minimum lease payments of $438 million, $550 million, and $338 million, respectively. Capital expenditures increased in 2017 from the prior year primarily due to increased investments in existing stores as we accelerated our current store remodel program. This investment acceleration follows an increase in 2016 as compared to 2015 due to increased remodels and guest experience enhancements. In 2016, these increases were partially offset by capital expenditure reductions driven by efficiency gains in technology. We expect capital expenditures in 2018 to increase to approximately $3.5 billion as we accelerate the rate of store remodels, continue our current rate of small-format store openings, and continue to make supply chain investments. We also expect to continue our current rate of investment in store leases.DividendsWe paid dividends totaling $1,338 million ($2.44 per share) in 2017 and $1,348 million ($2.32 per share) in 2016, a per share increase of 5.2 percent. We declared dividends totaling $1,356 million ($2.46 per share) in 2017, a per share increase of 4.2 percent over 2016. We declared dividends totaling $1,359 million ($2.36 per share) in 2016, a per share increase of 7.3 percent over 2015. We have paid dividends every quarter since our 1967 initial public offering, and it is our intent to continue to do so in the future.Share RepurchasesDuring 2017, 2016, and 2015 we returned $1,026 million, $3,686 million, and $3,441 million, respectively, to shareholders through share repurchase. See Part II, Item 5 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K and Note 25 to the Financial Statements for more information.26FinancingOur financing strategy is to ensure liquidity and access to capital markets, to maintain a balanced spectrum of debt maturities, and to manage our net exposure to floating interest rate volatility. Within these parameters, we seek to minimize our borrowing costs. Our ability to access the long-term debt and commercial paper markets has provided us with ample sources of liquidity. Our continued access to these markets depends on multiple factors, including the condition of debt capital markets, our operating performance, and maintaining strong credit ratings. As of February 3, 2018, our credit ratings were as follows:Credit RatingsMoody'sStandard and Poor'sFitchLong-term debtA2AA-Commercial paperP-1A-1F2If our credit ratings were lowered, our ability to access the debt markets, our cost of funds, and other terms for new debt issuances could be adversely impacted. Each of the credit rating agencies reviews its rating periodically and there is no guarantee our current credit ratings will remain the same as described above.In 2017, we transitioned to longer payment terms with many of our suppliers. Because of these changes, we expect less variability in our working capital needs throughout the year as we continue to better match payables to inventory levels. In 2017, we funded our holiday sales period working capital needs through internally generated funds. In 2016, we funded our peak holiday sales period working capital needs through internally generated funds and the issuance of commercial paper. We have additional liquidity through a committed $2.5 billion revolving credit facility obtained through a group of banks in October 2016. In October 2017, we extended this credit facility by one year to expire in October 2022. This unsecured revolving credit facility replaced a $2.25 billion unsecured revolving credit facility that was scheduled to expire in October 2018. No balances were outstanding under either credit facility at any time during 2017, 2016, or 2015.Most of our long-term debt obligations contain covenants related to secured debt levels. In addition to a secured debt level covenant, our credit facility also contains a debt leverage covenant. We are, and expect to remain, in compliance with these covenants. Additionally, at February 3, 2018, no notes or debentures contained provisions requiring acceleration of payment upon a credit rating downgrade, except that certain outstanding notes allow the note holders to put the notes to us if within a matter of months of each other we experience both (i) a change in control and (ii) our long-term credit ratings are either reduced and the resulting rating is non-investment grade, or our long-term credit ratings are placed on watch for possible reduction and those ratings are subsequently reduced and the resulting rating is non-investment grade.Note 20 of the Financial Statements provides more information about financing activities.We believe our sources of liquidity will continue to be adequate to maintain operations, finance anticipated expansion and strategic initiatives, fund debt maturities, pay dividends, and execute purchases under our share repurchase program for the foreseeable future. We continue to anticipate ample access to commercial paper and long-term financing.27Commitments and ContingenciesContractual Obligations as ofPayments Due by PeriodFebruary 3, 2018 Less than 1-33-5After 5(millions)Total1 YearYearsYearsYearsRecorded contractual obligations: Long-term debt (a)$10,537$201$2,096$1,119$7,121Capital lease obligations (b)2,001921931921,524Deferred compensation (c)5435310297291Real estate liabilities (d)114114———Tax contingencies (e)—————Unrecorded contractual obligations: Interest payments – long-term debt6,3214297826634,447Operating leases (b)4,1532274604393,027Purchase obligations (f)1,22551342965218Real estate obligations (g)602602———Future contributions to retirement plans (h)—————Contractual obligations$25,496$2,231$4,062$2,575$16,628(a) Represents principal payments only. See Note 20 of the Financial Statements for further information.(b) These payments also include $244 million and $386 million of legally binding minimum lease payments for stores that are expected to open in 2018 or later for capital and operating leases, respectively. See Note 22 of the Financial Statements for further information.(c) The timing of deferred compensation payouts is estimated based on payments currently made to former employees and retirees, forecasted investment returns, and the projected timing of future retirements.(d) Real estate liabilities include costs incurred but not paid related to the construction or remodeling of real estate and facilities.(e) Estimated tax contingencies of $363 million, including interest and penalties and primarily related to continuing operations, are not included in the table above because we are not able to make reasonably reliable estimates of the period of cash settlement. See Note 23 of the Financial Statements for further information.(f) Purchase obligations include all legally binding contracts such as firm minimum commitments for inventory purchases, merchandise royalties, equipment purchases, marketing-related contracts, software acquisition/license commitments, and service contracts. We issue inventory purchase orders in the normal course of business, which represent authorizations to purchase that are cancelable by their terms. We do not consider purchase orders to be firm inventory commitments; therefore, they are excluded from the table above. If we choose to cancel a purchase order, we may be obligated to reimburse the vendor for unrecoverable outlays incurred prior to cancellation. We also issue trade letters of credit in the ordinary course of business, which are excluded from this table as these obligations are conditioned on terms of the letter of credit being met.(g) Real estate obligations include commitments for the purchase, construction, or remodeling of real estate and facilities.(h) We have not included obligations under our pension plans in the contractual obligations table above because no additional amounts are required to be funded as of February 3, 2018. Our historical practice regarding these plans has been to contribute amounts necessary to satisfy minimum pension funding requirements, plus periodic discretionary amounts determined to be appropriate.Off Balance Sheet Arrangements: Other than the unrecorded contractual obligations noted above, we do not have any arrangements or relationships with entities that are not consolidated into the financial statements.Critical Accounting EstimatesOur consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with GAAP, which requires us to make estimates and apply judgments that affect the reported amounts. In the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, we describe the significant accounting policies used in preparing the consolidated financial statements. Our management has discussed the development, selection, and disclosure of our critical accounting estimates with the Audit & Finance Committee of our Board of Directors. The following items require significant estimation or judgment:Inventory and cost of sales: Our inventory is valued at the lower of cost or market. We reduce inventory for estimated losses related to shrink and markdowns. Our shrink estimate is based on historical losses verified by physical inventory counts. Historically, our actual physical inventory count results have shown our estimates to be reliable. Market adjustments for markdowns are recorded when the salability of the merchandise has diminished. We believe the risk of inventory obsolescence is largely mitigated because our inventory typically turns in less than three months. Inventory was $8,657 million and $8,309 million at February 3, 2018 and January 28, 2017, respectively, and is further described in Note 12 of the Financial Statements.28Vendor income: We receive various forms of consideration from our vendors (vendor income), principally earned as a result of volume rebates, markdown allowances, promotions, and advertising allowances. Substantially all vendor income is recorded as a reduction of cost of sales.We establish a receivable for vendor income that is earned but not yet received. Based on the agreements in place, this receivable is computed by estimating when we have completed our performance and when the amount is earned. The majority of the year-end vendor income receivables are collected within the following fiscal quarter, and we do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood that the assumptions used in our estimate will change significantly. Historically, adjustments to our vendor income receivable have not been material. Vendor income receivable was $416 million and $385 million at February 3, 2018 and January 28, 2017, respectively. Vendor income is described further in Note 4 of the Financial Statements.Long-lived assets: Long-lived assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amounts may not be recoverable. The evaluation is performed at the lowest level of identifiable cash flows independent of other assets. An impairment loss would be recognized when estimated undiscounted future cash flows from the operation and/or disposition of the assets are less than their carrying amount. Measurement of an impairment loss would be based on the excess of the carrying amount of the asset group over its fair value. Fair value is measured using discounted cash flows or independent opinions of value, as appropriate. We recorded impairments of $91 million, $43 million, and $54 million in 2017, 2016, and 2015, respectively, which are described further in Note 14 of the Financial Statements. Goodwill: We perform an impairment test of goodwill at least annually, and more frequently if events or circumstances occur that would indicate a reduced fair value in our reporting unit could exist. Typically, we perform a qualitative assessment in the fourth quarter of the fiscal year to determine if it is more likely than not that the carrying value of the goodwill exceeds the fair value of the goodwill. During our qualitative assessment we make significant estimates, assumptions, and judgments, including, but not limited to, the macroeconomic conditions, industry and market conditions, cost factors, including product and SG&A costs, overall financial performance of the Company, changes in our share price, and relevant company-specific events. If we determine that it is more likely than not that the carrying value of the goodwill exceeds the fair value of the goodwill, we perform the first step of the impairment process, which compares the fair value of the reporting unit to its carrying amount, including the goodwill. We have not been required to perform a quantitative analysis of goodwill in 2017 or 2016. We recorded a $12 million impairment of goodwill in 2015 related to the wind down of noncore operations.Insurance/self-insurance: We retain a substantial portion of the risk related to certain general liability, workers' compensation, property loss, and team member medical and dental claims. However, we maintain stop-loss coverage to limit the exposure related to certain risks. Liabilities associated with these losses include estimates of both claims filed and losses incurred but not yet reported. We use actuarial methods which consider a number of factors to estimate our ultimate cost of losses. General liability and workers' compensation liabilities are recorded at our estimate of their net present value; other liabilities referred to above are not discounted. Our workers' compensation and general liability accrual was $419 million and $447 million at February 3, 2018 and January 28, 2017, respectively. We believe that the amounts accrued are appropriate; however, our liabilities could be significantly affected if future occurrences or loss developments differ from our assumptions. For example, a five percent increase or decrease in average claim costs would impact our self-insurance expense by $21 million in 2017. Historically, adjustments to our estimates have not been material. Refer to Item 7A, Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk, for further disclosure of the market risks associated with these exposures. We maintain insurance coverage to limit our exposure to certain events, including network security matters. Income taxes: We pay income taxes based on the tax statutes, regulations, and case law of the various jurisdictions in which we operate. Significant judgment is required in determining the timing and amounts of deductible and taxable items, and in evaluating the ultimate resolution of tax matters in dispute with tax authorities.We recognized the income tax effects of the Tax Act in our 2017 financial statements in accordance with Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 118, which provides SEC staff guidance for the application of ASC Topic 740, Income Taxes, in the reporting period in which the President signed the Tax Act into law. Note 23 of the Financial Statements provides additional information.The benefits of uncertain tax positions are recorded in our financial statements only after determining it is likely the uncertain tax positions would withstand challenge by taxing authorities. We periodically reassess these probabilities and record any changes in the financial statements as appropriate. Liabilities for uncertain tax positions, including interest and penalties, were $363 million and $222 million at February 3, 2018 and January 28, 2017, respectively, 29and primarily relate to continuing operations. We believe the resolution of these matters will not have a material adverse impact on our consolidated financial statements. Income taxes are described further in Note 23 of the Financial Statements.Pension accounting: We maintain a funded qualified, defined benefit pension plan, as well as several smaller and unfunded nonqualified plans for certain current and retired team members. The costs for these plans are determined based on actuarial calculations using the assumptions described in the following paragraphs. Eligibility and the level of benefits varies depending on team members' full-time or part-time status, date of hire, age, and/or length of service. The benefit obligation and related expense for these plans are determined based on actuarial calculations using assumptions about the expected long-term rate of return, the discount rate, and compensation growth rates. The assumptions, with adjustments made for any significant plan or participant changes, are used to determine the period-end benefit obligation and establish expense for the next year.Our 2017 expected long-term rate of return on plan assets of 6.55 percent is determined by the portfolio composition, historical long-term investment performance, and current market conditions. A one percentage point decrease in our expected long-term rate of return would increase annual expense by $38 million. The discount rate used to determine benefit obligations is adjusted annually based on the interest rate for long-term high-quality corporate bonds, using yields for maturities that are in line with the duration of our pension liabilities. Our benefit obligation and related expense will fluctuate with changes in interest rates. A 0.5 percentage point decrease to the weighted average discount rate would increase annual expense by $31 million.Based on our experience, we use a graduated compensation growth schedule that assumes higher compensation growth for younger, shorter-service pension-eligible team members than it does for older, longer-service pension-eligible team members.Pension benefits are further described in Note 28 of the Financial Statements.Legal and other contingencies: We believe the accruals recorded in our consolidated financial statements properly reflect loss exposures that are both probable and reasonably estimable. We do not believe any of the currently identified claims or litigation may materially affect our results of operations, cash flows, or financial condition. However, litigation is subject to inherent uncertainties, and unfavorable rulings could occur. If an unfavorable ruling were to occur, it may cause a material adverse impact on the results of operations, cash flows, or financial condition for the period in which the ruling occurs, or future periods. Refer to Note 19 of the Financial Statements for further information on contingencies.New Accounting PronouncementsRefer to Note 2, Note 22, Note 28, and Note 29 of the Financial Statements for a description of new accounting pronouncements related to revenues, leases, pension expense, and accumulated other comprehensive income, respectively. We do not expect any other recently issued accounting pronouncements will have a material effect on our financial statements.30Forward-Looking StatementsThis report contains forward-looking statements, which are based on our current assumptions and expectations. These statements are typically accompanied by the words ""expect,"" ""may,"" ""could,"" ""believe,"" ""would,"" ""might,"" ""anticipates,"" or words of similar import. The principal forward-looking statements in this report include: our financial performance, statements regarding the adequacy of and costs associated with our sources of liquidity, the expected impact of the Pharmacy Transaction on our financial performance, the continued execution of our share repurchase program, our expected capital expenditures and new lease commitments, the impact of changes in the expected effective income tax rate on net income, including those resulting from the Tax Act, the impact of certain Tax Act provisions on our cash flows, the expected compliance with debt covenants, the expected impact and timing of adopting new accounting pronouncements, our intentions regarding future dividends, contributions and payments related to our pension plan, the expected returns on pension plan assets, the expected timing and recognition of compensation expenses, the effects of macroeconomic conditions, the adequacy of our reserves for general liability, workers' compensation and property loss, the expected outcome of, and adequacy of our reserves for investigations, inquiries, claims and litigation, expected changes to our contractual obligations and liabilities, the expected ability to recognize deferred tax assets and liabilities and the timing of such recognition, the resolution of tax matters, and changes in our assumptions and expectations.All such forward-looking statements are intended to enjoy the protection of the safe harbor for forward-looking statements contained in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, as amended. Although we believe there is a reasonable basis for the forward-looking statements, our actual results could be materially different. The most important factors which could cause our actual results to differ from our forward-looking statements are set forth on our description of risk factors in Item 1A to this Form 10-K, which should be read in conjunction with the forward-looking statements in this report. Forward-looking statements speak only as of the date they are made, and we do not undertake any obligation to update any forward-looking statement.31Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market RiskAt February 3, 2018, our exposure to market risk was primarily from interest rate changes on our debt obligations, some of which are at a LIBOR-plus floating-rate. Our interest rate exposure is primarily due to differences between our floating rate debt obligations compared to our floating rate short term investments. At February 3, 2018, our floating rate short-term investments exceeded our floating rate debt by approximately $900 million. Based on our balance sheet position at February 3, 2018, the annualized effect of a 0.1 percentage point increase in floating interest rates on our floating rate debt obligations, net of our floating rate short-term investments, would not be significant. In general, we expect our floating rate debt to exceed our floating rate short-term investments over time, but that may vary in different interest rate environments. See further description of our debt and derivative instruments in Notes 20 and 21 to the Financial Statements.We record our general liability and workers' compensation liabilities at net present value; therefore, these liabilities fluctuate with changes in interest rates. Based on our balance sheet position at February 3, 2018, the annualized effect of a 0.5 percentage point decrease in interest rates would be to decrease earnings before income taxes by $6 million.In addition, we are exposed to market return fluctuations on our qualified defined benefit pension plans. The value of our pension liabilities is inversely related to changes in interest rates. A 0.5 percentage point decrease to the weighted average discount rate would increase annual expense by $31 million. To protect against declines in interest rates, we hold high-quality, long-duration bonds and interest rate swaps in our pension plan trust. At year-end, we had hedged 55 percent of the interest rate exposure of our funded status.As more fully described in Notes 15 and 27 to the Financial Statements, we are exposed to market returns on accumulated team member balances in our nonqualified, unfunded deferred compensation plans. We control the risk of offering the nonqualified plans by making investments in life insurance contracts and prepaid forward contracts on our own common stock that offset a substantial portion of our economic exposure to the returns on these plans. The annualized effect of a one percentage point change in market returns on our nonqualified defined contribution plans (inclusive of the effect of the investment vehicles used to manage our economic exposure) would not be significant.There have been no other material changes in our primary risk exposures or management of market risks since the prior year.32",2023-12-30 21:32:52.760377
27419,TGT,TARGET CORP,2019,"Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of OperationsExecutive SummaryFiscal 2018 included the following notable items:•GAAP earnings per share from continuing operations were $5.50.•Adjusted earnings per share were $5.39.•Total revenue increased 3.6 percent, driven by a comparable sales increase and sales from new stores, partially offset by fiscal 2017 containing 53 weeks.•Comparable sales increased 5.0 percent, driven by a 5.0 percent increase in traffic.◦Comparable store sales grew 3.2 percent. ◦Comparable digital channel sales increased 36 percent, contributing 1.8 percentage points to comparable sales growth.•We returned $3.4 billion to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases.As described in Note 2 to the Financial Statements, certain prior-year amounts have been adjusted to reflect the impact of adopting Accounting Standards Update (ASU) No. 2014-09—Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606), ASU No. 2016-02—Leases (Topic 842), and ASU No. 2017-07—Compensation – Retirement Benefits (Topic 715) throughout this document to conform to the current year presentation. Sales were $74,433 million for 2018, an increase of $2,647 million or 3.7 percent from the prior year, due to a comparable sales increase of 5.0 percent and the contribution from new stores, partially offset by the impact of the extra week in 2017. Operating income in 2018 decreased by $114 million or 2.7 percent from 2017 to $4,110 million. The Analysis of Results of Operations discussion provides more information. Operating cash flow provided by continuing operations was $5,970 million for 2018, a decrease of $891 million, or 13.0 percent, from $6,861 million for 2017. Refer to the Cash Flows discussion within the Liquidity and Capital Resources section of MD&A on page 24 for additional information.Earnings Per Share From Continuing Operations Percent Change20182017 As Adjusted (a)(b)2016As Adjusted (b)2018/20172017/2016GAAP diluted earnings per share $5.50$5.29$4.584.0%15.5 %Adjustments(0.10)(0.60)0.42 Adjusted diluted earnings per share $5.39$4.69$5.0015.1%(6.3)%Note: Amounts may not foot due to rounding. Adjusted diluted earnings per share from continuing operations (Adjusted EPS), a non-GAAP metric, excludes the impact of certain items. Management believes that Adjusted EPS is useful in providing period-to-period comparisons of the results of our continuing operations. A reconciliation of non-GAAP financial measures to GAAP measures is provided on page 21.(a) Consisted of 53 weeks.(b) Lease standard adoption resulted in a $0.03 and $0.02 reduction in GAAP and Adjusted EPS, respectively, for 2017, and a less than $0.01 and $0.01 reduction in GAAP and Adjusted EPS, respectively, for 2016. We report after-tax return on invested capital (ROIC) from continuing operations because we believe ROIC provides a meaningful measure of our capital-allocation effectiveness over time. For the trailing twelve months ended February 2, 2019, ROIC was 14.7 percent, compared with 15.4 percent for the trailing twelve months ended February 3, 2018. Excluding the discrete impacts of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (Tax Act), ROIC was 14.6 percent and 13.6 percent for the trailing twelve months ended February 2, 2019, and February 3, 2018, respectively. A reconciliation of ROIC is provided on page 23.17Analysis of Results of Operations Percent Change(dollars in millions)20182017 As Adjusted (a)2016As Adjusted2018/20172017/2016Sales $74,433$71,786$69,4143.7 %3.4 %Other revenue923928857(0.5)8.3Total revenue75,35672,71470,2713.63.5Cost of sales53,29951,12549,1454.34.0SG&A expenses15,72315,14014,2173.96.5Depreciation and amortization (exclusive of depreciation included in cost of sales)2,2242,2252,045(0.1)8.8Operating income$4,110$4,224$4,864(2.7)%(13.1)%(a) Consisted of 53 weeks.Rate Analysis20182017 As Adjusted (a)2016As AdjustedGross margin rate28.4%28.8%29.2%SG&A expense rate20.920.820.2Depreciation and amortization (exclusive of depreciation included in cost of sales) expense rate3.03.12.9Operating income margin rate5.55.86.9Note: Gross margin rate is calculated as gross margin (sales less cost of sales) divided by sales. All other rates are calculated by dividing the applicable amount by total revenue.(a) Consisted of 53 weeks.SalesSales include all merchandise sales, net of expected returns, and gift card breakage. Note 3 of the Financial Statements defines gift card ""breakage"". Comparable sales is a measure that highlights the performance of our stores and digital channel sales by measuring the change in sales for a period over the comparable, prior-year period of equivalent length. Comparable sales include all sales, except sales from stores open less than 13 months, digital acquisitions we have owned less than 13 months, stores that have been closed, and digital acquisitions that we no longer operate. Comparable sales measures vary across the retail industry. As a result, our comparable sales calculation is not necessarily comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies. Digital channel sales include all sales initiated through mobile applications and our websites. Our stores fulfill the majority of digital channel sales, including through store pick up or drive up and delivery via our wholly owned subsidiary, Shipt. Digital channel sales may also be fulfilled through our distribution centers, our vendors, or other third parties.The increase in 2018 sales compared with 2017 is due to a 5.0 percent comparable sales increase and the contribution from new stores, partially offset by the extra week in 2017, which contributed $1,167 million of sales, or 1.6 percent of 2017 sales. The increase in 2017 sales is due to a comparable sales increase of 1.3 percent, the extra week in 2017, and the contribution from new stores. The extra week contributed 1.7 percentage points of increase over 2016. Inflation did not materially affect sales in any period presented.Comparable Sales201820172016Comparable sales change5.0%1.3 %(0.5)%Drivers of change in comparable sales Number of transactions5.01.6(0.8)Average transaction amount0.1(0.3)0.3Note: Amounts may not foot due to rounding.18Contribution to Comparable Sales Change201820172016Stores channel comparable sales change3.2%0.1%(1.5)%Digital channel percentage points contribution to comparable sales change1.81.21.0Total comparable sales change5.0%1.3%(0.5)%Note: Amounts may not foot due to rounding.Sales by Channel201820172016Stores originated92.9%94.5%95.6%Digitally originated7.15.54.4Total100%100%100%Note 3 to the Financial Statements provides sales by product category.

Additionally, we offer a branded proprietary Target Debit Card. Collectively, we refer to these products as REDcards®. Guests receive a 5 percent discount on nearly all purchases and free shipping when they use a REDcard at Target. We monitor the percentage of purchases that are paid for using REDcards (REDcard Penetration) because our internal analysis has indicated that a meaningful portion of incremental purchases on our REDcards are also incremental sales for Target.REDcard Penetration201820172016Target Debit Card13.0%13.1%13.0%Target Credit Cards10.911.311.2Total REDcard Penetration23.8%24.5%24.2%Note: Amounts may not foot due to rounding. In 2018, we refined our calculation of REDcard Penetration. The prior period amounts have been updated to conform with the current methodology, resulting in an increase of 0.2 percentage points to the Total REDcard Penetration for 2017 and 2016.Gross Margin Rate Our gross margin rate was 28.4 percent in 2018, 28.8 percent in 2017, and 29.2 percent in 2016. The 2018 decrease was primarily due to increased digital fulfillment and supply chain costs. The benefit of merchandising strategies, including cost savings initiatives and efforts to improve pricing and promotions, was partially offset by the impact of our sales mix.19The 2017 decrease was primarily due to increased digital fulfillment costs and supply chain costs. Benefits from cost savings initiatives were offset by net investments in pricing and promotions.Selling, General and Administrative Expense Rate Our SG&A expense rate was 20.9 percent in 2018, 20.8 percent in 2017, and 20.2 percent in 2016. The increase in 2018 was primarily due to higher compensation, primarily driven by store wages, partially offset by cost savings across multiple expense categories.The increase in 2017 was primarily due to higher compensation costs, including both bonus expense and store wages, partially offset by cost savings primarily driven by efficiency in our technology operations.Depreciation and Amortization Expense RateOur depreciation and amortization (exclusive of depreciation included in cost of sales) expense rate was 3.0 percent in 2018, 3.1 percent in 2017, and 2.9 percent in 2016. The 2018 decrease was primarily due to the rate impact of higher sales. The 2017 increase was primarily due to higher accelerated depreciation for planned store remodels, partially offset by the rate impact of the 53rd week of sales.Store DataChange in Number of Stores20182017Beginning store count1,8221,802Opened2932Closed(7)(12)Ending store count1,8441,822Number of Stores andRetail Square FeetNumber of Stores Retail Square Feet (a)February 2, 2019February 3, 2018 February 2, 2019February 3, 2018170,000 or more sq. ft.272274 48,60448,96650,000 to 169,999 sq. ft.1,5011,500 188,900189,03049,999 or less sq. ft.7148 2,0771,359Total1,8441,822 239,581239,355(a) In thousands, reflects total square feet less office, distribution center, and vacant space.20Other Performance FactorsNet Interest ExpenseNet interest expense from continuing operations was $461 million, $653 million, and $991 million for 2018, 2017, and 2016, respectively. Net interest expense for 2017 and 2016 included losses on early retirement of debt of $123 million and $422 million, respectively.Provision for Income TaxesOur 2018 effective income tax rate from continuing operations increased to 20.3 percent from 19.9 percent in 2017, primarily due to lower discrete favorable benefits of the Tax Act, which were $36 million in 2018 compared with $343 million in 2017, and less rate benefit from our global sourcing operations in 2018 compared with 2017. The lower 2018 benefit of discrete Tax Act-related items was substantially offset by the full-year benefit of a 21 percent federal statutory rate in 2018 compared with a 33.7 percent blended federal statutory rate in 2017.Our 2017 effective income tax rate from continuing operations decreased to 19.9 percent, from 32.7 percent in 2016, driven primarily by the impact of the Tax Act.Note 19 of the Financial Statements provides additional information.Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Financial Measures to GAAP MeasuresTo provide additional transparency, we have disclosed non-GAAP adjusted diluted earnings per share from continuing operations (Adjusted EPS). This metric excludes certain items presented below. We believe this information is useful in providing period-to-period comparisons of the results of our continuing operations. This measure is not in accordance with, or an alternative to, generally accepted accounting principles in the U.S. (GAAP). The most comparable GAAP measure is diluted earnings per share from continuing operations. Adjusted EPS should not be considered in isolation or as a substitution for analysis of our results as reported under GAAP. Other companies may calculate Adjusted EPS differently than we do, limiting the usefulness of the measure for comparisons with other companies. 2018 2017As Adjusted (a)(b) 2016As Adjusted (b)(millions, except per share data) Pretax Net of Tax Per Share Amounts Pretax Net of Tax Per Share Amounts Pretax Net of Tax Per Share AmountsGAAP diluted earnings per share from continuing operations $5.50 $5.29 $4.58Adjustments Tax Act (c) $— $(36) $(0.07) $— $(343) $(0.62) $— $— $—Loss on early retirement of debt — — — 123 75 0.14 422 257 0.44Other (d) — — — (5) (3) (0.01) (4) (2) —Other income tax matters (e) — (18) (0.03) — (57) (0.10) — (7) (0.01)Adjusted diluted earnings per share from continuing operations $5.39 $4.69 $5.00Note: Amounts may not foot due to rounding.(a) Consisted of 53 weeks.(b) Lease standard adoption resulted in a $0.03 and $0.02 reduction in GAAP and Adjusted EPS, respectively, for 2017, and a less than $0.01 and $0.01 reduction in GAAP and Adjusted EPS, respectively, for 2016.

These measures are not in accordance with, or an alternative for, GAAP. The most comparable GAAP measure is net earnings from continuing operations. EBIT and EBITDA should not be considered in isolation or as a substitution for analysis of our results as reported under GAAP. Other companies may calculate EBIT and EBITDA differently, limiting the usefulness of the measure for comparisons with other companies.

Our cash and cash equivalents balance includes short-term investments of $769 million and $1,906 million as of February 2, 2019, and February 3, 2018, respectively. Our investment policy is designed to preserve principal and liquidity of our short-term investments. This policy allows investments in large money market funds or in highly rated direct short-term instruments that mature in 60 days or less. We also place dollar limits on our investments in individual funds or instruments.Capital AllocationWe follow a disciplined and balanced approach to capital allocation based on the following priorities, ranked in order of importance: first, we fully invest in opportunities to profitably grow our business, create sustainable long-term value, and maintain our current operations and assets; second, we maintain a competitive quarterly dividend and seek to grow it annually; and finally, we return any excess cash to shareholders by repurchasing shares within the limits of our credit rating goals.Operating Cash FlowsOperating cash flow provided by continuing operations was $5,970 million in 2018 compared with $6,861 million in 2017 and $5,337 million in 2016. The 2018 operating cash flow decrease was primarily due to a larger increase in inventory in 2018 compared with 2017, partially offset by lower income tax payments in 2018 due to the Tax Act.The 2017 operating cash flow increase was due to increased payables leverage primarily driven by changes in vendor payment terms in 2017, partially offset by an inventory increase in 2017 compared with a decrease during 2016. The operating cash flow increase was also partially due to the payment of approximately $500 million of taxes during 2016 related to the sale of our pharmacy and clinic businesses.InventoryYear-end inventory was $9,497 million, compared with $8,597 million in 2017. We increased inventory in 2018 to support higher sales, including market share opportunities in toys and baby-related merchandise. In addition, inventory levels were increased to support new brand launches and our efforts to improve in-stock levels.24Capital ExpendituresCapital expenditures increased in 2018 from the prior year primarily due to increased investments in existing stores as we further accelerated our current store remodel program. This investment acceleration follows an increase in 2017 as we accelerated our store remodel program.In addition to these cash investments, we entered into leases related to new stores in 2018, 2017, and 2016 with total future minimum lease payments of $473 million, $438 million, and $550 million, respectively. We expect capital expenditures in 2019 at a level consistent with 2018 as we continue the current store remodel program, open additional small-format stores, and make other investments in our business. We also expect to continue our current rate of investment in store leases.DividendsWe paid dividends totaling $1,335 million ($2.52 per share) in 2018 and $1,338 million ($2.44 per share) in 2017, a per share increase of 3.3 percent. We declared dividends totaling $1,347 million ($2.54 per share) in 2018, a per share increase of 3.3 percent over 2017. We declared dividends totaling $1,356 million ($2.46 per share) in 2017, a per share increase of 4.2 percent over 2016. We have paid dividends every quarter since our 1967 initial public offering, and it is our intent to continue to do so in the future.Share RepurchasesDuring 2018, 2017, and 2016 we returned $2,067 million, $1,026 million, and $3,686 million, respectively, to shareholders through share repurchase. See Part II, Item 5 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K and Note 21 to the Financial Statements for more information.25FinancingOur financing strategy is to ensure liquidity and access to capital markets, to maintain a balanced spectrum of debt maturities, and to manage our net exposure to floating interest rate volatility. Within these parameters, we seek to minimize our borrowing costs. Our ability to access the long-term debt and commercial paper markets has provided us with ample sources of liquidity. Our continued access to these markets depends on multiple factors, including the condition of debt capital markets, our operating performance, and maintaining strong credit ratings. As of February 2, 2019, our credit ratings were as follows:Credit RatingsMoody'sStandard and Poor'sFitchLong-term debtA2AA-Commercial paperP-1A-1F2If our credit ratings were lowered, our ability to access the debt markets, our cost of funds, and other terms for new debt issuances could be adversely impacted. Each of the credit rating agencies reviews its rating periodically and there is no guarantee our current credit ratings will remain the same as described above.In 2018, we funded our holiday sales period working capital needs through internally generated funds and the issuance of commercial paper. In 2017, we funded our holiday sales period working capital needs through internally generated funds.We have additional liquidity through a committed $2.5 billion revolving credit facility obtained through a group of banks. In October 2018, we extended this credit facility by one year to October 2023. No balances were outstanding at any time during 2018, 2017, or 2016.Most of our long-term debt obligations contain covenants related to secured debt levels. In addition to a secured debt level covenant, our credit facility also contains a debt leverage covenant. We are, and expect to remain, in compliance with these covenants. Additionally, at February 2, 2019, no notes or debentures contained provisions requiring acceleration of payment upon a credit rating downgrade, except that certain outstanding notes allow the note holders to put the notes to us if within a matter of months of each other we experience both (i) a change in control and (ii) our long-term credit ratings are either reduced and the resulting rating is non-investment grade, or our long-term credit ratings are placed on watch for possible reduction and those ratings are subsequently reduced and the resulting rating is non-investment grade.Note 16 of the Financial Statements provides more information about financing activities.We believe our sources of liquidity will continue to be adequate to maintain operations, finance anticipated expansion and strategic initiatives, fund debt maturities, pay dividends, and execute purchases under our share repurchase program for the foreseeable future. We continue to anticipate ample access to commercial paper and long-term financing.26Commitments and ContingenciesContractual Obligations as ofPayments Due by PeriodFebruary 2, 2019 Less than 1-33-5After 5(millions)Total1 YearYearsYearsYearsRecorded contractual obligations: Long-term debt (a)$10,336$1,002$2,150$63$7,121Finance lease liabilities (b)1,46198196193974Operating lease liabilities (b)2,9042454704431,746Deferred compensation (c)51859116111232Real estate liabilities (d)121121———Tax contingencies (e)—————Unrecorded contractual obligations: Interest payments – long-term debt5,8934077246284,134Purchase obligations (f)99253217075215Real estate obligations (g)1,0134875967400Future contributions to retirement plans (h)—————Contractual obligations$23,238$2,951$3,885$1,580$14,822(a) Represents principal payments only. See Note 16 of the Financial Statements for further information.(b) Finance and operating lease payments include $127 million and $778 million, respectively, related to options to extend lease terms that are reasonably certain of being exercised. See Note 18 of the Financial Statements for further information.(c) The timing of deferred compensation payouts is estimated based on payments currently made to former employees and retirees and the projected timing of future retirements.(d) Real estate liabilities include costs incurred but not paid related to the construction or remodeling of real estate and facilities.(e) Estimated tax contingencies of $334 million, including interest and penalties and primarily related to continuing operations, are not included in the table above because we are not able to make reasonably reliable estimates of the period of cash settlement. See Note 19 of the Financial Statements for further information.(f) Purchase obligations include all legally binding contracts such as firm minimum commitments for inventory purchases, merchandise royalties, equipment purchases, marketing-related contracts, software acquisition/license commitments, and service contracts. We issue inventory purchase orders in the normal course of business, which represent authorizations to purchase that are cancelable by their terms. We do not consider purchase orders to be firm inventory commitments; therefore, they are excluded from the table above. If we choose to cancel a purchase order, we may be obligated to reimburse the vendor for unrecoverable outlays incurred prior to cancellation. We also issue trade letters of credit in the ordinary course of business, which are excluded from this table as these obligations are conditioned on terms of the letter of credit being met.(g) Real estate obligations include legally binding minimum lease payments for leases signed but not yet commenced, and commitments for the purchase, construction, or remodeling of real estate and facilities.(h) We have not included obligations under our pension plans in the contractual obligations table above because no additional amounts are required to be funded as of February 2, 2019. Our historical practice regarding these plans has been to contribute amounts necessary to satisfy minimum pension funding requirements, plus periodic discretionary amounts determined to be appropriate.Off Balance Sheet Arrangements: Other than the unrecorded contractual obligations noted above, we do not have any arrangements or relationships with entities that are not consolidated into the financial statements.27Critical Accounting EstimatesOur consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with GAAP, which requires us to make estimates and apply judgments that affect the reported amounts. In the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, we describe the significant accounting policies used in preparing the consolidated financial statements. Our management has discussed the development, selection, and disclosure of our critical accounting estimates with the Audit & Finance Committee of our Board of Directors. The following items require significant estimation or judgment:Inventory and cost of sales: The vast majority of our inventory is accounted for under the retail inventory accounting method using the last-in, first-out method. Our inventory is valued at the lower of cost or market. We reduce inventory for estimated losses related to shrink and markdowns. Our shrink estimate is based on historical losses verified by physical inventory counts. Historically, our actual physical inventory count results have shown our estimates to be reliable. Market adjustments for markdowns are recorded when the salability of the merchandise has diminished. We believe the risk of inventory obsolescence is largely mitigated because our inventory typically turns in less than three months. Inventory was $9,497 million and $8,597 million at February 2, 2019 and February 3, 2018, respectively, and is further described in Note 9 of the Financial Statements.Vendor income: We receive various forms of consideration from our vendors (vendor income), principally earned as a result of volume rebates, markdown allowances, promotions, and advertising allowances. Substantially all vendor income is recorded as a reduction of cost of sales.We establish a receivable for vendor income that is earned but not yet received. Based on the agreements in place, this receivable is computed by estimating when we have completed our performance and when the amount is earned. The majority of the year-end vendor income receivables are collected within the following fiscal quarter, and we do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood that the assumptions used in our estimate will change significantly. Historically, adjustments to our vendor income receivable have not been material. Vendor income receivable was $468 million and $416 million at February 2, 2019 and February 3, 2018, respectively. Vendor income is described further in Note 5 of the Financial Statements.Long-lived assets: Long-lived assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amounts may not be recoverable. The evaluation is performed at the lowest level of identifiable cash flows independent of other assets, which is primarily at the store level. An impairment loss would be recognized when estimated undiscounted future cash flows from the operation and/or disposition of the assets are less than their carrying amount. Measurement of an impairment loss would be based on the excess of the carrying amount of the asset group over its fair value. Fair value is measured using discounted cash flows or independent opinions of value, as appropriate. We recorded impairments of $92 million, $91 million, and $43 million in 2018, 2017, and 2016, respectively, which are described further in Note 11 of the Financial Statements. We applied the hindsight practical expedient for measurement of lease assets and liabilities, and associated leasehold improvement assets, in our adoption of ASU No. 2016-02—Leases (Topic 842), which required significant judgment to determine the reasonably certain lease term for existing leases in transition to the new standard. Using hindsight shortened lease terms for many leases. Operating lease assets and liabilities were $1,965 million and $2,170 million, respectively, at February 2, 2019. Finance lease assets and liabilities were $872 million and $1,021 million, respectively, at February 2, 2019. Leases are described further in Notes 2 and 18 of the Financial Statements.Insurance/self-insurance: We retain a substantial portion of the risk related to certain general liability, workers' compensation, property loss, and team member medical and dental claims. However, we maintain stop-loss coverage to limit the exposure related to certain risks. Liabilities associated with these losses include estimates of both claims filed and losses incurred but not yet reported. We use actuarial methods which consider a number of factors to estimate our ultimate cost of losses. General liability and workers' compensation liabilities are recorded at our estimate of their net present value; other liabilities referred to above are not discounted. Our workers' compensation and general liability accrual was $423 million and $419 million at February 2, 2019 and February 3, 2018, respectively. We believe that the amounts accrued are appropriate; however, our liabilities could be significantly affected if future occurrences or loss developments differ from our assumptions. For example, a 5 percent increase or decrease in average claim costs would impact our self-insurance expense by $21 million in 2018. Historically, adjustments to our estimates have not been material. Refer to Item 7A, Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk, for further disclosure of the market risks associated with these exposures. We maintain insurance coverage to limit our exposure to certain events, including network security matters. 28Income taxes: We pay income taxes based on the tax statutes, regulations, and case law of the various jurisdictions in which we operate. Significant judgment is required in determining the timing and amounts of deductible and taxable items, and in evaluating the ultimate resolution of tax matters in dispute with tax authorities.We recognized the income tax effects of the Tax Act in our 2018 and 2017 financial statements in accordance with Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 118, which provides SEC staff guidance for the application of ASC Topic 740, Income Taxes. Note 19 of the Financial Statements provides additional information.The benefits of uncertain tax positions are recorded in our financial statements only after determining it is likely the uncertain tax positions would withstand challenge by taxing authorities. We periodically reassess these probabilities and record any changes in the financial statements as appropriate. Liabilities for uncertain tax positions, including interest and penalties, were $334 million and $363 million at February 2, 2019 and February 3, 2018, respectively, and primarily relate to continuing operations. We believe the resolution of these matters will not have a material adverse impact on our consolidated financial statements. Income taxes are described further in Note 19 of the Financial Statements.Pension accounting: We maintain a funded, qualified defined benefit pension plan, as well as several smaller and unfunded nonqualified plans for certain current and retired team members. The costs for these plans are determined based on actuarial calculations using the assumptions described in the following paragraphs. Eligibility and the level of benefits varies depending on team members' full-time or part-time status, date of hire, age, and/or length of service. The benefit obligation and related expense for these plans are determined based on actuarial calculations using assumptions about the expected long-term rate of return, the discount rate, and compensation growth rates. The assumptions, with adjustments made for any significant plan or participant changes, are used to determine the period-end benefit obligation and establish expense for the next year.Our 2018 expected long-term rate of return on plan assets of 6.30 percent is determined by the portfolio composition, historical long-term investment performance, and current market conditions. A 1 percentage point decrease in our expected long-term rate of return would increase annual expense by $39 million. The discount rate used to determine benefit obligations is adjusted annually based on the interest rate for long-term high-quality corporate bonds, using yields for maturities that are in line with the duration of our pension liabilities. Our benefit obligation and related expense will fluctuate with changes in interest rates. A 1 percentage point decrease to the weighted average discount rate would increase annual expense by $68 million.Based on our experience, we use a graduated compensation growth schedule that assumes higher compensation growth for younger, shorter-service pension-eligible team members than it does for older, longer-service pension-eligible team members.Pension benefits are further described in Note 24 of the Financial Statements.Legal and other contingencies: We believe the accruals recorded in our consolidated financial statements properly reflect loss exposures that are both probable and reasonably estimable. We do not believe any of the currently identified claims or litigation may materially affect our results of operations, cash flows, or financial condition. However, litigation is subject to inherent uncertainties, and unfavorable rulings could occur. If an unfavorable ruling were to occur, it may cause a material adverse impact on the results of operations, cash flows, or financial condition for the period in which the ruling occurs, or future periods. Refer to Note 15 of the Financial Statements for further information on contingencies.New Accounting PronouncementsRefer to Note 2, Note 3, and Note 18, of the Financial Statements for a description of new accounting pronouncements related to revenues, leases, and pension expense. We do not expect any other recently issued accounting pronouncements will have a material effect on our financial statements.29Forward-Looking StatementsThis report contains forward-looking statements, which are based on our current assumptions and expectations. These statements are typically accompanied by the words ""expect,"" ""may,"" ""could,"" ""believe,"" ""would,"" ""might,"" ""anticipates,"" or words of similar import. The principal forward-looking statements in this report include: our financial performance, statements regarding the adequacy of and costs associated with our sources of liquidity, the continued execution of our share repurchase program, our expected capital expenditures and new lease commitments, the impact of changes in the expected effective income tax rate on net income, including those resulting from the Tax Act, the expected compliance with debt covenants, the expected impact of new accounting pronouncements, our intentions regarding future dividends, contributions and payments related to our pension plan, the expected returns on pension plan assets, the expected timing and recognition of compensation expenses, the effects of macroeconomic conditions, the adequacy of our reserves for general liability, workers' compensation and property loss, the expected outcome of, and adequacy of our reserves for investigations, inquiries, claims and litigation, expected changes to our contractual obligations and liabilities, the expected ability to recognize deferred tax assets and liabilities and the timing of such recognition, the resolution of tax matters, the expected impact of changes in information technology systems, and changes in our assumptions and expectations.All such forward-looking statements are intended to enjoy the protection of the safe harbor for forward-looking statements contained in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, as amended. Although we believe there is a reasonable basis for the forward-looking statements, our actual results could be materially different. The most important factors which could cause our actual results to differ from our forward-looking statements are set forth on our description of risk factors in Item 1A to this Form 10-K, which should be read in conjunction with the forward-looking statements in this report. Forward-looking statements speak only as of the date they are made, and we do not undertake any obligation to update any forward-looking statement.30Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market RiskAt February 2, 2019, our exposure to market risk was primarily from interest rate changes on our debt obligations, some of which are at a London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR)-plus floating-rate. Our interest rate exposure is primarily due to differences between our floating rate debt obligations compared to our floating rate short-term investments. At February 2, 2019, our floating rate debt exceeded our floating rate short-term investments by approximately $700 million. Based on our balance sheet position at February 2, 2019, the annualized effect of a 0.1 percentage point increase in floating interest rates on our floating rate debt obligations, net of our floating rate short-term investments, would not be significant. In general, we expect our floating rate debt to exceed our floating rate short-term investments over time, but that may vary in different interest rate environments. See further description of our debt and derivative instruments in Notes 16 and 17 to the Financial Statements.We record our general liability and workers' compensation liabilities at net present value; therefore, these liabilities fluctuate with changes in interest rates. Based on our balance sheet position at February 2, 2019, the annualized effect of a 0.5 percentage point decrease in interest rates would be to decrease earnings before income taxes by $6 million.In addition, we are exposed to market return fluctuations on our qualified defined benefit pension plans. The value of our pension liabilities is inversely related to changes in interest rates. A 1 percentage point decrease to the weighted average discount rate would increase annual expense by $68 million. To protect against declines in interest rates, we hold high-quality, long-duration bonds and interest rate swaps in our pension plan trust. At year-end, we had hedged 60 percent of the interest rate exposure of our funded status.As more fully described in Notes 12 and 23 to the Financial Statements, we are exposed to market returns on accumulated team member balances in our nonqualified, unfunded deferred compensation plans. We control the risk of offering the nonqualified plans by making investments in life insurance contracts and prepaid forward contracts on our own common stock that substantially offset our economic exposure to the returns on these plans. There have been no other material changes in our primary risk exposures or management of market risks since the prior year.31",2023-12-30 21:32:54.099486
27419,TGT,TARGET CORP,2020,"Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of OperationsExecutive OverviewOver the last several years, we have made strategic investments to build a durable operating and financial model that further differentiates Target and is designed to drive sustainable sales and profit growth. We have done this through an investment strategy focused on: Elevating the shopping experiences and winning with high-touch service •During the past three years, we have remodeled more than 700 stores, including nearly 300 during 2019. We plan to remodel approximately 300 in 2020.•We have grown our stores network and now have over 100 small format stores in key urban markets and on college campuses.•We have redesigned our store operating model – redefining roles for hundreds of thousands of team members to deliver better guest service. •We have invested significantly in our team, including a $13 starting hourly wage with a commitment to $15 by the end of 2020. Curation at Scale •We have delivered a steady stream of newness and exclusives across our assortment. We have introduced over 25 new owned and exclusive brands, including the 2019 launch of our new food and beverage owned brand, Good & Gather, which we expect will become our largest owned brand.Delivering Ease and Convenience through Same Day Services•We have expanded our digital fulfillment capabilities, which elevate the shopping experience and give our guests new reasons to choose Target. During 2019, over 70% of our comparable digital sales growth was driven by same-day fulfillment options: Order Pickup, Drive Up, and delivery via our wholly owned subsidiary, Shipt.These investments are translating into tangible financial results summarized below.Financial SummaryFiscal 2019 included the following notable items:•GAAP earnings per share from continuing operations were $6.34.•Adjusted earnings per share from continuing operations were $6.39.•Total revenue increased 3.7 percent, driven by a comparable sales increase and sales from new stores.•Comparable sales increased 3.4 percent, driven by a 2.7 percent increase in traffic.◦Comparable store sales grew 1.4 percent. ◦Digital channel sales increased 29 percent, contributing 1.9 percentage points to comparable sales growth.•Operating income of $4,658 million was 13.3 percent higher than the comparable prior-year period.Sales were $77,130 million for 2019, an increase of $2,697 million or 3.6 percent from the prior year. Operating cash flow provided by continuing operations was $7,099 million for 2019, an increase of $1,129 million, or 18.9 percent, from $5,970 million for 2018.TARGET CORPORATION2019 Form 10-K16MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSISTable of ContentsEXECUTIVE SUMMARY & ANALYSIS OF OPERATIONSIndex to Financial StatementsEarnings Per Share From Continuing Operations Percent Change2019 2018 2017 (a)2019/2018 2018/2017 GAAP diluted earnings per share $6.34 $5.50 $5.29 15.4 %4.0 %Adjustments0.05 (0.10) (0.60) Adjusted diluted earnings per share $6.39 $5.39 $4.69 18.4 %15.1 %Note: Amounts may not foot due to rounding. Adjusted diluted earnings per share from continuing operations (Adjusted EPS), a non-GAAP metric, excludes the impact of certain items. Management believes that Adjusted EPS is useful in providing period-to-period comparisons of the results of our continuing operations.

Note 2 to the Financial Statements defines gift card ""breakage."" We use comparable sales to evaluate the performance of our stores and digital channel sales by measuring the change in sales for a period over the comparable, prior-year period of equivalent length. Comparable sales include all sales, except sales from stores open less than 13 months, digital acquisitions we have owned less than 13 months, stores that have been closed, and digital acquisitions that we no longer operate. Comparable sales measures vary across the retail industry. As a result, our comparable sales calculation is not necessarily comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies. Digitally originated sales include all sales initiated through mobile applications and our websites. Our stores fulfill the majority of digitally originated sales, including shipment from stores to guests, store Order Pick Up or Drive Up, and delivery via Shipt. Digitally originated sales may also be fulfilled through our distribution centers, our vendors, or other third parties.Sales growth – from both comparable sales and new stores – represents an important driver of our long-term profitability. We expect that comparable sales growth will drive the majority of our total sales growth. We believe that our ability to successfully differentiate our guests’ shopping experience through a careful combination of merchandise assortment, price, convenience, guest experience, and other factors will over the long-term drive both increasing shopping frequency (traffic) and the amount spent each visit (average transaction amount).The increase in 2019 sales compared to 2018 is due to a 3.4 percent comparable sales increase and the contribution from new stores.Comparable Sales2019 2018 2017 Comparable sales change3.4 %5.0 %1.3 %Drivers of change in comparable sales Number of transactions2.7 5.0 1.6 Average transaction amount0.7 0.1 (0.3) Note: Amounts may not foot due to rounding.Contribution to Comparable Sales Change2019 2018 2017 Stores channel comparable sales change1.4 %3.2 %0.1 %Contribution from digitally originated sales to comparable sales change1.9 1.8 1.2 Total comparable sales change3.4 %5.0 %1.3 %Note: Amounts may not foot due to rounding.Sales by Channel2019 2018 2017 Stores originated91.2 %92.9 %94.5 %Digitally originated8.8 7.1 5.5 Total100 %100 %100 %Note 2 to the Financial Statements provides sales by product category.

Our cash and cash equivalents balance includes short-term investments of $1,810 million and $769 million as of February 1, 2020, and February 2, 2019, respectively. Our investment policy is designed to preserve principal and liquidity of our short-term investments. This policy allows investments in large money market funds or in highly rated direct short-term instruments that mature in 60 days or less. We also place dollar limits on our investments in individual funds or instruments.Capital AllocationWe follow a disciplined and balanced approach to capital allocation based on the following priorities, ranked in order of importance: first, we fully invest in opportunities to profitably grow our business, create sustainable long-term value, and maintain our current operations and assets; second, we maintain a competitive quarterly dividend and seek to grow it annually; and finally, we return any excess cash to shareholders by repurchasing shares within the limits of our credit rating goals.Operating Cash FlowsOperating cash flow provided by continuing operations was $7,099 million in 2019 compared with $5,970 million in 2018. The 2019 operating cash flow increase was primarily driven by higher net earnings and a reduction in inventory during 2019. Operating cash flow in 2019 also benefited from increased accounts payable due to timing of import inventory purchases, which have longer payment terms, compared with 2018.InventoryYear-end inventory was $8,992 million, compared with $9,497 million in 2018. Inventory levels were lower as of February 1, 2020, compared with February 2, 2019, partially due to focused efforts to reduce inventory across multiple categories where we optimized on-hand quantities and assortment. Additionally, elevated inventory levels in the prior year reflected intentional investments in toys merchandise.TARGET CORPORATION2019 Form 10-K23MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSISTable of ContentsANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITIONIndex to Financial StatementsCapital ExpendituresCapital expenditures decreased in 2019 from the prior year primarily due to project savings in our store remodel program and timing of certain planned expenditures. We have completed over 700 remodels since the launch of the current program in 2017, and expect to maintain our pace of approximately 300 remodels in 2020. Beginning in 2021, we expect to moderate the annual number of remodels to a range of 150 to 200.In addition to these cash investments, we entered into leases related to new stores in 2019, 2018, and 2017 with total future minimum lease payments of $669 million, $473 million, and $438 million, respectively.We expect capital expenditures in 2020 of approximately $3.5 billion as we continue the current store remodel program, open additional small-format stores, and accelerate investments in our supply chain. We also expect to continue to invest in new store leases.DividendsWe paid dividends totaling $1,330 million ($2.60 per share) in 2019 and $1,335 million ($2.52 per share) in 2018, a per share increase of 3.2 percent. We declared dividends totaling $1,345 million ($2.62 per share) in 2019 and $1,347 million ($2.54 per share) in 2018, a per share increase of 3.1 percent. We have paid dividends every quarter since our 1967 initial public offering and it is our intent to continue to do so in the future.Share RepurchasesDuring 2019 and 2018 we returned $1,518 million and $2,067 million, respectively, to shareholders through share repurchase. See Part II, Item 5, Market for the Registrant's Common Equity, Related Stockholder Matters and Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities of this Annual Report on Form 10-K and Note 20 to the Financial Statements for more information.TARGET CORPORATION2019 Form 10-K24MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSISTable of ContentsANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITIONIndex to Financial StatementsFinancingOur financing strategy is to ensure liquidity and access to capital markets, to maintain a balanced spectrum of debt maturities, and to manage our net exposure to floating interest rate volatility. Within these parameters, we seek to minimize our borrowing costs. Our ability to access the long-term debt and commercial paper markets has provided us with ample sources of liquidity. Our continued access to these markets depends on multiple factors, including the condition of debt capital markets, our operating performance, and maintaining strong credit ratings. As of February 1, 2020, our credit ratings were as follows:Credit RatingsMoody'sStandard and Poor'sFitchLong-term debtA2AA-Commercial paperP-1A-1F1If our credit ratings were lowered, our ability to access the debt markets, our cost of funds, and other terms for new debt issuances could be adversely impacted. Each of the credit rating agencies reviews its rating periodically and there is no guarantee our current credit ratings will remain the same as described above. Fitch raised our commercial paper rating from F2 to F1 during 2019.In March 2019, we issued $1.0 billion of debt, and in June 2019, we repaid $1.0 billion of debt at maturity. In January 2020, we issued $750 million of debt and we redeemed $1.0 billion of debt before its maturity.In both 2019 and 2018, we funded our holiday sales period working capital needs through internally generated funds and the issuance of commercial paper.We have additional liquidity through a committed $2.5 billion revolving credit facility obtained through a group of banks, which expires in October 2023. No balances were outstanding at any time during 2019 and 2018.Most of our long-term debt obligations contain covenants related to secured debt levels. In addition to a secured debt level covenant, our credit facility also contains a debt leverage covenant. We are, and expect to remain, in compliance with these covenants. Additionally, as of February 1, 2020, no notes or debentures contained provisions requiring acceleration of payment upon a credit rating downgrade, except that certain outstanding notes allow the note holders to put the notes to us if within a matter of months of each other we experience both (i) a change in control and (ii) our long-term credit ratings are either reduced and the resulting rating is non-investment grade, or our long-term credit ratings are placed on watch for possible reduction and those ratings are subsequently reduced and the resulting rating is non-investment grade.Notes 15 and 16 to the Financial Statements provide additional information.We believe our sources of liquidity will continue to be adequate to maintain operations, finance anticipated expansion and strategic initiatives, fund debt maturities, pay dividends, and execute purchases under our share repurchase programs for the foreseeable future. We continue to anticipate ample access to commercial paper and long-term financing.TARGET CORPORATION2019 Form 10-K25MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSISTable of ContentsANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITIONIndex to Financial StatementsCommitments and ContingenciesContractual Obligations as ofPayments Due by PeriodFebruary 1, 2020Less than 1-3 3-5 After 5 (millions)Total 1 Year Years Years Years Recorded contractual obligations: Long-term debt (a)$10,085 $94 $1,119 $1,000 $7,872 Finance lease liabilities (b)1,890 121 254 245 1,270 Operating lease liabilities (b)3,205 284 552 531 1,838 Deferred compensation (c)552 73 160 175 144 Real estate liabilities (d)90 90 — — — Tax contingencies (e)— — — — — Unrecorded contractual obligations: Interest payments – long-term debt5,964 399 766 707 4,092 Purchase obligations (f)676 247 135 74 220 Real estate obligations (g)1,313 588 66 88 571 Future contributions to retirement plans (h)— — — — — Contractual obligations$23,775 $1,896 $3,052 $2,820 $16,007 (a)Represents principal payments only.

We issue inventory purchase orders in the normal course of business, which represent authorizations to purchase that are cancelable by their terms. We do not consider purchase orders to be firm inventory commitments; therefore, they are excluded from the table above. If we choose to cancel a purchase order, we may be obligated to reimburse the vendor for unrecoverable outlays incurred prior to cancellation. We also issue trade letters of credit in the ordinary course of business, which are excluded from this table as these obligations are conditioned on terms of the letter of credit being met.(g)Real estate obligations include legally binding minimum lease payments for leases signed but not yet commenced, and commitments for the purchase, construction, or remodeling of real estate and facilities.(h)We have not included obligations under our pension plans in the contractual obligations table above because no additional amounts are required to be funded as of February 1, 2020. Our historical practice regarding these plans has been to contribute amounts necessary to satisfy minimum pension funding requirements, plus periodic discretionary amounts determined to be appropriate.Off Balance Sheet Arrangements: Other than the unrecorded contractual obligations noted above, we do not have any arrangements or relationships with entities that are not consolidated into the financial statements.TARGET CORPORATION2019 Form 10-K26MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSISTable of ContentsANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITIONIndex to Financial StatementsCritical Accounting EstimatesOur consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with GAAP, which requires us to make estimates and apply judgments that affect the reported amounts. In the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, we describe the significant accounting policies used in preparing the consolidated financial statements. Our management has discussed the development, selection, and disclosure of our critical accounting estimates with the Audit & Finance Committee of our Board of Directors. The following items require significant estimation or judgment:Inventory and cost of sales: The vast majority of our inventory is accounted for under the retail inventory accounting method using the last-in, first-out method (LIFO). Our inventory is valued at the lower of LIFO cost or market. We reduce inventory for estimated losses related to shrink and markdowns. Our shrink estimate is based on historical losses verified by physical inventory counts. Historically, our actual physical inventory count results have shown our estimates to be reliable. Market adjustments for markdowns are recorded when the salability of the merchandise has diminished. We believe the risk of inventory obsolescence is largely mitigated because our inventory typically turns in less than three months. Inventory was $8,992 million and $9,497 million as of February 1, 2020 and February 2, 2019, respectively, and is further described in Note 8 to the Financial Statements.Vendor income: We receive various forms of consideration from our vendors (vendor income), principally earned as a result of volume rebates, markdown allowances, promotions, and advertising allowances. Substantially all vendor income is recorded as a reduction of cost of sales.We establish a receivable for vendor income that is earned but not yet received. Based on historical trending and data, this receivable is computed by forecasting vendor income collections and estimating the amount earned. The majority of the year-end vendor income receivables are collected within the following fiscal quarter, and we do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood that the assumptions used in our estimate will change significantly. Historically, adjustments to our vendor income receivable have not been material. Vendor income receivable was $464 million and $468 million as of February 1, 2020 and February 2, 2019, respectively. Vendor income is described further in Note 4 to the Financial Statements.Long-lived assets: Long-lived assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amounts may not be recoverable. The evaluation is performed at the lowest level of identifiable cash flows independent of other assets, which is primarily at the store level. An impairment loss would be recognized when estimated undiscounted future cash flows from the operation and/or eventual disposition of the asset or asset group is less than its carrying amount, and is measured as the excess of its carrying amount over fair value. We estimate fair value by obtaining market appraisals, obtaining valuations from third-party brokers, or using other valuation techniques. We recorded impairments of $23 million, $92 million, and $91 million in 2019, 2018, and 2017, respectively, which are described further in Note 10 to the Financial Statements.Insurance/self-insurance: We retain a substantial portion of the risk related to certain general liability, workers' compensation, property loss, and team member medical and dental claims. However, we maintain stop-loss coverage to limit the exposure related to certain risks. Liabilities associated with these losses include estimates of both claims filed and losses incurred but not yet reported. We use actuarial methods which consider a number of factors to estimate our ultimate cost of losses. General liability and workers' compensation liabilities are recorded based on our estimate of their net present value; other liabilities referred to above are not discounted. Our workers' compensation and general liability accrual was $465 million and $423 million as of February 1, 2020 and February 2, 2019, respectively. We believe that the amounts accrued are appropriate; however, our liabilities could be significantly affected if future occurrences or loss developments differ from our assumptions. For example, a 5 percent increase or decrease in average claim costs would have impacted our self-insurance expense by $23 million in 2019. Historically, adjustments to our estimates have not been material. Refer to Part II, Item 7A, Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk, for further disclosure of the market risks associated with these exposures. We maintain insurance coverage to limit our exposure to certain events, including network security matters. Income taxes: We pay income taxes based on the tax statutes, regulations, and case law of the various jurisdictions in which we operate. Significant judgment is required in determining the timing and amounts of deductible and taxable items, and in evaluating the ultimate resolution of tax matters in dispute with tax authorities.TARGET CORPORATION2019 Form 10-K27MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSISTable of ContentsANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITIONIndex to Financial StatementsThe benefits of uncertain tax positions are recorded in our financial statements only after determining it is likely the uncertain tax positions would withstand challenge by taxing authorities. We periodically reassess these probabilities and record any changes in the financial statements as appropriate. Liabilities for uncertain tax positions, including interest and penalties, were $188 million and $334 million as of February 1, 2020 and February 2, 2019, respectively, and primarily relate to continuing operations. We believe the resolution of these matters will not have a material adverse impact on our consolidated financial statements. Income taxes are described further in Note 18 to the Financial Statements.Pension accounting: We maintain a funded qualified defined benefit pension plan, as well as nonqualified and international pension plans that are generally unfunded, for certain current and retired team members. The costs for these plans are determined based on actuarial calculations using the assumptions described in the following paragraphs. Eligibility and the level of benefits varies depending on team members' full-time or part-time status, date of hire, age, and/or length of service. The benefit obligation and related expense for these plans are determined based on actuarial calculations using assumptions about the expected long-term rate of return, the discount rate, compensation growth rates, mortality, and retirement age. These assumptions, with adjustments made for any significant plan or participant changes, are used to determine the period-end benefit obligation and establish expense for the next year.Our 2019 expected long-term rate of return on plan assets of 6.30 percent was determined by the portfolio composition, historical long-term investment performance, and current market conditions. A 1 percentage point decrease in our expected long-term rate of return would increase annual expense by $39 million.The discount rate used to determine benefit obligations is adjusted annually based on the interest rate for long-term high-quality corporate bonds, using yields for maturities that are in line with the duration of our pension liabilities. Our benefit obligation and related expense will fluctuate with changes in interest rates. A 1 percentage point decrease to the weighted average discount rate would increase annual expense by $61 million.Based on our experience, we use a graduated compensation growth schedule that assumes higher compensation growth for younger, shorter-service pension-eligible team members than it does for older, longer-service pension-eligible team members.Pension benefits are further described in Note 23 to the Financial Statements.Legal and other contingencies: We believe the accruals recorded in our consolidated financial statements properly reflect loss exposures that are both probable and reasonably estimable. We do not believe any of the currently identified claims or litigation may materially affect our results of operations, cash flows, or financial condition. However, litigation is subject to inherent uncertainties, and unfavorable rulings could occur. If an unfavorable ruling were to occur, it may cause a material adverse impact on the results of operations, cash flows, or financial condition for the period in which the ruling occurs, or future periods.

These statements are typically accompanied by the words ""expect,"" ""may,"" ""could,"" ""believe,"" ""would,"" ""might,"" ""anticipates,"" or similar words. The principal forward-looking statements in this report include: our financial performance, statements regarding the adequacy of and costs associated with our sources of liquidity, the funding of debt maturities, the continued execution of our share repurchase program, our expected capital expenditures and new lease commitments, the expected compliance with debt covenants, the expected impact of new accounting pronouncements, our intentions regarding future dividends, contributions and payments related to our pension plan, the expected return on plan assets, the expected timing and recognition of compensation expenses, the effects of macroeconomic conditions, the adequacy of our reserves for general liability, workers' compensation and property loss, the expected outcome of, and adequacy of our reserves for claims, litigation and the resolution of tax matters, our expectations regarding our contractual obligations, liabilities, and vendor income, the expected ability to recognize deferred tax assets and liabilities and the timing of such recognition, the expected impact of changes in information technology systems, and changes in our assumptions and expectations.All such forward-looking statements are intended to enjoy the protection of the safe harbor for forward-looking statements contained in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, as amended. Although we believe there is a reasonable basis for the forward-looking statements, our actual results could be materially different. The most important factors which could cause our actual results to differ from our forward-looking statements are set forth on our description of risk factors included in Part I, Item 1A, Risk Factors to this Form 10-K, which should be read in conjunction with the forward-looking statements in this report. Forward-looking statements speak only as of the date they are made, and we do not undertake any obligation to update any forward-looking statement.Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market RiskAs of February 1, 2020, our exposure to market risk was primarily from interest rate changes on our debt obligations, some of which are at a London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR). Our interest rate exposure is primarily due to differences between our floating rate debt obligations compared to our floating rate short-term investments. As of February 1, 2020, our floating rate short-term investments exceeded our floating rate debt by approximately $300 million. Based on our balance sheet position as of February 1, 2020, the annualized effect of a 0.1 percentage point increase in floating interest rates on our floating rate debt obligations, net of our floating rate short-term investments, would not be significant. In general, we expect our floating rate debt to exceed our floating rate short-term investments over time, but that may vary in different interest rate environments. See further description of our debt and derivative instruments in Notes 15 and 16 to the Financial Statements.In 2017, the United Kingdom's Financial Conduct Authority announced the intent to phase out LIBOR by the end of 2021. As a result, we may amend our contracts that use LIBOR as a benchmark, but do not expect these changes will have a material impact on our financial statements, liquidity and access to capital markets. We record our general liability and workers' compensation liabilities at net present value; therefore, these liabilities fluctuate with changes in interest rates. Based on our balance sheet position as of February 1, 2020, the annualized effect of a 0.5 percentage point decrease in interest rates would be to decrease earnings before income taxes by $6 million.In addition, we are exposed to market return fluctuations on our qualified defined benefit pension plan. The value of our pension liabilities is inversely related to changes in interest rates. A 1 percentage point decrease to the weighted average discount rate would increase annual expense by $61 million. To protect against declines in interest rates, we hold high-quality, long-duration bonds and interest rate swaps in our pension plan trust. At year-end, we had hedged 60 percent of the interest rate exposure of our plan liabilities.As more fully described in Note 22 to the Financial Statements, we are exposed to market returns on accumulated team member balances in our nonqualified, unfunded deferred compensation plans. We control the risk of offering the nonqualified plans by making investments in life insurance contracts and prepaid forward contracts on our own common stock that substantially offset our economic exposure to the returns on these plans.There have been no other material changes in our primary risk exposures or management of market risks since the prior year.TARGET CORPORATION2019 Form 10-K29FINANCIAL STATEMENTSTable of ContentsINDEXIndex to Financial Statements",2023-12-30 21:32:39.221294

Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of OperationsExecutive OverviewWhile our business was materially affected by the COVID-19 pandemic, resulting in significantly higher sales and profits in 2020, the pandemic highlighted the importance of our multi-category portfolio and our decision to put our stores at the center of our strategy. In 2020, we continued to make strategic investments to support our durable operating and financial model that further differentiates Target and is designed to drive sustainable sales and profit growth. We have done this through an investment strategy focused on: Elevating the Shopping Experiences and Winning with High-Touch Service •We remodeled 132 stores during 2020.•We opened 30 new stores, including 29 additional small format stores in key urban markets and on college campuses.•We invested significantly in our team, including a $15/hour minimum hourly wage for US team members, recognition bonuses, and certain other benefits in light of the COVID-19 pandemic. •We made significant investments in the health and safety of team members and guests. Curation at Scale •We continued the steady stream of newness and exclusives across our assortment and continued to introduce new owned brands. We expanded the assortment of our Food & Beverage owned brand, Good & GatherTM, which launched in 2019 and has become our largest selling food brand.•We announced a partnership with Ulta Beauty under which we will operate Ulta Beauty at Target, a shop-in-shop experience debuting on Target.com and in more than 100 Target locations beginning in 2021, with plans to scale to hundreds more over time.Delivering Ease and Convenience through Same-Day Services•We expanded our digital fulfillment capabilities, including fresh and frozen Food & Beverage products added to Order Pickup and Drive Up. During 2020, over 50 percent of our comparable digital sales growth was driven by same-day fulfillment options: Order Pickup, Drive Up, and delivery via Shipt.Financial Summary2020 included the following notable items:•GAAP diluted earnings per share were $8.64.•Adjusted diluted earnings per share were $9.42.•Total revenue increased 19.8 percent, driven by an increase in comparable sales.•Comparable sales increased 19.3 percent, driven by a 15.0 percent increase in average transaction amount.◦Comparable store originated sales grew 7.2 percent. ◦Comparable digital originated sales increased 145 percent.•Operating income of $6.5 billion was 40.4 percent higher than the comparable prior-year period.•We repurchased $1.77 billion of debt before its maturity at a market value of $2.25 billion, resulting in a loss of $512 million.Sales were $92.4 billion for 2020, an increase of $15.3 billion, or 19.8 percent, from the prior year. Operating cash flow provided by continuing operations was $10.5 billion for 2020, an increase of $3.4 billion, or 48.3 percent, from $7.1 billion for 2019.TARGET CORPORATION2020 Form 10-K17MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSISTable of ContentsEXECUTIVE OVERVIEW & FINANCIAL SUMMARYIndex to Financial StatementsEarnings Per Share From Continuing Operations Percent Change2020 2019 2018 2020/20192019/2018GAAP diluted earnings per share $8.64 $6.34 $5.50 36.3 %15.4 %Adjustments0.78 0.05 (0.10) Adjusted diluted earnings per share $9.42 $6.39 $5.39 47.4 %18.4 %Note: Amounts may not foot due to rounding. Adjusted diluted earnings per share from continuing operations (Adjusted EPS), a non-GAAP metric, excludes the impact of certain items. Management believes that Adjusted EPS is useful in providing period-to-period comparisons of the results of our continuing operations. A reconciliation of non-GAAP financial measures to GAAP measures is provided on page 23.We report after-tax return on invested capital (ROIC) from continuing operations because we believe ROIC provides a meaningful measure of our capital-allocation effectiveness over time. For the trailing twelve months ended January 30, 2021, after-tax ROIC was 23.5 percent, compared with 16.0 percent for the trailing twelve months ended February 1, 2020. The calculation of ROIC is provided on page 24.COVID-19On March 11, 2020, the World Health Organization declared the novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) a pandemic, and on March 13, 2020, the United States declared a national emergency. The rapid development and fluidity of this situation limits our ability to predict the ultimate impact of COVID-19 on our business, financial condition and financial performance, which has been and could continue to be material. States and local governments have taken various measures in response to COVID-19, including mandating the closure of certain businesses and encouraging or requiring citizens to avoid large gatherings. We have implemented numerous safety measures to protect our guests and team members — such as mandating face masks for all team members and guests in our stores, more rigorous cleaning processes, providing disposable face masks, gloves and thermometers for team members, installing distancing markers at stores, limiting guest levels within our stores, and installing partitions at all stores. To date, virtually all of our stores, digital channels, and distribution centers have remained open.As the pandemic has evolved, we have experienced unusually strong sales, as guests rely on Target for essential items like food, medicine, cleaning products, and household stock-up items, as well as merchandise associated with guests spending more time at home. Underlying this trend, we saw significant volatility in our sales mix, including both category and channel sales mix and same-day fulfillment options.•During the first quarter, comparable sales increased 10.8 percent, reflecting a 0.9 percent increase in store originated comparable sales and a 141 percent increase in digitally originated comparable sales. The quarter began with strength across our multi-category portfolio, followed by a shift to strong comparable sales growth in our Food & Beverage and Beauty & Household Essentials core merchandising categories and significant comparable sales declines in Apparel & Accessories. Comparable sales in Apparel & Accessories recovered notably beginning mid-April.•During the second through fourth quarters, comparable sales increased 21.7 percent, reflecting store originated comparable sales growth of 9.1 percent, and an increase in digitally originated comparable sales of 146 percent. Comparable sales growth was strong across our multi-category portfolio, with slightly higher growth in lower-margin categories.For the year ended January 30, 2021, gross margin was negatively impacted by changes in both our category and channel sales mix. Additionally, gross margin reflects the portion of investments in pay and benefits classified within Cost of Sales. Exceptionally low clearance and promotional markdown rates partially offset these pressures.Our SG&A expenses include significant incremental costs related to investments in pay and benefits for store team members, the spikes in merchandise volume in stores and the supply chain, incremental safety and cleaning supplies, and the impact of additional team member hours dedicated to more rigorous cleaning routines in our facilities. From an SG&A expense rate perspective, these incremental costs were more than offset by cost leverage resulting from exceptionally strong sales growth.To support our team and minimize potential disruptions in their work to serve our guests, we modified our plans for some of our strategic initiatives, including our previously announced remodel program. We completed 132 remodels TARGET CORPORATION2020 Form 10-K18MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSISTable of ContentsFINANCIAL SUMMARY & ANALYSIS OF OPERATIONSIndex to Financial Statementsin 2020, down from the previous expectation of approximately 300. Similarly, we opened 29 new small format stores in 2020, rather than the 36 previously announced.During the first quarter 2020, we issued $2.5 billion of 5-year and 10-year notes in an effort to increase our cash on hand. Additionally, we entered into a $900 million 364-day credit facility, increasing our total undrawn committed credit facilities to $3.4 billion. Our operating performance during the second and third quarters of 2020 and financial position allowed us to repurchase $1.77 billion of debt before its maturity at a market value of $2.25 billion in October 2020 and terminate the 364-day credit facility in November 2020. Note 17 to the Consolidated Financial Statements and the Liquidity and Capital Resources section provide additional information.Sale of DermstoreIn February 2021, we sold Dermstore LLC (Dermstore) for approximately $350 million, subject to working capital and other closing adjustments. We expect to recognize a pre-tax gain in excess of $300 million in the first quarter of 2021. Dermstore represented less than 1 percent of our consolidated revenues, operating income and net assets.Analysis of Results of OperationsSummary of Operating Income Percent Change(dollars in millions)2020 2019 2018 2020/20192019/2018Sales $92,400 $77,130 $74,433 19.8 %3.6 %Other revenue1,161 982 923 18.2 6.3 Total revenue93,561 78,112 75,356 19.8 3.7 Cost of sales66,177 54,864 53,299 20.6 2.9 SG&A expenses18,615 16,233 15,723 14.7 3.2 Depreciation and amortization (exclusive of depreciation included in cost of sales)2,230 2,357 2,224 (5.4)6.0 Operating income$6,539 $4,658 $4,110 40.4 %13.3 %Rate Analysis2020 2019 2018 Gross margin rate28.4 %28.9 %28.4 %SG&A expense rate19.9 20.8 20.9 Depreciation and amortization (exclusive of depreciation included in cost of sales) expense rate2.4 3.0 3.0 Operating income margin rate7.0 6.0 5.5 Note: Gross margin rate is calculated as gross margin (sales less cost of sales) divided by sales.

Note 3 to the Financial Statements defines gift card ""breakage."" We use comparable sales to evaluate the performance of our stores and digital channel sales by measuring the change in sales for a period over the comparable, prior-year period of equivalent length. Comparable sales include all sales, except sales from stores open less than 13 months, digital acquisitions we have owned less than 13 months, stores that have been closed, and digital acquisitions that we no longer operate. Comparable sales measures vary across the retail industry. As a result, our comparable sales calculation is not necessarily comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies. Digitally originated sales include all sales initiated through mobile applications and our websites. Our stores fulfill the majority of digitally originated sales, including shipment from stores to guests, store Order Pickup or Drive Up, and delivery via Shipt. Digitally originated sales may also be fulfilled through our distribution centers, our vendors, or other third parties.Sales growth – from both comparable sales and new stores – represents an important driver of our long-term profitability. We expect that comparable sales growth will drive the majority of our total sales growth. We believe that our ability to successfully differentiate our guests’ shopping experience through a careful combination of merchandise assortment, price, convenience, guest experience, and other factors will over the long-term drive both increasing shopping frequency (traffic) and the amount spent each visit (average transaction amount).The increase in 2020 sales compared to 2019 is due to a 19.3 percent comparable sales increase and the contribution from new stores. The COVID-19 pandemic has affected the amount and mix of sales across channels and categories.Comparable Sales2020 2019 2018 Comparable sales change19.3 %3.4 %5.0 %Drivers of change in comparable sales Number of transactions3.7 2.7 5.0 Average transaction amount15.0 0.7 0.1 Contribution to Comparable Sales Change2020 2019 2018 Stores originated channel comparable sales change7.2 %1.4 %3.2 %Contribution from digitally originated sales to comparable sales12.1 1.9 1.8 Total comparable sales change19.3 %3.4 %5.0 %Note: Amounts may not foot due to rounding.Sales by Channel2020 2019 2018 Stores originated82.1 %91.2 %92.9 %Digitally originated17.9 8.8 7.1 Total100 %100 %100 %TARGET CORPORATION2020 Form 10-K20MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSISTable of ContentsANALYSIS OF OPERATIONSIndex to Financial StatementsSales by Product Category2020 2019 2018 Apparel and accessories16 %19 %18 %Beauty and household essentials26 27 26 Food and beverage20 19 20 Hardlines18 16 17 Home furnishings and décor20 19 19 Total100 %100 %100 %Note 3 to the Financial Statements provides additional product category sales information.

Additionally, we offer a branded proprietary Target Debit Card. Collectively, we refer to these products as RedCards™. We monitor the percentage of purchases that are paid for using RedCards (RedCard Penetration) because our internal analysis has indicated that a meaningful portion of incremental purchases on our RedCards are also incremental sales for Target. Guests receive a 5 percent discount on virtually all purchases when they use a RedCard at Target. RedCard sales increased for all years presented below; however, RedCard penetration declined as total Sales increased at a faster pace.RedCard Penetration2020 2019 2018 Target Debit Card12.3 %12.6 %13.0 %Target Credit Cards9.2 10.7 10.9 Total RedCard Penetration21.5 %23.3 %23.8 %Note: Amounts may not foot due to rounding.Gross Margin RateOur gross margin rate was 28.4 percent in 2020 and 28.9 percent in 2019. This decrease reflected increased digital fulfillment and supply chain costs (stemming from unusually strong growth in digital volume combined with the impact of higher pay and benefit costs classified within Cost of Sales) and the impact of category sales mix, as sales growth was strongest in lower-margin categories. The decrease was partially offset by the net impact of merchandising actions, most notably the benefit of exceptionally low clearance and promotional markdown rates.TARGET CORPORATION2020 Form 10-K21MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSISTable of ContentsANALYSIS OF OPERATIONSIndex to Financial StatementsSelling, General and Administrative (SG&A) Expense RateOur SG&A expense rate was 19.9 percent in 2020 and 20.8 percent in 2019. Incremental team member pay and benefits and investments to protect the health and safety of guests represented approximately $1.5 billion of the $2.4 billion increase in SG&A expenses for the year ended January 30, 2021, compared with the prior-year periods. From a rate perspective, these increased costs were more than offset by leverage resulting from strong revenue growth.Store DataChange in Number of Stores2020 2019 Beginning store count1,868 1,844 Opened30 26 Closed(1)(2)Ending store count1,897 1,868 Number of Stores andRetail Square FeetNumber of StoresRetail Square Feet (a)January 30, 2021February 1, 2020January 30, 2021February 1, 2020170,000 or more sq. ft.273 272 48,798 48,619 50,000 to 169,999 sq. ft.1,509 1,505 189,508 189,227 49,999 or less sq. ft.115 91 3,342 2,670 Total1,897 1,868 241,648 240,516 (a)In thousands, reflects total square feet less office, distribution center, and vacant space.Other Performance FactorsNet Interest ExpenseNet interest expense from continuing operations was $977 million and $477 million for 2020 and 2019, respectively. The increase was primarily due to a $512 million loss on early retirement of debt in 2020.Provision for Income TaxesOur 2020 effective income tax rate from continuing operations was 21.2 percent compared with 22.0 percent in 2019. The effective tax rate for 2020 reflects a larger rate benefit from discrete items, primarily related to share-based payments and resolution of certain income tax matters, partially offset by the rate impact of higher earnings, compared with the prior year.Note 19 to the Financial Statements provides additional information.TARGET CORPORATION2020 Form 10-K22MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSISTable of ContentsRECONCILIATION OF NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURESIndex to Financial StatementsReconciliation of Non-GAAP Financial Measures to GAAP MeasuresTo provide additional transparency, we have disclosed non-GAAP adjusted diluted earnings per share from continuing operations (Adjusted EPS).

In November 2020, we lifted the share repurchase suspension and, in February 2021, began repurchasing shares. We believe our sources of liquidity will continue to be adequate to maintain operations, finance anticipated expansion and strategic initiatives, fund debt maturities, pay dividends, and execute purchases under our share repurchase program for the foreseeable future. We continue to anticipate ample access to commercial paper and long-term financing.Our period-end cash and cash equivalents balance increased to $8.5 billion from $2.6 billion in 2019. Our cash and cash equivalents balance includes short-term investments of $7.6 billion and $1.8 billion as of January 30, 2021, and February 1, 2020, respectively. Our investment policy is designed to preserve principal and liquidity of our short-term investments. This policy allows investments in large money market funds or in highly rated direct short-term instruments that mature in 60 days or less. We also place dollar limits on our investments in individual funds or instruments.Operating Cash FlowsOperating cash flow provided by continuing operations was $10.5 billion in 2020 compared with $7.1 billion in 2019. The increase reflects stronger operating performance combined with higher payables leverage during 2020 due to increased inventory turnover driven by strong sales, compared with 2019. Additionally, operating cash flows for 2020 reflect increased payroll-related liabilities, including the deferral of employer social security tax payments and higher incentive compensation.InventoryYear-end inventory was $10.7 billion, compared with $9.0 billion in 2019. Inventory levels were higher as of January 30, 2021, compared with February 1, 2020, reflecting efforts to align inventory with sales trends.TARGET CORPORATION2020 Form 10-K25MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSISTable of ContentsANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITIONIndex to Financial StatementsCapital ExpendituresCapital expenditures decreased in 2020 from the prior year as we modified plans for some of our strategic initiatives, including store remodels and new store openings, as a result of COVID-19. We have completed over 800 remodels since the launch of the current program in 2017, including 132 in 2020. We expect to complete 150 full-store remodels and open 30 to 40 new stores during 2021.In addition to these cash investments, we entered into leases related to new stores in 2020, 2019, and 2018 with total future minimum lease payments of $764 million, $669 million, and $473 million, respectively, and new leases related to our supply chain with total future minimum lease payments of $442 million, $185 million, and $11 million, respectively.We expect capital expenditures in 2021 of approximately $4.0 billion to support remodels, new stores, and supply chain projects to add replenishment capacity and modernize the network, including sortation centers. Beyond full-store remodels, we will invest in optimizing front-end space in our highest-volume locations, increasing the efficiency of our Pickup and Drive Up services, as well as the build-out of Ulta Beauty shop-in-shops. We also expect to continue to invest in new store and supply chain leases.DividendsWe paid dividends totaling $1.3 billion ($2.68 per share) in 2020 and $1.3 billion ($2.60 per share) in 2019, a per share increase of 3.1 percent. We declared dividends totaling $1.4 billion ($2.70 per share) in 2020 and $1.3 billion ($2.62 per share) in 2019, a per share increase of 3.1 percent. We have paid dividends every quarter since our 1967 initial public offering and it is our intent to continue to do so in the future.Share RepurchasesDuring 2020 and 2019 we returned $609 million and $1.5 billion, respectively, to shareholders through share repurchase.

Within these parameters, we seek to minimize our borrowing costs. Our ability to access the long-term debt and commercial paper markets has provided us with ample sources of liquidity. Our continued access to these markets depends on multiple factors, including the condition of debt capital markets, our operating performance, and maintaining strong credit ratings. As of January 30, 2021, our credit ratings were as follows:Credit RatingsMoody'sStandard and Poor'sFitchLong-term debtA2AA-Commercial paperP-1A-1F1If our credit ratings were lowered, our ability to access the debt markets, our cost of funds, and other terms for new debt issuances could be adversely impacted. Each of the credit rating agencies reviews its rating periodically and there is no guarantee our current credit ratings will remain the same as described above.In 2020, we funded our holiday sales period working capital needs through internally generated funds. In 2019, we funded our holiday sales period working capital needs through internally generated funds and the issuance of commercial paper.We have additional liquidity through a committed $2.5 billion revolving credit facility obtained through a group of banks, which expires in October 2023. No balances were outstanding at any time during 2020 or 2019.Most of our long-term debt obligations contain covenants related to secured debt levels. In addition to a secured debt level covenant, our credit facility also contains a debt leverage covenant. We are, and expect to remain, in compliance with these covenants. Additionally, as of January 30, 2021, no notes or debentures contained provisions requiring acceleration of payment upon a credit rating downgrade, except that certain outstanding notes allow the note holders to put the notes to us if within a matter of months of each other we experience both (i) a change in control and (ii) our long-term credit ratings are either reduced and the resulting rating is non-investment grade, or our long-term credit ratings are placed on watch for possible reduction and those ratings are subsequently reduced and the resulting rating is non-investment grade.Note 16 to the Financial Statements provides additional information.Critical Accounting EstimatesOur consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with GAAP, which requires us to make estimates and apply judgments that affect the reported amounts. In the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, we describe the significant accounting policies used in preparing the consolidated financial statements. Our management has discussed the development, selection, and disclosure of our critical accounting estimates with the Audit & Finance Committee of our Board of Directors. The following items require significant estimation or judgment:Inventory and cost of sales: The vast majority of our inventory is accounted for under the retail inventory accounting method using the last-in, first-out method (LIFO). Our inventory is valued at the lower of LIFO cost or market. We reduce inventory for estimated losses related to shrink and markdowns. Our shrink estimate is based on historical losses verified by physical inventory counts. Historically, our actual physical inventory count results have shown our estimates to be reliable. Market adjustments for markdowns are recorded when the salability of the merchandise has diminished. Salability can be impacted by consumer preferences and seasonality, among other factors. We believe the risk of inventory obsolescence is largely mitigated because our inventory typically turns in less than three months. Inventory was $10.7 billion and $9.0 billion as of January 30, 2021, and February 1, 2020, respectively, and is further described in Note 9 to the Financial Statements.Vendor income: We receive various forms of consideration from our vendors (vendor income), principally earned as a result of volume rebates, markdown allowances, promotions, and advertising allowances. Substantially all vendor income is recorded as a reduction of cost of sales. Vendor income earned can vary based on a number of factors, including purchase volumes, sales volumes, and our pricing and promotion strategies.TARGET CORPORATION2020 Form 10-K27MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSISTable of ContentsANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITIONIndex to Financial StatementsWe establish a receivable for vendor income that is earned but not yet received. Based on historical trending and data, this receivable is computed by forecasting vendor income collections and estimating the amount earned. The majority of the year-end vendor income receivables are collected within the following fiscal quarter, and we do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood that the assumptions used in our estimate will change significantly. Historically, adjustments to our vendor income receivable have not been material. Vendor income receivable was $504 million and $464 million as of January 30, 2021, and February 1, 2020, respectively. Vendor income is described further in Note 5 to the Financial Statements.Long-lived assets: Long-lived assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amounts may not be recoverable. The evaluation is performed primarily at the store level. An impairment loss would be recognized when estimated undiscounted future cash flows from the operation and/or eventual disposition of the asset or asset group is less than its carrying amount, and is measured as the excess of its carrying amount over fair value. We estimate fair value by obtaining market appraisals, obtaining valuations from third-party brokers, or using other valuation techniques. We recorded impairments of $62 million, $23 million, and $92 million in 2020, 2019, and 2018, respectively, which are described further in Note 11 to the Financial Statements.Insurance/self-insurance: We retain a substantial portion of the risk related to certain general liability, workers' compensation, property loss, and team member medical and dental claims. However, we maintain stop-loss coverage to limit the exposure related to certain risks. Liabilities associated with these losses include estimates of both claims filed and losses incurred but not yet reported. We use actuarial methods which consider a number of factors to estimate our ultimate cost of losses. General liability and workers' compensation liabilities are recorded based on our estimate of their net present value; other liabilities referred to above are not discounted. Our workers' compensation and general liability accrual was $510 million and $465 million as of January 30, 2021, and February 1, 2020, respectively. We believe that the amounts accrued are appropriate; however, our liabilities could be significantly affected if future occurrences or loss developments differ from our assumptions. For example, a 5 percent increase or decrease in average claim costs would have impacted our self-insurance expense by $25 million in 2020. Historically, adjustments to our estimates have not been material. Refer to Part II, Item 7A, Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk, for further disclosure of the market risks associated with these exposures. We maintain insurance coverage to limit our exposure to certain events, including network security matters. Income taxes: We pay income taxes based on the tax statutes, regulations, and case law of the various jurisdictions in which we operate. Significant judgment is required in determining the timing and amounts of deductible and taxable items, and in evaluating the ultimate resolution of tax matters in dispute with tax authorities. The benefits of uncertain tax positions are recorded in our financial statements only after determining it is likely the uncertain tax positions would withstand challenge by taxing authorities. We periodically reassess these probabilities and record any changes in the financial statements as appropriate. Liabilities for uncertain tax positions, including interest and penalties, were $193 million and $188 million as of January 30, 2021, and February 1, 2020, respectively. We believe the resolution of these matters will not have a material adverse impact on our consolidated financial statements. Income taxes are described further in Note 19 to the Financial Statements.Pension accounting: We maintain a funded qualified defined benefit pension plan, as well as nonqualified and international pension plans that are generally unfunded, for certain current and retired team members. The costs for these plans are determined based on actuarial calculations using the assumptions described in the following paragraphs. Eligibility and the level of benefits vary depending on each team member's full-time or part-time status, date of hire, age, length of service, and/or compensation. The benefit obligation and related expense for these plans are determined based on actuarial calculations using assumptions about the expected long-term rate of return, the discount rate, compensation growth rates, mortality, and retirement age. These assumptions, with adjustments made for any significant plan or participant changes, are used to determine the period-end benefit obligation and establish expense for the next year.Our 2020 expected long-term rate of return on plan assets of 6.10 percent was determined by the portfolio composition, historical long-term investment performance, and current market conditions. A 1 percentage point decrease in our expected long-term rate of return would increase annual expense by $40 million.The discount rate used to determine benefit obligations is adjusted annually based on the interest rate for long-term high-quality corporate bonds, using yields for maturities that are in line with the duration of our pension liabilities. TARGET CORPORATION2020 Form 10-K28MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSISTable of ContentsNEW ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS & FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTSIndex to Financial StatementsOur benefit obligation and related expense will fluctuate with changes in interest rates. A 1 percentage point decrease to the weighted average discount rate would increase annual expense by $59 million.Based on our experience, we use a graduated compensation growth schedule that assumes higher compensation growth for younger, shorter-service pension-eligible team members than it does for older, longer-service pension-eligible team members.Pension benefits are further described in Note 24 to the Financial Statements.Legal and other contingencies: We believe the accruals recorded in our consolidated financial statements properly reflect loss exposures that are both probable and reasonably estimable. We do not believe any of the currently identified claims or litigation may materially affect our results of operations, cash flows, or financial condition. However, litigation is subject to inherent uncertainties, and unfavorable rulings could occur. If an unfavorable ruling were to occur, it may cause a material adverse impact on the results of operations, cash flows, or financial condition for the period in which the ruling occurs, or future periods. Refer to Note 15 to the Financial Statements for further information on contingencies.New Accounting PronouncementsWe do not expect that any recently issued accounting pronouncements will have a material effect on our financial statements.Forward-Looking StatementsThis report contains forward-looking statements, which are based on our current assumptions and expectations. These statements are typically accompanied by the words ""expect,"" ""may,"" ""could,"" ""believe,"" ""would,"" ""might,"" ""anticipates,"" or similar words. The principal forward-looking statements in this report include: our financial performance, statements regarding the adequacy of and costs associated with our sources of liquidity, the funding of debt maturities, the continued execution of our share repurchase program, our expected capital expenditures and new lease commitments, the expected compliance with debt covenants, the expected impact of new accounting pronouncements, our intentions regarding future dividends, contributions and payments related to our pension plan, the expected return on plan assets, the expected timing and recognition of compensation expenses, the effects of macroeconomic conditions, the adequacy of our reserves for general liability, workers' compensation and property loss, the expected outcome of, and adequacy of our reserves for claims, litigation and the resolution of tax matters, our expectations regarding our contractual obligations, liabilities, and vendor income, the expected ability to recognize deferred tax assets and liabilities and the timing of such recognition, the expected impact of changes in information technology systems, future responses to and effects of the COVID-19 pandemic, and changes in our assumptions and expectations.All such forward-looking statements are intended to enjoy the protection of the safe harbor for forward-looking statements contained in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, as amended. Although we believe there is a reasonable basis for the forward-looking statements, our actual results could be materially different. The most important factors which could cause our actual results to differ from our forward-looking statements are set forth on our description of risk factors included in Part I, Item 1A, Risk Factors to this Form 10-K, which should be read in conjunction with the forward-looking statements in this report. Forward-looking statements speak only as of the date they are made, and we do not undertake any obligation to update any forward-looking statement.TARGET CORPORATION2020 Form 10-K29MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSISTable of ContentsQUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURESIndex to Financial StatementsItem 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market RiskAs of January 30, 2021, our exposure to market risk was primarily from interest rate changes on our debt obligations, some of which are at a London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR). Our interest rate exposure is primarily due to differences between our floating rate debt obligations compared to our floating rate short-term investments. As of January 30, 2021, our floating rate short-term investments exceeded our floating rate debt by approximately $6.1 billion. Based on our balance sheet position as of January 30, 2021, the annualized effect of a 0.1 percentage point increase in floating interest rates on our floating rate debt obligations, net of our floating rate short-term investments, would increase our earnings before income taxes by $6 million. In general, we expect our floating rate debt to exceed our floating rate short-term investments over time, but that may vary in different interest rate and economic environments. For example, our short-term investments as of January 30, 2021, exceeded our floating rate debt due to operating cash flow acceleration driven by strong operating results, as well as the temporary suspension of share repurchases and reduced capital expenditures in the uncertain environment. See further description of our debt and derivative instruments in Notes 16 and 17 to the Financial Statements.The United Kingdom's Financial Conduct Authority has announced the intent to phase out LIBOR over the next several years. We do not expect the phase out to materially impact our financial statements, liquidity or access to capital markets. We record our general liability and workers' compensation liabilities at net present value; therefore, these liabilities fluctuate with changes in interest rates. Based on our balance sheet position as of January 30, 2021, the annualized effect of a 0.5 percentage point decrease in interest rates would be to decrease earnings before income taxes by $5 million.In addition, we are exposed to market return fluctuations on our qualified defined benefit pension plan. The value of our pension liabilities is inversely related to changes in interest rates. A 1 percentage point decrease in the weighted average discount rate would increase annual expense by $59 million. To protect against declines in interest rates, we hold high-quality, long-duration bonds and derivative instruments in our pension plan trust. At year-end, we had hedged 65 percent of the interest rate exposure of our plan liabilities.As more fully described in Note 23 to the Financial Statements, we are exposed to market returns on accumulated team member balances in our nonqualified, unfunded deferred compensation plans. We control the risk of offering the nonqualified plans by making investments in life insurance contracts and prepaid forward contracts on our own common stock that substantially offset our economic exposure to the returns on these plans.There have been no other material changes in our primary risk exposures or management of market risks since the prior year.TARGET CORPORATION2020 Form 10-K30FINANCIAL STATEMENTSTable of ContentsINDEXIndex to Financial Statements",2023-12-30 21:32:30.859267

In 2020 and 2021, governments took various measures in response to COVID-19, such as mandating the closure of certain businesses and encouraging or requiring citizens to avoid large gatherings. To date, virtually all of our stores, digital channels, and distribution centers have remained open. Since the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, we have experienced strong comparable sales growth and significant volatility in our sales category and channel mix.Supply Chain DisruptionsIn recent months, we have seen increasing supply chain disruptions. In addition to country of origin production delays, trucker and dockworker shortages, a broad-based surge in consumer demand, and other factors have led to industry-wide U.S. port and ground transportation delays. In response, we have taken various actions, including ordering merchandise earlier, securing ocean freight routes, and increased use of air transport for certain merchandise. Some of these supply chain disruptions and resulting actions have resulted in increased costs. The Gross Margin Rate analysis on page 22 provides additional information.Sale of DermstoreIn February 2021, we sold Dermstore LLC (Dermstore) for $356 million in cash and recognized a $335 million pretax gain, which is included in Net Other (Income) / Expense.

Note 4 to the Financial Statements defines gift card ""breakage."" We use comparable sales to evaluate the performance of our stores and digital channel sales by measuring the change in sales for a period over the comparable, prior-year period of equivalent length. Comparable sales include all sales, except sales from stores open less than 13 months, digital acquisitions we have owned less than 13 months, stores that have been closed, and digital acquisitions that we no longer operate. Comparable sales measures vary across the retail industry. As a result, our comparable sales calculation is not necessarily comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies. Digitally originated sales include all sales initiated through mobile applications and our websites. Our stores fulfill the majority of digitally originated sales, including shipment from stores to guests, store Order Pickup or Drive Up, and delivery via Shipt. Digitally originated sales may also be fulfilled through our distribution centers, our vendors, or other third parties.Sales growth – from both comparable sales and new stores – represents an important driver of our long-term profitability. We expect that comparable sales growth will drive the majority of our total sales growth. We believe that our ability to successfully differentiate our guests’ shopping experience through a careful combination of merchandise assortment, price, convenience, guest experience, and other factors will over the long-term drive both increasing shopping frequency (number of transactions, or ""traffic"") and the amount spent each visit (average transaction amount).Comparable Sales202120202019Comparable sales change12.7 %19.3 %3.4 %Drivers of change in comparable sales Number of transactions (traffic)12.3 3.7 2.7 Average transaction amount0.4 15.0 0.7 Comparable Sales by Channel202120202019Stores originated comparable sales change11.0 %7.2 %1.4 %Digitally originated comparable sales change20.8 144.7 28.6 Sales by Channel202120202019Stores originated81.1 %82.1 %91.2 %Digitally originated18.9 17.9 8.8 Total100 %100 %100 %Sales by Fulfillment Channel202120202019Stores96.4 %96.0 %97.2 %Other3.6 4.0 2.8 Total100 %100 %100 %Note: Sales fulfilled by stores include in-store purchases and digitally originated sales fulfilled by shipping merchandise from stores to guests, Order Pickup, Drive Up, and Shipt.Sales by Product Category202120202019Apparel and accessories17 %16 %19 %Beauty and household essentials26 26 27 Food and beverage20 20 19 Hardlines18 18 16 Home furnishings and décor19 20 19 Total100 %100 %100 %TARGET CORPORATION2021 Form 10-K21MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSISTable of ContentsANALYSIS OF OPERATIONSIndex to Financial StatementsNote 4 to the Financial Statements provides additional product category sales information.

Our cash and cash equivalents balance includes short-term investments of $5.0 billion and $7.6 billion as of January 29, 2022, and January 30, 2021, respectively. Our investment policy is designed to preserve principal and liquidity of our short-term investments. This policy allows investments in large money market funds or in highly rated direct short-term instruments that mature in 60 days or less. We also place dollar limits on our investments in individual funds or instruments.Operating Cash FlowsCash flows provided by operating activities were $8.6 billion in 2021 compared with $10.5 billion in 2020. For 2021, operating cash flows reflect stronger operating results, offset by increased inventory investment and lower accounts payable leverage, compared with 2020. Additionally, operating cash flows for 2021 reflect a $1.0 billion increase in income tax payments.InventoryYear-end inventory was $13.9 billion, compared with $10.7 billion in 2020. The increase in inventory levels reflect our efforts to align inventory with sales trends, and elevated in-transit inventory related to import supply chain delays.TARGET CORPORATION2021 Form 10-K27MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSISTable of ContentsANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITIONIndex to Financial StatementsCapital ExpendituresNote: Amounts may not foot due to rounding.Capital expenditures increased in 2021 from the prior year as we invested in our strategic initiatives, including store remodels, some of which were delayed in 2020, new store openings, and supply chain projects. Beyond full-store remodels, we invested in optimizing front-end space in high-volume locations to increase the efficiency of our Same-Day Services, and built-out about 100 Ulta Beauty shop-in-shops. We have completed over 900 full-store remodels since the launch of the current program in 2017, including 145 in 2021. In addition to these cash investments, we entered into leases related to new stores in 2021, 2020, and 2019 with total future minimum lease payments of $401 million, $764 million, and $669 million, respectively, and new leases related to our supply chain with total future minimum lease payments of $226 million, $442 million, and $185 million, respectively.We expect capital expenditures in 2022 of approximately $4.0 billion to $5.0 billion to support remodels, new stores, and supply chain projects. Supply chain projects will add replenishment capacity and modernize our network, including the use of sortation centers to enhance our last-mile delivery capabilities. We expect to complete approximately 200 full-store remodels, open 25 to 30 new stores, and add more than 250 Ulta Beauty shop-in-shops during 2022. Additionally, we will continue to invest in optimizing front-end space. We also expect to continue to invest in new store and supply chain leases.DividendsWe paid dividends totaling $1.5 billion ($3.16 per share) in 2021 and $1.3 billion ($2.68 per share) in 2020, a per share increase of 17.9 percent. We declared dividends totaling $1.7 billion ($3.38 per share) in 2021 and $1.4 billion ($2.70 per share) in 2020, a per share increase of 25.2 percent. We have paid dividends every quarter since our 1967 initial public offering and it is our intent to continue to do so in the future.Share RepurchasesDuring 2021 and 2020 we returned $7.2 billion and $609 million, respectively, to shareholders through share repurchase. See Part II, Item 5, Market for the Registrant's Common Equity, Related Stockholder Matters and Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities of this Annual Report on Form 10-K and Note 21 to the Financial Statements for more information.TARGET CORPORATION2021 Form 10-K28MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSISTable of ContentsANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITIONIndex to Financial StatementsSubsequent to year-end, we entered into an accelerated share repurchase arrangement to repurchase up to $2.75 billion of our common stock. Under the agreement, we paid $2.75 billion and received an initial delivery of 8.9 million shares, subject to a final settlement of cash or additional shares in the second quarter of 2022.FinancingOur financing strategy is to ensure liquidity and access to capital markets, to maintain a balanced spectrum of debt maturities, and to manage our net exposure to floating interest rate volatility. Within these parameters, we seek to minimize our borrowing costs. Our ability to access the long-term debt and commercial paper markets has provided us with ample sources of liquidity. Our continued access to these markets depends on multiple factors, including the condition of debt capital markets, our operating performance, and maintaining strong credit ratings. As of January 29, 2022, our credit ratings were as follows:Credit RatingsMoody'sStandard and Poor'sFitchLong-term debtA2AACommercial paperP-1A-1F1If our credit ratings were lowered, our ability to access the debt markets, our cost of funds, and other terms for new debt issuances could be adversely impacted. Each of the credit rating agencies reviews its rating periodically and there is no guarantee our current credit ratings will remain the same as described above. Fitch raised our long-term debt rating from A- to A during 2021.In 2021, we issued $2.0 billion of debt, and we repaid $1.1 billion of debt at maturity.In 2021, we obtained a committed $3.0 billion unsecured revolving credit facility that will expire in October 2026. This new facility replaced our $2.5 billion unsecured revolving credit facility that was set to expire in October 2023. No balances were outstanding under either credit facility at any time during 2021 or 2020.Most of our long-term debt obligations contain covenants related to secured debt levels. In addition to a secured debt level covenant, our credit facility also contains a debt leverage covenant. We are, and expect to remain, in compliance with these covenants. Additionally, as of January 29, 2022, no notes or debentures contained provisions requiring acceleration of payment upon a credit rating downgrade, except that certain outstanding notes allow the note holders to put the notes to us if within a matter of months of each other we experience both (i) a change in control and (ii) our long-term credit ratings are either reduced and the resulting rating is non-investment grade, or our long-term credit ratings are placed on watch for possible reduction and those ratings are subsequently reduced and the resulting rating is non-investment grade.Note 16 to the Financial Statements provides additional information.Future Cash RequirementsWe enter into contractual obligations in the ordinary course of business that may require future cash payments. Such obligations include, but are not limited to, purchase commitments, debt service, leasing arrangements, and liabilities related to deferred compensation and pensions. The Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements provide additional information. We believe our sources of liquidity, namely operating cash flows, credit facility capacity, and access to capital markets, will continue to be adequate to meet our contractual obligations, working capital and capital expenditure requirements, finance anticipated expansion and strategic initiatives, fund debt maturities, pay dividends, and execute purchases under our share repurchase program for the foreseeable future.TARGET CORPORATION2021 Form 10-K29MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSISTable of ContentsANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITIONIndex to Financial StatementsCritical Accounting EstimatesOur consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with GAAP, which requires us to make estimates and apply judgments that affect the reported amounts. In the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements, we describe the significant accounting policies used in preparing the consolidated financial statements. Our management has discussed the development, selection, and disclosure of our critical accounting estimates with the Audit & Risk Committee of our Board of Directors. The following items require significant estimation or judgment:Inventory and cost of sales: The vast majority of our inventory is accounted for under the retail inventory accounting method using the last-in, first-out method (LIFO). Our inventory is valued at the lower of LIFO cost or market. We reduce inventory for estimated losses related to shrink and markdowns. Our shrink estimate is based on historical losses verified by physical inventory counts. Historically, our actual physical inventory count results have shown our estimates to be reliable. Market adjustments for markdowns are recorded when the salability of the merchandise has diminished. Salability can be impacted by consumer preferences and seasonality, among other factors. We believe the risk of inventory obsolescence is largely mitigated because our inventory typically turns in less than three months. Inventory was $13.9 billion and $10.7 billion as of January 29, 2022, and January 30, 2021, respectively, and is further described in Note 10 to the Financial Statements.Vendor income: We receive various forms of consideration from our vendors (vendor income), principally earned as a result of volume rebates, markdown allowances, promotions, and advertising allowances. Substantially all vendor income is recorded as a reduction of cost of sales. Vendor income earned can vary based on a number of factors, including purchase volumes, sales volumes, and our pricing and promotion strategies.We establish a receivable for vendor income that is earned but not yet received. Based on historical trending and data, this receivable is computed by forecasting vendor income collections and estimating the amount earned. The majority of the year-end vendor income receivables are collected within the following fiscal quarter, and we do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood that the assumptions used in our estimate will change significantly. Historically, adjustments to our vendor income receivable have not been material. Vendor income receivable was $518 million and $504 million as of January 29, 2022, and January 30, 2021, respectively. Vendor income is described further in Note 6 to the Financial Statements.Long-lived assets: Long-lived assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amounts may not be recoverable. The evaluation is performed primarily at the store level. An impairment loss is recognized when estimated undiscounted future cash flows from the operation and/or eventual disposition of the asset or asset group is less than its carrying amount, and is measured as the excess of its carrying amount over fair value. We estimate fair value by obtaining market appraisals, obtaining valuations from third-party brokers, or using other valuation techniques. We recorded impairments of $87 million, $62 million, and $23 million in 2021, 2020, and 2019, respectively, which are described further in Note 12 to the Financial Statements.Insurance/self-insurance: We retain a substantial portion of the risk related to certain general liability, workers' compensation, property loss, and team member medical and dental claims. However, we maintain stop-loss coverage to limit the exposure related to certain risks. Liabilities associated with these losses include estimates of both claims filed and losses incurred but not yet reported. We use actuarial methods which consider a number of factors to estimate our ultimate cost of losses. General liability and workers' compensation liabilities are recorded based on our estimate of their net present value; other liabilities referred to above are not discounted. Our workers' compensation and general liability accrual was $519 million and $510 million as of January 29, 2022, and January 30, 2021, respectively. We believe that the amounts accrued are appropriate; however, our liabilities could be significantly affected if future occurrences or loss developments differ from our assumptions. For example, a 5 percent increase or decrease in average claim costs would have impacted our self-insurance expense by $26 million in 2021. Historically, adjustments to our estimates have not been material. Refer to Part II, Item 7A, Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk, for further disclosure of the market risks associated with these exposures. We maintain insurance coverage to limit our exposure to certain events, including network security matters. TARGET CORPORATION2021 Form 10-K30MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSISTable of ContentsANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION & NEW ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTSIndex to Financial StatementsIncome taxes: We pay income taxes based on the tax statutes, regulations, and case law of the various jurisdictions in which we operate. Significant judgment is required in determining the timing and amounts of deductible and taxable items, and in evaluating the ultimate resolution of tax matters in dispute with tax authorities. The benefits of uncertain tax positions are recorded in our financial statements only after determining it is likely the uncertain tax positions would withstand challenge by taxing authorities. We periodically reassess these probabilities and record any changes in the financial statements as appropriate. Liabilities for uncertain tax positions, including interest and penalties, were $138 million and $193 million as of January 29, 2022, and January 30, 2021, respectively. We believe the resolution of these matters will not materially affect our consolidated financial statements. Income taxes are described further in Note 19 to the Financial Statements.Pension accounting: We maintain a funded qualified defined benefit pension plan, as well as nonqualified and international pension plans that are generally unfunded, for certain current and retired team members. The costs for these plans are determined based on actuarial calculations using the assumptions described in the following paragraphs. Eligibility and the level of benefits vary depending on each team member's full-time or part-time status, date of hire, age, length of service, and/or compensation. The benefit obligation and related expense for these plans are determined based on actuarial calculations using assumptions about the expected long-term rate of return, the discount rate, compensation growth rates, mortality, and retirement age. These assumptions, with adjustments made for any significant plan or participant changes, are used to determine the period-end benefit obligation and establish expense for the next year.Our 2021 expected long-term rate of return on plan assets of 5.80 percent was determined by the portfolio composition, historical long-term investment performance, and current market conditions. A 1 percentage point decrease in our expected long-term rate of return would increase annual expense by $41 million.The discount rate used to determine benefit obligations is adjusted annually based on the interest rate for long-term high-quality corporate bonds, using yields for maturities that are in line with the duration of our pension liabilities. Our benefit obligation and related expense will fluctuate with changes in interest rates. A 1 percentage point decrease in the weighted average discount rate would increase annual expense by $62 million.Based on our experience, we use a graduated compensation growth schedule that assumes higher compensation growth for younger, shorter-service pension-eligible team members than it does for older, longer-service pension-eligible team members.Pension benefits are further described in Note 24 to the Financial Statements.Legal and other contingencies: We believe the accruals recorded in our consolidated financial statements properly reflect loss exposures that are both probable and reasonably estimable. We do not believe any of the currently identified claims or litigation will materially affect our results of operations, cash flows, or financial condition. However, litigation is subject to inherent uncertainties, and unfavorable rulings could occur. If an unfavorable ruling were to occur, it may cause a material adverse impact on the results of operations, cash flows, or financial condition for the period in which the ruling occurs, or future periods. Refer to Note 15 to the Financial Statements for further information on contingencies.New Accounting PronouncementsWe do not expect that any recently issued accounting pronouncements will have a material effect on our financial statements.TARGET CORPORATION2021 Form 10-K31MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSISTable of ContentsFORWARD LOOKING STATEMENTS & QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURESIndex to Financial StatementsForward-Looking StatementsThis report contains forward-looking statements, which are based on our current assumptions and expectations. These statements are typically accompanied by the words ""expect,"" ""may,"" ""could,"" ""believe,"" ""would,"" ""might,"" ""anticipates,"" or similar words. The principal forward-looking statements in this report include: our financial performance, statements regarding the adequacy of and costs associated with our sources of liquidity, the funding of debt maturities, the continued execution of our share repurchase program, our expected capital expenditures and new lease commitments, the expected compliance with debt covenants, the expected impact of new accounting pronouncements, our intentions regarding future dividends, contributions and payments related to our pension plan, the expected return on plan assets, the expected timing and recognition of compensation expenses, the effects of macroeconomic conditions, the adequacy of our reserves for general liability, workers' compensation and property loss, the expected outcome of, and adequacy of our reserves for claims, litigation, and the resolution of tax matters, our expectations regarding our contractual obligations, liabilities, and vendor income, the expected ability to recognize deferred tax assets and liabilities and the timing of such recognition, the expected impact of changes in information technology systems, future responses to and effects of the COVID-19 pandemic, and changes in our assumptions and expectations.All such forward-looking statements are intended to enjoy the protection of the safe harbor for forward-looking statements contained in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, as amended. Although we believe there is a reasonable basis for the forward-looking statements, our actual results could be materially different. The most important factors which could cause our actual results to differ from our forward-looking statements are set forth on our description of risk factors included in Part I, Item 1A, Risk Factors to this Form 10-K, which should be read in conjunction with the forward-looking statements in this report. Forward-looking statements speak only as of the date they are made, and we do not undertake any obligation to update any forward-looking statement.Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market RiskAs of January 29, 2022, our exposure to market risk was primarily from interest rate changes on our debt obligations and short-term investments, some of which are at a London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR). Our interest rate exposure is primarily due to differences between our floating rate debt obligations compared to our floating rate short-term investments. As of January 29, 2022, our floating rate short-term investments exceeded our floating rate debt by approximately $3.5 billion. Based on our balance sheet position as of January 29, 2022, the annualized effect of a 0.1 percentage point increase in floating interest rates on our floating rate debt obligations, net of our floating rate short-term investments, would increase our earnings before income taxes by $3 million. In general, we expect our floating rate debt to exceed our floating rate short-term investments over time, but that may vary in different interest rate and economic environments. For example, our short-term investments as of January 29, 2022, exceeded our floating rate debt due to operating cash flow acceleration driven by strong operating results. See further description of our debt and derivative instruments in Notes 16 and 17 to the Financial Statements.The United Kingdom's Financial Conduct Authority has announced the intent to phase out LIBOR by June 2023. We do not expect the phase out to materially impact our financial statements, liquidity, or access to capital markets. We record our general liability and workers' compensation liabilities at net present value; therefore, these liabilities fluctuate with changes in interest rates. Based on our balance sheet position as of January 29, 2022, the annualized effect of a 0.5 percentage point increase/(decrease) in interest rates would increase/(decrease) earnings before income taxes by $6 million.In addition, we are exposed to market return fluctuations on our qualified defined benefit pension plan. The value of our pension liabilities is inversely related to changes in interest rates. A 1 percentage point decrease in the weighted average discount rate would increase annual expense by $62 million. To protect against declines in interest rates, we hold high-quality, long-duration bonds and derivative instruments in our pension plan trust. As of January 29, 2022, we had hedged 70 percent of the interest rate exposure of our plan liabilities.TARGET CORPORATION2021 Form 10-K32MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSISTable of ContentsQUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURESIndex to Financial StatementsAs more fully described in Note 23 to the Financial Statements, we are exposed to market returns on accumulated team member balances in our nonqualified, unfunded deferred compensation plans. We control the risk of offering the nonqualified plans by making investments in life insurance contracts and prepaid forward contracts on our own common stock that substantially offset our economic exposure to the returns on these plans.There have been no other material changes in our primary risk exposures or management of market risks since the prior year.TARGET CORPORATION2021 Form 10-K33FINANCIAL STATEMENTSTable of ContentsINDEXIndex to Financial Statements",2023-12-30 21:32:30.254118

See Business Environment below for additional information.Sales were $107.6 billion for 2022, an increase of $3.0 billion, or 2.8 percent, from the prior year. Operating cash flow was $4.0 billion for 2022, a decrease of $(4.6) billion, or (53.4) percent, from $8.6 billion for 2021.

Adjusted diluted earnings per share (Adjusted EPS), a non-GAAP metric, excludes the impact of certain items. Management believes that Adjusted EPS is useful in providing period-to-period comparisons of the results of our operations. A reconciliation of non-GAAP financial measures to GAAP measures is provided on page 24.We report after-tax return on invested capital (ROIC) because we believe ROIC provides a meaningful measure of our capital-allocation effectiveness over time. For the trailing twelve months ended January 28, 2023, after-tax ROIC was 12.6 percent, compared with 33.1 percent for the trailing twelve months ended January 29, 2022. The calculation of ROIC is provided on page 26.Business EnvironmentFollowing the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020, we experienced strong comparable sales growth and significant volatility in our category and channel mix, which continued through 2021, along with increasing supply chain disruptions. In addition to country of origin production delays, trucker and dockworker shortages, a broad-based surge in consumer demand, and other factors led to industry-wide U.S. port and ground transportation delays. In response to the rising guest demand and supply chain constraints, we took various actions, including ordering merchandise earlier, securing ocean freight routes, adding incremental holding capacity near U.S. ports, and increasing use of air transport for certain merchandise. Some of these supply chain disruptions and resulting actions resulted in increased costs. In 2022, our comparable sales growth slowed significantly, reflecting sales decreases in our Discretionary categories (Apparel & Accessories, Hardlines, and Home Furnishings & Decor) that substantially offset growth in our Frequency categories (Beauty & Household Essentials and Food & Beverage). In response to this shift in demand, we took several actions to address our inventory position and create additional flexibility in a rapidly changing environment, including increasing promotional and clearance markdowns, removing excess inventory, and cancelling purchase orders. In addition, during the second half of 2022, port congestion, shipping container availability, and other supply chain pressures improved. This resulted in some inventory arriving earlier than anticipated, which resulted in increased costs of managing elevated inventory levels and an increased working capital investment. These factors, net of the impact of retail price increases taken to address merchandise and freight cost inflation, resulted in decreased profitability compared to the prior year.

Note 3 to the Financial Statements defines gift card ""breakage."" We use comparable sales to evaluate the performance of our stores and digital channel sales by measuring the change in sales for a period over the comparable, prior-year period of equivalent length. Comparable sales include all sales, except sales from stores open less than 13 months, digital acquisitions we have owned less than 13 months, stores that have been closed, and digital acquisitions that we no longer operate. Comparable sales measures vary across the retail industry. As a result, our comparable sales calculation is not necessarily comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies. Digitally originated sales include all sales initiated through mobile applications and our websites. Our stores fulfill the majority of digitally originated sales, including shipment from stores to guests, store Order Pickup or Drive Up, and delivery via Shipt. Digitally originated sales may also be fulfilled through our distribution centers, our vendors, or other third parties.Sales growth – from both comparable sales and new stores – represents an important driver of our long-term profitability. We expect that comparable sales growth will drive the majority of our total sales growth. We believe that our ability to successfully differentiate our guests’ shopping experience through a careful combination of merchandise assortment, price, convenience, guest experience, and other factors will over the long-term drive both increasing shopping frequency (number of transactions, or ""traffic"") and the amount spent each visit (average transaction amount).Comparable Sales202220212020Comparable sales change2.2 %12.7 %19.3 %Drivers of change in comparable sales Number of transactions (traffic)2.1 12.3 3.7 Average transaction amount0.1 0.4 15.0 TARGET CORPORATION2022 Form 10-K21MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSISTable of ContentsANALYSIS OF OPERATIONSIndex to Financial StatementsComparable Sales by Channel202220212020Stores originated comparable sales change2.4 %11.0 %7.2 %Digitally originated comparable sales change1.5 20.8 144.7 Sales by Channel202220212020Stores originated81.4 %81.1 %82.1 %Digitally originated18.6 18.9 17.9 Total100 %100 %100 %Sales by Fulfillment Channel202220212020Stores96.7 %96.4 %96.0 %Other3.3 3.6 4.0 Total100 %100 %100 %Note: Sales fulfilled by stores include in-store purchases and digitally originated sales fulfilled by shipping merchandise from stores to guests, Order Pickup, Drive Up, and Shipt.Part I, Item 1, Business of this Form 10-K and Note 3 to the Financial Statements provides additional product category sales information. The collective interaction of a broad array of macroeconomic, competitive, and consumer behavioral factors, as well as sales mix, and transfer of sales to new stores makes further analysis of sales metrics infeasible.TD Bank Group offers credit to qualified guests through Target-branded credit cards: the Target Credit Card and the Target MasterCard Credit Card (Target Credit Cards). Additionally, we offer a branded proprietary Target Debit Card and RedCard Reloadable Account. Collectively, we refer to these products as RedCards™. Guests receive a 5 percent discount on virtually all purchases when they use a RedCard at Target. We monitor the percentage of purchases that are paid for using RedCards (RedCard Penetration) because our internal analysis has indicated that a meaningful portion of incremental purchases on our RedCards are also incremental sales for Target. For the years ended January 28, 2023, January 29, 2022, and January 30, 2021, total RedCard Penetration was 19.8 percent, 20.5 percent, and 21.5 percent, respectively. TARGET CORPORATION2022 Form 10-K22MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSISTable of ContentsANALYSIS OF OPERATIONSIndex to Financial StatementsGross Margin RateOur gross margin rate was 23.6 percent in 2022 and 28.3 percent in 2021. This decrease reflected the net impact of •merchandising pressure, including◦higher clearance and promotional markdown rates, including the impact of inventory impairments and other actions taken in our Discretionary categories; and◦higher merchandise and freight costs, partially offset by the benefit of retail price increases;•supply chain pressure related to increased compensation and headcount in our distribution centers, investments in new facilities, and costs of managing excess inventory; •higher inventory shrink; and•favorable mix in the relative growth rates of higher and lower margin categories.Selling, General and Administrative (SG&A) Expense RateOur SG&A expense rate was 18.9 percent in 2022, compared with 18.6 percent in 2021, reflecting the net impact of cost increases across our business, including investments in hourly team member wages, partially offset by lower incentive compensation in 2022 compared to the prior year.Store DataChange in Number of Stores20222021Beginning store count1,926 1,897 Opened23 32 Closed(1)(3)Ending store count1,948 1,926 Number of Stores andRetail Square FeetNumber of StoresRetail Square Feet (a)January 28, 2023January 29, 2022January 28, 2023January 29, 2022170,000 or more sq. ft.274 274 48,985 49,071 50,000 to 169,999 sq. ft.1,527 1,516 191,241 190,205 49,999 or less sq. ft.147 136 4,358 4,008 Total1,948 1,926 244,584 243,284 (a)In thousands; reflects total square feet less office, distribution center, and vacant space.TARGET CORPORATION2022 Form 10-K23MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSISTable of ContentsANALYSIS OF OPERATIONSIndex to Financial StatementsOther Performance FactorsNet Interest ExpenseNet interest expense was $478 million for 2022, compared with $421 million for 2021. The increase in net interest expense was primarily due to higher average debt and commercial paper levels in 2022 compared with 2021.Net Other (Income) / ExpenseNet Other (Income) / Expense was $(48) million and $(382) million for 2022 and 2021, respectively. 2021 included the $335 million gain on the February 2021 sale of Dermstore. Provision for Income TaxesOur 2022 effective income tax rate was 18.7 percent compared with 22.0 percent in 2021. The decrease reflects lower pretax earnings in the current year and the impacts of discrete tax benefits. Our effective tax rate is generally more volatile at lower amounts of pretax income because the impact of discrete, deductible and nondeductible tax items and credits is greater.Note 18 to the Financial Statements provides additional information.Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Financial Measures to GAAP MeasuresTo provide additional transparency, we have disclosed non-GAAP adjusted diluted earnings per share (Adjusted EPS).

Our cash and cash equivalents balance includes short-term investments of $1.3 billion and $5.0 billion as of January 28, 2023, and January 29, 2022, respectively. Our investment policy is designed to preserve principal and liquidity of our short-term investments. This policy allows investments in large money market funds or in highly rated direct short-term instruments that mature in 60 days or less. We also place dollar limits on our investments in individual funds or instruments.Operating Cash FlowsCash flows provided by operating activities were $4.0 billion in 2022 compared with $8.6 billion in 2021. For 2022, operating cash flows decreased as a result of lower earnings and lower accounts payable leverage, partially offset by decreased inventory investment, compared with 2021. InventoryYear-end inventory was $13.5 billion, compared with $13.9 billion in 2021. The decrease in inventory levels primarily reflects the following:•decreased in-transit and late-arriving inventory as lead times improved, •investments in our inventory position in our Frequency categories, offsetting reductions in our Discretionary categories, and•increases in unit costs across all of our categories.The Business Environment section on page 20 provides additional information.TARGET CORPORATION2022 Form 10-K27MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSISTable of ContentsANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITIONIndex to Financial StatementsCapital ExpendituresNote: Amounts may not foot due to rounding.Capital expenditures increased in 2022 from the prior year as we invested in our strategic initiatives, including an increase in investments in both stores and in our supply chain. The increase also reflects the impact of inflation on these projects. Beyond full-store remodels, we invested in optimizing front-end space in high-volume locations to increase the efficiency of our Same-Day Services, and built-out and opened approximately 250 Ulta Beauty shop-in-shops. We have completed over 1,000 full-store remodels since the launch of the current program in 2017, including 140 in 2022. In addition to these cash investments, we entered into leases related to new stores in 2022, 2021, and 2020 with total future minimum lease payments of $319 million, $401 million, and $764 million, respectively, and new leases related to our supply chain with total future minimum lease payments of $1.6 billion, $226 million, and $442 million, respectively.We expect capital expenditures in 2023 of approximately $4.0 billion to $5.0 billion to support full-store remodels and other existing store investments, new stores, and supply chain projects. Supply chain projects will add replenishment capacity and modernize our network, including the use of sortation centers to enhance our last-mile delivery capabilities. We expect to complete approximately 70 full-store remodels, open about 20 new stores, and add additional Ulta Beauty shop-in-shops during 2023. Additionally, we will continue to invest in optimizing front-end space. We also expect to continue to invest in new store and supply chain leases.DividendsWe paid dividends totaling $1.8 billion ($3.96 per share) in 2022 and $1.5 billion ($3.16 per share) in 2021, a per share increase of 25.3 percent. We declared dividends totaling $1.9 billion ($4.14 per share) in 2022 and $1.7 billion ($3.38 per share) in 2021, a per share increase of 22.5 percent. We have paid dividends every quarter since our 1967 initial public offering and it is our intent to continue to do so in the future.Share RepurchasesDuring 2022 and 2021 we returned $2.6 billion and $7.2 billion, respectively, to shareholders through share repurchase. See Part II, Item 5, Market for the Registrant's Common Equity, Related Stockholder Matters and Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities of this Annual Report on Form 10-K and Note 20 to the Financial Statements for more information.TARGET CORPORATION2022 Form 10-K28MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSISTable of ContentsANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITIONIndex to Financial StatementsFinancingOur financing strategy is to ensure liquidity and access to capital markets, to maintain a balanced spectrum of debt maturities, and to manage our net exposure to floating interest rate volatility. Within these parameters, we seek to minimize our borrowing costs. Our ability to access the long-term debt and commercial paper markets has provided us with ample sources of liquidity. Our continued access to these markets depends on multiple factors, including the condition of debt capital markets, our operating performance, and maintaining strong credit ratings. As of January 28, 2023, our credit ratings were as follows:Credit RatingsMoody'sStandard and Poor'sFitchLong-term debtA2AACommercial paperP-1A-1F1If our credit ratings were lowered, our ability to access the debt markets, our cost of funds, and other terms for new debt issuances could be adversely impacted. Each of the credit rating agencies reviews its rating periodically and there is no guarantee our current credit ratings will remain the same as described above.In 2022, we issued $2.7 billion of debt, and we repaid $62 million of debt at maturity.In 2022, we obtained a new committed $1.0 billion 364-day unsecured revolving credit facility that will expire in October 2023. We also extended our existing committed $3.0 billion unsecured revolving credit facility, which now expires in October 2027. No balances were outstanding under either credit facility at any time during 2022 or 2021.Most of our long-term debt obligations contain covenants related to secured debt levels. In addition to a secured debt level covenant, our credit facilities also contain a debt leverage covenant. We are, and expect to remain, in compliance with these covenants. Additionally, as of January 28, 2023, no notes or debentures contained provisions requiring acceleration of payment upon a credit rating downgrade, except that certain outstanding notes allow the note holders to put the notes to us if within a matter of months of each other we experience both (i) a change in control and (ii) our long-term credit ratings are either reduced and the resulting rating is non-investment grade, or our long-term credit ratings are placed on watch for possible reduction and those ratings are subsequently reduced and the resulting rating is non-investment grade.Note 15 to the Financial Statements provides additional information.Future Cash RequirementsWe enter into contractual obligations in the ordinary course of business that may require future cash payments. Such obligations include, but are not limited to, purchase commitments, debt service, leasing arrangements, and liabilities related to deferred compensation and pensions. The Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements provide additional information. We believe our sources of liquidity, namely operating cash flows, credit facility capacity, and access to capital markets, will continue to be adequate to meet our contractual obligations, working capital and capital expenditure requirements, finance anticipated expansion and strategic initiatives, fund debt maturities, pay dividends, and execute purchases under our share repurchase program for the foreseeable future.Critical Accounting EstimatesOur consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with GAAP, which requires us to make estimates and apply judgments that affect the reported amounts. In the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements, we describe the significant accounting policies used in preparing the consolidated financial statements. Our management has discussed the development, selection, and disclosure of our critical accounting estimates with the Audit & Risk Committee of our Board of Directors. The following items require significant estimation or judgment:TARGET CORPORATION2022 Form 10-K29MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSISTable of ContentsANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITIONIndex to Financial StatementsInventory and cost of sales: The vast majority of our inventory is accounted for under the retail inventory accounting method using the last-in, first-out method (LIFO). Our inventory is valued at the lower of LIFO cost or market. We reduce inventory for estimated losses related to shrink and markdowns. Our shrink estimate is based on historical losses verified by physical inventory counts. Historically, our actual physical inventory count results have shown our estimates to be reliable. Market adjustments for markdowns are recorded when the salability of the merchandise has diminished. Salability can be impacted by consumer preferences and seasonality, among other factors. We believe the risk of inventory obsolescence is largely mitigated because our inventory typically turns in less than three months. Inventory was $13.5 billion and $13.9 billion as of January 28, 2023, and January 29, 2022, respectively, and is further described in Note 9 to the Financial Statements.Vendor income: We receive various forms of consideration from our vendors (vendor income), principally earned as a result of volume rebates, markdown allowances, promotions, and advertising allowances. Substantially all vendor income is recorded as a reduction of cost of sales. Vendor income earned can vary based on a number of factors, including purchase volumes, sales volumes, and our pricing and promotion strategies.We establish a receivable for vendor income that is earned but not yet received. Based on historical trending and data, this receivable is computed by forecasting vendor income collections and estimating the amount earned. The majority of the year-end vendor income receivables are collected within the following fiscal quarter, and we do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood that the assumptions used in our estimate will change significantly. Historically, adjustments to our vendor income receivable have not been material. Vendor income receivable was $526 million and $518 million as of January 28, 2023, and January 29, 2022, respectively. Vendor income is described further in Note 5 to the Financial Statements.Long-lived assets: Long-lived assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amounts may not be recoverable. The evaluation is performed primarily at the store level. An impairment loss is recognized when estimated undiscounted future cash flows from the operation and/or eventual disposition of the asset or asset group is less than its carrying amount, and is measured as the excess of its carrying amount over fair value. We estimate fair value by obtaining market appraisals, obtaining valuations from third-party brokers, or using other valuation techniques. We recorded impairments of $66 million, $87 million, and $62 million in 2022, 2021, and 2020, respectively, which are described further in Note 11 to the Financial Statements.Insurance/self-insurance: We retain a substantial portion of the risk related to certain general liability, workers' compensation, property loss, and team member medical and dental claims. However, we maintain stop-loss coverage to limit the exposure related to certain risks. Liabilities associated with these losses include estimates of both claims filed and losses incurred but not yet reported. We use actuarial methods which consider a number of factors to estimate our ultimate cost of losses. General liability and workers' compensation liabilities are recorded based on our estimate of their net present value; other liabilities referred to above are not discounted. Our workers' compensation and general liability accrual was $560 million and $519 million as of January 28, 2023, and January 29, 2022, respectively. We believe that the amounts accrued are appropriate; however, our liabilities could be significantly affected if future occurrences or loss developments differ from our assumptions. For example, a 5 percent increase or decrease in average claim costs would have impacted our self-insurance expense by $28 million in 2022. Historically, adjustments to our estimates have not been material. Refer to Part II, Item 7A, Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk, for further disclosure of the market risks associated with these exposures. We maintain insurance coverage to limit our exposure to certain events, including network security matters. Income taxes: We pay income taxes based on the tax statutes, regulations, and case law of the various jurisdictions in which we operate. Significant judgment is required in determining the timing and amounts of deductible and taxable items, and in evaluating the ultimate resolution of tax matters in dispute with tax authorities. The benefits of uncertain tax positions are recorded in our financial statements only after determining it is likely the uncertain tax positions would withstand challenge by taxing authorities. We periodically reassess these probabilities and record any changes in the financial statements as appropriate. Gross uncertain tax positions, including interest and penalties, were $241 million and $138 million as of January 28, 2023, and January 29, 2022, respectively. We believe the resolution of these matters will not materially affect our consolidated financial statements. Income taxes are described further in Note 18 to the Financial Statements.TARGET CORPORATION2022 Form 10-K30MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSISTable of ContentsANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION & NEW ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTSIndex to Financial StatementsPension accounting: We maintain a funded qualified defined benefit pension plan, as well as nonqualified and international pension plans that are generally unfunded, for certain current and retired team members. The costs for these plans are determined based on actuarial calculations using the assumptions described in the following paragraphs. Eligibility and the level of benefits vary depending on each team member's full-time or part-time status, date of hire, age, length of service, and/or compensation. The benefit obligation and related expense for these plans are determined based on actuarial calculations using assumptions about the expected long-term rate of return, the discount rate, compensation growth rates, mortality, and retirement age. These assumptions, with adjustments made for any significant plan or participant changes, are used to determine the period-end benefit obligation and establish expense for the next year.Our 2022 expected long-term rate of return on plan assets of 5.60 percent was determined by the portfolio composition, historical long-term investment performance, and current market conditions. A 1 percentage point decrease in our expected long-term rate of return would increase annual expense by $42 million.The discount rate used to determine benefit obligations is adjusted annually based on the interest rate for long-term high-quality corporate bonds, using yields for maturities that are in line with the duration of our pension liabilities. Our benefit obligation and related expense will fluctuate with changes in interest rates. A 1 percentage point decrease in the weighted average discount rate would increase annual expense by $59 million.Based on our experience, we use a graduated compensation growth schedule that assumes higher compensation growth for younger, shorter-service pension-eligible team members than it does for older, longer-service pension-eligible team members.Pension benefits are further described in Note 23 to the Financial Statements.Legal and other contingencies: We believe the accruals recorded in our consolidated financial statements properly reflect loss exposures that are both probable and reasonably estimable. We do not believe any of the currently identified claims or litigation will materially affect our results of operations, cash flows, or financial condition. However, litigation is subject to inherent uncertainties, and unfavorable rulings could occur. If an unfavorable ruling were to occur, it may cause a material adverse impact on the results of operations, cash flows, or financial condition for the period in which the ruling occurs, or future periods. Refer to Note 14 to the Financial Statements for further information on contingencies.New Accounting PronouncementsWe do not expect that any recently issued accounting pronouncements will have a material effect on our financial statements.TARGET CORPORATION2022 Form 10-K31MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSISTable of ContentsFORWARD LOOKING STATEMENTS & QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURESIndex to Financial StatementsForward-Looking StatementsThis report contains forward-looking statements, which are based on our current assumptions and expectations.

Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market RiskAs of January 28, 2023, our exposure to market risk was primarily from interest rate changes on our debt obligations and short-term investments, some of which are at a London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR). Our interest rate exposure is primarily due to differences between our floating rate debt obligations compared to our floating rate short-term investments. As of January 28, 2023, our floating rate debt exceeded our floating rate short-term investments by approximately $1.2 billion. Based on our balance sheet position as of January 28, 2023, the annualized effect of a 0.1 percentage point increase in floating interest rates on our floating rate debt obligations, net of our floating rate short-term investments, would decrease our earnings before income taxes by $1 million. In general, we expect our floating rate debt to exceed our floating rate short-term investments over time, but that may vary in different interest rate and economic environments. See further description of our debt and derivative instruments in Notes 15 and 16 to the Financial Statements.The United Kingdom's Financial Conduct Authority has announced the intent to phase out LIBOR by June 2023. We do not expect the phase out to materially impact our financial statements, liquidity, or access to capital markets. We record our general liability and workers' compensation liabilities at net present value; therefore, these liabilities fluctuate with changes in interest rates. Based on our balance sheet position as of January 28, 2023, the annualized effect of a 0.5 percentage point increase/(decrease) in interest rates would increase/(decrease) earnings before income taxes by $7 million.In addition, we are exposed to market return fluctuations on our qualified defined benefit pension plan. The value of our pension liabilities is inversely related to changes in interest rates. A 1 percentage point decrease in the weighted average discount rate would increase annual expense by $59 million. To protect against declines in interest rates, we hold high-quality, long-duration bonds and derivative instruments in our pension plan trust. As of January 28, 2023, we had hedged 70 percent of the interest rate exposure of our plan liabilities.As more fully described in Note 22 to the Financial Statements, we are exposed to market returns on accumulated team member balances in our nonqualified, unfunded deferred compensation plans. We control the risk of offering the nonqualified plans by making investments in life insurance contracts and prepaid forward contracts on our own common stock that substantially offset our economic exposure to the returns on these plans.There have been no other material changes in our primary risk exposures or management of market risks since the prior year.TARGET CORPORATION2022 Form 10-K32FINANCIAL STATEMENTSTable of ContentsINDEXIndex to Financial Statements",2023-12-30 21:32:24.771170

27419,TGT,TARGET CORP,2007,"Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. Executive Summary Fiscal 2006, a 53 week period, was a year of substantial sales and earnings growth for Target. Earnings from continuing operations increased 15.8 percent to $2,787 million, and on this same basis, diluted earnings per share rose 18.5 percent to $3.21. Sales increased 12.9 percent, including comparable-store sales (as defined below) growth of 4.8 percent. The combination of strong performance in both our retail and credit card operations produced earnings from continuing operations before interest expense and income taxes of $5,069 million, an increase of more than 17 percent from 2005. Net cash provided by operating activities was $4,862 million for 2006. During 2006 we repurchased 19.5 million shares of our common stock under our share repurchase program for a total investment of $977 million and paid dividends of $380 million. In addition, we opened 91 net new stores in 2006. Management's Discussion and Analysis is based on our Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data. Analysis of Continuing Operations Revenues and Comparable-Store Sales Sales include merchandise sales, net of expected returns, from our stores and our on-line business, as well as gift card breakage. Refer to Note 2 for a definition of gift card breakage. Total revenues include sales and net credit card revenues. Total revenues do not include sales tax as we consider ourselves a pass-through conduit for collecting and remitting sales taxes. Comparable-store sales are sales from general merchandise and SuperTarget stores open longer than one year, including: •sales from stores that have been remodeled or expanded while remaining open •sales from stores that have been relocated to new buildings of the same format within the same trade area, in which the new store opens at about the same time as the old store closes Comparable-store sales do not include: •sales from our on-line business •sales from general merchandise stores that have been converted, or relocated within the same trade area, to a SuperTarget store format •sales from stores that were intentionally closed to be remodeled, expanded or reconstructed Comparable-store sales increases or decreases are calculated by comparing sales in current year periods to comparable, prior fiscal-year periods of equivalent length. The method of calculating comparable-store sales varies across the retail industry. Revenue Growth 2006 2005 2004 Comparable-store sales 4.8% 5.6% 5.3% Sales 12.9% (a) 12.2% 11.6% Net credit card revenues 19.5% (a) 16.5% 5.5% Total revenues 13.1% (a) 12.3% 11.5% (a) Consisted of 53 weeks. In 2006, total revenues were $59,490 million compared to $52,620 in 2005, an increase of 13.1 percent. Total revenue growth was attributable to the opening of new stores, a comparable-store sales increase of 4.8 percent, the addition of the 53rd week and the 19.5 percent increase in net credit card revenues. Comparable-store sales growth in 2006 and 2005 was attributable to growth in average transaction amount and the number of transactions in comparable stores. In each of the past several years, our comparable-store sales growth has experienced a modest negative impact due to the transfer of sales to new stores. In 2006, there was a deflationary impact of approximately 1 percent on sales growth compared to essentially no impact of inflation/deflation in 2005 and a deflationary impact of approximately 1 percent in 2004. In 2007, a 52-week year following a 53-week year, we expect to generate a high single-digit percent increase in revenues, reflecting contribution from new store expansion, continued growth in comparable-store sales due to increases in average transaction amount and the number of transactions in comparable stores and growth in net credit card revenues. We do not expect inflation/deflation to have a significant effect on sales growth in 2007. Subsequent to year end, we changed our definition of comparable-store sales to include sales from our on-line business because we believe this combined measure represents a more useful disclosure in light of our fully-integrated, multi-channel approach to our business. Gross Margin Rate Gross margin rate represents gross margin (sales less cost of sales) as a percentage of sales. See Note 3 for a description of expenses included in cost of sales. In 2006, our consolidated gross margin rate was 31.9 percent compared to 31.9 percent in 2005. Within our gross margin rate for the year, we experienced an increase in markup, which was offset by an increase in markdowns. Markup is the difference between an item's cost and its retail price (expressed as a percentage of its retail price). Factors that affect markup include vendor offerings and negotiations, vendor income, sourcing strategies, market forces like the cost of raw materials and freight, and competitive influences. Markdowns are the reduction in the original or previous price of retail merchandise. Factors that affect markdowns include inventory management and competitive influences. The definition and method of calculating markup, markdowns and gross margin varies across the retail industry. In 2005, our consolidated gross margin rate was 31.9 percent compared to 31.2 percent in 2004. This change in gross margin rate primarily reflected an improvement in markup, including an increase in direct import penetration, as well as favorable inventory shrink performance. We expect our consolidated gross margin rate in 2007 to be approximately equal to our 2006 gross margin rate. The factors affecting our outlook include: our introduction of new merchandising strategies, our growth in direct imports and our ability to leverage our increasing scale, offset by the more rapid pace of growth of lower margin categories like consumables and commodities. Selling, General and Administrative Expense Rate Our selling, general and administrative (SG&A) expense rate represents SG&A expenses as a percentage of sales. See Note 3 for a description of expenses included in SG&A expenses. SG&A expenses exclude depreciation and amortization, and SG&A expenses also exclude expenses associated with our credit card operations, which are reflected separately in our Consolidated Statements of Operations. In 2006, our SG&A expense rate was 22.2 percent compared to 21.8 percent in 2005. This increase was primarily due to higher store payroll costs, the year-over-year impact of reduced transition services income related to our 2004 divestiture of Mervyn's and the $27 million Visa/MasterCard settlement that reduced SG&A expense in 2005. In 2005, our consolidated SG&A expense rate was 21.8 percent compared to 21.4 percent in 2004. The expense rate increase was due to several factors including the year-over-year impact of reduced transition services income related to our 2004 divestitures of Marshall Field's and Mervyn's, higher utilities expense and the effects of stronger year-over-year performance on incentive and share-based compensation expense. Some of the expense rate increase was also attributable to growth in marketing expenses for which the corresponding vendor income is recorded as a reduction of inventory costs because it did not meet the criteria required for recording it as an element of SG&A expenses. The combination of all unfavorable expense items more than offset the year-over-year favorability from the $65 million lease accounting adjustment during 2004. In 2007, we expect our SG&A expense rate to be approximately equal to our 2006 rate. Credit Card Contribution We offer credit to qualified guests through our REDcard products, the Target Visa and the Target Card. Our credit card program strategically supports our core retail operations and remains an important contributor to our overall profitability. Our credit card revenues are comprised of finance charges, late fees and other revenues. In addition, we receive fees from merchants who accept the Target Visa credit card. In 2006, our net credit card revenues primarily increased due to an 11.1 percent increase in average receivables. Our credit card operations are allocated a portion of consolidated interest expense based on estimated funding costs for average net accounts receivable and other financial services assets. Our allocation methodology assumes that 90 percent of the sum of average net receivables and other financial services assets are debt-financed with a mix of fixed rate and variable rate debt in proportion to the mix of fixed and variable rate financial services assets. Beginning in 2005, the majority of our credit card portfolio began to earn interest at variable rates; thus, the majority of the interest allocation to the credit card business in 2006 and 2005 is at rates that are determined based upon our approximate marginal variable rate cost of borrowed funds. Credit card expenses include a bad debt provision, as well as operations and marketing expenses supporting our credit card portfolio. In 2006 versus 2005, our bad debt provision decreased relative to our average receivables balance due to the favorable write-off experience and continued strength of the overall credit quality of the portfolio. Our 2006 year-end reserve balance as a percentage of average receivables increased as we reserved for the expected increase in future write-offs. Our delinquency rates increased in the last quarter of 2006 as compared to 2005 as we cycled the effects of the October 2005 federal bankruptcy legislation and experience the effects of the mandated increases in minimum payments for certain guests. Operations and marketing expenses increased primarily due to the growth of the Target Visa portfolio. In 2005 versus 2004, our bad debt provision grew at a slower pace than our average receivables balance due to the aging of the portfolio and the favorable macro-economic credit card environment. However, our total reserve balance as a percentage of average receivables increased in 2005 as we reserved for the expected effects of the mandated increases in minimum payments for certain guests. Our net write-offs as a percentage of average receivables and our delinquency rates continued to improve, despite a significant increase in bankruptcy filings in advance of the October 2005 effective date of the related federal bankruptcy legislation. Operations and marketing expenses increased primarily due to the growth of the Target Visa portfolio. In 2006, our credit card operations' contribution to earnings from continuing operations before income taxes (EBT) was $693 million, a 53.3 percent increase from 2005. The favorability in credit card contribution was attributable to strong growth in net interest income and the year-over-year reduction in bad debt expense. In 2005, our credit card operations' contribution to EBT was $452 million, a 77.4 percent increase from 2004. The favorability in credit card contribution was attributable to strong growth in net interest income. Average receivables rose 12.5 percent from 2004, which was approximately equal to our sales growth. We expect our 2007 credit card receivables to increase in line with 2007 sales growth, and we expect our overall credit card performance to remain strong. In 2007, our delinquency rate is expected to remain stable in the range of our recent experience, approximately 3.5 percent to 4.0 percent of average receivables, and we expect our net write-off experience to be closer to our 2004 and 2005 rates than our 2006 rate. Credit Card Contribution to EBT (millions) 2006 2005 2004 Revenues Finance charges $1,117 $915 $772 Interest expense (286 ) (193 ) (230 ) Net interest income 831 722 542 Late fees and other revenues 356 310 287 Merchant fees Intracompany 74 72 65 Third-party 139 124 98 Non-interest income 569 506 450 Expenses Bad debt 380 466 451 Operations and marketing 327 310 286 Total expenses 707 776 737 Credit card contribution to EBT $693 $452 $255 As a percentage of average receivables 11.0% 8.2% 5.2% Net interest margin (a) 13.2% 13.0% 11.0% (a) Net interest income divided by average accounts receivable.

These discounts and rewards are redeemable only on purchases made at Target. The discounts associated with our REDcard products are included as reductions in sales in our Consolidated Statements of Operations and were $104 million, $97 million and $80 million in 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively. Depreciation and Amortization During 2006, we adjusted the period over which we amortize leasehold acquisition costs to match the expected terms for individual leases, resulting in a cumulative benefit to depreciation and amortization expense of approximately $28 million. This change reduced depreciation and amortization expense during 2006, when depreciation and amortization expense totaled $1,496 million, compared to $1,409 million in 2005, an increase of 6.1 percent. In 2005, depreciation and amortization expense increased 11.9 percent, in line with our sales growth for the year, to $1,409 million. We expect 2007 depreciation and amortization expense to be approximately $1.7 billion. Net Interest Expense In 2006, net interest expense was $572 million compared to $463 million in 2005, an increase of 23.4 percent. This increase related primarily to growth in the cost of funding our credit card operations and was also unfavorably impacted by the 53rd week in the current fiscal year. The average portfolio interest rate was 6.2 percent in 2006 and 5.9 percent in 2005. In 2005, net interest expense was $463 million, compared to $570 million in 2004. This decrease was primarily due to a significantly smaller loss on debt repurchase in 2005 (less than $1 million in 2005 compared to $89 million in 2004). The decrease in 2005 net interest expense also reflected the benefit of lower average net debt in the first half of the year due to the application of proceeds from the mid-2004 Marshall Field's and Mervyn's sale transactions. This benefit was partially offset by higher average net debt balances in the second half of the year and a higher annual average portfolio interest rate. For the full year, the average portfolio interest rate was 5.9 percent in 2005 and 5.5 percent in 2004. Our 2007 net interest expense is expected to increase due to modestly higher average net debt. To preserve our net interest margin on our receivables, we intend to maintain a sufficient level of floating-rate debt to generate parallel changes in net interest expense and finance charge revenue. Provision for Income Taxes Our effective income tax rate from continuing operations was 38.0 percent in 2006, 37.6 percent in 2005 and 37.8 percent in 2004. Our lower 2005 effective rate was due to the favorable resolution of various tax matters in 2005. We expect our effective income tax rate in 2007 to rise modestly from 2006. Analysis of Financial Condition Liquidity and Capital Resources Our financial condition remains strong. In assessing our financial condition, we consider factors such as cash flow provided by operations, capital expenditures and debt service obligations. Cash flow provided by operations was $4,862 million in 2006 compared to $4,451 million in 2005, primarily due to higher earnings from continuing operations. We continue to fund our growth and execute our share repurchase program through a combination of internally-generated funds and debt financing. Our year-end gross receivables were $6,711 million compared to $6,117 million in 2005, an increase of 9.7 percent. This growth was driven by increased issuance and usage of the Target Visa credit card by our guests during 2006. Average receivables in 2006 increased 11.1 percent. In 2007 we expect our credit card receivables to grow in line with our 2007 sales. Year-end inventory levels increased $416 million, or 7.1 percent, reflecting the natural increase required to support additional square footage and comparable-store sales growth. This growth was largely funded by an increase in accounts payable over the same period. In June 2004, our Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of $3 billion of our common stock. In November 2005, our Board increased the aggregate authorization by $2 billion for a total authorization of $5 billion. In 2006, we repurchased 19.5 million shares of our common stock for a total investment of $977 million ($50.16 per share), primarily through open market transactions. Since the inception of this share repurchase program, we have repurchased a total of 71.0 million shares of our common stock for a total investment of $3,450 million ($48.56 per share). Of the shares reacquired in 2006, a portion was delivered upon settlement of prepaid forward contracts. The details of prepaid forward contract settlements and our long positions in prepaid forward contracts have been provided in Note 25 and Note 27. In 2005 we reacquired 23.1 million shares for a total investment of $1,197 million ($51.88 per share). We expect to continue to execute our share repurchase program primarily in open market transactions, subject to market conditions, and to complete the total program by year-end 2008 or sooner. Our financing strategy is to ensure liquidity and access to capital markets, to manage our net exposure to floating interest rate volatility and to maintain a balanced spectrum of debt maturities. Within these parameters, we seek to minimize our cost of borrowing. In 2006 we declared dividends of $.46 per share totaling approximately $396 million, an increase of 18.6 percent over 2005. In 2005 we declared dividends of $.38 per share totaling approximately $334 million, an increase of 19.3 percent over 2004. We have paid dividends every quarter since our first dividend was declared following our 1967 initial public offering, and it is our intent to continue to do so in the future. Management believes that cash flows from operations, together with current levels of cash and cash equivalents, proceeds from long-term financing activities and issuance of short-term debt will be sufficient in 2007 to fund planned capital expenditures, share repurchases, growth in receivables, maturities of long-term debt, and other cash requirements, including our seasonal inventory buildup. Maintaining strong investment-grade debt ratings is a key part of our strategy. Our debt ratings as of February 3, 2007 were: Debt Ratings Standard and Poor's Moody's Fitch Long-term debt A1 A+ A+ Commercial paper P-1 A-1 F1 Securitized receivables Aaa AAA n/a As described in Note 19, during 2006 we issued $750 million of long-term debt and issued $500 million of Variable Funding Certificates backed by credit card receivables through the Target Credit Card Master Trust. As of February 3, 2007, $100 million of the Variable Funding Certificates were outstanding. Further liquidity is provided by a committed $1.6 billion unsecured revolving credit facility obtained through a group of banks in June 2005, which is scheduled to expire in June 2010. No balances were outstanding at any time during 2006 or 2005 under this or previously existing revolving credit facilities. Most of our long-term debt obligations contain covenants related to secured debt levels. In addition, our credit facility contains a debt leverage covenant. We are, and expect to remain, in compliance with these covenants. At February 3, 2007, no notes or debentures contained provisions requiring acceleration of payment upon a debt rating downgrade. Our interest coverage ratio represents the ratio of pre-tax earnings before fixed charges (interest expense and the interest portion of rent expense) to fixed charges. Our interest coverage ratio calculated as prescribed by Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) rules was 7.1x, 7.2x, and 5.4x in 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively. The ratio in 2004 was adversely affected by losses from discretionary debt repurchase transactions and excludes historical income from discontinued operations. Management believes adjustments for these items are necessary to make the coverage ratio a more useful and consistent indicator of creditworthiness. Capital Expenditures Capital expenditures were $3,928 million in 2006 compared to $3,388 million in 2005 and $3,068 million in 2004. This increase was primarily attributable to continued new store expansion, an increase in remodel program expenditures and growth in distribution center capital investment. Net property and equipment increased $2,393 in 2006 following an increase of $2,178 million in 2005. Spending for new stores, store expansions and remodels, and information systems hardware and software, distribution capacity and other infrastructure to support store growth as a percentage of total capital expenditures are shown below for each of the last three fiscal years. Percentage of Capital Expenditures Capital Expenditures 2006 2005 2004 New stores 61% 60% 64% Remodels and expansions 12% 12% 12% Information technology, distribution and other 27% 28% 24% Total 100% 100% 100% In 2007, we expect to invest $4.2 billion to $4.4 billion primarily in new stores, store expansions and remodels, as well as information systems hardware and software, distribution capacity and other infrastructure to support our planned growth. Our estimated 2007 store opening program reflects net square footage growth of approximately 8 percent, including 115 to 120 new stores partially offset by closings and relocations. We also expect to remodel approximately 40 to 45 stores, most of which will be expanded. In addition, we expect to open two distribution centers in 2007.

Commitments and Contingencies At February 3, 2007, our contractual obligations were as follows: Contractual Obligations Payments Due by Period (millions) Total Less than 1 Year 1-3 Years 3-5 Years After 5 Years Long-term debt (a) $9,897 $1,355 $2,268 $2,343 $3,931 Interest payments – long-term debt (b) 4,165 547 899 625 2,094 Capital lease obligations 249 15 30 32 172 Operating leases (c) 3,325 142 266 235 2,682 Deferred compensation 691 46 205 98 342 Real estate obligations 1,106 1,106 — — — Purchase obligations 1,613 483 605 290 235 Contractual cash obligations $21,046 $3,694 $4,273 $3,623 $9,456 (a) Required principal payments only. Excludes Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 133, ""Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities,"" fair market value adjustments recorded in long-term debt. (b) Includes payments on $1,750 million of floating rate long-term debt secured by credit card receivables, $750 million of which matures in 2007, $900 million of which matures in 2010, and $100 million of which matures in 12 monthly installments beginning in October 2007. These payments are calculated assuming rates of approximately 5.5 percent, based on a spread over presumed LIBOR of 5.35%, for each year outstanding. Excludes payments received or made related to interest rate swaps. The fair value of outstanding interest rate swaps has been provided in Note 21. (c) Total contractual lease payments include $1,631 million related to certain options to extend the lease term that are reasonably assured of being exercised and also includes $188 million of legally binding minimum lease payments for stores opening in 2007 or later. Refer to Note 22 for further description of leases. Real estate obligations include commitments for the purchase, construction or remodeling of real estate and facilities. Purchase obligations include all legally binding contracts such as firm minimum commitments for inventory purchases, merchandise royalties, purchases of equipment, marketing-related contracts, software acquisition/license commitments and service contracts. We issue inventory purchase orders in the normal course of business, which represent authorizations to purchase that are cancelable by their terms. We do not consider purchase orders to be firm inventory commitments; therefore, they are excluded from the table above. We also issue trade letters of credit in the ordinary course of business, which are excluded from this table as these obligations are conditional on the purchase order not being cancelled. If we choose to cancel a purchase order, we may be obligated to reimburse the vendor for unrecoverable outlays incurred prior to cancellation, under certain circumstances. We have not included obligations under our pension and postretirement health care benefit plans in the contractual obligations table above. Our historical practice regarding these plans has been to contribute amounts necessary to satisfy minimum pension funding requirements plus periodic discretionary amounts determined to be appropriate. Further information on these plans, including our expected contributions for 2007, is included in Note 28. We have not provided any material financial guarantees as of February 3, 2007. We have not created and are not party to any off-balance sheet entities for the purpose of raising capital, incurring debt or operating our business. We do not have any arrangements or relationships with entities that are not consolidated into the financial statements that are reasonably likely to materially affect our liquidity or the availability of capital resources. Analysis of Discontinued Operations Marshall Field's and Mervyn's were divested in 2004; no financial results of discontinued operations are included for 2006 or 2005. In 2004, revenues and earnings from discontinued operations reflected only a partial year of results and excluded the holiday season. For 2004, total revenues included in discontinued operations were $3,095 million, and earnings from discontinued operations were $75 million, net of taxes of $46 million. In addition, we recorded a gain on the sale of discontinued operations of $1,238 million, net of taxes of $761 million, during 2004. Critical Accounting Estimates Our analysis of operations and financial condition is based on our consolidated financial statements, prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP). Preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions affecting the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities. In the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, we describe our significant accounting policies used in preparing the consolidated financial statements. Our estimates are evaluated on an ongoing basis and are drawn from historical experience and other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results could differ under different assumptions or conditions. Our senior management has discussed the development and selection of our critical accounting estimates with the Audit Committee of our Board of Directors. The following items in our consolidated financial statements require significant estimation or judgment: Inventory and cost of sales We use the retail inventory method to account for substantially all of our inventory and the related cost of sales. Under this method, inventory is stated at cost using the last-in, first-out (LIFO) method as determined by applying a cost-to-retail ratio to each merchandise grouping's ending retail value. Cost includes the purchase price as adjusted for vendor income. Since inventory value is adjusted regularly to reflect market conditions, our inventory methodology reflects the lower of cost or market. We reduce inventory for estimated losses related to shrink and markdowns. Our shrink estimate is based on historical losses verified by ongoing physical inventory counts. Markdowns designated for clearance activity are recorded when the salability of the merchandise has diminished. Inventory is at risk of obsolescence if economic conditions change. Examples of relevant economic conditions include shifting consumer demand, changing consumer credit markets or increasing competition. We believe these risks are largely mitigated because substantially all of our inventory turns in less than six months. Inventory is further described in Note 11. Vendor income receivable Cost of sales and SG&A expenses are partially offset by various forms of consideration received from our vendors. This ""vendor income"" is earned for a variety of vendor-sponsored programs, such as volume rebates, markdown allowances, promotions and advertising, as well as for our compliance programs. We establish a receivable for the vendor income that is earned but not yet received. Based on provisions of the agreements in place, this receivable is computed by estimating the point at which we have completed our performance and the amount earned. We perform detailed analyses to determine the appropriate level of the receivable in aggregate. The majority of all year-end receivables associated with these activities are collected within the following fiscal quarter. See further description in Note 4. Allowance for doubtful accounts When receivables are recorded, we recognize an allowance for doubtful accounts in an amount equal to anticipated future write-offs. This allowance includes provisions for uncollectible finance charges and other credit fees. We estimate future write-offs based on delinquencies, risk scores, aging trends, industry risk trends and our historical experience. Substantially all accounts continue to accrue finance charges until they are written off. Accounts are automatically written off when they become 180 days past due. Management believes the allowance for doubtful accounts is adequate to cover anticipated losses in our credit card accounts receivable under current conditions; however, significant deterioration in any of the factors mentioned above or in general economic conditions could materially change these expectations. Accounts receivable is described in Note 10. Analysis of long-lived and intangible assets for impairment We review assets at the lowest level for which there are identifiable cash flows, usually at the store level. The carrying amount of assets is compared to the expected undiscounted future cash flows to be generated by those assets over their estimated remaining economic lives. Impairment testing of intangibles requires a comparison between the carrying value and the fair value. Discounted cash flow models are used in determining fair value for the purposes of the required annual impairment analysis. No material impairments were recorded in 2006, 2005 or 2004 as a result of the tests performed. Insurance/self-insurance We retain a substantial portion of the risk related to certain general liability, workers' compensation, property loss and team member medical and dental claims. Liabilities associated with these losses include estimates of both claims filed and losses incurred but not yet reported. We estimate our ultimate cost based on an analysis of historical data and actuarial estimates. General liability and workers' compensation liabilities are recorded at our estimate of their net present value; other liabilities are not discounted. We believe that the amounts accrued are adequate, although actual losses may differ from the amounts provided. We maintain stop-loss coverage to limit the exposure related to certain risks. Income taxes We pay income taxes based on the tax statutes, regulations and case law of the various jurisdictions in which we operate. Significant judgment is required in determining income tax provisions and in evaluating the ultimate resolution of tax matters in dispute with tax authorities. Historically, our assessments of the ultimate resolution of tax issues have been materially accurate. The current open tax issues are not dissimilar in size or substance from historical items. Management believes the resolution of the foregoing matters will not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements. Income taxes are further described in Note 23. Pension and postretirement health care accounting We fund and maintain a qualified defined benefit pension plan. We also maintain several smaller nonqualified plans and a postretirement health care plan for certain retired team members. The costs for these plans are calculated based on actuarial calculations using the assumptions described in the following paragraphs. Our expected long-term rate of return on plan assets is determined by the composition of our asset portfolio, our historical long-term investment performance and current market conditions. The discount rate used to determine benefit obligations is adjusted annually based on the interest rate for long-term high-quality corporate bonds as of the measurement date (October 31) using yields for maturities that are in line with the duration of our pension liabilities. Historically, this same discount rate has also been used to determine pension and postretirement health care expense for the following plan year. We are currently evaluating whether we will early adopt the measurement date provisions of SFAS No. 158, ""Employers' Accounting for Defined Benefit Pension and Other Postretirement Plans, an amendment of FASB Statements No. 87, 88, 106, and 132(R)"" (SFAS 158), as discussed below in the 2006 Adoptions section. In 2006, we increased our discount rate by 0.05 percentage points from the previous year for the purpose of calculating the October 31, 2006 benefit obligation. Based on our experience, we use a graduated compensation growth schedule that assumes higher compensation growth for younger, shorter-service pension-eligible team members than it does for older, longer-service pension-eligible team members. In 2006, we increased the assumed rate of compensation increase by 0.50 percentage points for the purpose of calculating the October 31, 2006 benefit obligation. In 2005, we made a 0.75 percentage point increase in the assumed compensation rate increase, which impacted the net periodic benefit cost for 2006. Pension and postretirement health care benefits are further described in Note 28. New Accounting Pronouncements 2006 Adoptions We adopted the recognition and disclosure provisions of SFAS 158 during 2006. Please refer to Note 28 (Pension and Postretirement Health Care Benefits) for further description of this adoption. We are currently evaluating whether we will adopt the SFAS 158 measurement date provisions in 2007 or 2008, including the potential impact on our results of operations and financial position. In September 2006, the SEC staff published Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 108, ""Considering the Effects of Prior Year Misstatements when Quantifying Misstatements in Current Year Financial Statements"" (SAB 108). SAB 108 addresses quantifying the financial statement effects of misstatements, specifically, how the effects of prior year uncorrected errors must be considered in quantifying misstatements in the current year financial statements. We adopted SAB 108 during the fourth quarter of 2006. The adoption of this statement did not have any impact on our consolidated net earnings, cash flows or financial position. 2007 and Future Adoptions In July 2006, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued FASB Interpretation No. 48, ""Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes—an interpretation of FASB Statement No. 109"" (FIN 48). FIN 48 prescribes the financial statement recognition and measurement criteria for tax positions taken in a tax return, clarifies when tax benefits should be recorded and how they should be classified in financial statements, and requires certain disclosures of uncertain tax matters. FIN 48 is effective at the beginning of fiscal 2007. We are presently evaluating the impact of the adoption of FIN 48 on our results of operations and financial position. In September 2006, the FASB issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 157, ""Fair Value Measurement"" (SFAS 157). SFAS 157 provides a definition of fair value, provides guidance for measuring fair value in U.S. GAAP and expands disclosures about fair value measurements. SFAS 157 will be effective at the beginning of fiscal 2008. We are presently evaluating the impact of the adoption of SFAS 157 on our results of operations and financial position. In February 2007, the FASB issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 159, ""The Fair Value Option for Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities"" (SFAS 159). SFAS 159 permits entities to choose to measure many financial instruments and certain other items at fair value. SFAS 159 will be effective at the beginning of fiscal 2008. We are presently evaluating the impact of the adoption of SFAS 159 on our results of operations and financial position. Forward-Looking Statements This report, including the preceding Management's Discussion and Analysis, contains forward-looking statements regarding our performance, financial position, liquidity and adequacy of capital resources. Forward-looking statements are typically accompanied by the words ""expect,"" ""may,"" ""could,"" ""believe,"" ""would,"" ""might,"" ""anticipates,"" or words of similar import. The forward-looking statements in this report include the anticipated impact of new and proposed accounting pronouncements, the expected outcome of pending and threatened litigation, our expectations with respect to our share repurchase program and our outlook in fiscal 2007. Forward-looking statements are based on our current assumptions and expectations and are subject to certain risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those projected. We caution that the forward-looking statements are qualified by the risks and challenges posed by increased competition (including the effects of competitor liquidation activities), shifting consumer demand, changing consumer credit markets, changing wages, health care and other benefit costs, shifting capital markets and general economic conditions, hiring and retaining effective team members, sourcing merchandise from domestic and international vendors, investing in new business strategies, the outbreak of war or pandemics and other significant national and international events, and other risks and uncertainties. As a result, although we believe there is a reasonable basis for the forward- looking statements, you should not place undue reliance on those statements. You are encouraged to review Exhibit (99)A to this Form 10-K, which contains additional important factors that may cause actual results to differ materially from those predicted in the forward-looking statements. Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk. Our exposure to market risk results primarily from interest rate changes on our debt obligations and on our credit card receivables, the majority of which are now assessed finance charges at a prime-based floating rate. To preserve our net interest margin, we intend to maintain sufficient levels of floating-rate debt to generate parallel changes in net interest expense as finance charge revenues fluctuate. At February 3, 2007, our level of floating-rate debt obligations exceeded our level of floating-rate credit card assets by approximately $1 billion. As a result, based on our balance sheet position at February 3, 2007, the annualized effect of a one percentage point increase in floating interest rates on our interest rate swap agreements and other floating rate debt obligations, net of our floating rate credit card assets, would be to decrease earnings from continuing operations before income taxes by approximately $10 million. See further description in Note 21. We record our general liability and workers' compensation liabilities at net present value; therefore, these liabilities fluctuate with changes in interest rates. We economically hedge a portion of our exposure to these interest rate changes by entering into interest rate forward contracts that partially mitigate the effects of interest rate changes. As a result, we do not have significant net exposure to interest rate changes for these liabilities. In addition, we are exposed to fluctuations of market returns on our qualified defined benefit pension and nonqualified defined contribution plans. The annualized effect of a one percentage point decrease in the return on pension plan assets would decrease plan assets by $21 million at February 3, 2007. The resulting impact on net pension expense would be calculated consistent with the provisions of SFAS No. 87, ""Employers' Accounting for Pensions."" See further description in Note 28. As more fully described in Note 14 and Note 27, we are exposed to market returns on accumulated team member balances in our nonqualified, unfunded deferred compensation plans. We control our risk of offering the nonqualified plans by making investments in life insurance contracts and prepaid forward contracts on our own common stock that offset a substantial portion of our economic exposure to the returns on these plans. The annualized effect of a one percentage point change in market returns on our nonqualified defined contribution plans (inclusive of the effect of the investment vehicles used to manage our economic exposure) would not be significant. We do not have significant direct exposure to foreign currency rates as all of our stores are located in the United States and the vast majority of imported merchandise is purchased in U.S. dollars. Overall, there have been no material changes in our primary risk exposures or management of market risks since the prior year.",2023-12-30 21:32:33.254249

27419,TGT,TARGET CORP,2009,"Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Executive Summary Our financial results for both the fourth quarter and 2008 fiscal year reflect the impact of adverse economic conditions on our business segments. Our Retail Segment results were affected by changes in consumer spending patterns that negatively impacted our traffic and sales, particularly in higher margin discretionary categories, creating an elevated level of markdowns resulting from weaker than expected sales. Our Credit Card Segment performance, like that of other credit card issuers, was adversely affected by the deteriorating credit and risk environment. As a result, we incurred higher-than-expected bad debt expense as we both wrote-off accounts and added significantly to our allowance for doubtful accounts. In light of this challenging retail and credit environment, we have suspended our share repurchase program and reduced spending on new store construction and remodels. Sales totaled $62,884 million in 2008, $61,471 million in 2007 and $57,878 million in 2006, increasing 2.3 percent in 2008 and 6.2 percent in 2007. Comparable-store sales (as defined below) in 2008 declined 2.9 percent from 2007; comparable-store sales in 2007 grew 3.0 percent from 2006. Credit card revenues were $2,064 million, $1,896 million and $1,612 million in 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively, increasing 8.9 percent in 2008 and 17.6 percent in 2007. The combination of retail and credit card operations produced earnings before interest expense and income taxes of $4,402 million in 2008, $5,272 million in 2007 and $5,069 million in 2006, decreasing 16.5 percent in 2008 and increasing 4.0 percent in 2007. Cash flow provided by operations was $4,430 million, $4,125 million and $4,862 million for 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively. Additionally, we paid dividends of $465 million in 2008, $442 million in 2007 and $380 million in 2006. We opened 114 new stores in 2008, or 91 stores net of 21 relocations and two closings. In 2007, we opened 118 new stores representing 103 stores net of 14 relocations and one closing. Management's Discussion and Analysis is based on our Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data. Analysis of Results of Operations Retail Segment Percent Change Retail Segment Results (millions) 2008 2007 2006 2008/2007 2007/2006 Sales $ 62,884 $ 61,471 $ 57,878 2.3 % 6.2 % Cost of sales 44,157 42,929 40,366 2.9 6.3 Gross margin 18,727 18,542 17,512 1.0 5.9 SG&A expenses (a) 12,838 12,557 11,745 2.2 6.9 EBITDA 5,889 5,985 5,767 (1.6 ) 3.8 Depreciation and amortization 1,808 1,643 1,481 10.1 10.9 EBIT $ 4,081 $ 4,342 $ 4,286 (6.0 )% 1.3 % EBITDA is earnings before interest expense, income taxes, depreciation and amortization.

Our Retail Segment charges these discounts to our Credit Card Segment, and the reimbursements of $117 million in 2008, $114 million in 2007 and $109 million in 2006, are recorded as a reduction to SG&A expenses within the Retail Segment. Retail Segment Rate Analysis 2008 2007 2006 Gross margin rate 29.8 % 30.2 % 30.3 % SG&A expense rate 20.4 20.4 20.3 EBITDA margin rate 9.4 9.7 10.0 Depreciation and amortization expense rate 2.9 2.7 2.6 EBIT margin rate 6.5 7.1 7.4 Retail Segment rate analysis metrics are computed by dividing the applicable amount by sales. 12 Table of Contents Sales Sales include merchandise sales, net of expected returns, from our stores and our online business, as well as gift card breakage. Refer to Note 2 for a definition of gift card breakage. Total sales for the Retail Segment for the 2008 year were $62,884 million, compared with $61,471 million in 2007 and $57,878 million in 2006. The 2008 and 2007 periods were 52-week years compared to the 2006 period that was a 53-week year. Growth in total sales between 2008 and 2007 resulted from sales from stores opened in 2008, offset by lower comparable-store sales. The increase in total sales between 2007 and 2006 is attributable to both new stores and comparable-store sales increases. In 2008, inflation affected sales growth by approximately 2 percentage points, compared with a deflationary impact of 2 percent in 2007 and 1 percent in 2006. Percentage of Sales Sales by Product Category 2008 2007 2006 Consumables and commodities 37 % 34 % 32 % Electronics, entertainment, sporting goods and toys 22 22 23 Apparel and accessories 20 22 22 Home furnishings and décor 21 22 23 Total 100 % 100 % 100 % Comparable-store sales is a measure that indicates the performance of our existing stores by measuring the growth in sales for such stores for a period over the comparable, prior-year period of equivalent length. The method of calculating comparable-store sales varies across the retail industry. As a result, our comparable-store sales calculation is not necessarily comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies. Additionally, beginning in 2007, we changed our comparable-store sales calculation to include sales from our online business because we believe this combined measure represents a more useful disclosure in light of our fully integrated, multi-channel approach to our business. Comparable-store sales are sales from our online business and sales from general merchandise and SuperTarget stores open longer than one year, including: •sales from stores that have been remodeled or expanded while remaining open •sales from stores that have been relocated to new buildings of the same format within the same trade area, in which the new store opens at about the same time as the old store closes Comparable-store sales do not include: •sales from general merchandise stores that have been converted, or relocated within the same trade area, to a SuperTarget store format •sales from stores that were intentionally closed to be remodeled, expanded or reconstructed Comparable-Store Sales 2008 2007 2006 Comparable-store sales (2.9) % 3.0 % 4.8 % Drivers of changes in comparable-store sales: Number of transactions (3.1) % 0.3 % 1.1 % Average transaction amount 0.2 % 2.6 % 3.7 % Units per transaction (2.1) % 1.1 % 2.2 % Selling price per unit 2.3 % 1.5 % 1.4 % The comparable-store sales increases or decreases above are calculated by comparing sales in fiscal year periods with comparable prior fiscal year periods of equivalent length. In 2008, the change in comparable-store sales was driven by a decline in the number of transactions, slightly offset by an increase in average transaction amount, which reflects the effect of a higher selling price per unit sold partially offset by a decrease in number of units per transaction. In fiscal 2007, the comparable store sales increase was driven primarily by an increase in average transaction amount when compared to 2006, with both the number of units and selling price per unit sold, each representing roughly half of the increase attributable to average transaction amount. Transaction-level metrics are influenced by a broad array of macroeconomic, competitive and consumer behavioral factors, and comparable-store sales rates is negatively impacted by transfer of sales to new stores. 13 Table of Contents Gross Margin Rate Gross margin rate represents gross margin (sales less cost of sales) as a percentage of sales. See Note 3 for a description of expenses included in cost of sales. Markup is the difference between an item's cost and its retail price (expressed as a percentage of its retail price). Factors that affect markup include vendor offerings and negotiations, vendor income, sourcing strategies, market forces like raw material and freight costs, and competitive influences. Markdowns are the reduction in the original or previous price of retail merchandise. Factors that affect markdowns include inventory management, competitive influences and economic conditions. In 2008, our consolidated gross margin rate was 29.8 percent compared with 30.2 percent in 2007. Our 2008 gross margin rate was adversely affected by sales mix, which resulted in a 0.6 percentage point reduction in the gross margin rate. Sales in merchandise categories that yield lower gross margin rates (generally non-discretionary product categories of consumables and commodities) outpaced sales in our higher margin apparel and home merchandise categories. This mix impact was partially offset by favorable supply chain expense rates, as well as higher gross margin rates within merchandise categories across our assortment, which had a combined favorable impact on gross margin rate of approximately 0.2 percentage point. In 2007, our consolidated gross margin rate was consistent with the 2006 gross margin rate. Our gross margin rate for 2007 benefited from higher margin rates within merchandise categories. Substantially all of this benefit was offset by the adverse effects from sales of lower margin merchandise categories outpacing sales of higher margin merchandise categories. During 2007, rate improvement within categories was driven generally by an array of inventory control initiatives that minimized markdowns. Selling, General and Administrative Expense Rate Our selling, general and administrative (SG&A) expense rate represents SG&A expenses as a percentage of sales. See Note 3 for a description of expenses included in SG&A expenses. SG&A expenses exclude depreciation and amortization, as well as expenses associated with our credit card operations, which are reflected separately in our Consolidated Statements of Operations. SG&A expense rate was 20.4 percent in 2008, which was the same as 2007 and consistent with 20.3 percent in 2006. Within SG&A expenses in 2008 and 2007, there were no expense categories that experienced a significant fluctuation as a percentage of sales, when compared to prior periods. These expense rates reflect sustained productivity gains in our stores and disciplined expense control across the Corporation. Depreciation and Amortization Expense Rate Our depreciation and amortization expense rate represents depreciation and amortization expense as a percentage of sales. In 2008, our depreciation and amortization expense rate was 2.9 percent compared with 2.7 percent in 2007 and 2.6 percent in 2006. The comparative increases in 2008 and 2007 were due to increased capital expenditures, specifically related to investments in new stores. During 2006, we adjusted the period over which we amortize leasehold acquisition costs to match the expected terms for individual leases, resulting in a cumulative benefit to depreciation and amortization expense of approximately $28 million.

Our primary measure of profitability in our Credit Card Segment is the EBIT generated by our total credit card receivables portfolio less the interest expense on nonrecourse debt collateralized by credit card receivables. We analyze this measure of profit in light of the amount of capital Target has invested in our credit card receivables. In addition, we measure the performance of our overall credit card receivables portfolio by calculating the dollar spread to LIBOR at the portfolio level. This metric approximates the credit performance and overall financial performance of the entire credit card portfolio we manage by measuring the difference between EBIT earned on the portfolio and a hypothetical benchmark rate financing cost applied to the entire portfolio. The vast majority of our portfolio accrues finance charge revenue at rates tied to the Prime Rate, and the interest rate on all nonrecourse debt securitized by credit card receivables is tied to LIBOR. Segment profit and dollar spread to LIBOR measures in 2008 were significantly impacted on both a rate and dollar basis by bad debt expense. Segment revenues were $2,064 million, an increase of $168 million, or 8.9 percent, from the prior year, driven by a 19.5 percent increase in average receivables. On a rate basis, 15 Table of Contents revenue yield decreased 2.4 percentage points primarily due to a reduction in the Prime Rate index used to determine finance charge rates in the portfolio and lower external sales volume contributing to the decline in third party merchant fees. This negative pressure on revenue yield was offset modestly by the positive impact of terms changes implemented in 2008 that increased our effective yield. Segment expenses were $1,742 million, an increase of $776 million, or 80.3 percent, from the prior year driven by an increase in bad debt expense of $770 million. The increase in bad debt expense resulted from the increase in our incurred net write-off rate from 5.9 percent in 2007 to 9.3 percent in 2008 and the increase in the allowance for doubtful accounts of $440 million for anticipated future write-offs of current receivables. Segment profit decreased from 16.3 percent in 2007 to 3.7 percent in 2008 primarily due to the effect of bad debt expense, the reduction in receivables owned and funded by Target, and the impact of a lower Prime Rate during 2008. 2007 segment revenues were $1,896 million, an increase of $284 million, or 17.6 percent, from the prior year, driven by a higher average receivables balance. The annualized rates for the components of segment revenue were consistent with prior periods. Segment expenses were $966 million, an increase of $136 million, or 16.4 percent, from 2006. This increase was due to bad debt expense in 2007 which rose reflecting an increase in net write-offs and an increase in the allowance for doubtful accounts as a result of higher expected future losses on period-end receivables. Segment ROIC benefited from a slightly higher percentage of third party funding of our credit card receivables. We implemented a terms change to our portfolio, effective in April 2009, that establishes a minimum annual percentage rate (APR) applied to a receivables balance as a finance charge. Under this terms change, finance charges will accrue at a fixed APR if the benchmark Prime Rate is less than a threshold amount; if the Prime Rate is greater than the threshold, finance charges will accrue at the benchmark Prime Rate, plus a spread. Receivables Rollforward Analysis Fiscal Year Percent Change (millions) 2008 2007 2006 2008/2007 2007/2006 Beginning receivables $ 8,624 $ 6,711 $ 6,117 28.5 % 9.7 % Charges at Target 4,207 4,491 4,339 (6.3 ) 3.5 Charges at third parties 8,542 9,398 7,831 (9.1 ) 20.0 Payments (13,482 ) (13,388 ) (12,832 ) 0.7 4.3 Other 1,203 1,412 1,256 (14.8 ) 12.4 Period-end receivables $ 9,094 $ 8,624 $ 6,711 5.4 28.5 Average receivables $ 8,695 $ 7,275 $ 6,161 19.5 18.1 Accounts with three or more payments (60+ days) past due as a percentage of period-end receivables 6.1 % 4.0 % 3.5 % Accounts with four or more payments (90+ days) past due as a percentage of period-end receivables 4.3 % 2.7 % 2.4 % Allowance for Doubtful Accounts Fiscal Year Percent Change (millions) 2008 2007 2006 2008/2007 2007/2006 Allowance at beginning of period $ 570 $ 517 $ 451 10.4 % 14.6 % Bad debt provision 1,251 481 380 160.1 26.5 Net write-offs (a) (811 ) (428 ) (314 ) 89.8 36.0 Allowance at end of period $ 1,010 $ 570 $ 517 77.1 10.4 As a percentage of period-end receivables 11.1 % 6.6 % 7.7 % Net write-offs as a percentage of average receivables (annualized) 9.3 % 5.9 % 5.1 % (a) Net write-offs include the principal amount of losses (excluding accrued and unpaid finance charges) less current period principal recoveries. Our 2008 period-end gross receivables were $9,094 million compared with $8,624 million in 2007, an increase of 5.4 percent. Average receivables in 2008 increased 19.5 percent compared with 2007 levels. This growth was driven by the annualization of the prior year's product change from proprietary Target Cards to higher-limit Target Visa cards and the impact of industry-wide declines in payment rates, offset in part by a reduction in charge activity resulting from reductions in card usage by our guests, and from risk management and underwriting initiatives that significantly reduced credit lines for higher risk guests. 16 Table of Contents 2007 period-end receivables were $8,624 million compared with $6,711 million in 2006, an increase of 28.5 percent. Average receivables in 2007 increased 18.1 percent to $7,275 million from $6,161 million. This growth in receivables measure was driven primarily by a product change from proprietary Target Cards to Target Visa cards for a group of higher credit-quality Target Card Guests. A product change to a Target Visa card generally results in a higher receivables balance because it can be used for purchases outside of Target stores and has a higher credit limit. Accounts converted from a Target Card to a Target Visa accounted for approximately 20 percentage points of the growth in period-end receivables. The remainder of our year-over-year receivables growth was primarily due to a reduction in payment rates on non-converted accounts. Other Performance Factors Net Interest Expense Net interest expense was $866 million at the end of 2008, increasing 33.8 percent, or $219 million from 2007. This increase was due primarily to higher average debt balances supporting capital investment, share repurchase and the receivables portfolio, partially offset by a lower average portfolio net interest rate. In 2007, net interest expense was $647 million compared with $572 million in 2006, an increase of 13.2 percent. This increase related to higher average debt balances, including the debt to fund growth in accounts receivable. The average portfolio interest rate was 5.3 percent in 2008, 6.1 percent in 2007 and 6.2 percent in 2006. Provision for Income Taxes Our effective income tax rate was 37.4 percent in 2008, 38.4 percent in 2007 and 38.0 percent in 2006. The decrease in 2008 was primarily due to tax reserve reductions resulting from audit settlements and the effective resolution of other issues. The 2008 effective income tax rate is also lower due to a comparatively greater proportion of earnings subject to rate differences between taxing jurisdictions. These rate declines were partially offset by lower capital market returns on investments used to economically hedge the market risk in deferred compensation plans. Gains and losses from these investments are not taxable. The increase in the 2007 effective rate from the prior year was primarily due to lower capital market returns on these investments as compared to 2006. Workforce Reduction In 2008, we recorded a $47 million charge related to workforce reduction actions, approximately $21 million of which related to actions announced in January 2009 affecting our headquarters population. This charge was comprised of severance and benefit costs of $37 million and other expenses, primarily early lease exit costs, of $10 million. At the end of 2008, the remaining liability balance relating to severance costs was approximately $31 million. We believe that the liability will be substantially extinguished by the end of the first quarter of 2009. The liability is recorded as a component of other current liabilities and the expenses are recorded as a component of SG&A. We will incur costs in 2009 for workforce reduction actions announced in 2008 but where team members are required to provide future services. We estimate those costs will be approximately $11 million and generally represent severance and benefits costs to be paid during 2009. Analysis of Financial Condition Liquidity and Capital Resources We continue to fund our operations and growth through a combination of internally generated funds and debt financing. Cash flow provided by operations was $4,430 million in 2008 compared with $4,125 million in 2007. Our 2008 period-end gross receivables were $9,094 million compared with $8,624 million in 2007, an increase of 5.4 percent. Average receivables in 2008 increased 19.5 percent compared with 2007 levels. This growth was driven by the annualization of the prior year's product change from proprietary Target Cards to higher-limit Target Visa cards and the impact of industry-wide declines in payment rates, offset in part by a reduction in charge activity resulting from risk management and underwriting initiatives that significantly 17 Table of Contents reduced credit lines and from notable reductions in card usage. As further described in Note 10, we sold an interest in our credit card receivables to a JPMorgan Chase affiliate (JPMC). The interest sold represented 47 percent of the receivables portfolio at the time of the transaction. Year-end inventory levels decreased $75 million, or 1.1 percent from 2007, reflecting inventory management initiatives responding to declining consumer demand offset by increased inventory levels required to support comparatively higher retail square footage. Accounts payable decreased by 5.7 percent over the same period. During 2008, we repurchased 67.2 million shares of our common stock for a total cash investment of $3,395 million ($50.49 per share) under a $10 billion share repurchase plan authorized by our Board of Directors in November 2007. In 2007 we repurchased 46.2 million shares of our common stock for a total cash investment of $2,642 million ($57.24 per share). In November 2008 we announced that, in light of our business outlook, we were temporarily suspending our open-market share repurchase program. We declared dividends totaling $471 million ($0.62 per share) in 2008, an increase of 3.8 percent over 2007. In 2007 we declared dividends totaling $454 million ($0.54 per share), an increase of 14.6 percent over 2006. We have paid dividends every quarter since our first dividend was declared following our 1967 initial public offering, and it is our intent to continue to do so in the future. Our financing strategy is to ensure liquidity and access to capital markets, to manage our net exposure to floating interest rate volatility, and to maintain a balanced spectrum of debt maturities. Within these parameters, we seek to minimize our borrowing costs. Maintaining strong investment-grade debt ratings is a key part of our financing strategy. Our current debt ratings are as follows: Debt Ratings Standard and Poor's Moody's Fitch Long-term debt A2 A+ A Commercial paper P-1 A-1 F1 Securitized receivables (a) Aaa AA n/a (a) These rated securitized receivables exclude the interest in our credit card receivables sold to JPMC. At January 31, 2009 and February 2, 2008, there were no amounts outstanding under our commercial paper program. We fund our peak sales season working capital needs through our commercial paper program and typically use the cash generated from that sales season to repay the commercial paper issued. Additionally and as described in Note 10, we sold to JPMC an interest in our credit card receivables for approximately $3.8 billion. We received proceeds of approximately $3.6 billion, reflecting a 7 percent discount. An additional source of liquidity is available to us through a committed $2 billion unsecured revolving credit facility obtained through a group of banks in April 2007, which will expire in April 2012. No balances were outstanding at any time during 2008 or 2007 under this or previously existing revolving credit facilities. Most of our long-term debt obligations contain covenants related to secured debt levels. In addition to a secured debt level covenant, our credit facility also contains a debt leverage covenant. We are, and expect to remain, in compliance with these covenants. Additionally, at January 31, 2009, no notes or debentures contained provisions requiring acceleration of payment upon a debt rating downgrade, except that certain outstanding notes allow the note holders to put the notes to us if within a matter of months of each other we experience both (i) a change in control; and (ii) our long-term debt ratings are either reduced and the resulting rating is non-investment grade, or our long-term debt ratings are placed on watch for possible reduction and those ratings are subsequently reduced and the resulting rating is non-investment grade. Our interest coverage ratio represents the ratio of pre-tax earnings before fixed charges to fixed charges. Fixed charges include interest expense and the interest portion of rent expense. Our interest coverage ratio as calculated by the SEC's applicable rules was 4.3x in 2008, 6.4x in 2007 and 7.1x in 2006. Capital Expenditures Capital expenditures were $3,547 million in 2008, compared with $4,369 million in 2007 and $3,928 million in 2006. This decrease was driven by lower capital expenditures for new stores, remodels and technology-related assets. Our 2008 capital expenditures include $1,258 million related to stores that will 18 Table of Contents open in 2009 and later years. Net property and equipment increased $1,661 million in 2008 following an increase of $2,664 million in 2007.

Excludes Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 133, ""Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities,"" fair market value adjustments recorded in long-term debt. Principal amounts include the 47 percent interest in credit card receivables sold to JPMC at the principal amount.(b)These payments vary with LIBOR and are calculated assuming LIBOR of 0.5 percent plus a spread, for each year outstanding. (c) Total contractual lease payments include $1,830 million of lease payments related to options to extend the lease term that are reasonably assured of being exercised and also includes $164 million of legally binding minimum lease payments for stores opening in 2009 or later. Refer to Note 21 for a further description of leases. (d) Estimated tax contingencies of $447 million, including interest and penalties, are not included in the table above because we are not able to make reasonably reliable estimates of the period of cash settlement. Real estate obligations include commitments for the purchase, construction or remodeling of real estate and facilities. Purchase obligations include all legally binding contracts such as firm minimum commitments for inventory purchases, merchandise royalties, equipment purchases, marketing-related contracts, software acquisition/license commitments and service contracts. We issue inventory purchase orders in the normal course of business, which represent authorizations to purchase that are cancelable by their terms. We do not consider purchase orders to be firm inventory commitments; therefore, they are excluded from the table above. We also issue trade letters of credit in the ordinary course of business, which are excluded from this table as these obligations are conditional on the purchase order not being cancelled. If we choose to cancel a purchase order, we may be obligated to reimburse the vendor for unrecoverable outlays incurred prior to cancellation. We have not included obligations under our pension and postretirement health care benefit plans in the contractual obligations table above. Our historical practice regarding these plans has been to contribute amounts necessary to satisfy minimum pension funding requirements, plus periodic discretionary amounts determined to be appropriate. Further information on these plans, including our expected contributions for 2009, is included in Note 27. We do not have any arrangements or relationships with entities that are not consolidated into the financial statements that are reasonably likely to materially affect our liquidity or the availability of capital resources. 19 Table of Contents Critical Accounting Estimates Our analysis of operations and financial condition is based on our consolidated financial statements, prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP). Preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions affecting the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements, reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities. In the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, we describe the significant accounting policies used in preparing the consolidated financial statements. Our estimates are evaluated on an ongoing basis and are drawn from historical experience and other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results could differ under different assumptions or conditions. Our senior management has discussed the development and selection of our critical accounting estimates with the Audit Committee of our Board of Directors. The following items in our consolidated financial statements require significant estimation or judgment: Inventory and cost of sales We use the retail inventory method to account for substantially our entire inventory and the related cost of sales. Under this method, inventory is stated at cost using the last-in, first-out (LIFO) method as determined by applying a cost-to-retail ratio to each merchandise grouping's ending retail value. Cost includes the purchase price as adjusted for vendor income. Since inventory value is adjusted regularly to reflect market conditions, our inventory methodology reflects the lower of cost or market. We reduce inventory for estimated losses related to shrink and markdowns. Our shrink estimate is based on historical losses verified by ongoing physical inventory counts. Historically our actual physical inventory count results have shown our estimates to be reliable. Markdowns designated for clearance activity are recorded when the salability of the merchandise has diminished. Inventory is at risk of obsolescence if economic conditions change. Relevant economic conditions include changing consumer demand, changing consumer credit markets or increasing competition. We believe these risks are largely mitigated because our inventory typically turns in less than six months. Inventory is further described in Note 11. Vendor income receivable Cost of sales and SG&A expenses are partially offset by various forms of consideration received from our vendors. This ""vendor income"" is earned for a variety of vendor-sponsored programs, such as volume rebates, markdown allowances, promotions and advertising, as well as for our compliance programs. We establish a receivable for the vendor income that is earned but not yet received. Based on the agreements in place, this receivable is computed by estimating when we have completed our performance and the amount earned. The majority of all year-end vendor income receivables are collected within the following fiscal quarter. Vendor income is described further in Note 4. Allowance for doubtful accounts When receivables are recorded, we recognize an allowance for doubtful accounts in an amount equal to anticipated future write-offs. This allowance includes provisions for uncollectible finance charges and other credit-related fees. We estimate future write-offs based on historical experience of delinquencies, risk scores, aging trends and industry risk trends. Substantially all accounts continue to accrue finance charges until they are written off. Accounts are automatically written off when they become 180 days past due. Management believes the allowance for doubtful accounts is adequate to cover anticipated losses in our credit card accounts receivable under current conditions; however, unexpected, significant deterioration in any of the factors mentioned above or in general economic conditions could materially change these expectations. We believe that the allowance recorded at January 31, 2009 is sufficient to cover currently anticipated losses. Credit card receivables are described in Note 10. Analysis of long-lived and intangible assets for impairment We review assets at the lowest level for which there are identifiable cash flows, usually at the store level. An impairment loss on a long-lived and identifiable intangible asset would be recognized when estimated undiscounted future cash flows from the operation and disposition of the asset are less than the asset carrying amount. Goodwill is tested for impairment by comparing its carrying value to a fair value estimated by discounted future cash flows. No material impairments were recorded in 2008, 2007 or 2006 as a result of the tests performed. Insurance/self-insurance We retain a substantial portion of the risk related to certain general liability, workers' compensation, property loss and team member medical and dental claims. Liabilities associated with these losses include estimates of both claims filed and losses incurred but not yet reported. We estimate 20 Table of Contents our ultimate cost based on an analysis of historical data and actuarial estimates. General liability and workers' compensation liabilities are recorded at our estimate of their net present value; other liabilities referred to above are not discounted. We believe that the amounts accrued are adequate, although actual losses may differ from the amounts provided. We maintain stop-loss coverage to limit the exposure related to certain risks. Refer to Item 7A for further disclosure of the market risks associated with our insurance policies. Income taxes We pay income taxes based on the tax statutes, regulations and case law of the various jurisdictions in which we operate. Significant judgment is required in determining income tax provisions and in evaluating the ultimate resolution of tax matters in dispute with tax authorities. Historically, our assessments of the ultimate resolution of tax issues have been materially accurate. The current open tax issues are not dissimilar in size or substance from historical items. We believe the resolution of these matters will not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements. Income taxes are described further in Note 22. Pension and postretirement health care accounting We fund and maintain a qualified defined benefit pension plan. We also maintain several smaller nonqualified plans and a postretirement health care plan for certain current and retired team members. The costs for these plans are determined based on actuarial calculations using the assumptions described in the following paragraphs. Eligibility for, and the level of, these benefits varies depending on team members' full-time or part-time status, date of hire and/or length of service. Our expected long-term rate of return on plan assets is determined by the portfolio composition, historical long-term investment performance and current market conditions. The discount rate used to determine benefit obligations is adjusted annually based on the interest rate for long-term high-quality corporate bonds as of the measurement date using yields for maturities that are in line with the duration of our pension liabilities. Historically, this same discount rate has also been used to determine pension and postretirement health care expense for the following plan year. Effective February 4, 2007, we adopted the measurement date provisions of SFAS No. 158, ""Employers' Accounting for Defined Benefit Pension and Other Postretirement Plans, an amendment of FASB Statements No. 87, 88, 106, and 132(R)"" (SFAS 158). The discount rates used to determine benefit obligations and benefits expense are included in Note 27. Benefits expense recorded during the year is partially dependent upon the discount rates used, and a 0.1 percent increase to the weighted average discount rate used to determine pension and postretirement health care expenses would decrease annual expense by approximately $4 million. Based on our experience, we use a graduated compensation growth schedule that assumes higher compensation growth for younger, shorter-service pension-eligible team members than it does for older, longer-service pension-eligible team members. Pension and postretirement health care benefits are further described in Note 27. New Accounting Pronouncements 2008 Adoptions In September 2006, the FASB issued SFAS No. 157, ""Fair Value Measurement"" (SFAS 157). SFAS 157 defines fair value, provides guidance for measuring fair value in accordance with GAAP and expands disclosures about fair value measurements. SFAS 157, as originally issued, was effective for fiscal years beginning after November 15, 2007. However, in February 2008, the FASB issued FASB Staff Position FAS 157-2, which deferred the effective date of SFAS 157 for one year, as it relates to nonfinancial assets and liabilities. We adopted SFAS 157 for financial assets and liabilities at the beginning of the first quarter of 2008, and the adoption had no impact to our consolidated net earnings, cash flows and financial position. Subsequent to our adoption of SFAS 157, the FASB has issued various other FASB Staff Positions and guidance on fair value measurement; the additional guidance has not had an impact on our adoption. We will adopt SFAS 157 for nonfinancial assets and liabilities at the beginning of 2009 and do not expect to have a material impact on our consolidated net earnings, cash flows or financial position. In February 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 159, ""The Fair Value Option for Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities"" (SFAS 159). SFAS 159 permits entities to choose to measure many financial instruments and certain other items at fair value. We adopted SFAS 159 at the beginning of fiscal 2008, and the adoption had no impact to our consolidated net earnings, cash flows or financial position. In March 2008, the FASB issued SFAS No. 161, ""Disclosures about Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities, an amendment of FASB Statement No. 133"" (SFAS 161). SFAS 161 requires enhanced disclosures about derivatives and hedging activities. SFAS 161, as originally issued, was effective at the beginning of fiscal 21 Table of Contents 2009. However, in October 2008, the FASB issued Staff Position No. FAS 133-1 and FIN 45-4, which, amongst other actions, accelerated the effective date of SFAS 161 to be effective for interim and annual periods beginning after November 15, 2008. Since SFAS 161 requires only additional disclosures concerning derivatives and hedging activities, the adoption of SFAS 161 did not have any impact on our consolidated net earnings, cash flows or financial position. In November 2008, the FASB Staff Position FAS 140-e and FIN 46(R)-e, Disclosures about Transfers of Financial Assets and Interests in Variable Interest Entities (the FSP) was published with an effective date for periods ending December 15, 2008. The FSP is intended to enhance currently required disclosures until the pending amendments to SFAS 140, ""Accounting for Transfers and Servicing of Financial Assets and Extinguishments of Liabilities,"" and FASB Interpretation No. 46 (revised December 2003), ""Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities,"" are published. Since the FSP requires only additional disclosures related to certain asset transfers, the adoption of the FSP did not have any impact on our consolidated net earnings, cash flows or financial position. Future Adoptions In December 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 141(R), ""Business Combinations"" (SFAS 141(R)), which changes the accounting for business combinations and their effects on the financial statements. SFAS 141(R) will be effective at the beginning of fiscal 2009. The adoption of this statement is not expected to have a material impact on our consolidated net earnings, cash flows or financial position. In December 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 160, ""Accounting and Reporting of Noncontrolling Interests in Consolidated Financial Statements, an amendment of ARB No. 51"" (SFAS 160). SFAS 160 requires entities to report noncontrolling interests in subsidiaries as equity in their consolidated financial statements. SFAS 160 will be effective at the beginning of fiscal 2009. The adoption of this statement is not expected to have a material impact on our consolidated net earnings, cash flows or financial position. Outlook for Fiscal Year 2009 We anticipate that the challenging economic and consumer environment we experienced in 2008 will continue into 2009. In the first half of 2009, in our Retail Segment, we expect a continuation of recent sales trends – specifically mid-single digit declines in overall comparable-store sales with stronger growth in our lower-margin non-discretionary categories than in our higher-margin home and apparel categories. This sales performance will likely lead to a moderate decline in our gross margin rate because it is unlikely that we will be able to offset the impact of the adverse sales mix with rate improvements within categories. Even in light of continued strong expense control, we expect a moderate de-leveraging in our SG&A expense rate as a result of our expectation for soft comparable store sales. As a result, we expect to generate EBITDA and EBIT in our Retail Segment below last year's levels for the first half of the year. In our Credit Card Segment we expect net write-offs to stabilize in the range of $300 million in each of the first two quarters of 2009, levels which were anticipated in establishing the allowance for doubtful accounts at the end of fiscal 2008. We do not anticipate the need to add any meaningful reserves in the foreseeable future, especially in light of the high likelihood that we will experience modest decreases in gross receivables. Overall, we expect to generate moderate rates of profit in the Credit Card Segment in the first two quarters of 2009, though it is not likely to be as strong as the profits generated in the first two quarters of 2008. In light of the current environment, we are being very deliberate in the management and application of cash resources. This means that we have planned for fewer stores to open in 2009, particularly in our October cycle, than we would have in a more robust environment. Specifically, we expect to open about 75 stores in 2009, or about 60 stores net of rebuilds and relocations. Based on these store opening expectations, our base capital investment plan for 2009 envisions investing just over $2 billion, with the possibility that it might be as high as $2.5 billion if we were to see clear and measurable signs of improvement in the economy that lead us to approve incremental store openings in 2010 and beyond. We expect to again generate more than $4 billion in cash from operations in 2009, which, in light of our current suspension of substantially all share repurchase activity, would provide ample cash from internal sources to fund our projected capital investments, pay dividends on our common stock and fund the $1.3 billion of debt that is maturing in 2009, all without the need to access the term debt capital markets during the year. Our expectation is for earnings per share (diluted) in the first two quarters of 2009 to be well below 2008 levels, in line with our experience in the fourth quarter of 2008. Whether our performance will improve in the 22 Table of Contents last two quarters of 2009 will depend on the extent to which economic conditions improve, and in turn to what extent our Retail Segment sales improve, and to a lesser degree when, and to what extent, we begin to experience clear and measurable benefits of recent risk management efforts in the Credit Card Segment. Forward-Looking Statements This report contains forward-looking statements, which are based on our current assumptions and expectations. These statements are typically accompanied by the words ""expect,"" ""may,"" ""could,"" ""believe,"" ""would,"" ""might,"" ""anticipates,"" or words of similar import. The principal forward-looking statements in this report include: The expected earnings per share (diluted) for the first two quarters of 2009; for our Retail Segment, our outlook for sales trends, gross margin rates, SG&A expense rate, and EBITDA and EBIT; for our Credit Card Segment, our outlook for future write-offs of current receivables, profit, and the allowance for doubtful accounts; the expected cash generated from operations in 2009; our expected capital expenditures and the number of stores to be opened in 2009; the expected compliance with debt covenants; and the adequacy of our reserves for general liability, workers' compensation, property loss, team member medical and dental claims, workforce reduction costs, the expected outcome of claims and litigation and the resolution of tax uncertainties. All such forward-looking statements are intended to enjoy the protection of the safe harbor for forward-looking statements contained in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, as amended. Although we believe there is a reasonable basis for the forward-looking statements, our actual results could be materially different. The most important factors which could cause our actual results to differ from our forward-looking statements are set forth on our description of risk factors in Item 1A to this Form 10-K, which should be read in conjunction with the forward-looking statements in this report. Forward-looking statements speak only as of the date they are made, and we do not undertake any obligation to update any forward-looking statement. Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk Our exposure to market risk results primarily from interest rate changes on our debt obligations, some of which are at a LIBOR-plus floating rate, and on our credit card receivables, the majority of which are assessed finance charges at a prime-based floating rate. To manage our net interest margin, we generally maintain levels of floating-rate debt to generate similar changes in net interest expense as finance charge revenues fluctuate. Our degree of floating asset and liability matching may vary over time and vary in different interest rate environments. At January 31, 2009, our level of floating-rate credit card assets exceeded our level of net floating-rate debt obligations by approximately $1.3 billion. As a result, based on our balance sheet position at January 31, 2009, the annualized effect of a half percentage point decrease in floating interest rates on our floating rate debt obligations, net of our floating rate credit card assets and marketable securities, would be to decrease earnings before income taxes by approximately $7 million. See further description in Note 20. We record our general liability and workers' compensation liabilities at net present value; therefore, these liabilities fluctuate with changes in interest rates. Periodically and in certain interest rate environments, we economically hedge a portion of our exposure to these interest rate changes by entering into interest rate forward contracts that partially mitigate the effects of interest rate changes. Based on our balance sheet position at January 31, 2009, the annualized effect of a one percentage point decrease in interest rates would be to decrease earnings before income taxes by approximately $19 million. In addition, we are exposed to market return fluctuations on our qualified defined benefit pension plans. The annualized effect of a one percentage point decrease in the return on pension plan assets would decrease plan assets by $18 million at January 31, 2009. The resulting impact on net pension expense would be calculated consistent with the provisions of SFAS No. 87, ""Employers' Accounting for Pensions."" The value of our pension liabilities is inversely related to changes in interest rates. To protect against declines in interest rates we hold high-quality, long-duration bonds and interest rate swaps in our pension plan trust. At year end, we had hedged approximately 50 percent of the interest rate exposure of our funded status. As more fully described in Note 14 and Note 26, we are exposed to market returns on accumulated team member balances in our nonqualified, unfunded deferred compensation plans. We control our risk of offering the nonqualified plans by making investments in life insurance contracts and prepaid forward contracts on our own common stock that offset a substantial portion of our economic exposure to the returns on these plans. The annualized effect of a one percentage point change in market returns on our nonqualified defined contribution plans (inclusive of the effect of the investment vehicles used to manage our economic exposure) would not be significant. We do not have significant direct exposure to foreign currency rates as all of our stores are located in the United States, and the vast majority of imported merchandise is purchased in U.S. dollars. Overall, there have been no material changes in our primary risk exposures or management of market risks since the prior year. 23 Table of Contents",2023-12-30 21:32:50.452494
27419,TGT,TARGET CORP,2010,"Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Executive Summary Our 2009 financial results in both of our business segments were affected by the challenging economy in which we operated. In light of that environment, performance in our Retail Segment was remarkable, as the segment generated the highest EBIT in the Corporation's history, in a year when comparable-store sales declined 2.5 percent. In the Credit Card Segment, disciplined management led to a 29.4 percent increase in segment profit in a year when Target's average investment in the portfolio declined about 32 percent, representing a near-doubling of segment pretax return on invested capital. Cash flow provided by operations was $5,881 million, $4,430 million, and $4,125 million for 2009, 2008, and 2007, respectively. In 2009, we opened 76 new stores representing 58 stores net of 13 relocations and 5 closings. In 2008, we opened 114 new stores representing 91 stores net of 21 relocations and two closings. Management's Discussion and Analysis is based on our Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.

Sales Sales include merchandise sales, net of expected returns, from our stores and our online business, as well as gift card breakage. Refer to Note 2 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for a definition of gift card breakage. Total sales for the Retail Segment for 2009 were $63,435 million, compared with $62,884 million in 2008 and $61,471 million in 2007. All periods were 52-week years. Growth in total sales between 2009 and 2008 as well as between 2008 and 2007 resulted from sales from additional stores opened, offset by lower comparable-store sales. In 2009, deflation affected sales growth by approximately 13 Table of Contents 4 percentage points, compared with an inflationary impact of approximately 2 percentage points in 2008 and a deflationary impact of 2 percentage points in 2007.

Comparable-store sales is a measure that indicates the performance of our existing stores by measuring the growth in sales for such stores for a period over the comparable, prior-year period of equivalent length. The method of calculating comparable-store sales varies across the retail industry. As a result, our comparable-store sales calculation is not necessarily comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies. Comparable-store sales are sales from our online business and sales from general merchandise and SuperTarget stores open longer than one year, including: •sales from stores that have been remodeled or expanded while remaining open •sales from stores that have been relocated to new buildings of the same format within the same trade area, in which the new store opens at about the same time as the old store closes Comparable-store sales do not include: •sales from general merchandise stores that have been converted, or relocated within the same trade area, to a SuperTarget store format •sales from stores that were intentionally closed to be remodeled, expanded or reconstructed Comparable-Store Sales 2009 2008 2007 Comparable-store sales (2.5) % (2.9 )% 3.0 % Drivers of changes in comparable-store sales: Number of transactions (0.2) % (3.1 )% 0.3 % Average transaction amount (2.3) % 0.2 % 2.6 % Units per transaction (1.5) % (2.1 )% 1.1 % Selling price per unit (0.8) % 2.3 % 1.5 % The comparable-store sales increases or decreases above are calculated by comparing sales in fiscal year periods with comparable prior fiscal year periods of equivalent length. In fiscal 2009, the change in comparable-store sales was driven by a decline in the average transaction amount, primarily due to a decrease in the number of units per transaction. In 2008, the change in comparable-store sales was driven by a decline in the number of transactions, slightly offset by an increase in average transaction amount, which reflects the effect of a higher selling price per unit sold partially offset by a decrease in number of units per transaction. Transaction-level metrics are influenced by a broad array of macroeconomic, competitive and consumer behavioral factors, as well as sales mix, and comparable-store sales rates are negatively impacted by transfer of sales to new stores. Gross Margin Rate Gross margin rate represents gross margin (sales less cost of sales) as a percentage of sales. See Note 3 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for a description of expenses included in cost of sales. Markup is the difference between an item's cost and its retail price (expressed as a percentage of its retail price). Factors that affect markup include vendor offerings and negotiations, vendor income, sourcing strategies, market forces like raw material and freight costs, and competitive influences. Markdowns are the reduction in the original or previous price of retail merchandise. Factors that affect markdowns include inventory management, competitive influences and economic conditions. In 2009, our gross margin rate was 30.5 percent compared with 29.8 percent in 2008. Our 2009 gross margin rate benefitted from rate improvements within categories, partially offset by the mix impact of faster 14 Table of Contents sales growth in lower margin rate categories (generally product categories of household essentials and food). The impact of rate performance within merchandise categories on gross margin rate was an approximate 1.1 percentage point increase for 2009. This increase is the result of improved markups and reduced markdowns. The impact of sales mix on gross margin rate was an approximate 0.4 percentage point reduction. In 2008 our gross margin rate was 29.8 percent compared with 30.2 percent in 2007. Our 2008 gross margin rate was adversely affected by sales mix, which resulted in a 0.6 percentage point reduction in the gross margin rate. Sales in merchandise categories that yield lower gross margin rates outpaced sales in our higher margin apparel and home merchandise categories. This mix impact was partially offset by favorable supply chain expense rates, as well as higher gross margin rates within merchandise categories across our assortment, which had a combined impact on gross margin rate of an approximate 0.2 percentage point increase. Selling, General and Administrative Expense Rate Our selling, general and administrative (SG&A) expense rate represents SG&A expenses as a percentage of sales. See Note 3 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for a description of expenses included in SG&A expenses. SG&A expenses exclude depreciation and amortization, as well as expenses associated with our credit card operations, which are reflected separately in our Consolidated Statements of Operations. SG&A expense rate was 20.5 percent in 2009 compared with 20.4 percent in both 2008 and 2007. The change in the rate was primarily driven by an approximate 0.4 percentage point impact from an increase in incentive compensation due to better than expected 2009 performance compared with 2008 results. The rate increase was partially offset by an approximate 0.2 percentage point impact from sustained productivity gains in our stores. Within SG&A expenses in 2008 and 2007, there were no expense categories that experienced a significant fluctuation as a percentage of sales, when compared with prior periods. Depreciation and Amortization Expense Rate Our depreciation and amortization expense rate represents depreciation and amortization expense as a percentage of sales. In 2009, our depreciation and amortization expense rate was 3.2 percent compared with 2.9 percent in 2008 and 2.7 percent in 2007. The increase in the rate was primarily due to accelerated depreciation on assets that will be replaced as part of our 340-store 2010 remodel program. The comparative increase in 2008 was due to increased capital expenditures, specifically related to investments in new stores.

(b) As a percentage of average gross credit card receivables. (c) Spread to LIBOR is a metric used to analyze the performance of our total credit card portfolio because the majority of our portfolio earned finance charge revenue at rates tied to the Prime Rate, and the interest rate on all nonrecourse debt securitized by credit card receivables is tied to LIBOR. Our primary measure of segment profit in our Credit Card Segment is the EBIT generated by our total credit card receivables portfolio less the interest expense on nonrecourse debt collateralized by credit card receivables. We analyze this measure of profit in light of the amount of capital we have invested in our credit card receivables. In addition, we measure the performance of our overall credit card receivables portfolio by calculating the dollar Spread to LIBOR at the portfolio level. This metric approximates overall financial performance of the entire credit card portfolio we manage by measuring the difference between EBIT earned on the portfolio and a hypothetical benchmark rate financing cost applied to the entire portfolio. The interest rate on all nonrecourse debt securitized by credit card receivables is tied to LIBOR. For the first quarter of 2009, the vast majority of our portfolio accrued finance charge revenue at rates tied to the Prime Rate. Effective April 2009, we implemented a terms change to our portfolio that established a minimum annual percentage rate (APR) applied to cardholder account balances. Under these terms, finance charges accrue at a fixed APR if the benchmark Prime Rate is less than 6%; if the Prime Rate is greater than 6%, finance charges accrue at the benchmark Prime Rate, plus a spread. Because the Prime Rate was less than 6% during 2009, the majority of our portfolio accrued finance charges at a fixed APR subsequent to this terms change. As a result of regulatory actions that impact our portfolio, effective January 2010, we implemented a second terms change that converted the minimum APR for the majority of our accounts to a variable rate, and we eliminated penalty 16 Table of Contents pricing for all current, or nondelinquent accounts. Penalty pricing is the charging of a higher interest rate for a period of time, generally 12 months, and is triggered when a cardholder repeatedly fails to make timely payments. In 2009, Credit Card Segment profit increased to $201 million from $155 million as a result of improved portfolio performance (Spread to LIBOR) and significantly lower funding costs. The reduction in our investment in the portfolio combined with these results produced a strong improvement in segment ROIC. Segment revenues were $1,922 million, a decrease of $143 million, or 6.9 percent, from the prior year. The decrease in revenue was driven by a lower Prime Rate, lower average receivables, higher finance charge and late-fee write-offs and lower late fees due to fewer delinquent accounts offset by the positive impacts of the terms changes implemented in late 2008 and April 2009. Segment expenses were $1,624 million, a decrease of $118 million, or 6.8 percent, from prior year driven by lower bad debt and operations and marketing expenses, on both a dollar and rate basis. Segment interest expense benefited from a significantly lower LIBOR rate compared to the prior year. Segment profit and dollar Spread to LIBOR measures in 2008 were significantly impacted on both a rate and dollar basis by bad debt expense. Segment revenues were $2,064 million, an increase of $168 million, or 8.9 percent, from the prior year, driven by a 19.5 percent increase in average receivables. On a rate basis, revenue yield decreased 2.4 percentage points primarily due to a reduction in the Prime Rate index used to determine finance charge rates in the portfolio and lower external sales volume contributing to the decline in third party merchant fees. This negative pressure on revenue yield was offset modestly by the positive impact of terms changes implemented in 2008 that increased our effective yield. Segment expenses were $1,742 million, an increase of $776 million, or 80.3 percent, from the prior year driven by an increase in bad debt expense of $770 million. The increase in bad debt expense resulted from the increase in our incurred net write-off rate from 5.9 percent in 2007 to 9.3 percent in 2008 and the increase in the allowance for doubtful accounts of $440 million for anticipated future write-offs of current receivables. Segment profit decreased from 16.3 percent in 2007 to 3.7 percent in 2008 primarily due to the effect of bad debt expense, the reduction in receivables owned and funded by Target, and the impact of a lower Prime Rate during 2008.

Average gross credit card receivables in 2009 decreased 4.0 percent compared with 2008 levels. This change was driven by tighter risk management and underwriting initiatives that have significantly reduced available credit lines for higher-risk cardholders, fewer new accounts being opened, and a decrease in charge activity resulting from reductions in card usage by our guests, partially offset by the impact of a decline in payment rates. Our 2008 period-end gross credit card receivables were $9,094 million compared with $8,624 million in 2007, an increase of 5.4 percent. Average gross credit card receivables in 2008 increased 19.5 percent compared with 2007 levels. This growth was driven by the annualization of the prior year's product change from proprietary Target Cards to higher-limit Target Visa cards and the impact of industry-wide declines in payment rates, offset in part by a reduction in charge activity resulting from reductions in card usage by our guests, and from risk management and underwriting initiatives that significantly reduced credit lines for higher risk cardholders. Other Performance Factors Net Interest Expense Net interest expense was $801 million at the end of 2009, decreasing 7.5 percent, or $65 million from 2008. This decline was due to a decrease in the annualized average portfolio interest rate from 5.3 percent to 4.8 percent partially offset by a $16 million charge related to the early retirement of long-term debt. In 2008, net interest expense was $866 million compared with $647 million in 2007, an increase of 33.8 percent. This increase was due primarily to higher average debt balances supporting capital investment, share repurchase and the receivables portfolio, partially offset by a lower average portfolio net interest rate. Provision for Income Taxes Our effective income tax rate was 35.7 percent in 2009 and 37.4 percent in 2008. The decrease in the effective rate between periods is primarily due to nontaxable capital market returns on investments used to economically hedge the market risk in deferred compensation plans in 2009 compared with nondeductible losses in 2008. The 2009 effective income tax rate is also lower due to federal and state discrete items. Our effective income tax rate for 2008 was 37.4 percent compared with 38.4 percent in 2007. The decrease in 2008 was primarily due to tax reserve reductions resulting from audit settlements and the effective resolution of other issues. The 2008 effective income tax rate was also lower due to a comparatively greater proportion of earnings subject to rate differences between taxing jurisdictions. These rate declines were partially offset by lower capital market returns on investments used to economically hedge the market risk in deferred compensation plans. Gains and losses from these investments are not taxable. Analysis of Financial Condition Liquidity and Capital Resources Our 2009 operations were entirely funded by internally generated funds. Cash flow provided by operations was $5,881 in 2009 compared with $4,430 million in 2008. This strong cash flow allowed us to fund capital expenditures of $1,729 million and pay off $1.3 billion of maturing debt with internally generated funds. In addition we accelerated the payoff of a $550 million 2010 debt maturity, restarted our share repurchase program earlier than expected and experienced a $1.3 billion increase in marketable securities at January 30, 2010. Our 2009 period-end gross credit card receivables were $7,982 million compared with $9,094 million in 2008, a decrease of 12.2 percent. Average gross credit card receivables in 2009 decreased 4.0 percent compared with 2008 levels. This change was driven by the factors indicated in the Credit Card Segment above. This trend and the factors influencing it are likely to continue into 2010. Due to the decrease in gross credit card receivables, Target Receivables Corporation (TRC), using cash flows from the receivables, repaid an affiliate of JPMorgan Chase (JPMC) $163 million during 2009 under the terms of our agreement with them as described in Note 10 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. To the extent the receivables balance continues to decline, TRC expects to continue to pay JPMC a prorata portion of principal collections such that the portion owned by JPMC would not exceed 47 percent. 18 Table of Contents Year-end inventory levels increased $474 million, or 7.1 percent from 2008, primarily due to unusually low inventory levels at the end of 2008 in response to the challenging economic environment. Inventory levels were also higher to support traffic-driving strategic initiatives, such as food and pharmacy, in addition to comparatively higher retail square footage. Accounts payable increased by $174 million, or 2.7 percent over the same period. During 2009, we repurchased 9.9 million shares of our common stock for a total cash investment of $479 million ($48.54 per share) under a $10 billion share repurchase plan authorized by our Board of Directors in November 2007. In 2008, we repurchased 67.2 million shares of our common stock for a total cash investment of $3,395 million ($50.49 per share). We paid dividends totaling $496 million in 2009 and $465 million in 2008, an increase of 6.7 percent. We declared dividends totaling $503 million ($0.67 per share) in 2009, an increase of 6.8 percent over 2008. In 2008, we declared dividends totaling $471 million ($0.62 per share), an increase of 3.8 percent over 2007. We have paid dividends every quarter since our first dividend was declared following our 1967 initial public offering, and it is our intent to continue to do so in the future. Our financing strategy is to ensure liquidity and access to capital markets, to manage our net exposure to floating interest rate volatility, and to maintain a balanced spectrum of debt maturities. Within these parameters, we seek to minimize our borrowing costs. Maintaining strong investment-grade debt ratings is a key part of our financing strategy. Our current debt ratings are as follows: Debt Ratings Standard and Poor's Moody's Fitch Long-term debt A2 A+ A Commercial paper P-1 A-1 F1 Securitized receivables (a) Aa2 A+ n/a (a)These rated securitized receivables exclude the interest in our credit card receivables sold to JPMC. At January 30, 2010 and January 31, 2009, there were no amounts outstanding under our commercial paper program. In past years, we funded our peak sales season working capital needs through our commercial paper program and then used the cash generated from that sales season to repay the commercial paper issued. In 2009 we funded our working capital needs through internally generated funds. Additionally and as described in Note 10 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, during 2008 we sold to JPMC an interest in our credit card receivables for approximately $3.8 billion. We received proceeds of approximately $3.6 billion, reflecting a 7 percent discount. An additional source of liquidity is available to us through a committed $2 billion unsecured revolving credit facility obtained through a group of banks in April 2007, which will expire in April 2012. No balances were outstanding at any time during 2009 or 2008 under this facility. Most of our long-term debt obligations contain covenants related to secured debt levels. In addition to a secured debt level covenant, our credit facility also contains a debt leverage covenant. We are, and expect to remain, in compliance with these covenants. Additionally, at January 30, 2010, no notes or debentures contained provisions requiring acceleration of payment upon a debt rating downgrade, except that certain outstanding notes allow the note holders to put the notes to us if within a matter of months of each other we experience both (i) a change in control; and (ii) our long-term debt ratings are either reduced and the resulting rating is non-investment grade, or our long-term debt ratings are placed on watch for possible reduction and those ratings are subsequently reduced and the resulting rating is non-investment grade. Our interest coverage ratio represents the ratio of pretax earnings before fixed charges to fixed charges. Fixed charges include interest expense and the interest portion of rent expense. Our interest coverage ratio as calculated by the SEC's applicable rules was 5.1x in 2009, 4.3x in 2008, and 6.4x in 2007. Capital Expenditures Capital expenditures were $1,729 million in 2009 compared with $3,547 million in 2008 and $4,369 million in 2007. This decrease was driven by lower capital expenditures for new stores, remodels and technology-related assets. Our 2009 capital expenditures include $232 million related to stores that will open in 2010 and 19 Table of Contents later years. Net property and equipment decreased $475 million in 2009 following an increase of $1,661 million in 2008.

Excludes fair market value adjustments recorded in long-term debt, as required by derivative and hedging accounting rules. Principal amounts include the 47 percent interest in credit card receivables sold to JPMC at the principal amount. In the event of a decrease in the receivables principal balance, accelerated repayment of this obligation may occur.(b)These payments vary with LIBOR and are calculated assuming LIBOR of 0.25 percent plus a spread, for each year outstanding.(c)Total contractual lease payments include $2,016 million of operating lease payments related to options to extend the lease term that are reasonably assured of being exercised. These payments also include $196 million and $88 million of legally binding minimum lease payments for stores opening in 2010 or later for capital and operating leases, respectively. Capital lease obligations include interest. Refer to Note 21 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for a further description of leases.(d)Estimated tax contingencies of $579 million, including interest and penalties, are not included in the table above because we are not able to make reasonably reliable estimates of the period of cash settlement. Real estate obligations include commitments for the purchase, construction or remodeling of real estate and facilities. Purchase obligations include all legally binding contracts such as firm minimum commitments for inventory purchases, merchandise royalties, equipment purchases, marketing-related contracts, software acquisition/license commitments and service contracts. We issue inventory purchase orders in the normal course of business, which represent authorizations to purchase that are cancelable by their terms. We do not consider purchase orders to be firm inventory commitments; therefore, they are excluded from the table above. We also issue trade letters of credit in the ordinary course of business, which are excluded from this table as these obligations are conditional on the purchase order not being cancelled. If we choose to cancel a purchase order, we may be obligated to reimburse the vendor for unrecoverable outlays incurred prior to cancellation. We have not included obligations under our pension and postretirement health care benefit plans in the contractual obligations table above. Our historical practice regarding these plans has been to contribute amounts necessary to satisfy minimum pension funding requirements, plus periodic discretionary amounts determined to be appropriate. Further information on these plans, including our expected contributions for 2010, is included in Note 27 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. We do not have any arrangements or relationships with entities that are not consolidated into the financial statements that are reasonably likely to materially affect our liquidity or the availability of capital resources. 20 Table of Contents Critical Accounting Estimates Our analysis of operations and financial condition is based on our consolidated financial statements, prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP). Preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions affecting the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements, reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities. In the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, we describe the significant accounting policies used in preparing the consolidated financial statements. Our estimates are evaluated on an ongoing basis and are drawn from historical experience and other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results could differ under different assumptions or conditions. However we do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood that there will be a material change in future estimates or assumptions. Our senior management has discussed the development and selection of our critical accounting estimates with the Audit Committee of our Board of Directors. The following items in our consolidated financial statements require significant estimation or judgment: Inventory and cost of sales We use the retail inventory method to account for substantially our entire inventory and the related cost of sales. Under this method, inventory is stated at cost using the last-in, first-out (LIFO) method as determined by applying a cost-to-retail ratio to each merchandise grouping's ending retail value. Cost includes the purchase price as adjusted for vendor income. Since inventory value is adjusted regularly to reflect market conditions, our inventory methodology reflects the lower of cost or market. We reduce inventory for estimated losses related to shrink and markdowns. Our shrink estimate is based on historical losses verified by ongoing physical inventory counts. Historically our actual physical inventory count results have shown our estimates to be reliable. Markdowns designated for clearance activity are recorded when the salability of the merchandise has diminished. Inventory is at risk of obsolescence if economic conditions change. Relevant economic conditions include changing consumer demand, customer preferences, changing consumer credit markets or increasing competition. We believe these risks are largely mitigated because our inventory typically turns in less than three months. Inventory is further described in Note 11 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Vendor income receivable Cost of sales and SG&A expenses are partially offset by various forms of consideration received from our vendors. This ""vendor income"" is earned for a variety of vendor-sponsored programs, such as volume rebates, markdown allowances, promotions and advertising allowances, as well as for our compliance programs. We establish a receivable for the vendor income that is earned but not yet received. Based on the agreements in place, this receivable is computed by estimating when we have completed our performance and when the amount is earned. The majority of all year-end vendor income receivables are collected within the following fiscal quarter. Vendor income is described further in Note 4 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Allowance for doubtful accounts When receivables are recorded, we recognize an allowance for doubtful accounts in an amount equal to anticipated future write-offs. This allowance includes provisions for uncollectible finance charges and other credit-related fees. We estimate future write-offs based on historical experience of delinquencies, risk scores, aging trends and industry risk trends. Substantially all accounts continue to accrue finance charges until they are written off. Accounts are automatically written off when they become 180 days past due. Management believes the allowance for doubtful accounts is adequate to cover anticipated losses in our credit card accounts receivable under current conditions; however, unexpected, significant deterioration in any of the factors mentioned above or in general economic conditions could materially change these expectations. Credit card receivables are described in Note 10 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Analysis of long-lived and intangible assets for impairment We review assets at the lowest level for which there are identifiable cash flows, usually at the store level, on an annual basis or whenever an event or change in circumstances indicates the carrying value of the asset may not be recoverable. An impairment loss on a long-lived and identifiable intangible asset would be recognized when estimated undiscounted future cash flows from the operation and disposition of the asset are less than the asset carrying amount. Goodwill is tested for impairment by comparing its carrying value to a fair value estimated by discounting future cash flows. This test is performed at least annually or whenever an event or change in circumstances indicates the 21 Table of Contents carrying value of the asset may not be recoverable. Impairment on long-lived assets of $49 million in 2009, $2 million in 2008 and $7 million in 2007 were recorded as a result of the tests performed. Our estimates of future cash flows require us to make assumptions and to apply judgment, including forecasting future sales and expenses and estimating useful lives of the assets. These estimates can be affected by factors such as future store results, real estate values, and economic conditions that can be difficult to predict. Insurance/self-insurance We retain a substantial portion of the risk related to certain general liability, workers' compensation, property loss and team member medical and dental claims. However, we maintain stop-loss coverage to limit the exposure related to certain risks. Liabilities associated with these losses include estimates of both claims filed and losses incurred but not yet reported. We estimate our ultimate cost based on an analysis of historical data and actuarial estimates. General liability and workers' compensation liabilities are recorded at our estimate of their net present value; other liabilities referred to above are not discounted. We believe that the amounts accrued are adequate, although actual losses may differ from the amounts provided. Refer to Item 7A for further disclosure of the market risks associated with these exposures. Income taxes We pay income taxes based on the tax statutes, regulations and case law of the various jurisdictions in which we operate. Significant judgment is required in determining income tax provisions and in evaluating the ultimate resolution of tax matters in dispute with tax authorities. Historically, our assessments of the ultimate resolution of tax issues have been materially accurate. The current open tax issues are not dissimilar in size or substance from historical items. We believe the resolution of these matters will not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements. Income taxes are described further in Note 22 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Pension and postretirement health care accounting We fund and maintain a qualified defined benefit pension plan. We also maintain several smaller nonqualified plans and a postretirement health care plan for certain current and retired team members. The costs for these plans are determined based on actuarial calculations using the assumptions described in the following paragraphs. Eligibility for, and the level of, these benefits varies depending on team members' full-time or part-time status, date of hire and/or length of service. Our expected long-term rate of return on plan assets is determined by the portfolio composition, historical long-term investment performance and current market conditions. Benefits expense recorded during the year is partially dependent upon the long-term rate of return used, and a 0.1 percent decrease in the expected long-term rate of return used to determine net pension and postretirement health care benefits expense would increase annual expense by approximately $2 million. The discount rate used to determine benefit obligations is adjusted annually based on the interest rate for long-term high-quality corporate bonds as of the measurement date using yields for maturities that are in line with the duration of our pension liabilities. Historically, this same discount rate has also been used to determine net pension and postretirement health care benefits expense for the following plan year. The discount rates used to determine benefit obligations and benefits expense are included in Note 27 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Benefits expense recorded during the year is partially dependent upon the discount rates used, and a 0.1 percent decrease to the weighted average discount rate used to determine net pension and postretirement health care benefits expense would increase annual expense by approximately $4 million. Based on our experience, we use a graduated compensation growth schedule that assumes higher compensation growth for younger, shorter-service pension-eligible team members than it does for older, longer-service pension-eligible team members. Pension and postretirement health care benefits are further described in Note 27 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. New Accounting Pronouncements Future Adoptions In June 2009, the FASB issued SFAS No. 166, ""Accounting for Transfers of Financial Assets an amendment of FASB Statement No. 140"" (SFAS 166), codified in the Transfers and Servicing accounting principles, which amends the derecognition guidance in former FASB Statement No. 140 and eliminates the exemption from consolidation for qualifying special-purpose entities. This guidance will be effective for the 22 Table of Contents Corporation beginning in fiscal 2010 and adoption is not anticipated to affect our consolidated net earnings, cash flows or financial position. In June 2009, the FASB issued SFAS No. 167, ""Amendments to FASB Interpretation No. 46(R)"" (SFAS 167), codified in the Consolidation accounting principles, which amends the consolidation guidance applicable to variable interest entities. The amendments will significantly affect the overall consolidation analysis under former FASB Interpretation No. 46(R). This guidance will be effective for the Corporation beginning in fiscal 2010 and adoption is not anticipated to affect our consolidated net earnings, cash flows or financial position. Outlook In the Retail Segment, we expect to generate increases in comparable-store sales, likely in the range of 2 to 4 percent for the year, including an expected 1 percentage point lift from our remodel program. While our comparable-store sales comparisons are easier in the spring than the fall, the expected incremental sales resulting from remodels will grow as the year progresses. Additionally, we expect total sales to increase by a mid-single digit percentage. In 2010 we expect to generally preserve our 2009 EBIT margin rate in our Retail Segment, which if achieved would result in our Retail Segment EBIT increasing in line with total sales growth. In our Credit Card Segment, we expect the lower consumer usage of credit and our risk management strategies to continue throughout 2010, resulting in a low double-digit percentage decline in gross credit card receivables by the end of the year. We also expect to maintain segment profit on a dollar basis at generally the level earned in 2009, generating a higher pretax segment ROIC in 2010 than in 2009. We expect our 2010 book effective tax rate to approximate our long-term structural rate, likely in the range of 37.0 to 37.5 percent. We also expect to continue to execute against our share repurchase authorization. We expect our 2010 capital expenditures to be in the range of $2 to $2.5 billion, reflective of projects we will complete in 2010 as well as initial spending for our 2011 and 2012 new store programs. Our expectation is that our 2010 new store program will result in approximately 13 new stores and that our 2011 new store program will be in the range of 20 to 30 stores. Due to the early repayment of an August 2010 debt maturity, the only significant remaining 2010 maturity, prior to our seasonal working capital peak (which typically occurs in October or November), is the $900 million public series borrowing collateralized by our credit card receivables due in October. Forward-Looking Statements This report contains forward-looking statements, which are based on our current assumptions and expectations. These statements are typically accompanied by the words ""expect,"" ""may,"" ""could,"" ""believe,"" ""would,"" ""might,"" ""anticipates,"" or words of similar import. The principal forward looking statements in this report include: For our Retail Segment, our outlook for sales, expected merchandise returns, comparable-store sales trends and EBIT margin rates; for our Credit Card Segment, our outlook for year-end gross credit card receivables, portfolio size, future write-offs of current receivables, profit, ROIC, and the allowance for doubtful accounts; on a consolidated basis, the expected effective income tax rate, the continued execution of our share repurchase program, our expected capital expenditures and the number of stores to be opened in 2010 and 2011, the expected compliance with debt covenants, our intentions regarding future dividends, the anticipated impact of new accounting pronouncements, our expected future share-based compensation expense, our expected contributions and benefit payments related to our pension and postretirement health care plans, and the adequacy of our reserves for general liability, workers' compensation, property loss, and team member medical and dental, the expected outcome of claims and litigation, and the resolution of tax uncertainties. All such forward-looking statements are intended to enjoy the protection of the safe harbor for forward-looking statements contained in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, as amended. Although we believe there is a reasonable basis for the forward-looking statements, our actual results could be materially different. The most important factors which could cause our actual results to differ from our forward-looking statements are set forth on our description of risk factors in Item 1A to this Form 10-K, which should be read in conjunction with the forward-looking statements in this report. Forward-looking statements speak only as of the date they are made, and we do not undertake any obligation to update any forward-looking statement. 23 Table of Contents Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk Our exposure to market risk results primarily from interest rate changes on our debt obligations, some of which are at a LIBOR-plus floating rate, and on our credit card receivables, the majority of which are assessed finance charges at a Prime-based floating rate. To manage our net interest margin, we generally maintain levels of floating-rate debt to generate similar changes in net interest expense as finance charge revenues fluctuate. The degree of floating asset and liability matching may vary over time and in different interest rate environments. At January 30, 2010, the amount of floating-rate credit card assets exceeded the amount of net floating-rate debt obligations by approximately $1 billion. As a result, based on our balance sheet position at January 30, 2010, the annualized effect of a 0.1 percentage point decrease in floating interest rates on our floating rate debt obligations, net of our floating rate credit card assets and marketable securities, would be to decrease earnings before income taxes by approximately $1 million. See further description in Note 20 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. We record our general liability and workers' compensation liabilities at net present value; therefore, these liabilities fluctuate with changes in interest rates. Periodically, in certain interest rate environments, we economically hedge a portion of our exposure to these interest rate changes by entering into interest rate forward contracts that partially mitigate the effects of interest rate changes. Based on our balance sheet position at January 30, 2010, the annualized effect of a 0.5 percentage point decrease in interest rates would be to decrease earnings before income taxes by approximately $9 million. In addition, we are exposed to market return fluctuations on our qualified defined benefit pension plans. The annualized effect of a one percentage point decrease in the return on pension plan assets would decrease plan assets by $22 million at January 30, 2010. The value of our pension liabilities is inversely related to changes in interest rates. To protect against declines in interest rates we hold high-quality, long-duration bonds and interest rate swaps in our pension plan trust. At year end, we had hedged approximately 50 percent of the interest rate exposure of our funded status. As more fully described in Note 14 and Note 26 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, we are exposed to market returns on accumulated team member balances in our nonqualified, unfunded deferred compensation plans. We control the risk of offering the nonqualified plans by making investments in life insurance contracts and prepaid forward contracts on our own common stock that offset a substantial portion of our economic exposure to the returns on these plans. The annualized effect of a one percentage point change in market returns on our nonqualified defined contribution plans (inclusive of the effect of the investment vehicles used to manage our economic exposure) would not be significant. We do not have significant direct exposure to foreign currency rates as all of our stores are located in the United States, and the vast majority of imported merchandise is purchased in U.S. dollars. Overall, there have been no material changes in our primary risk exposures or management of market risks since the prior year. 24 Table of Contents",2023-12-30 21:32:52.719201
27419,TGT,TARGET CORP,2011,"Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Executive Summary Our 2010 Retail Segment sales increased 3.7 percent over last year due to a 2.1 percent comparable-store increase combined with the contribution from new stores. Our Retail Segment EBITDA and EBIT increased 4.9 percent and 5.8 percent, respectively, compared with the prior year. In the Credit Card Segment, we achieved a significant increase in segment profit primarily due to declining bad debt expense driven by improved trends in key measures of risk. Cash flow provided by operations was $5,271 million, $5,881 million and $4,430 million for 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively. We opened 13 new stores and 76 new stores in 2010 and 2009, respectively. In 2010 we remodeled 341 stores, significantly more than the 67 stores we remodeled in 2009. Additionally, during 2010 and 2009 we repurchased 47.8 million and 9.9 million shares of our common stock for a total cash investment of $2,508 million ($52.44 per share) and $479 million ($48.54 per share), respectively. In January 2011, we entered into an agreement to purchase the leasehold interests in up to 220 sites in Canada currently operated by Zellers Inc., in exchange for C$1,825 million (Canadian dollars), due in two payments, one in May 2011 and one in September 2011. We believe this transaction will allow us to open 100 to 150 Target stores in Canada, primarily during 2013. We expect that renovation of these stores will require an investment of over C$1 billion, a portion of which may be funded by landlords. At January 29, 2011 the value of C$1.00 approximated the value of $1.00. Additionally, in January 2011, we announced our plan to actively pursue the sale of our credit card receivables portfolio. As of January 29, 2011 the gross balance of our credit card receivables portfolio was $6,843 million, of which $3,954 million was funded by third parties and $2,889 million was funded by Target. Refer to Note 10 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further description of historical financing transactions related to our credit card receivables. Management's Discussion and Analysis is based on our Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data. 14 Table of Contents Analysis of Results of Operations Retail Segment Percent Change Retail Segment Results (millions) 2010 2009 2008 2010/2009 2009/2008 Sales $ 65,786 $ 63,435 $ 62,884 3.7 % 0.9 % Cost of sales 45,725 44,062 44,157 3.8 (0.2 ) Gross margin 20,061 19,373 18,727 3.5 3.5 SG&A expenses (a) 13,367 12,989 12,838 2.9 1.2 EBITDA 6,694 6,384 5,889 4.9 8.4 Depreciation and amortization 2,065 2,008 1,808 2.8 11.0 EBIT $ 4,629 $ 4,376 $ 4,081 5.8 % 7.3 % EBITDA is earnings before interest expense, income taxes, depreciation and amortization.

Effective with the October 2010 nationwide launch of our new 5% REDcard Rewards loyalty program, we changed the formula under which our Credit Card segment reimburses our Retail Segment to better align with the attributes of the new program. These reimbursed amounts were $102 million in 2010, $89 million in 2009 and $117 million in 2008. In all periods these amounts were recorded as reductions to SG&A expenses within the Retail Segment and increases to operations and marketing expenses within the Credit Card Segment.

Sales Sales include merchandise sales, net of expected returns, from our stores and our online business, as well as gift card breakage. Refer to Note 2 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for a definition of gift card breakage. Total sales for the Retail Segment for 2010 were $65,786 million, compared with $63,435 million in 2009 and $62,884 million in 2008. All periods were 52-week years. Growth in total sales between 2010 and 2009 resulted from higher comparable-store sales and additional stores opened, whereas between 2009 and 2008, growth in total sales resulted from sales from additional stores opened, partially offset by lower comparable-store sales. In 2010, deflation affected sales growth by approximately 0.2 percentage points, compared with a deflationary impact of approximately 3.6 percentage points in 2009 and an inflationary impact of 2.2 percentage points in 2008.

The method of calculating comparable-store sales varies across the retail industry. As a result, our comparable-store sales calculation is not necessarily comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies. Comparable-store sales are sales from our online business and stores open longer than one year, including: •sales from stores that have been remodeled or expanded while remaining open •sales from stores that have been relocated to new buildings of the same format within the same trade area, in which the new store opens at about the same time as the old store closes Comparable-store sales do not include: •sales from general merchandise stores that have been converted, or relocated within the same trade area, to a SuperTarget store format •sales from stores that were intentionally closed to be remodeled, expanded or reconstructed Comparable-Store Sales 2010 2009 2008 Comparable-store sales change 2.1 % (2.5)% (2.9) % Drivers of changes in comparable-store sales: Number of transactions 2.0 % (0.2)% (3.1) % Average transaction amount 0.1 % (2.3)% 0.2 % Units per transaction 2.5 % (1.5)% (2.1) % Selling price per unit (2.3) % (0.8)% 2.3 % The comparable-store sales increases or decreases above are calculated by comparing sales in fiscal year periods with comparable prior fiscal year periods of equivalent length. In 2010, the change in comparable-store sales was driven by an increase in the number of transactions and a slight increase in the average transaction amount, reflecting an increase in units per transaction largely offset by a decrease in selling price per unit. In 2009, the change in comparable-store sales was driven by a decline in the average transaction amount, primarily due to a decrease in the number of units per transaction, as well as a slight decrease in the number of transactions. The collective interaction of a broad array of macroeconomic, competitive and consumer behavioral factors, as well as sales mix, and transfer of sales to new stores makes further analysis of sales metrics infeasible. Beginning April 2010, all new qualified credit card applicants receive the Target Card, and we no longer issue the Target Visa to credit card applicants. Existing Target Visa cardholders are not affected. Beginning October 2010, guests receive a 5 percent discount on virtually all purchases at checkout every day when they use a REDcard at any Target store or on Target.com. We monitor the percentage of store sales that are paid for using REDcards (REDcard Penetration), because our internal analysis has indicated that a meaningful portion of the incremental purchases on our REDcards are also incremental sales for Target, with the remainder of the incremental purchases on the REDcards representing a shift in tender type. REDcard Penetration 2010 2009 2008 Target credit penetration 5.2 % 5.2 % 6.2 % Target debit penetration 0.7 % 0.4 % 0.3 % Total store REDcard penetration 5.9 % 5.6 % 6.5 % Since launching our new 5% REDcard Rewards program in October 2010, we have experienced an increase in REDcard penetration. REDcard penetration for the fourth quarter of 2010 was 7.4 percent compared to 5.6 percent in the fourth quarter of 2009. Gross Margin Rate Gross margin rate represents gross margin (sales less cost of sales) as a percentage of sales. See Note 3 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for a description of costs included in cost of sales. Markup is the 16 Table of Contents difference between an item's cost and its retail price (expressed as a percentage of its retail price). Factors that affect markup include vendor offerings and negotiations, vendor income, sourcing strategies, market forces like raw material and freight costs, and competitive influences. Markdowns are the reduction in the original or previous price of retail merchandise. Factors that affect markdowns include inventory management, competitive influences and economic conditions. Our gross margin rate was 30.5 percent in 2010, unchanged from prior year, as margin rates within categories were generally stable and the impact of sales mix was essentially neutral. There were no other significant variances in the drivers of gross margin rate. Our gross margin rate was 30.5 percent in 2009, compared with 29.8 percent in 2008. Our 2009 gross margin rate benefitted from rate improvements within categories, partially offset by the mix impact of faster sales growth in lower margin rate categories (generally product categories of household essentials and food). The impact of rate performance within merchandise categories on gross margin rate was an approximate 1.1 percentage point increase for 2009. This increase is the result of improved markups and reduced markdowns. The impact of sales mix on gross margin rate was an approximate 0.4 percentage point reduction. Selling, General and Administrative Expense Rate Our selling, general and administrative (SG&A) expense rate represents SG&A expenses as a percentage of sales. See Note 3 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for a description of costs included in SG&A expenses. SG&A expenses exclude depreciation and amortization, as well as expenses associated with our credit card operations, which are reflected separately in our Consolidated Statements of Operations. SG&A expense rate was 20.3 percent in 2010 compared with 20.5 percent in 2009 and 20.4 percent in 2008. The change in the rate in 2010 was primarily due to favorable leverage of overall compensation expenses. The change in the SG&A expense rate in 2009 was primarily driven by an approximate 0.4 percentage point impact from an increase in incentive compensation due to better than expected 2009 performance compared with 2008 results, which was partially offset by an approximate 0.2 percentage point impact from sustained productivity gains in our stores. Depreciation and Amortization Expense Rate Our depreciation and amortization expense rate represents depreciation and amortization expense as a percentage of sales. In 2010, our depreciation and amortization expense rate was 3.1 percent compared with 3.2 percent in 2009 and 2.9 percent in 2008. The rate was essentially unchanged from the same period last year. In 2009 the increase in the rate was primarily due to accelerated depreciation on assets that were replaced as part of our remodel program.

Our credit card program supports our core retail operations and remains an important contributor to our overall profitability and engagement with our guests. Beginning April 2010, all new qualified credit card applicants receive the Target Card, and we no longer issue the Target Visa to credit card applicants. Existing Target Visa cardholders are not affected. Beginning October 2010, guests receive a 5 percent discount on virtually all purchases at checkout every day when they use a REDcard at any Target store or on Target.com. This new REDcard Rewards program replaced the existing rewards program in which account holders received an initial 10 percent-off coupon for opening the account and earned points toward a 10 percent-off coupon on subsequent purchases. These changes are intended to simplify the program and to generate profitable incremental retail sales. Credit card revenues are comprised of finance charges, late fees and other revenue, and third party merchant fees, or the amounts received from merchants who accept the Target Visa credit card. Credit Card Segment Results (dollars in millions) 2010 2009 2008 Amount Rate (d) Amount Rate (d) Amount Rate (d) Finance charge revenue $ 1,302 18.3 % $ 1,450 17.4 % $ 1,451 16.7 % Late fees and other revenue 197 2.8 349 4.2 461 5.3 Third party merchant fees 105 1.5 123 1.5 152 1.7 Total revenues 1,604 22.6 1,922 23.0 2,064 23.7 Bad debt expense 528 7.4 1,185 14.2 1,251 14.4 Operations and marketing expenses (a) 433 6.1 425 5.1 474 5.4 Depreciation and amortization 19 0.3 14 0.2 17 0.2 Total expenses 980 13.8 1,624 19.4 1,742 20.0 EBIT 624 8.8 298 3.5 322 3.7 Interest expense on nonrecourse debt collateralized by credit card receivables 83 97 167 Segment profit $ 541 $ 201 $ 155 Average receivables funded by Target (b) $ 2,771 $ 2,866 $ 4,192 Segment pretax ROIC (c) 19.5 % 7.0 % 3.7 % (a) Loyalty Program discounts are recorded as reductions to sales in our Retail Segment. Effective with the October 2010 nationwide launch of our new 5% REDcard Rewards loyalty program, we changed the formula under which our Credit Card segment reimburses our Retail Segment to better align with the attributes of the new program. These reimbursed amounts were $102 million in 2010, $89 million in 2009 and $117 million in 2008. In all periods these amounts were recorded as reductions to SG&A expenses within the Retail Segment and increases to operations and marketing expenses within the Credit Card Segment. (b) Amounts represent the portion of average gross credit card receivables funded by Target. For 2010, 2009 and 2008, these amounts exclude $4,335 million, $5,484 million and $4,503 million, respectively, of receivables funded by nonrecourse debt collateralized by credit card receivables. (c) ROIC is return on invested capital, and this rate equals our segment profit divided by average gross credit card receivables funded by Target, expressed as an annualized rate. (d) As an annualized percentage of average gross credit card receivables. 18 Table of Contents Spread Analysis – Total Portfolio (dollars in millions) 2010 2009 2008 Amount Rate Amount Rate Amount Rate EBIT $ 624 8.8 % (c) $ 298 3.5 % (c) $ 322 3.7 % (c) LIBOR (a) 0.3 % 0.3 % 2.3 % Spread to LIBOR (b) $ 604 8.5 % (c) $ 270 3.2 % (c) $ 118 1.4 % (c) (a) Balance-weighted one-month LIBOR. (b) Spread to LIBOR is a metric used to analyze the performance of our total credit card portfolio because the majority of our portfolio earned finance charge revenue at rates tied to the Prime Rate, and the interest rate on all nonrecourse debt securitized by credit card receivables is tied to LIBOR. (c) As a percentage of average gross credit card receivables. Our primary measure of segment profit in our Credit Card Segment is the EBIT generated by our total credit card receivables portfolio less the interest expense on nonrecourse debt collateralized by credit card receivables. We analyze this measure of profit in light of the amount of capital we have invested in our credit card receivables. In addition, we measure the performance of our overall credit card receivables portfolio by calculating the dollar Spread to LIBOR at the portfolio level. This metric approximates overall financial performance of the entire credit card portfolio we manage by measuring the difference between EBIT earned on the portfolio and a hypothetical benchmark rate financing cost applied to the entire portfolio. The interest rate on all nonrecourse debt securitized by credit card receivables is tied to LIBOR. Effective April 2009, we implemented a terms change to our portfolio that established a minimum annual percentage rate (APR) applied to cardholder account balances. Under these terms, finance charges accrue at a fixed APR if the benchmark Prime Rate is less than 6%; if the Prime Rate is greater than 6%, finance charges accrue at the benchmark Prime Rate, plus a spread. Because the Prime Rate was less than 6% during 2009, the majority of our portfolio accrued finance charges at a fixed APR subsequent to this terms change. As a result of regulatory actions that impact our portfolio, effective January 2010, we implemented a second terms change that converted the minimum APR for the majority of our accounts to a variable rate, and we eliminated penalty pricing for all current, or nondelinquent accounts. Penalty pricing is the charging of a higher interest rate for a period of time, generally 12 months, and is triggered when a cardholder repeatedly fails to make timely payments. Additionally, beginning in August 2010 late fee limitations went into effect that resulted in reduced late fee revenue. In 2010, Credit Card Segment profit increased to $541 million from $201 million, driven mostly by favorability in bad debt expense. The reduction in our investment in the portfolio combined with these results produced a strong improvement in segment ROIC. Segment revenues were $1,604 million, a decrease of $318 million, or 16.5 percent, from the prior year, which was primarily driven by lower average receivables as well as reduced late fees. Segment expenses were $980 million, a decrease of $644 million, or 39.7 percent, from prior year driven primarily by lower bad debt expense due to lower actual and expected write-offs. Segment interest expense on nonrecourse debt declined due to a decrease in nonrecourse debt securitized by credit card receivables. In 2009, Credit Card Segment profit increased to $201 million from $155 million as a result of improved portfolio performance (Spread to LIBOR) and significantly lower funding costs. The reduction in our investment in the portfolio combined with these results produced a strong improvement in segment ROIC. Segment revenues were $1,922 million, a decrease of $143 million, or 6.9 percent, from the prior year. The decrease in revenue was driven by a lower Prime Rate, lower average receivables, higher finance charge and late-fee write-offs, and lower late fees due to fewer delinquent accounts offset by the positive impacts of the terms changes implemented in late 2008 and April 2009. Segment expenses were $1,624 million, a decrease of $118 million, or 6.8 percent, from prior year driven by lower bad debt and operations and marketing expenses, on both a dollar and rate basis. Segment interest expense benefited from a significantly lower LIBOR rate compared to the prior year. 19 Table of Contents Receivables Rollforward Analysis Percent Change (millions) 2010 2009 2008 2010/2009 2009/2008 Beginning gross credit card receivables $ 7,982 $ 9,094 $ 8,624 (12.2 )% 5.4 % Charges at Target 3,699 3,553 4,207 4.1 (15.5 ) Charges at third parties 5,815 6,763 8,542 (14.0 ) (20.8 ) Payments (11,283 ) (12,065 ) (13,482 ) (6.5 ) (10.5 ) Other 630 637 1,203 (1.1 ) (47.1 ) Period-end gross credit card receivables $ 6,843 $ 7,982 $ 9,094 (14.3 )% (12.2 )% Average gross credit card receivables $ 7,106 $ 8,351 $ 8,695 (14.9 )% (4.0 )% Accounts with three or more payments (60+ days) past due as a percentage of period-end credit card receivables 4.2 % 6.3 % 6.1 % Accounts with four or more payments (90+ days) past due as a percentage of period-end gross credit card receivables 3.1 % 4.7 % 4.3 % Allowance for Doubtful Accounts Percent Change (millions) 2010 2009 2008 2010/2009 2009/2008 Allowance at beginning of period $ 1,016 $ 1,010 $ 570 0.6 % 77.1 % Bad debt expense 528 1,185 1,251 (55.4 ) (5.3 ) Write-offs (a) (1,007 ) (1,287 ) (912 ) (21.8 ) 41.1 Recoveries (a) 153 108 101 40.2 8.3 Allowance at end of period $ 690 $ 1,016 $ 1,010 (32.1 )% 0.6 % As a percentage of period-end gross credit card receivables 10.1 % 12.7 % 11.1 % Net write-offs as a percentage of average gross credit card receivables (annualized) 12.0 % 14.1 % 9.3 % (a) Write-offs include the principal amount of losses (excluding accrued and unpaid finance charges), and recoveries include current period principal collections on previously written-off balances. These amounts combined represent net write-offs. Our 2010 period-end gross credit card receivables were $6,843 million compared to $7,982 million in 2009, a decrease of 14.3 percent. Average gross credit card receivables in 2010 decreased 14.9 percent compared with 2009 levels. In response to regulatory changes and credit card industry trends, we have undertaken risk management and underwriting initiatives that have reduced available credit lines for higher-risk cardholders. Additionally, we have experienced an increase in payment rates and a decrease in charges at third-parties. Our 2009 period-end gross credit card receivables were $7,982 million compared with $9,094 million in 2008, a decrease of 12.2 percent. Average gross credit card receivables in 2009 decreased 4.0 percent compared with 2008 levels. This change was driven by the tighter risk management and underwriting initiatives described above, fewer new accounts being opened, and a decrease in charge activity resulting from reductions in card usage by our guests, partially offset by the impact of lower payment rates. Other Performance Factors Net Interest Expense Net interest expense, which includes the interest expense on nonrecourse debt collateralized by credit card receivables detailed in the Credit Card Segment Results above, was $757 million for 2010, decreasing 5.5 percent, or $44 million from 2009 due to lower average debt balances and a $16 million charge related to the early retirement of long-term debt in 2009, partially offset by a higher average portfolio interest rate of 5.3 percent in 2010, compared with 4.8 percent in 2009. In 2009, net interest expense was $801 million, decreasing 7.5 percent, or $65 million from 2008. This decline was due to a lower average portfolio interest rate of 4.8 percent in 2009, compared with 5.3 percent in 2008, partially offset by a $16 million charge related to the early retirement of long-term debt. 20 Table of Contents Provision for Income Taxes Our effective income tax rate was 35.1 percent in 2010 and 35.7 percent in 2009. The decrease in the effective rate between periods is primarily due to the favorable resolution of various income tax matters, which reduced income tax expense by approximately $100 million. Our effective income tax rate was 35.7 percent in 2009 and 37.4 percent in 2008. The decrease in the effective rate between periods is primarily due to nontaxable capital market returns on investments used to economically hedge the market risk in deferred compensation plans in 2009, compared with nondeductible losses in 2008. The 2009 effective income tax rate is also lower due to federal and state discrete items. Analysis of Financial Condition Liquidity and Capital Resources Our period end cash and cash equivalents balance was $1,712 million compared with $2,200 million in 2009. Marketable securities of $1,129 million and $1,617 million were included in cash and cash equivalents at the end of 2010 and 2009, respectively. Our investment policy is designed to preserve principal and liquidity of our marketable securities. This policy allows investments in large money market funds or in highly rated direct short-term instruments that mature in 60 days or less. We also place certain limitations on the aggregate dollars invested and percentage of total fund value held when making short-term investment decisions. Our 2010 operations were funded by both internally and externally generated funds. Cash flow provided by operations was $5,271 million in 2010 compared with $5,881 million in 2009. This cash flow, combined with our prior year-end cash position and the debt issuance described below, allowed us to fund capital expenditures of $2,129 million and pay off $2,259 million of debt. In addition, in 2010 we increased our share repurchases and raised dividends paid to our shareholders. Our 2010 period-end gross credit card receivables were $6,843 million compared with $7,982 million in 2009, a decrease of 14.3 percent. Average gross credit card receivables in 2010 decreased 14.9 percent compared with 2009 levels. This change was driven by the factors indicated in the Credit Card Segment above. This trend and the factors influencing it are likely to continue into 2011. Due to the decrease in gross credit card receivables, Target Receivables LLC (TR LLC), formerly known as Target Receivables Corporation (TRC), using cash flows from the receivables, repaid an affiliate of JPMorgan Chase (JPMC) $566 million and $163 million during 2010 and 2009, respectively, under the terms of our agreement with them as described in Note 10 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. To the extent the receivables balance continues to decline, TR LLC expects to continue to pay JPMC a prorata portion of principal collections such that the portion owned by JPMC would not exceed 47 percent. Year-end inventory levels increased $417 million, or 5.8 percent from 2009. Inventory levels were higher to support traffic-driving strategic initiatives, such as our expanded food assortment in general merchandise stores and pharmacy, in addition to comparatively higher retail square footage. Accounts payable increased by $115 million, or 1.8 percent over the same period. During 2010, we repurchased 47.8 million shares of our common stock for a total cash investment of $2,508 million ($52.44 per share) under a $10 billion share repurchase plan authorized by our Board of Directors in November 2007. In 2009, we repurchased 9.9 million shares of our common stock for a total cash investment of $479 million ($48.54 per share). We paid dividends totaling $609 million in 2010 and $496 million in 2009, an increase of 22.7 percent. We declared dividends totaling $659 million ($0.92 per share) in 2010, an increase of 31.1 percent over 2009. In 2009, we declared dividends totaling $503 million ($0.67 per share), an increase of 6.8 percent over 2008. We have paid dividends every quarter since our first dividend was declared following our 1967 initial public offering, and it is our intent to continue to do so in the future. Our financing strategy is to ensure liquidity and access to capital markets, to manage our net exposure to floating interest rate volatility, and to maintain a balanced spectrum of debt maturities. Within these parameters, we seek to minimize our borrowing costs. As described in Note 19, in July 2010, we issued $1 billion of long-term debt at 3.875% that matures in July 2020. There were no amounts issued in 2009. 21 Table of Contents Our ability to access the long-term debt, commercial paper and securitized debt markets has provided ample sources of liquidity to Target in the past. Our continued access to these markets depends on multiple factors including the economic environment, our operating performance and maintaining strong debt ratings. The ratings assigned to our debt by the credit rating agencies affect both the pricing and terms of any new financing. As of January 29, 2011 our credit ratings were as follows: Credit Ratings Standard and Poor's Moody's Fitch Long-term debt A2 A+ A Commercial paper P-1 A-1 F1 Securitized receivables (a) Aa2 n/a n/a (a) These rated securitized receivables exclude the interest in our credit card receivables sold to JPMC. If our credit ratings were lowered, our ability to access the debt markets and our cost of funds for new debt issuances could be adversely impacted. Each of the credit rating agencies reviews its rating periodically and there is no guarantee our current credit rating will remain the same as described above. As a measure of our financial condition we monitor our interest coverage ratio, representing the ratio of pretax earnings before fixed charges to fixed charges. Fixed charges include interest expense and the interest portion of rent expense. Our interest coverage ratio as calculated by the SEC's applicable rules was 6.1x in 2010, 5.1x in 2009 and 4.3x in 2008. At January 29, 2011 and January 30, 2010, there were no amounts outstanding under our commercial paper program. In past years, we funded our peak sales season working capital needs through our commercial paper program and then used the cash generated from that sales season to repay the commercial paper issued. In 2010 and 2009 we funded our working capital needs through internally generated funds and the long-term debt issuance indicated above. Commercial Paper (millions) 2010 2009 Maximum daily amount outstanding during the year $ — $ 112 Average amount outstanding during the year — 1 Amount outstanding at year-end — — Weighted average interest rate — 0.2 % An additional source of liquidity is available to us through a committed $2 billion unsecured revolving credit facility obtained through a group of banks in April 2007, which will expire in April 2012. No balances were outstanding at any time during 2010 or 2009 under this facility. Most of our long-term debt obligations contain covenants related to secured debt levels. In addition to a secured debt level covenant, our credit facility also contains a debt leverage covenant. We are, and expect to remain, in compliance with these covenants. Additionally, at January 29, 2011, no notes or debentures contained provisions requiring acceleration of payment upon a debt rating downgrade, except that certain outstanding notes allow the note holders to put the notes to us if within a matter of months of each other we experience both (i) a change in control; and (ii) our long-term debt ratings are either reduced and the resulting rating is non-investment grade, or our long-term debt ratings are placed on watch for possible reduction and those ratings are subsequently reduced and the resulting rating is non-investment grade. We believe our sources of liquidity will be adequate to maintain operations and to finance anticipated expansion and strategic initiatives during 2011, including our plan to enter the Canadian retail market by paying C$1,825 million to purchase the leasehold interests in up to 220 sites currently operated by Zellers Inc. We may issue new long-term debt for these and other initiatives, and we anticipate ample access to long-term financing. Further, in January 2011, we announced our plan to actively pursue the sale of our credit card receivables portfolio, which may provide additional funding. As of January 29, 2011 the gross balance of our credit card receivables 22 Table of Contents portfolio was $6,843 million, of which $3,954 million was funded by third parties and $2,889 million was funded by Target. Capital Expenditures Capital expenditures were $2,129 million in 2010 compared with $1,729 million in 2009 and $3,547 million in 2008. This increase was driven by higher capital expenditures for remodels partially offset by reduced expenditures for new stores. Our 2010 capital expenditures include $482 million related to stores that will open in 2011 and later years. Net property and equipment increased $213 million in 2010 following a decrease of $475 million in 2009. Capital Expenditures (millions) 2010 2009 2008 New stores $ 574 $ 899 $ 2,341 Remodels and expansions 966 294 284 Information technology, distribution and other 589 536 922 Total $ 2,129 $ 1,729 $ 3,547 In connection with the previously described agreement to purchase leasehold interests in Canada, we expect that renovation of these stores will require an investment of over C$1 billion, primarily during 2012 and 2013, a portion of which may be funded by landlords. 23 Table of Contents Commitments and Contingencies At January 29, 2011, our contractual obligations were as follows: Payments Due by Period Contractual Obligations (millions) Total Less than 1 Year 1-3 Years 3-5 Years After 5 Years Recorded Contractual Obligations: Long-term debt (a) Unsecured $ 11,287 $ 106 $ 2,002 $ 28 $ 9,151 Nonrecourse 4,061 — 4,061 — — Capital lease obligations (b) 617 32 66 62 457 Real estate liabilities (c) 65 65 — — — Deferred compensation (d) 440 44 96 106 194 Tax contingencies (e) — — — — — Unrecorded Contractual Obligations: Interest payments – long-term debt Unsecured 10,080 678 1,214 1,127 7,061 Nonrecourse (f) 101 32 69 — — Operating leases (b) 3,954 190 376 288 3,100 Real estate obligations (g) 243 209 34 — — Purchase obligations (h) 1,907 713 747 348 99 Payment for Canadian leasehold interests (i) 1,825 1,825 — — — Future contributions to retirement plans (j) — — — — — Contractual obligations $ 34,580 $ 3,894 $ 8,665 $ 1,959 $ 20,062 (a) Required principal payments only. Excludes fair market value adjustments recorded in long-term debt, as required by derivative and hedging accounting rules. Principal includes the 47 percent interest in credit card receivables sold to JPMC at the principal amount. In the event of a decrease in the receivables principal balance, accelerated repayment of this obligation may occur. (b) Total contractual lease payments include $1,949 million of operating lease payments related to options to extend the lease term that are reasonably assured of being exercised. These payments also include $28 million and $241 million of legally binding minimum lease payments for stores opening in 2011 or later for capital and operating leases, respectively. Capital lease obligations include interest. (c) Real estate liabilities include costs incurred but not paid related to the construction or remodeling of real estate and facilities. (d) Deferred compensation obligations include commitments related to our nonqualified deferred compensation plans. The timing of deferred compensation payouts is estimated based on payments currently made to former employees and retirees, forecasted investment returns, and the projected timing of future retirements. (e) Estimated tax contingencies of $397 million, including interest and penalties, are not included in the table above because we are not able to make reasonably reliable estimates of the period of cash settlement. (f) These payments vary with LIBOR and are calculated assuming LIBOR of 0.25 percent plus a spread, for each year outstanding. (g) Real estate obligations include commitments for the purchase, construction or remodeling of real estate and facilities. (h) Purchase obligations include all legally binding contracts such as firm minimum commitments for inventory purchases, merchandise royalties, equipment purchases, marketing related contracts, software acquisition/license commitments and service contracts. We issue inventory purchase orders in the normal course of business, which represent authorizations to purchase that are cancelable by their terms. We do not consider purchase orders to be firm inventory commitments; therefore, they are excluded from the table above. If we choose to cancel a purchase order, we may be obligated to reimburse the vendor for unrecoverable outlays incurred prior to cancellation. We also issue trade letters of credit in the ordinary course of business, which are excluded from this table as these obligations are conditioned on terms of the letter of credit being met. (i) In January 2011, we entered into an agreement to purchase the leasehold interests in up to 220 sites in Canada currently operated by Zellers Inc., in exchange for C$1,825 million. At January 29, 2011 the value of C$1.00 approximated the value of $1.00. This commitment does not include future minimum lease payments on sites that may be selected in 2011. (j) We have not included obligations under our pension and postretirement health care benefit plans in the contractual obligations table above because no additional amounts are required to be funded as of January 29, 2011. Our historical practice regarding these plans has been to contribute amounts necessary to satisfy minimum pension funding requirements, plus periodic discretionary amounts determined to be appropriate. 24 Table of Contents Off Balance Sheet Arrangements We do not have any arrangements or relationships with entities that are not consolidated into the financial statements or financial guarantees that are reasonably likely to materially affect our liquidity or the availability of capital resources. Critical Accounting Estimates Our analysis of operations and financial condition is based on our consolidated financial statements, prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP). Preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions affecting the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements, reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities. In the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, we describe the significant accounting policies used in preparing the consolidated financial statements. Our estimates are evaluated on an ongoing basis and are drawn from historical experience and other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results could differ under other assumptions or conditions. However, we do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood that there will be a material change in future estimates or assumptions. Our senior management has discussed the development and selection of our critical accounting estimates with the Audit Committee of our Board of Directors. The following items in our consolidated financial statements require significant estimation or judgment: Inventory and cost of sales We use the retail inventory method to account for substantially our entire inventory and the related cost of sales. Under this method, inventory is stated at cost using the last-in, first-out (LIFO) method as determined by applying a cost-to-retail ratio to each merchandise grouping's ending retail value. Cost includes the purchase price as adjusted for vendor income. Since inventory value is adjusted regularly to reflect market conditions, our inventory methodology reflects the lower of cost or market. We reduce inventory for estimated losses related to shrink and markdowns. Our shrink estimate is based on historical losses verified by ongoing physical inventory counts. Historically, our actual physical inventory count results have shown our estimates to be reliable. Markdowns designated for clearance activity are recorded when the salability of the merchandise has diminished. Inventory is at risk of obsolescence if economic conditions change. Relevant economic conditions include changing consumer demand, customer preferences, changing consumer credit markets or increasing competition. We believe these risks are largely mitigated because our inventory typically turns in less than three months. Inventory was $7,596 million and $7,179 million at January 29, 2011 and January 30, 2010, respectively, and is further described in Note 11 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Vendor income receivable Cost of sales and SG&A expenses are partially offset by various forms of consideration received from our vendors. This ""vendor income"" is earned for a variety of vendor-sponsored programs, such as volume rebates, markdown allowances, promotions and advertising allowances, as well as for our compliance programs. We establish a receivable for the vendor income that is earned but not yet received. Based on the agreements in place, this receivable is computed by estimating when we have completed our performance and when the amount is earned. The majority of all year-end vendor income receivables are collected within the following fiscal quarter, and we do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood that the assumptions used in our estimate will change significantly. Historically, adjustments to our vendor income receivable have not been material. Vendor income receivable was $517 million and $390 million at January 29, 2011 and January 30, 2010, respectively, and is described further in Note 4 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Allowance for doubtful accounts When receivables are recorded, we recognize an allowance for doubtful accounts in an amount equal to anticipated future write-offs. This allowance includes provisions for uncollectible finance charges and other credit-related fees. We estimate future write-offs based on historical experience of delinquencies, risk scores, aging trends and industry risk trends. Substantially all accounts continue to accrue finance charges until they are written off. Accounts are automatically written off when they become 180 days past due. Management believes the allowance for doubtful accounts is adequate to cover anticipated losses in our credit card accounts receivable under current conditions; however, unexpected, significant deterioration in any of the 25 Table of Contents factors mentioned above or in general economic conditions could materially change these expectations. During 2010, we continued risk management and underwriting initiatives that reduced available credit lines for higher-risk cardholders. In addition, we experienced an increase in payment rates and a decrease in charge activity from reductions in card usage by our guests. As a result of these trends, our allowance for doubtful accounts related to our credit card receivables decreased $326 million, from $1,016 million, or 12.7 percent of gross credit card receivables, at January 30, 2010 to $690 million, or 10.1 percent of gross credit card receivables, at January 29, 2011. Credit card receivables and our allowance for doubtful accounts are described in Note 10 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Long-lived assets Long-lived assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset (or asset group) may not be recoverable. An impairment loss would be recognized when estimated undiscounted future cash flows from the operation and disposition of the asset group are less than the carrying amount of the asset group. Asset groups have identifiable cash flows independent of other asset groups. Measurement of an impairment loss would be based on the excess of the carrying amount of the asset group over its fair value. Fair value is measured using discounted cash flows or independent opinions of value, as appropriate. A 10 percent decrease in the fair value of assets we intend to sell as of January 29, 2011 would result in additional impairment of approximately $12 million in 2010. Historically, we have not realized material losses upon sale of long-lived assets. Goodwill and intangible assets We evaluate goodwill and intangible assets for impairment annually, or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value of the asset may not be recoverable. Discounted cash flow models are used in determining fair value of goodwill and intangible assets. Growth rates for sales and profits are determined using inputs from our long-range planning process. We also make estimates of discount rates, perpetuity growth rates, and other factors. As of January 29, 2011 and January 30, 2010, we had $223 million and $239 million of goodwill and intangible assets, respectively. While we currently believe that the fair value of our goodwill and intangible assets exceeds its carrying value, materially different assumptions regarding future performance of our businesses or other factors could result in impairment losses. Insurance/self-insurance We retain a substantial portion of the risk related to certain general liability, workers' compensation, property loss and team member medical and dental claims. However, we maintain stop-loss coverage to limit the exposure related to certain risks. Liabilities associated with these losses include estimates of both claims filed and losses incurred but not yet reported. We use actuarial methods which consider a number of factors to estimate our ultimate cost of losses. General liability and workers' compensation liabilities are recorded at our estimate of their net present value; other liabilities referred to above are not discounted. Our workers' compensation and general liability accrual was $628 million and $653 million at January 29, 2011 and January 30, 2010, respectively. We believe that the amounts accrued are adequate; however, our liabilities could be significantly affected if future occurrences or loss developments differ from our assumptions. For example, a 5 percent increase or decrease in average claim costs would impact our self-insurance expense by approximately $30 million in 2010. Historically, adjustments to our estimates have not been material. Refer to Item 7A for further disclosure of the market risks associated with these exposures. Income taxes We pay income taxes based on the tax statutes, regulations and case law of the various jurisdictions in which we operate. Significant judgment is required in determining the timing and amounts of deductible and taxable items and in evaluating the ultimate resolution of tax matters in dispute with tax authorities. The benefits of uncertain tax positions are recorded in our financial statements only after determining whether it is likely the uncertain tax positions would withstand challenge by taxing authorities. We periodically reassess these probabilities, and record any changes in the financial statements as deemed appropriate. Liabilities for tax positions considered uncertain, including interest and penalties, were $397 million and $579 million at January 29, 2011 and January 30, 2010, respectively. We believe the resolution of these matters will not have a material adverse impact on our consolidated financial statements. Income taxes are described further in Note 22 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. 26 Table of Contents Pension and postretirement health care accounting We fund and maintain a qualified defined benefit pension plan. We also maintain several smaller nonqualified plans and a postretirement health care plan for certain current and retired team members. The costs for these plans are determined based on actuarial calculations using the assumptions described in the following paragraphs. Eligibility for, and the level of, these benefits varies depending on team members' full-time or part-time status, date of hire and/or length of service. Our expected long-term rate of return on plan assets is determined by the portfolio composition, historical long-term investment performance and current market conditions. Benefits expense recorded during the year is partially dependent upon the long-term rate of return used. A one percentage point decrease in the expected long-term rate of return used to determine net pension and postretirement health care benefits expense would increase annual expense by approximately $24 million. The discount rate used to determine benefit obligations is adjusted annually based on the interest rate for long-term high-quality corporate bonds as of the measurement date, using yields for maturities that are in line with the duration of our pension liabilities. Therefore, these liabilities fluctuate with changes in interest rates. Historically, this same discount rate has also been used to determine net pension and postretirement health care benefits expense for the following plan year. Benefits expense recorded during the year is partially dependent upon the discount rates used, and a 0.5 percentage point decrease to the weighted average discount rate used to determine net pension and postretirement health care benefits expense would increase annual expense by approximately $23 million. Based on our experience, we use a graduated compensation growth schedule that assumes higher compensation growth for younger, shorter-service pension-eligible team members than it does for older, longer-service pension-eligible team members. Pension and postretirement health care benefits are further described in Note 27 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Legal contingencies We are exposed to claims and litigation arising in the ordinary course of business and use various methods to resolve these matters in a manner that we believe serves the best interest of our shareholders and other constituents. Historically, adjustments to our estimates have not been material. We believe the recorded reserves in our consolidated financial statements are adequate in light of the probable and estimable liabilities. We do not believe that any of the currently identified claims or litigation matters will have a material adverse impact on our results of operations, cash flows or financial condition. However, litigation is subject to inherent uncertainties, and unfavorable rulings could occur. If an unfavorable ruling were to occur, there may be a material adverse impact on the results of operations, cash flows or financial condition for the period in which the ruling occurs, or future periods. New Accounting Pronouncements Recent Adoptions In June 2009, the FASB issued SFAS No. 166, ""Accounting for Transfers of Financial Assets an amendment of FASB Statement No. 140"" (SFAS 166), codified in the Transfers and Servicing accounting principles, which amends the derecognition guidance in former FASB Statement No. 140 and eliminates the exemption from consolidation for qualifying special-purpose entities. We adopted this guidance at the beginning of 2010 and adoption had no impact on our consolidated net earnings, cash flows or financial position. In June 2009, the FASB issued SFAS No. 167, ""Amendments to FASB Interpretation No. 46(R)"" (SFAS 167), codified in the Consolidation accounting principles, which amends the consolidation guidance applicable to variable interest entities. The amendments significantly affected the overall consolidation analysis under former FASB Interpretation No. 46(R). We adopted this guidance at the beginning of 2010 and the adoption had no impact on our consolidated net earnings, cash flows or financial position. 27 Table of Contents Outlook Our outlook is based on the application of business judgment in light of current business trends, our assumptions regarding the macroeconomic environment, and estimates of the impact of current initiatives, the most significant of which are our store remodel program, the new 5 percent REDcard Rewards program, and our planned Canadian expansion. In the Retail Segment, we expect that comparable-store sales will increase in the 4 to 5 percent range in 2011. We expect that our store remodel program will contribute incremental comparable-store sales, and net of the adverse impact of remodel disruption, this impact will grow to a run rate of about 1.5 percentage points as we progress through the year. Separately we expect that the sales contribution of our 5% REDcard Rewards program will grow more rapidly in its importance, adding up to 2 percentage points to our same store sales growth later in 2011. These estimates are based on extrapolations of the current performance of these programs. In 2011 we expect to produce a full-year EBIT margin rate consistent with 2010, due to favorable leverage of SG&A and depreciation and amortization expenses offsetting the gross margin rate declines associated with our store remodel and new rewards strategies. This offsetting impact is unlikely to occur in the spring, particularly in the first quarter, resulting in modest pressure on EBIT margin rate in the spring, and modest favorability on this measure in the fall. In our Credit Card Segment, we expect receivables will continue to decline in 2011, with the pace of the decline moderating as the year progresses. We expect that the allowance for doubtful accounts will continue to decline in 2011 as well, due to this decline in receivables and expected continued improvement in portfolio risks. We also expect measures of our rate of portfolio profitability to remain strong in 2011. Additionally, in January 2011 we announced our plan to actively pursue the sale of our credit card receivables portfolio. As of January 29, 2011 the gross balance of our credit card receivables portfolio was $6,843 million, of which $3,954 million was funded by third parties and $2,889 million was funded by Target. In January 2011, we entered into an agreement to purchase the leasehold interests in up to 220 sites in Canada currently operated by Zellers Inc., in exchange for C$1,825 million, due in two payments, one in May 2011 and one in September 2011. We believe this transaction will allow us to open 100 to 150 Target stores in Canada, primarily during 2013. We expect that renovation of these stores will require an investment of over C$1 billion, a portion of which may be funded by landlords. Our direct costs associated with entry into Canada may add expenses equating to an earnings per share (EPS) equivalent in the range of $0.10 for 2011, an estimate that will continue to evolve over time. We currently believe the aggregate effect of our Canadian expansion could result in a $0.15 to $0.20 unfavorable impact on 2011 EPS, reflecting direct incremental expenses and the indirect impact of the Canadian investment on the pace of share repurchase. We expect that the 2012 dilutive EPS impact of the Canadian expansion will exceed the 2011 dilutive EPS impact, due primarily to a full year of lease-related expenses. We expect 2011 capital expenditures related to our U.S. retail operations to be approximately $2.5 billion, driven primarily by a larger remodel program. We expect to open 21 new stores in the U.S. in 2011, adding approximately 15 new locations net of closings and relocations. We also expect to continue to execute against our share repurchase plan, although at a slower pace due to our Canadian expansion, investing in the range of $1.5 billion to $2.0 billion during 2011. The timing and amount of share repurchase activity will be dependent on market conditions and the amount of future net earnings and cash flows. We expect our 2011 effective tax rate to be in the range of 36 to 37 percent. Forward-Looking Statements This report contains forward-looking statements, which are based on our current assumptions and expectations. These statements are typically accompanied by the words ""expect,"" ""may,"" ""could,"" ""believe,"" ""would,"" ""might,"" ""anticipates,"" or words of similar import. The principal forward-looking statements in this report include: For our Retail Segment, our outlook for sales, comparable-store sales trends, including the impact of our store remodel and 5% REDcard Rewards programs, and EBIT margin rates; for our Credit Card Segment, our outlook for year-end gross credit card receivables, future write-offs of current receivables, rate of portfolio 28 Table of Contents profitability, the allowance for doubtful accounts, improvement in portfolio risks, and the pursuit of a portfolio sale; on a consolidated basis, details on the expected investment in Canada and its impact on our results, statements regarding the adequacy of our sources of liquidity, the continued execution of our share repurchase program, our expected capital expenditures and the number of stores to be opened in 2011, the expected effective income tax rate, the expected compliance with debt covenants, our intentions regarding future dividends, our expected future share-based compensation expense, our expected return on plan assets, our expected expense, contributions and benefit payments related to our pension and postretirement health care plans, the adequacy of our reserves for general liability, workers' compensation, property loss, and team member medical and dental, the potential impact of changes in our critical accounting estimates, the expected outcome of claims and litigation, and the resolution of tax uncertainties. All such forward-looking statements are intended to enjoy the protection of the safe harbor for forward-looking statements contained in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, as amended. Although we believe there is a reasonable basis for the forward-looking statements, our actual results could be materially different. The most important factors which could cause our actual results to differ from our forward-looking statements are set forth on our description of risk factors in Item 1A to this Form 10-K, which should be read in conjunction with the forward-looking statements in this report. Forward-looking statements speak only as of the date they are made, and we do not undertake any obligation to update any forward-looking statement. Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk Our exposure to market risk results primarily from interest rate changes on our debt obligations, some of which are at a LIBOR-plus floating rate, and on our credit card receivables, the majority of which are assessed finance charges at a Prime based floating rate. To manage our net interest margin, we generally maintain levels of floating-rate debt to generate similar changes in net interest expense as finance charge revenues fluctuate. The degree of floating asset and liability matching may vary over time and in different interest rate environments. At January 29, 2011, the amount of floating-rate credit card assets exceeded the amount of net floating-rate debt obligations by approximately $2 billion. As a result, based on our balance sheet position at January 29, 2011, the annualized effect of a 0.1 percentage point decrease in floating interest rates on our floating rate debt obligations, net of our floating rate credit card assets and marketable securities, would be to decrease earnings before income taxes by approximately $2 million. See further description in Note 20 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. We record our general liability and workers' compensation liabilities at net present value; therefore, these liabilities fluctuate with changes in interest rates. Periodically, in certain interest rate environments, we economically hedge a portion of our exposure to these interest rate changes by entering into interest rate forward contracts that partially mitigate the effects of interest rate changes. Based on our balance sheet position at January 29, 2011, the annualized effect of a 0.5 percentage point decrease in interest rates would be to decrease earnings before income taxes by approximately $10 million. In addition, we are exposed to market return fluctuations on our qualified defined benefit pension plans. The annualized effect of a one percentage point decrease in the return on pension plan assets would decrease plan assets by $25 million at January 29, 2011. The value of our pension liabilities is inversely related to changes in interest rates. To protect against declines in interest rates we hold high-quality, long-duration bonds and interest rate swaps in our pension plan trust. At year-end, we had hedged approximately 55 percent of the interest rate exposure of our funded status. As more fully described in Note 14 and Note 26 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, we are exposed to market returns on accumulated team member balances in our nonqualified, unfunded deferred compensation plans. We control the risk of offering the nonqualified plans by making investments in life insurance contracts and prepaid forward contracts on our own common stock that offset a substantial portion of our economic exposure to the returns on these plans. The annualized effect of a one percentage point change in market returns on our nonqualified defined contribution plans (inclusive of the effect of the investment vehicles used to manage our economic exposure) would not be significant. 29 Table of Contents We do not currently have significant direct exposure to foreign currency rates as all of our stores are located in the United States, and the vast majority of imported merchandise is purchased in U.S. dollars. Our previously described agreement to purchase leasehold interests in Canada will expose us to market risk associated with foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations between the Canadian dollar and the U.S. dollar beginning in 2011. Overall, there have been no material changes in our primary risk exposures or management of market risks since the prior year. 30 Table of Contents",2023-12-30 21:32:51.998804
27419,TGT,TARGET CORP,2012,"Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Executive Summary Consolidated revenues were $69,865 million for 2011, an increase of $2,475 million or 3.7 percent from the prior year. Consolidated earnings before interest expense and income taxes for 2011 increased by $70 million or 1.3 percent over 2010 to $5,322 million. Cash flow provided by operations was $5,434 million, $5,271 million and $5,881 million for 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively. Diluted earnings per share in 2011 increased 7.0 percent to $4.28 from $4.00 in the prior year. Adjusted diluted earnings per share, which we believe is useful in providing period-to-period comparisons of the results of our U.S. operations, increased 14.3 percent to $4.41 in 2011 from $3.86 in the prior year. Earnings Per Share Percent Change 2011 2010 2009 2011/2010 2010/2009 GAAP diluted earnings per share $ 4.28 $ 4.00 $ 3.30 7.0 % 21.4 % Adjustments (a) 0.13 (0.14 ) (0.04 ) Adjusted diluted earnings per share $ 4.41 $ 3.86 $ 3.26 14.3 % 18.4 % Note: A reconciliation of non-GAAP financial measures to GAAP measures is provided on page 20. (a)Adjustments represent the diluted EPS impact of our 2013 Canadian market entry, favorable resolution of various income tax matters and the loss on early retirement of debt. Our financial results for 2011 in our U.S. Retail Segment reflect increased sales of 4.1 percent over the same period last year due to a 3.0 percent comparable-store increase combined with the contribution from new stores. In 2011 we experienced a slight reduction in U.S. Retail Segment EBITDA margin rate compared to 2010, due primarily to a decrease in gross margin rate, partially offset by a favorable selling, general and administrative (SG&A) expense rate. U.S. Retail Segment EBIT margin rate in 2011 was consistent with the 2010 rate. We opened 21 new stores in 2011 (13 net of 5 relocations and 3 closures). During 2010, we opened 13 new stores (10 net of 1 relocation and 2 closures). In the U.S. Credit Card Segment, we achieved an increase in segment profit primarily due to declining bad debt expense driven by improved trends in key measures of risk in our accounts receivable portfolio. 14 Table of Contents Our Canadian Segment was initially reported in our first quarter 2011 financial results, as a result of entering into an agreement to purchase the leasehold interests in up to 220 sites in Canada operated by Zellers Inc. (Zellers). We acquired leasehold interests in 189 Zellers sites for $1,861 million, and sold our right to acquire 54 of these sites to third-party retailers and landlords for $225 million. These transactions resulted in a final net purchase price of $1,636 million. We believe this transaction will allow us to open 125 to 135 Target stores in Canada, primarily during 2013. During 2011, Canadian Segment start-up costs totaled $74 million, and primarily consisted of compensation, benefits and consulting expenses. These expenses are reported in selling, general and administrative expense within the consolidated statement of operations. Management's Discussion and Analysis is based on our Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.

EBIT is earnings before interest expense and income taxes. Note: See Note 28 to our Consolidated Financial Statements for a reconciliation of our segment results to earnings before income taxes. (a)Effective with the October 2010 nationwide launch of our 5% REDcard Rewards loyalty program, we changed the formula under which the U.S. Retail Segment charges the U.S. Credit Card Segment to better align with the attributes of this program. Loyalty program charges were $258 million in 2011, $102 million in 2010 and $89 million in 2009. In all periods, these amounts were recorded as reductions to SG&A expenses within the U.S. Retail Segment and increases to operations and marketing expenses within the U.S. Credit Card Segment. U.S. Retail Segment Rate Analysis 2011 2010 2009 Gross margin rate 30.1 % 30.5 % 30.5 % SG&A expense rate 20.1 20.3 20.5 EBITDA margin rate 10.0 10.2 10.1 Depreciation and amortization expense rate 3.0 3.1 3.2 EBIT margin rate 7.0 7.0 6.9 Rate analysis metrics are computed by dividing the applicable amount by sales. Sales Sales include merchandise sales, net of expected returns, from our stores and our online business, as well as gift card breakage. Refer to Note 2 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for a definition of gift card breakage. Total sales for the U.S. Retail Segment for 2011 were $68,466 million, compared with $65,786 million in 2010 and $63,435 million in 2009. All periods were 52-week years. Growth in total sales between 2011 and 2010, as well as between 2010 and 2009, resulted from higher comparable-store sales and additional stores opened. Inflation did not materially affect sales during 2011 or 2010. During 2009, we experienced a deflationary impact on sales of approximately 3.6 percentage points. Refer to the Merchandise section in Item 1, Business, for additional product category information. 15 Table of Contents Comparable-store sales is a measure that highlights the performance of our existing stores by measuring the change in sales for such stores for a period over the comparable, prior-year period of equivalent length. The method of calculating comparable-store sales varies across the retail industry. As a result, our comparable-store sales calculation is not necessarily comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies. Comparable-store sales are sales from our online business and stores open longer than one year, including: •sales from stores that have been remodeled or expanded while remaining open (including our current store remodel program) •sales from stores that have been relocated to new buildings of the same format within the same trade area, in which the new store opens at about the same time as the old store closes Comparable-store sales do not include: •sales from general merchandise stores that have been converted, or relocated within the same trade area, to a SuperTarget store format •sales from stores that were intentionally closed to be remodeled, expanded or reconstructed Comparable-Store Sales 2011 2010 2009 Comparable-store sales change 3.0 % 2.1% (2.5) % Drivers of change in comparable-store sales: Number of transactions 0.4 2.0 (0.2) Average transaction amount 2.6 0.1 (2.3) Units per transaction 2.3 2.5 (1.5) Selling price per unit 0.3 (2.3 ) (0.8) In 2011, the change in comparable-store sales was driven by a slight increase in the number of transactions and an increase in the average transaction amount, reflecting an increase in units per transaction and a slight increase in selling price per unit. In 2010, the change in comparable-store sales was driven by an increase in the number of transactions and a slight increase in the average transaction amount, reflecting an increase in units per transaction largely offset by a decrease in selling price per unit. The collective interaction of a broad array of macroeconomic, competitive and consumer behavioral factors, as well as sales mix, and transfer of sales to new stores makes further analysis of sales metrics infeasible. Our U.S. Credit Card Segment offers credit to qualified guests through our branded proprietary credit cards: the Target Visa Credit Card and the Target Credit Card (Target Credit Cards). Additionally, we offer a branded proprietary Target Debit Card. Collectively, we refer to these products as REDcards®. Beginning October 2010, guests receive a 5 percent discount on virtually all purchases at checkout every day when they use a REDcard at any Target store or on Target.com. We monitor the percentage of store sales that are paid for using REDcards (REDcard Penetration), because our internal analysis has indicated that a meaningful portion of the incremental purchases on our REDcards are also incremental sales for Target, with the remainder representing a shift in tender type. REDcard Penetration 2011 2010 2009 Target Credit Cards 6.8 % 5.2 % 5.2 % Target Debit Card 2.5 0.7 0.4 % Total Store REDcard Penetration 9.3 % 5.9 % 5.6 % Gross Margin Rate Gross margin rate represents gross margin (sales less cost of sales) as a percentage of sales. See Note 3 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for a description of costs included in cost of sales. Markup is the difference between an item's cost and its retail price (expressed as a percentage of its retail price). Factors that affect markup include vendor offerings and negotiations, vendor income, sourcing strategies, market forces like raw material and freight costs, and competitive influences. Markdowns are the reduction in the original or previous 16 Table of Contents price of retail merchandise. Factors that affect markdowns include inventory management, competitive influences and economic conditions. Our gross margin rate was 30.1 percent in 2011, decreasing from 30.5 percent in the prior year, reflecting the impact of our integrated growth strategies of 5% REDcard Rewards and remodel program, partially offset by underlying rate improvements within categories. The REDcard Rewards program reduces category gross margin rates because it drives incremental sales among guests who receive 5% off on virtually all items purchased in our stores and online. The remodel program reduces the overall gross margin rate because it drives incremental sales with a stronger-than-average mix in lower-than-average gross margin rate product categories, primarily food. Our gross margin rate was 30.5 percent in 2010, unchanged from prior year, as margin rates within categories were generally stable and the impact of sales mix was essentially neutral. There were no other significant variances in the drivers of gross margin rate. Selling, General and Administrative Expense Rate Our selling, general and administrative expense rate represents SG&A expenses as a percentage of sales. See Note 3 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for a description of costs included in SG&A expenses. SG&A expenses exclude depreciation and amortization, as well as expenses associated with our credit card operations, which are reflected separately in our Consolidated Statements of Operations. SG&A expense rate was 20.1 percent in 2011 compared with 20.3 percent in 2010 and 20.5 percent in 2009. The change in the rate in 2011 was primarily due to increased charges to the U.S. Credit Segment and favorable leverage on store hourly payroll expense. The change in the SG&A expense rate in 2010 was primarily due to favorable leverage of overall compensation expenses. Depreciation and Amortization Expense Rate Our depreciation and amortization expense rate represents depreciation and amortization expense as a percentage of sales. In 2011, our depreciation and amortization expense rate was 3.0 percent compared with 3.1 percent in 2010 and 3.2 percent in 2009.

Our credit card program supports our core retail operations and remains an important contributor to our overall profitability and engagement with our guests. Beginning October 2010, guests receive a 5 percent discount on virtually all purchases at checkout, every day, when they use a REDcard at any Target store or on Target.com. Credit card revenues are comprised of finance charges, late fees and other revenue, and third party merchant fees, which are amounts received from merchants who accept the Target Visa credit card. In January 2011, we announced our plan to actively pursue the sale of our credit card receivables portfolio. In January 2012, we announced that we temporarily suspended our efforts to sell the receivables portfolio until later in 2012. We intend to execute a transaction only if appropriate strategic and financial conditions are met, and we will classify the credit card receivables portfolio as held for sale when a transaction that allows us to meet our objectives has been agreed upon with a potential buyer.

(c)As a percentage of average gross credit card receivables. 18 Table of Contents Our primary measure of segment profit is the EBIT generated by our total credit card receivables portfolio less the interest expense on nonrecourse debt collateralized by credit card receivables. We analyze this measure of profit in light of the amount of capital we have invested in our credit card receivables. In addition, we measure the performance of our overall credit card receivables portfolio by calculating the dollar spread to LIBOR at the portfolio level. This metric approximates overall financial performance of the entire credit card portfolio we manage by measuring the difference between EBIT earned on the portfolio and a hypothetical benchmark rate financing cost applied to the entire portfolio. The interest rate on all nonrecourse debt securitized by credit card receivables is tied to LIBOR. In 2011, segment profit increased to $606 million from $541 million, driven mostly by a decline in bad debt expense, partially offset by lower total revenues. The reduction in our investment in the portfolio combined with these results produced a strong improvement in segment ROIC. Segment revenues were $1,399 million, a decrease of $205 million, or 12.8 percent, from the prior year, which was primarily driven by lower average receivables resulting in reduced finance charge revenue. Segment expenses were $721 million, a decrease of $259 million, or 26.5 percent, from prior year driven by lower bad debt expense due to improved trends in key measures of risk. Segment interest expense on nonrecourse debt declined due to a decrease in nonrecourse debt securitized by credit card receivables. In 2010, segment profit increased to $541 million from $201 million, driven mostly by favorability in bad debt expense. The reduction in our investment in the portfolio combined with these results produced a strong improvement in segment ROIC. Segment revenues were $1,604 million, a decrease of $318 million, or 16.5 percent, from the prior year, which was primarily driven by lower average receivables as well as reduced late fees. Segment expenses were $980 million, a decrease of $644 million, or 39.7 percent, from prior year driven primarily by lower bad debt expense due to lower actual and expected write-offs. Segment interest expense on nonrecourse debt declined due to a decrease in nonrecourse debt securitized by credit card receivables.

These amounts combined represent net write-offs. 19 Table of Contents Period-end and average gross receivables have declined because of an increase in payment rates and a decrease in Target Visa Credit Card charges at third-parties, partially offset by an increase in charges at Target over the past two years. The decrease in charges on our credit cards at third parties is primarily due to the fact that we no longer issue new Target Visa accounts and we undertook risk management and underwriting initiatives that reduced available credit lines for higher-risk cardholders during 2009 and 2010. We expect to report period-over-period declines in segment profit in 2012, primarily because our 2011 results benefited from significant allowance reductions. Canadian Segment During 2011, start-up costs totaled $74 million and primarily consisted of compensation, benefits and consulting expenses. These expenses are reported in SG&A expense within the consolidated statement of operations. Additionally, we recorded $48 million in depreciation for 2011 related to capital lease assets and leasehold interests acquired in our Zellers asset purchase. We have begun to invest capital to prepare for site renovation, establish supply chain capabilities and build supporting infrastructure. Other Performance Factors Net Interest Expense Net interest expense, including interest expense on nonrecourse debt collateralized by credit card receivables detailed in the U.S. Credit Card Segment Results above, was $866 million for 2011, increasing 14.4 percent, or $109 million from 2010. This increase is due to an $87 million loss on early retirement of debt, $44 million of interest on Canadian capitalized leases and higher average debt balances, partially offset by a lower average portfolio interest rate. In 2010, net interest expense was $757 million, decreasing 5.5 percent or $44 million from 2009 due to lower average debt balances and a $16 million charge related to the early retirement of long-term debt in 2009, partially offset by a higher average portfolio interest rate. Provision for Income Taxes Our effective income tax rate was 34.3 percent in 2011 and 35.1 percent in 2010. The decrease in the effective rate between periods is primarily due to a reduction in the structural domestic effective tax rate. This was slightly offset by the unfavorable impact of losses in Canada which are tax effected at a lower rate than the U.S. rate. Various income tax matters were resolved in 2011 and 2010 which reduced tax expense by $85 million and $102 million, respectively. A tax rate reconciliation is provided in Note 22 to our Consolidated Financial Statements. Our effective income tax rate was 35.1 percent in 2010 and 35.7 percent in 2009. The decrease in the effective rate between periods is primarily due to the favorable resolution of various income tax matters, as noted above. We expect a 2012 consolidated effective income tax rate of 36.7 percent to 37.7 percent, excluding the impact of resolution of income tax matters. Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Financial Measures to GAAP Measures Our segment measure of profit is used by management to evaluate the return on our investment and to make operating decisions. To provide additional transparency, we have disclosed non-GAAP adjusted diluted earnings per share, which excludes the impact of our 2013 Canadian market entry, favorable resolution of various income tax matters and the loss on early retirement of debt. We believe this information is useful in providing period-to-period comparisons of the results of our U.S. operations. This measure is not in accordance with, or an alternative for, generally accepted accounting principles in the United States. The most comparable GAAP measure is diluted earnings per share. Non-GAAP adjusted EPS should not be considered in isolation or as a substitution for analysis 20 Table of Contents of our results as reported under GAAP. Other companies may calculate non-GAAP adjusted EPS differently than we do, limiting the usefulness of the measure for comparisons with other companies.

The sum of the non-GAAP adjustments may not equal the total adjustment amounts due to rounding. (a)Represents interest expense, net of interest income, not included in U.S. Credit Card segment profit. For 2011, 2010 and 2009, U.S. Credit Card segment profit included $72 million, $83 million and $97 million of interest expense on nonrecourse debt collateralized by credit card receivables, respectively. These amounts, along with other interest expense, equal consolidated GAAP interest expense. (b)In 2011, taxes are allocated to our business segments based on income tax rates applicable to the operations of the segment for the period. (c)For 2011, 2010 and 2009, average diluted shares outstanding were 683.9 million, 729.4 million and 754.8 million, respectively. (d)Represents the loss on early retirement of debt. (e)Represents the effect of resolution of income tax matters. The 2011 and 2009 results also include tax effects of $32 million and $6 million, respectively, related to losses on early retirement of debt. Analysis of Financial Condition Liquidity and Capital Resources Our period-end cash and cash equivalents balance was $794 million compared with $1,712 million in 2010. Short-term investments (highly liquid investments with an original maturity of three months or less from the time of purchase) of $194 million and $1,129 million were included in cash and cash equivalents at the end of 2011 and 2010, respectively. Our investment policy is designed to preserve principal and liquidity of our short-term investments. This policy allows investments in large money market funds or in highly rated direct short-term instruments that mature in 60 days or less. We also place certain dollar limits on our investments in individual funds or instruments. 21 Table of Contents Our 2011 operations were funded by both internally and externally generated funds. Cash flow provided by operations was $5,434 million in 2011 compared with $5,271 million in 2010. During 2011, Target issued $3.5 billion of debt that matures between January 2013 and January 2022. This cash flow, combined with our prior year-end cash position, allowed us to fund capital expenditures, retire outstanding debt obligations, pay dividends and continue purchases under our share repurchase program. During 2011, we also completed our real estate transaction with Zellers. This transaction resulted in a final net purchase price of $1,636 million. Our 2011 period-end gross credit card receivables were $6,357 million compared with $6,843 million in 2010, a decrease of 7.1 percent. Average gross credit card receivables in 2011 decreased 11.1 percent compared with 2010 levels. This change was driven by the factors indicated in the U.S. Credit Card Segment above. During 2011 we retired our 2008 credit card financing with JPMorgan Chase by making principal and make-whole payments totaling $3,080 million. As of January 28, 2012, $1 billion of our credit card receivables portfolio was funded by third parties. We intend to pursue a sale of our credit card receivables portfolio, which may provide additional liquidity in 2012. Year-end inventory levels increased $322 million, or 4.2 percent from 2010. Inventory levels were higher to support traffic-driving strategic initiatives, such as our remodel program, including expanded food assortment and pharmacy offerings, in addition to comparatively higher retail square footage. Accounts payable increased by $232 million, or 3.5 percent over the same period. During 2011, we repurchased 37.2 million shares of our common stock for a total cash investment of $1,894 million ($50.89 per share) under a $10 billion share repurchase plan authorized by our Board of Directors in November 2007. In 2010, we repurchased 47.8 million shares of our common stock for a total cash investment of $2,508 million ($52.44 per share). During January 2012, our Board of Directors authorized a $5 billion share repurchase plan. We expect to begin repurchasing shares under this new authorization upon completion of the current program. We intend to complete this new program primarily through open market transactions in the next 2 to 3 years. We paid dividends totaling $750 million in 2011 and $609 million in 2010, an increase of 23.1 percent. We declared dividends totaling $777 million ($1.15 per share) in 2011, an increase of 17.8 percent over 2010. In 2010, we declared dividends totaling $659 million ($0.92 per share), an increase of 31.1 percent over 2009. We have paid dividends every quarter since our first dividend was declared following our 1967 initial public offering, and it is our intent to continue to do so in the future. Our financing strategy is to ensure liquidity and access to capital markets, to manage our net exposure to floating interest rate volatility, and to maintain a balanced spectrum of debt maturities. Within these parameters, we seek to minimize our borrowing costs. Our ability to access the long-term debt, commercial paper and securitized debt markets has provided us with ample sources of liquidity. Our continued access to these markets depends on multiple factors including the condition of debt capital markets, our operating performance and maintaining strong debt ratings. The ratings assigned to our debt by the credit rating agencies affect both the pricing and terms of any new financing. As of January 28, 2012 our credit ratings were as follows: Credit Ratings Standard and Poor's Moody's Fitch Long-term debt A2 A+ A- Commercial paper P-1 A-1 F2 If our credit ratings were lowered, our ability to access the debt markets and our cost of funds for new debt issuances could be adversely impacted. Each of the credit rating agencies reviews its rating periodically and there is no guarantee our current credit rating will remain the same as described above. As a measure of our financial condition, we monitor our interest coverage ratio, representing the ratio of pretax earnings before fixed charges to fixed charges. Fixed charges include interest expense and the interest portion of rent expense. Our interest coverage ratio was 5.9x in 2011, 6.1x in 2010 and 5.1x in 2009. 22 Table of Contents In 2011, we funded our peak sales season working capital needs through our commercial paper program and used the cash generated from that sales season to repay the commercial paper issued. In 2010, we funded our working capital needs through internally generated funds and long-term debt issuance. Commercial Paper (millions) 2011 2010 Maximum daily amount outstanding during the year $ 1,211 $ — Average amount outstanding during the year 244 — Amount outstanding at year-end — — Weighted average interest rate 0.11 % — An additional source of liquidity is available to us through a committed $2.25 billion revolving credit facility obtained through a group of banks in October 2011, which will expire in October 2016. This new revolving credit facility replaced a $2 billion revolving credit facility that was scheduled to expire in April 2012. No balances were outstanding at any time during 2011 or 2010 under either facility. Most of our long-term debt obligations contain covenants related to secured debt levels. In addition to a secured debt level covenant, our credit facility also contains a debt leverage covenant. We are, and expect to remain, in compliance with these covenants, and these covenants have no practical effect on our ability to pay dividends. Additionally, at January 28, 2012, no notes or debentures contained provisions requiring acceleration of payment upon a debt rating downgrade, except that certain outstanding notes allow the note holders to put the notes to us if within a matter of months of each other we experience both (i) a change in control; and (ii) our long-term debt ratings are either reduced and the resulting rating is non-investment grade, or our long-term debt ratings are placed on watch for possible reduction and those ratings are subsequently reduced and the resulting rating is non-investment grade. We expect approximately $3.3 billion of capital expenditures in 2012, reflecting an estimated $2.5 billion in our U.S. Retail Segment and approximately $800 million in our Canadian Segment. We believe our sources of liquidity will continue to be adequate to maintain operations and to finance anticipated expansion and strategic initiatives during 2012, and we continue to anticipate ample access to long-term financing. See the Commitments and Contingencies table on page 24 for detailed information on material commitments and contingencies as of January 28, 2012. Capital Expenditures Capital expenditures were $4,368 million in 2011 compared with $2,129 million in 2010 and $1,729 million in 2009. This increase was driven by our purchase of Zellers leases in Canada as well as store remodels.

Excludes fair market value adjustments recorded in long-term debt, as required by derivative and hedging accounting rules. (b)Total contractual lease payments include $2,894 million and $1,910 million of capital lease payments and operating lease payments, respectively, related to options to extend the lease term that are reasonably assured of being exercised. These payments also include $828 million and $171 million of legally binding minimum lease payments for stores that are expected to open in 2012 or later for capital and operating leases, respectively. Capital lease obligations include interest. (c)Real estate liabilities include costs incurred but not paid related to the construction or remodeling of real estate and facilities. (d)Deferred compensation obligations include commitments related to our nonqualified deferred compensation plans. The timing of deferred compensation payouts is estimated based on payments currently made to former employees and retirees, forecasted investment returns, and the projected timing of future retirements. (e)Estimated tax contingencies of $318 million, including interest and penalties, are not included in the table above because we are not able to make reasonably reliable estimates of the period of cash settlement. (f)Real estate obligations include commitments for the purchase, construction or remodeling of real estate and facilities. (g)Purchase obligations include all legally binding contracts such as firm minimum commitments for inventory purchases, merchandise royalties, equipment purchases, marketing-related contracts, software acquisition/license commitments and service contracts. We issue inventory purchase orders in the normal course of business, which represent authorizations to purchase that are cancelable by their terms. We do not consider purchase orders to be firm inventory commitments; therefore, they are excluded from the table above. If we choose to cancel a purchase order, we may be obligated to reimburse the vendor for unrecoverable outlays incurred prior to cancellation. We also issue trade letters of credit in the ordinary course of business, which are excluded from this table as these obligations are conditioned on terms of the letter of credit being met. (h)We have not included obligations under our pension and postretirement health care benefit plans in the contractual obligations table above because no additional amounts are required to be funded as of January 28, 2012. Our historical practice regarding these plans has been to contribute amounts necessary to satisfy minimum pension funding requirements, plus periodic discretionary amounts determined to be appropriate. Off Balance Sheet Arrangements We do not have any arrangements or relationships with entities that are not consolidated into the financial statements or financial guarantees that are reasonably likely to materially affect our liquidity or the availability of capital resources. 24 Table of Contents Critical Accounting Estimates Our analysis of operations and financial condition is based on our consolidated financial statements, prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP). Preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions affecting the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements, reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities. In the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, we describe the significant accounting policies used in preparing the consolidated financial statements. Our estimates are evaluated on an ongoing basis and are drawn from historical experience and other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results could differ under other assumptions or conditions. However, we do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood that there will be a material change in future estimates or assumptions. Our senior management has discussed the development and selection of our critical accounting estimates with the Audit Committee of our Board of Directors. The following items in our consolidated financial statements require significant estimation or judgment: Inventory and cost of sales We use the retail inventory method to account for substantially all inventory and the related cost of sales. Under this method, inventory is stated at cost using the last-in, first-out (LIFO) method as determined by applying a cost-to-retail ratio to each merchandise grouping's ending retail value. Cost includes the purchase price as adjusted for vendor income. Since inventory value is adjusted regularly to reflect market conditions, our inventory methodology reflects the lower of cost or market. We reduce inventory for estimated losses related to shrink and markdowns. Our shrink estimate is based on historical losses verified by ongoing physical inventory counts. Historically, our actual physical inventory count results have shown our estimates to be reliable. Markdowns designated for clearance activity are recorded when the salability of the merchandise has diminished. Inventory is at risk of obsolescence if economic conditions change. Relevant economic conditions include changing consumer demand, customer preferences, changing consumer credit markets or increasing competition. We believe these risks are largely mitigated because our inventory typically turns in less than three months. Inventory was $7,918 million and $7,596 million at January 28, 2012 and January 29, 2011, respectively, and is further described in Note 11 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Vendor income receivable Cost of sales and SG&A expenses are partially offset by various forms of consideration received from our vendors. This ""vendor income"" is earned for a variety of vendor-sponsored programs, such as volume rebates, markdown allowances, promotions and advertising allowances, as well as for our compliance programs. We establish a receivable for the vendor income that is earned but not yet received. Based on the agreements in place, this receivable is computed by estimating when we have completed our performance and when the amount is earned. The majority of all year-end vendor income receivables are collected within the following fiscal quarter, and we do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood that the assumptions used in our estimate will change significantly. Historically, adjustments to our vendor income receivable have not been material. Vendor income receivable was $589 million and $517 million at January 28, 2012 and January 29, 2011, respectively, and is described further in Note 4 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Allowance for doubtful accounts When receivables are recorded, we recognize an allowance for doubtful accounts in an amount equal to anticipated future write-offs. This allowance includes provisions for uncollectible finance charges and other credit-related fees. We estimate future write-offs based on historical experience of delinquencies, risk scores, aging trends and industry risk trends. Substantially all past-due accounts accrue finance charges until they are written off. Accounts are automatically written off when they become 180 days past due. Management believes the allowance for doubtful accounts is appropriate to cover anticipated losses in our credit card accounts receivable under current conditions; however, unexpected, significant deterioration in any of the factors mentioned above or in general economic conditions could materially change these expectations. Our allowance for doubtful accounts related to our credit card receivables decreased $260 million, from $690 million, or 10.1 percent of gross credit card receivables, at January 29, 2011 to $430 million, or 6.8 percent of gross credit card 25 Table of Contents receivables, at January 28, 2012. Credit card receivables and our allowance for doubtful accounts are described in Note 10 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Long-lived assets Long-lived assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset (or asset group) may not be recoverable. An impairment loss would be recognized when estimated undiscounted future cash flows from the operation and disposition of the asset group are less than the carrying amount of the asset group. Asset groups have identifiable cash flows independent of other asset groups. Measurement of an impairment loss would be based on the excess of the carrying amount of the asset group over its fair value. Fair value is measured using discounted cash flows or independent opinions of value, as appropriate. A 10 percent decrease in the fair value of assets we intend to sell as of January 28, 2012 would result in additional impairment of $6 million in 2011. Historically, we have not realized material losses upon sale of long-lived assets. Insurance/self-insurance We retain a substantial portion of the risk related to certain general liability, workers' compensation, property loss and team member medical and dental claims. However, we maintain stop-loss coverage to limit the exposure related to certain risks. Liabilities associated with these losses include estimates of both claims filed and losses incurred but not yet reported. We use actuarial methods which consider a number of factors to estimate our ultimate cost of losses. General liability and workers' compensation liabilities are recorded at our estimate of their net present value; other liabilities referred to above are not discounted. Our workers' compensation and general liability accrual was $646 million and $628 million at January 28, 2012 and January 29, 2011, respectively. We believe that the amounts accrued are appropriate; however, our liabilities could be significantly affected if future occurrences or loss developments differ from our assumptions. For example, a 5 percent increase or decrease in average claim costs would impact our self-insurance expense by $32 million in 2011. Historically, adjustments to our estimates have not been material. Refer to Item 7A for further disclosure of the market risks associated with these exposures. Income taxes We pay income taxes based on the tax statutes, regulations and case law of the various jurisdictions in which we operate. Significant judgment is required in determining the timing and amounts of deductible and taxable items and in evaluating the ultimate resolution of tax matters in dispute with tax authorities. The benefits of uncertain tax positions are recorded in our financial statements only after determining whether it is likely the uncertain tax positions would withstand challenge by taxing authorities. We periodically reassess these probabilities, and record any changes in the financial statements as deemed appropriate. Liabilities for tax positions considered uncertain, including interest and penalties, were $318 million and $397 million at January 28, 2012 and January 29, 2011, respectively. We believe the resolution of these matters will not have a material adverse impact on our consolidated financial statements. Income taxes are described further in Note 22 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Pension and postretirement health care accounting We fund and maintain a qualified defined benefit pension plan. We also maintain several smaller nonqualified plans and a postretirement health care plan for certain current and retired team members. The costs for these plans are determined based on actuarial calculations using the assumptions described in the following paragraphs. Eligibility for, and the level of, these benefits varies depending on team members' full-time or part-time status, date of hire and/or length of service. Our expected long-term rate of return on plan assets of 8.0% is determined by the portfolio composition, historical long-term investment performance and current market conditions. Our compound annual rate of return on qualified plans' assets was 5.1 percent, 7.8 percent and 8.3 percent for the 5-year, 10-year and 15-year periods, respectively. Benefits expense recorded during the year is partially dependent upon the long-term rate of return used. A one percentage point decrease in the expected long-term rate of return used to determine net pension and postretirement health care benefits expense would increase annual expense by $26 million. The discount rate used to determine benefit obligations is adjusted annually based on the interest rate for long-term high-quality corporate bonds as of the measurement date, using yields for maturities that are in line with the duration of our pension liabilities. Therefore, these liabilities fluctuate with changes in interest rates. Historically, 26 Table of Contents this same discount rate has also been used to determine net pension and postretirement health care benefits expense for the following plan year. Benefits expense recorded during the year is partially dependent upon the discount rates used, and a 0.5 percentage point decrease to the weighted average discount rate used to determine net pension and postretirement health care benefits expense would increase annual expense by $25 million. Based on our experience, we use a graduated compensation growth schedule that assumes higher compensation growth for younger, shorter-service pension-eligible team members than it does for older, longer-service pension-eligible team members. Pension and postretirement health care benefits are further described in Note 27 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Legal contingencies We are exposed to claims and litigation arising in the ordinary course of business and use various methods to resolve these matters in a manner that we believe serves the best interest of our shareholders and other constituents. Historically, adjustments to our estimates have not been material. We believe the recorded reserves in our consolidated financial statements are adequate in light of the probable and estimable liabilities. We do not believe that any of the currently identified claims or litigation matters will have a material adverse impact on our results of operations, cash flows or financial condition. However, litigation is subject to inherent uncertainties, and unfavorable rulings could occur. If an unfavorable ruling were to occur, there may be a material adverse impact on the results of operations, cash flows or financial condition for the period in which the ruling occurs, or future periods. New Accounting Pronouncements We do not expect that any recently issued accounting pronouncements will have a material effect on our financial statements, although we will be presenting a separate Statement of Comprehensive Income in accordance with Accounting Standard Update 2011-05, ""Comprehensive Income (Topic 220)"" beginning in 2012. Forward-Looking Statements This report contains forward-looking statements, which are based on our current assumptions and expectations. These statements are typically accompanied by the words ""expect,"" ""may,"" ""could,"" ""believe,"" ""would,"" ""might,"" ""anticipates,"" or words of similar import. The principal forward-looking statements in this report include: For our U.S. Credit Card Segment, aggregate portfolio risks and the level of, the allowance for doubtful accounts, anticipated segment profit, and the pursuit and timing of a portfolio sale; for our Canadian Segment, our performance, timing and amount of future capital investments in Canada; on a consolidated basis, statements regarding the adequacy of and costs associated with our sources of liquidity, the continued execution of our share repurchase program and the expected duration of the approved programs, our expected capital expenditures, the expected effective income tax rate, the expected compliance with debt covenants, the expected impact of new accounting pronouncements, our intentions regarding future dividends, contributions related to our pension and postretirement health care plans, the expected returns on pension plan assets, the impact of future changes in foreign currency, the effects of macroeconomic conditions, the adequacy of our reserves for general liability, workers' compensation, property loss, the expected outcome of claims and litigation, the expected ability to recognize deferred tax assets and liabilities, including foreign net operating loss carryforwards, and the resolution of tax matters. All such forward-looking statements are intended to enjoy the protection of the safe harbor for forward-looking statements contained in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, as amended. Although we believe there is a reasonable basis for the forward-looking statements, our actual results could be materially different. The most important factors which could cause our actual results to differ from our forward-looking statements are set forth on our description of risk factors in Item 1A to this Form 10-K, which should be read in conjunction with the forward-looking statements in this report. Forward-looking statements speak only as of the date they are made, and we do not undertake any obligation to update any forward-looking statement. 27 Table of Contents Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk Our exposure to market risk results primarily from interest rate changes on our debt obligations, some of which are at a LIBOR-plus floating-rate, and on our credit card receivables, the majority of which are assessed finance charges at a Prime-based floating-rate. To manage our net interest margin, we generally maintain levels of floating-rate debt to generate similar changes in net interest expense as finance charge revenues fluctuate. The degree of floating asset and liability matching may vary over time and in different interest rate environments. At January 28, 2012, the amount of floating-rate credit card assets exceeded the amount of net floating-rate debt obligations by approximately $2 billion. As a result, based on our balance sheet position at January 28, 2012, the annualized effect of a 0.1 percentage point decrease in floating interest rates on our floating rate debt obligations, net of our floating rate credit card assets and short-term investments, would be to decrease earnings before income taxes by approximately $2 million. See further description of our debt and derivative instruments in Notes 19 and 20 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. We record our general liability and workers' compensation liabilities at net present value; therefore, these liabilities fluctuate with changes in interest rates. Periodically, in certain interest rate environments, we economically hedge a portion of our exposure to these interest rate changes by entering into interest rate forward contracts that partially mitigate the effects of interest rate changes. Based on our balance sheet position at January 28, 2012, the annualized effect of a 0.5 percentage point decrease in interest rates would be to decrease earnings before income taxes by $9 million. In addition, we are exposed to market return fluctuations on our qualified defined benefit pension plans. The annualized effect of a one percentage point decrease in the return on pension plan assets would decrease plan assets by $29 million at January 28, 2012. The value of our pension liabilities is inversely related to changes in interest rates. To protect against declines in interest rates, we hold high-quality, long-duration bonds and interest rate swaps in our pension plan trust. At year-end, we had hedged 35 percent of the interest rate exposure of our funded status. As more fully described in Note 14 and Note 26 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, we are exposed to market returns on accumulated team member balances in our nonqualified, unfunded deferred compensation plans. We control the risk of offering the nonqualified plans by making investments in life insurance contracts and prepaid forward contracts on our own common stock that offset a substantial portion of our economic exposure to the returns on these plans. The annualized effect of a one percentage point change in market returns on our nonqualified defined contribution plans (inclusive of the effect of the investment vehicles used to manage our economic exposure) would not be significant. Our investment in Canada during 2011 has exposed us to market risk associated with foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations between the Canadian dollar and the U.S. dollar that we were not exposed to in previous years. Similar foreign currency risk will exist as new Target stores are opened in Canada and inventory is purchased in both U.S. and Canadian dollars. During 2011, gains and losses due to fluctuations in exchange rates were not significant. Currently, we do not have significant direct exposure to other foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations, as all of our stores are located in the United States, and the vast majority of imported merchandise is purchased in U.S. dollars. There have been no other material changes in our primary risk exposures or management of market risks since the prior year. 28 Table of Contents",2023-12-30 21:32:54.750077
27419,TGT,TARGET CORP,2013,"Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Executive Summary Our fiscal year ends on the Saturday nearest January 31. The 2012 period includes 53 weeks, while 2011 and 2010 each consisted of 52 weeks. Consolidated revenues were $73,301 million for 2012, an increase of $3,436 million or 4.9 percent from the prior year. Consolidated earnings before interest expense and income taxes for 2012 increased by $49 million or 0.9 percent over 2011 to $5,371 million. Cash flow provided by operations was $5,325 million, $5,434 million and $5,271 million for 2012, 2011 and 2010, respectively. Diluted earnings per share in 2012 increased 5.6 percent to $4.52 from $4.28 in the prior year. Adjusted diluted earnings per share, which we believe is useful in providing period-to-period comparisons of the results of our U.S. operations, increased 7.9 percent to $4.76 in 2012 from $4.41 in the prior year. Earnings Per Share Percent Change 2012 (a) 2011 2010 2012/2011 2011/2010 GAAP diluted earnings per share $ 4.52 $ 4.28 $ 4.00 5.6 % 7.0 % Adjustments (b) 0.24 0.13 (0.14 ) Adjusted diluted earnings per share $ 4.76 $ 4.41 $ 3.86 7.9 % 14.3 % Note: A reconciliation of non-GAAP financial measures to GAAP measures is provided on page 22. (a)Consisted of 53 weeks. (b)Adjustments represent the diluted EPS impact of our 2013 Canadian market entry, the gain on receivables held for sale, favorable resolution of various income tax matters and the loss on early retirement of debt. Our 2012 financial results in our U.S. Retail Segment reflect increased sales of 5.1 percent over the same period last year due to a 2.7 percent comparable-store increase, the contribution from new stores and the additional week in 2012. Our 2012 U.S. Retail Segment earnings before interest expense, income taxes, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) margin rate decreased slightly from the prior period, primarily due to a lower gross margin rate from our 5% REDcard Rewards loyalty program and our store remodel program. Our earnings before interest expense and income taxes (EBIT) margin rate remained consistent with the prior year due to a decrease in our depreciation and amortization rate. 14 Table of Contents In the U.S. Credit Card Segment, we experienced a decrease in segment profit due to annualizing over a significant reserve reduction in the prior year and lower finance charge revenue resulting from a smaller portfolio. These changes were partially offset by lower interest expense due to repayment of $2,769 million in collateralized debt in the fourth quarter of 2011, as well as the additional week in 2012. The 2012 and 2011 loss in our Canadian Segment totaling $369 million and $122 million, respectively, is comprised of start-up costs and depreciation related to our 2013 entry into the Canadian retail market. Credit Card Receivables Transaction On October 22, 2012, we reached an agreement to sell our entire consumer credit card portfolio to TD Bank Group (TD). Historically, our credit card receivables were recorded at par value less an allowance for doubtful accounts. With this agreement, our receivables are classified as held for sale at February 2, 2013, and are recorded at the lower of cost (par) or fair value. We recorded a gain of $161 million outside of our segments in 2012, representing the net adjustment to eliminate our allowance for doubtful accounts and record our receivables at lower of cost (par) or fair value. On March 13, 2013, we completed the sale to TD for cash consideration of $5.7 billion, equal to the gross (par) value of the outstanding receivables at the time of closing. Concurrent with the sale of the portfolio for $5.7 billion, we repaid the nonrecourse debt collateralized by credit card receivables (2006/2007 Series Variable Funding Certificate) at par of $1.5 billion, resulting in net cash proceeds of $4.2 billion. As of March 20, 2013, we also have open tender offers to use up to an aggregate of $1.2 billion of cash proceeds from the sale to repurchase outstanding debt. Over time, we expect to apply the remaining proceeds from the sale in a manner that will preserve our strong investment-grade credit ratings by further reducing our debt position and continuing our current share repurchase program. Following this sale, TD will underwrite, fund and own Target Credit Card and Target Visa receivables in the U.S. TD will control risk management policies and oversee regulatory compliance, and we will perform account servicing and primary marketing functions. We will earn a substantial portion of the profits generated by the Target Credit Card and Target Visa portfolios. This transaction will be accounted for as a sale, and the receivables will no longer be reported on our Consolidated Statements of Financial Position. In the first quarter of 2013, we will recognize a gain on sale of $391 million related to consideration received in excess of the recorded amount of the receivables. Consideration received includes cash of $5.7 billion and a beneficial interest asset of $225 million. The beneficial interest effectively represents a receivable for the present value of future profit-sharing we expect to receive on the receivables sold. Based on historical payment patterns, we estimate that the beneficial interest asset will be reduced over a four year period, with larger reductions in the early years. As a result, a portion of the profit-sharing payments we receive from TD in the first four years of the arrangement will not be recorded as income on our Consolidated Statements of Operations. Following the sale of our credit card portfolio in 2013, income from the profit-sharing arrangement, net of account servicing expenses, will be recognized within SG&A expenses. Including the profit-sharing arrangement in the U.S. Segment will reduce the SG&A rate below the historical U.S. Retail Segment SG&A rate, and raise EBITDA and EBIT margin rates above historical U.S. Retail Segment rates. For comparison purposes, historical U.S. Retail Segment and U.S. Credit Card Segment results will be restated to form a new U.S. Segment. The combination of these two historical segments into a single U.S. Segment will result in a higher SG&A rate in 2013 compared with 2012, 2011 and 2010, reflecting credit card profit that will be retained by TD beginning in 2013. Although we expect lower EBITDA and EBIT margin rates in the U.S. Segment compared with prior periods, we expect that the impact of the receivables sale transaction will become neutral and ultimately accretive to EPS over time. 15 Table of Contents Analysis of Results of Operations U.S. Retail Segment U.S. Retail Segment Results Percent Change (dollars in millions) 2012 (a) 2011 2010 2012/2011 2011/2010 Sales $ 71,960 $ 68,466 $ 65,786 5.1 % 4.1 % Cost of sales 50,568 47,860 45,725 5.7 4.7 Gross margin 21,392 20,606 20,061 3.8 2.7 SG&A expenses (b) 14,342 13,774 13,367 4.1 3.0 EBITDA 7,050 6,832 6,694 3.2 2.1 Depreciation and amortization 2,031 2,067 2,065 (1.8 ) 0.1 EBIT $ 5,019 $ 4,765 $ 4,629 5.3 % 2.9 % Note: See Note 29 to our Consolidated Financial Statements for a reconciliation of our segment results to earnings before income taxes. (a)Consisted of 53 weeks. (b)Effective with the October 2010 nationwide launch of our 5% REDcard Rewards loyalty program, we changed the formula under which the U.S. Retail Segment charges the U.S. Credit Card Segment to better align with the attributes of this program. Loyalty program charges were $300 million, $258 million and $102 million in 2012, 2011 and 2010, respectively. In all periods, these amounts were recorded as reductions to SG&A expenses within the U.S. Retail Segment and increases to operations and marketing expenses within the U.S. Credit Card Segment. U.S. Retail Segment Rate Analysis 2012 (a) 2011 2010 Gross margin rate 29.7 % 30.1 % 30.5 % SG&A expense rate 19.9 20.1 20.3 EBITDA margin rate 9.8 10.0 10.2 Depreciation and amortization expense rate 2.8 3.0 3.1 EBIT margin rate 7.0 7.0 7.0 Rate analysis metrics are computed by dividing the applicable amount by sales. (a)Consisted of 53 weeks. Sales Sales include merchandise sales, net of expected returns, and gift card breakage. Refer to Note 2 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for a definition of gift card breakage. Sales growth in 2012 and 2011 resulted from higher comparable-store sales and the contribution from new stores, with 2012 also benefitting by 1.7 percentage points from the additional week. Inflation did not materially affect sales in any period presented. Refer to the Merchandise section in Item 1, Business, for additional product category information. Comparable-store sales is a measure that highlights the performance of our existing stores and digital sales by measuring the change in sales for a period over the comparable, prior-year period of equivalent length. The method of calculating comparable-store sales varies across the retail industry. As a result, our comparable-store sales calculation is not necessarily comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies. Comparable-store sales include all sales, except sales from stores open less than thirteen months. Comparable-Store Sales 2012 2011 2010 Comparable-store sales change 2.7 % 3.0% 2.1 % Drivers of change in comparable-store sales: Number of transactions 0.5 % 0.4% 2.0 % Average transaction amount 2.3 % 2.6% 0.1 % Selling price per unit 1.3 % 0.3% (2.3) % Units per transaction 1.0 % 2.3% 2.5 % 16 Table of Contents The collective interaction of a broad array of macroeconomic, competitive and consumer behavioral factors, as well as sales mix, and transfer of sales to new stores makes further analysis of sales metrics infeasible. Credit is offered to qualified guests through our branded proprietary credit cards: the Target Credit Card and the Target Visa (Target Credit Cards). Additionally, we offer a branded proprietary Target Debit Card. Collectively, we refer to these products as REDcards®. Since October 2010, guests receive a 5-percent discount on virtually all purchases at checkout, every day, when they use a REDcard. In November 2011, guests also began to receive free shipping at Target.com when they use their REDcard. We monitor the percentage of store sales that are paid for using REDcards (REDcard Penetration) because our internal analysis has indicated that a meaningful portion of the incremental purchases on our REDcards are also incremental sales for Target, with the remainder representing a shift in tender type. REDcard Penetration 2012 2011 2010 Target Credit Cards 7.9 % 6.8 % 5.2 % Target Debit Card 5.7 2.5 0.7 % Total store REDcard Penetration 13.6 % 9.3 % 5.9 % Gross Margin Rate Our gross margin rate was 29.7 percent in 2012, 30.1 percent in 2011 and 30.5 percent in 2010. The decrease in each period reflects the impact of our integrated growth strategies of our 5% REDcard Rewards loyalty program and our store remodel program, which impacted the rate by 0.4 percent and 0.5 percent in 2012 and 2011, respectively, partially offset by underlying rate improvements within categories in 2011. The REDcard Rewards loyalty program reduces gross margin rates because it drives incremental sales among guests who receive a 5-percent discount on virtually all items purchased. The remodel program reduces the overall gross margin rate because it drives incremental sales with a stronger-than-average mix in lower-than-average gross margin rate product categories, primarily food. We changed certain merchandise vendor contracts beginning in 2013. As a result, we expect our gross margin rate to increase by about 20 to 25 basis points from prior years, with an equal and offsetting increase in our SG&A rate. This shift will result from a larger proportion of vendor income offsetting cost of sales as compared to certain advertising expenses within SG&A. This change will have no impact on our EBITDA or EBIT margins or margin rates as our SG&A rate will increase by the same amount. In January 2013 we announced plans to price match top online retailers year-round. Based on our experience during the 2012 holiday season, we do not expect this change to significantly affect our gross margin rate. Selling, General and Administrative Expense Rate Our SG&A expense rate was 19.9 percent, 20.1 percent and 20.3 percent in 2012, 2011 and 2010, respectively. The change in 2012 was primarily due to improvements in store hourly payroll expense, which impacted the rate by 0.1 percent, and continued disciplined expense management across the Company, partially offset by technology and multichannel investments, which impacted the rate by nearly 0.2 percent. The change in 2011 was primarily due to increased loyalty program charges to the U.S. Credit Segment and favorable leverage on store hourly payroll expense. As noted above, a 2013 change to certain merchandise vendor contracts is expected to increase our SG&A rate by about 20 to 25 basis points because vendor funding will no longer offset certain advertising expenses. This change will have no impact on our EBITDA or EBIT margins or margin rates as our gross margin rate will increase by the same amount. Following the sale of our credit card portfolio in 2013, income from the profit-sharing arrangement, net of account servicing expenses, will be recognized as an offset to SG&A expenses. 17 Table of Contents Depreciation and Amortization Expense Rate Our depreciation and amortization expense rate was 2.8 percent, 3.0 percent and 3.1 percent in 2012, 2011 and 2010, respectively. The decrease in 2012 was due to the favorable impact of higher sales combined with stable depreciation and amortization expenses, reflecting the moderate pace of capital investments in recent years, and the impact from the additional week in 2012.

(c)Spread to LIBOR is a metric used to analyze the performance of our total credit card portfolio because the majority of our portfolio earned finance charge revenue at rates tied to the Prime Rate, and the interest rate on all nonrecourse debt securitized by credit card receivables is tied to LIBOR. (d)As a percentage of average credit card receivables, at par. For 2012, the additional week has been adjusted to provide comparable results to the prior period. Our primary measure of segment profit is the EBIT generated by our total credit card receivables portfolio less the interest expense on nonrecourse debt collateralized by credit card receivables. We also measure the performance of our overall credit card receivables portfolio by calculating the dollar Spread to LIBOR at the portfolio level. This metric approximates overall financial performance of the entire credit card portfolio by measuring the difference between EBIT earned on the portfolio and a hypothetical benchmark rate financing cost applied to the entire portfolio. The interest rate on all nonrecourse debt securitized by credit card receivables is tied to LIBOR. We 19 Table of Contents continue to recognize an allowance for doubtful accounts and bad debt expense within our U.S. Credit Card Segment, which allows us to evaluate the performance of the portfolio. The allowance for doubtful accounts is eliminated in consolidation to present the receivables at the lower of cost (par) or fair value. On a consolidated basis, net write-offs are reported within credit card expenses in our Consolidated Statements of Operations. In 2012 and 2011, segment revenues decreased from the prior year primarily due to lower average receivables resulting in reduced finance charge revenue. In 2012, segment expense increases were driven by higher bad debt expense, primarily attributable to annualizing over a significant reserve reduction in the prior year. In 2011, segment expenses decreased from the prior year as we significantly reduced our bad debt reserve due to improved trends in key measures of risk. Segment interest expense on nonrecourse debt declined in both 2012 and 2011 due to lower outstanding nonrecourse debt securitized by credit card receivables.

These amounts combined represent net write-offs. Period-end and average credit card receivables, at par, have declined because of an increase in payment rates and a decrease in Target Visa charges at third-parties, partially offset by an increase in charges at Target over the past two years. The decrease in charges at third parties is primarily due to the fact that we no longer issue new Target Visa accounts. Canadian Segment During 2012 and 2011, start-up costs reported in SG&A expense in the Consolidated Statements of Operations totaled $272 million and $74 million, respectively, and primarily consisted of compensation, benefits and third-party 20 Table of Contents service expenses. Additionally, we recorded $97 million and $48 million in depreciation for 2012 and 2011, respectively. Other Performance Factors Net Interest Expense Net interest expense was $762 million in 2012, including $78 million of interest on Canadian capitalized leases. This decrease of 12.0 percent, or $104 million, from 2011 was primarily due to an $87 million loss on early retirement of debt in 2011. As of March 20, 2013, we also have open tender offers to use up to an aggregate of $1.2 billion of cash proceeds from the sale to repurchase outstanding debt, which will impact interest expense in 2013. Net interest expense was $866 million for 2011, increasing 14.4 percent, or $109 million from 2010. This increase was due to an $87 million loss on early retirement of debt, $44 million of interest on Canadian capitalized leases and higher average debt balances, partially offset by a lower average portfolio interest rate. Provision for Income Taxes Our effective income tax rate increased to 34.9 percent in 2012, from 34.3 percent in 2011, primarily due to a reduction in the favorable resolution of various income tax matters and the unfavorable impact of losses in Canada, which are tax effected at a lower rate than U.S. earnings. Various income tax matters were resolved in 2012 and 2011 which reduced tax expense by $58 million and $85 million, respectively. A tax rate reconciliation is provided in Note 23 to our Consolidated Financial Statements. Our effective income tax rate decreased to 34.3 percent in 2011, from 35.1 percent in 2010, primarily due to a reduction in the structural domestic effective tax rate. This reduction was slightly offset by a reduction in the favorable resolution of various income tax matters and the unfavorable impact of losses in Canada, which are tax effected at a lower rate than U.S. earnings. Various income tax matters were resolved in 2011 and 2010 which reduced tax expense by $85 million and $102 million, respectively. We expect a 2013 consolidated effective income tax rate of 35.7 percent to 36.7 percent, excluding the impact of resolution of income tax matters. 21 Table of Contents Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Financial Measures to GAAP Measures Our segment measure of profit is used by management to evaluate the return on our investment and to make operating decisions. To provide additional transparency, we have disclosed non-GAAP adjusted diluted earnings per share, which excludes the impact of our 2013 Canadian market entry, the gain on receivables held for sale, favorable resolution of various income tax matters and the loss on early retirement of debt. We believe this information is useful in providing period-to-period comparisons of the results of our U.S. operations. This measure is not in accordance with, or an alternative for, generally accepted accounting principles in the United States. The most comparable GAAP measure is diluted earnings per share. Non-GAAP adjusted EPS should not be considered in isolation or as a substitution for analysis of our results as reported under GAAP. Other companies may calculate non-GAAP adjusted EPS differently than we do, limiting the usefulness of the measure for comparisons with other companies.

(g)Represents the loss on early retirement of debt. 22 Table of Contents Analysis of Financial Condition Liquidity and Capital Resources Our period-end cash and cash equivalents balance was $784 million compared with $794 million in 2011. Short-term investments (highly liquid investments with an original maturity of three months or less from the time of purchase) of $130 million and $194 million were included in cash and cash equivalents at the end of 2012 and 2011, respectively. Our investment policy is designed to preserve principal and liquidity of our short-term investments. This policy allows investments in large money market funds or in highly rated direct short-term instruments that mature in 60 days or less. We also place certain dollar limits on our investments in individual funds or instruments. Cash Flows Our 2012 operations were funded by both internally and externally generated funds. Cash flow provided by operations was $5,325 million in 2012 compared with $5,434 million in 2011. During 2012, we issued $1.5 billion of unsecured debt that matures in July 2042, and we amended the 2006/2007 Series Variable Funding Certificate to obtain additional funding of $500 million and to extend the maturity to 2013. These cash flows, combined with our prior year-end cash position, allowed us to fund capital expenditures, pay current maturities, pay dividends and continue purchases under our share repurchase program. Our 2012 period-end credit card receivables, at par, were $6,024 million compared with $6,357 million in 2011, a decrease of 5.2 percent. Average credit card receivables, at par, in 2012 decreased 5.1 percent compared with 2011 levels. This change was driven by the factors indicated in the U.S. Credit Card Segment above. As of February 2, 2013, $1,500 million of our credit card receivables portfolio was funded by third parties. On October 22, 2012, we reached an agreement to sell our entire consumer credit card portfolio to TD Bank Group (TD). On March 13, 2013, we completed the sale to TD for cash consideration of $5.7 billion, equal to the gross (par) value of the outstanding receivables at the time of closing. Concurrent with the sale of the portfolio, we repaid the nonrecourse debt collateralized by credit card receivables (2006/2007 Series Variable Funding Certificate) at par of $1.5 billion, resulting in net cash proceeds of $4.2 billion. As of March 20, 2013, we also have open tender offers to use up to an aggregate of $1.2 billion of cash proceeds from the sale to repurchase outstanding debt. Over time, we expect to apply the remaining proceeds from the sale in a manner that will preserve our strong investment-grade credit ratings by further reducing our debt position and continuing our current share repurchase program. Year-end inventory levels decreased slightly from $7,918 million in 2011 to $7,903 million in 2012, primarily due to supply chain management improvements and continued disciplined inventory management, partially offset by an increase in inventory for our 2013 Canadian retail market entry. Accounts payable increased by $199 million, or 2.9 percent over the same period. Share Repurchases During the first quarter of 2012, we completed a $10 billion share repurchase program authorized by our Board of Directors in November 2007, and began repurchasing shares under a new $5 billion program authorized by our Board of Directors in January 2012. During 2012, we repurchased 32.2 million shares of our common stock for a total investment of $1,900 million ($58.96 per share). During 2011, we repurchased 37.2 million shares of our common stock for a total investment of $1,894 million ($50.89 per share). Dividends We paid dividends totaling $869 million in 2012 and $750 million in 2011, for an increase of 15.9 percent. We declared dividends totaling $903 million ($1.38 per share) in 2012, for an increase of 16.2 percent over 2011. We declared dividends totaling $777 million ($1.15 per share) in 2011, an increase of 17.8 percent over 2010. We have 23 Table of Contents paid dividends every quarter since our 1967 initial public offering, and it is our intent to continue to do so in the future. Short-term and Long-term Financing Our financing strategy is to ensure liquidity and access to capital markets, to manage our net exposure to floating interest rate volatility, and to maintain a balanced spectrum of debt maturities. Within these parameters, we seek to minimize our borrowing costs. Our ability to access the long-term debt, commercial paper and securitized debt markets has provided us with ample sources of liquidity. Our continued access to these markets depends on multiple factors, including the condition of debt capital markets, our operating performance and maintaining strong debt ratings. As of February 2, 2013, our credit ratings were as follows: Credit Ratings Standard and Poor's Moody's Fitch Long-term debt A2 A+ A- Commercial paper P-1 A-1 F2 If our credit ratings were lowered, our ability to access the debt markets, our cost of funds and other terms for new debt issuances could be adversely impacted. Each of the credit rating agencies reviews its rating periodically and there is no guarantee our current credit rating will remain the same as described above. As a measure of our financial condition, we monitor our interest coverage ratio, representing the ratio of pretax earnings before fixed charges to fixed charges. Fixed charges include interest expense and the interest portion of rent expense. Our interest coverage ratio was 6.1x in 2012, 5.9x in 2011 and 6.1x in 2010. In 2012, we funded our peak sales season working capital needs through internally generated funds. In 2011, we funded our peak sales season working capital needs through our commercial paper program and used the cash generated from that sales season to repay the commercial paper issued. Commercial Paper (dollars in millions) 2012 2011 2010 Maximum daily amount outstanding during the year $ 970 $ 1,211 $ — Average amount outstanding during the year 120 244 — Amount outstanding at year-end 970 — — Weighted average interest rate 0.16 % 0.11 % — % We have additional liquidity through a committed $2.25 billion revolving credit facility obtained in October 2011 and expiring in October 2017. No balances were outstanding at any time during 2012 or 2011 under this facility. Most of our long-term debt obligations contain covenants related to secured debt levels. Our credit facility also contains a debt leverage covenant. We are, and expect to remain, in compliance with these covenants, and these covenants have no practical effect on our ability to pay dividends. Additionally, at February 2, 2013, no notes or debentures contained provisions requiring acceleration of payment upon a debt rating downgrade, except that certain outstanding notes allow the note holders to put the notes to us if within a matter of months of each other we experience both (i) a change in control; and (ii) our long-term debt ratings are either reduced and the resulting rating is non-investment grade, or our long-term debt ratings are placed on watch for possible reduction and those ratings are subsequently reduced and the resulting rating is non-investment grade. We believe our sources of liquidity will continue to be adequate to maintain operations, finance anticipated expansion and strategic initiatives, pay dividends and continue purchases under our share repurchase program for the foreseeable future. We continue to anticipate ample access to commercial paper and long-term financing. 24 Table of Contents Capital Expenditures 2012 2011 Capital Expenditures (a) (millions) U.S. Canada Total U.S. Canada Total 2010 New stores $ 673 $ 417 $ 1,090 $ 439 $ 1,619 $ 2,058 $ 574 Store remodels and expansions 690 — 690 1,289 — 1,289 966 Information technology, distribution and other 982 515 1,497 748 273 1,021 589 Total $ 2,345 $ 932 $ 3,277 $ 2,476 $ 1,892 $ 4,368 $ 2,129 (a)See Note 29 to our Consolidated Financial Statements for capital expenditures by segment. The decrease in capital expenditures in 2012 from the prior year was primarily driven by the purchase of Zellers leases in Canada in 2011 and fewer store remodels in the U.S. in 2012, partially offset by continued investment in new stores in the U.S. and Canada and technology and multichannel investments. We expect approximately $3.8 billion of capital expenditures in 2013, reflecting an estimated $2.3 billion in our U.S. Segment and approximately $1.5 billion in our Canadian Segment. Commitments and Contingencies Payments Due by Period Contractual Obligations as of February 2, 2013 (millions) Total Less than 1 Year 1-3 Years 3-5 Years After 5 Years Recorded contractual obligations: Long-term debt (a) Unsecured $ 13,179 $ 501 $ 1,028 $ 3,002 $ 8,648 Nonrecourse 1,500 1,500 — — — Capital lease obligations (b) 4,997 136 323 294 4,244 Real estate liabilities (c) 316 316 — — — Deferred compensation (d) 505 41 88 99 277 Tax contingencies (e) — — — — — Unrecorded contractual obligations: Interest payments – long-term debt Unsecured 10,805 666 1,309 1,213 7,617 Nonrecourse 7 7 — — — Operating leases (b) 4,029 179 343 312 3,195 Real estate obligations (f) 812 620 192 — — Purchase obligations (g) 1,472 685 646 40 101 Future contributions to retirement plans (h) — — — — — Contractual obligations $ 37,622 $ 4,651 $ 3,929 $ 4,960 $ 24,082 (a)Represents principal payments only, and excludes any fair market value adjustments recorded in long-term debt under derivative and hedge accounting rules. See Note 20 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further information. (b)Total contractual lease payments include $3,323 million and $2,039 million of capital and operating lease payments, respectively, related to options to extend the lease term that are reasonably assured of being exercised. These payments also include $947 million and $181 million of legally binding minimum lease payments for stores that are expected to open in 2013 or later for capital and operating leases, respectively. Capital lease obligations include interest. See Note 22 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further information. (c)Real estate liabilities include costs incurred but not paid related to the construction or remodeling of real estate and facilities. (d)Deferred compensation obligations include commitments related to our nonqualified deferred compensation plans. The timing of deferred compensation payouts is estimated based on payments currently made to former employees and retirees, forecasted investment returns, and the projected timing of future retirements. 25 Table of Contents (e)Estimated tax contingencies of $280 million, including interest and penalties, are not included in the table above because we are not able to make reasonably reliable estimates of the period of cash settlement. See Note 23 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further information. (f)Real estate obligations include commitments for the purchase, construction or remodeling of real estate and facilities. (g) Purchase obligations include all legally binding contracts such as firm minimum commitments for inventory purchases, merchandise royalties, equipment purchases, marketing-related contracts, software acquisition/license commitments and service contracts. We issue inventory purchase orders in the normal course of business, which represent authorizations to purchase that are cancelable by their terms. We do not consider purchase orders to be firm inventory commitments; therefore, they are excluded from the table above. If we choose to cancel a purchase order, we may be obligated to reimburse the vendor for unrecoverable outlays incurred prior to cancellation. We also issue trade letters of credit in the ordinary course of business, which are excluded from this table as these obligations are conditioned on terms of the letter of credit being met. (h)We have not included obligations under our pension and postretirement health care benefit plans in the contractual obligations table above because no additional amounts are required to be funded as of February 2, 2013. Our historical practice regarding these plans has been to contribute amounts necessary to satisfy minimum pension funding requirements, plus periodic discretionary amounts determined to be appropriate. Off Balance Sheet Arrangements: Other than the unrecorded contractual obligations above, we do not have any arrangements or relationships with entities that are not consolidated into the financial statements. Critical Accounting Estimates Our analysis of operations and financial condition is based on our consolidated financial statements prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP). Preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions affecting the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements, reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities. In the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, we describe the significant accounting policies used in preparing the consolidated financial statements. Our estimates are evaluated on an ongoing basis and are drawn from historical experience and other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results could differ under other assumptions or conditions. However, we do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood that there will be a material change in future estimates or assumptions. Our senior management has discussed the development and selection of our critical accounting estimates with the Audit Committee of our Board of Directors. The following items in our consolidated financial statements require significant estimation or judgment: Inventory and cost of sales: We use the retail inventory method to account for the majority of our inventory and the related cost of sales. Under this method, inventory is stated at cost using the last-in, first-out (LIFO) method as determined by applying a cost-to-retail ratio to each merchandise grouping's ending retail value. The cost of our inventory includes the amount we pay to our suppliers to acquire inventory, freight costs incurred in connection with the delivery of product to our distribution centers and stores, and import costs, reduced by vendor income and cash discounts. The majority of our distribution center operating costs, including compensation and benefits, are expensed in the period incurred. Since inventory value is adjusted regularly to reflect market conditions, our inventory methodology reflects the lower of cost or market. We reduce inventory for estimated losses related to shrink and markdowns. Our shrink estimate is based on historical losses verified by ongoing physical inventory counts. Historically, our actual physical inventory count results have shown our estimates to be reliable. Markdowns designated for clearance activity are recorded when the salability of the merchandise has diminished. Inventory is at risk of obsolescence if economic conditions change, including changing consumer demand, guest preferences, changing consumer credit markets or increasing competition. We believe these risks are largely mitigated because our inventory typically turns in less than three months. Inventory was $7,903 million and $7,918 million at February 2, 2013 and January 28, 2012, respectively, and is further described in Note 12 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. 26 Table of Contents Vendor income receivable: Cost of sales and SG&A expenses are partially offset by various forms of consideration received from our vendors. This ""vendor income"" is earned for a variety of vendor-sponsored programs, such as volume rebates, markdown allowances, promotions and advertising allowances, as well as for our compliance programs. We establish a receivable for the vendor income that is earned but not yet received. Based on the agreements in place, this receivable is computed by estimating when we have completed our performance and when the amount is earned. The majority of all year-end vendor income receivables are collected within the following fiscal quarter, and we do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood that the assumptions used in our estimate will change significantly. Historically, adjustments to our vendor income receivable have not been material. Vendor income receivable was $621 million and $592 million at February 2, 2013 and January 28, 2012, respectively, and is described further in Note 4 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Credit card receivables accounting: Historically, our credit card receivables were recorded at par value less an allowance for doubtful accounts. When receivables were recorded, we recognized an allowance for doubtful accounts in an amount equal to anticipated future write-offs. The allowance included provisions for uncollectible finance charges and other credit-related fees. We estimated future write-offs based on historical experience of delinquencies, risk scores, aging trends and industry risk trends. Accounts were automatically written off when they became 180 days past due. Management believes the allowance for doubtful accounts was appropriate to cover anticipated losses in our credit card accounts receivable; however, unexpected, significant deterioration in any of the factors mentioned above or in general economic conditions could have materially changed these expectations. As of February 2, 2013, our consumer credit card receivables are recorded at the lower of cost (par) or fair value because they are classified as held for sale as a result of the credit card receivables transaction. Lower of cost (par) or fair value is determined on a segmented basis using the delinquency and credit-quality segmentation we have historically used to determine the allowance for doubtful accounts. Many nondelinquent balances are recorded at cost (par) because fair value exceeds cost. Delinquent balances are generally recorded at fair value, which reflects our expectation of losses on these receivables. Refer to Note 11 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for more information on our credit card receivables. Long-lived assets: Long-lived assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amounts may not be recoverable. The evaluation is performed at the lowest level of identifiable cash flows independent of other assets. An impairment loss would be recognized when estimated undiscounted future cash flows from the operation and/or disposition of the assets are less than their carrying amount. Measurement of an impairment loss would be based on the excess of the carrying amount of the asset group over its fair value. Fair value is measured using discounted cash flows or independent opinions of value, as appropriate. A 10 percent decrease in the fair value of assets we intend to sell or close as of February 2, 2013 would result in additional impairment of $4 million in 2012. Historically, we have not realized material losses upon sale of long-lived assets. Insurance/self-insurance: We retain a substantial portion of the risk related to certain general liability, workers' compensation, property loss and team member medical and dental claims. However, we maintain stop-loss coverage to limit the exposure related to certain risks. Liabilities associated with these losses include estimates of both claims filed and losses incurred but not yet reported. We use actuarial methods which consider a number of factors to estimate our ultimate cost of losses. General liability and workers' compensation liabilities are recorded at our estimate of their net present value; other liabilities referred to above are not discounted. Our workers' compensation and general liability accrual was $627 million and $646 million at February 2, 2013 and January 28, 2012, respectively. We believe that the amounts accrued are appropriate; however, our liabilities could be significantly affected if future occurrences or loss developments differ from our assumptions. For example, a 5 percent increase or decrease in average claim costs would impact our self-insurance expense by $31 million in 2012. Historically, adjustments to our estimates have not been material. Refer to Item 7A for further disclosure of the market risks associated with these exposures. 27 Table of Contents Income taxes: We pay income taxes based on the tax statutes, regulations and case law of the various jurisdictions in which we operate. Significant judgment is required in determining the timing and amounts of deductible and taxable items, and in evaluating the ultimate resolution of tax matters in dispute with tax authorities. The benefits of uncertain tax positions are recorded in our financial statements only after determining it is likely the uncertain tax positions would withstand challenge by taxing authorities. We periodically reassess these probabilities, and record any changes in the financial statements as deemed appropriate. Liabilities for uncertain tax positions, including interest and penalties, were $280 million and $318 million at February 2, 2013 and January 28, 2012, respectively. We believe the resolution of these matters will not have a material adverse impact on our consolidated financial statements. Income taxes are described further in Note 23 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Pension and postretirement health care accounting: We maintain a funded qualified defined benefit pension plan, as well as several smaller and unfunded nonqualified plans and a postretirement health care plan for certain current and retired team members. The costs for these plans are determined based on actuarial calculations using the assumptions described in the following paragraphs. Eligibility and the level of benefits varies depending on team members' full-time or part-time status, date of hire and/or length of service. The benefit obligation and related expense for these plans are determined based on actuarial calculations using assumptions about the expected long-term rate of return, the discount rate and compensation growth rates. The assumptions used to determine the period-end benefit obligation also establish the expense for the next year, with adjustments made for any significant plan or participant changes. Our expected long-term rate of return on plan assets of 8.0 percent is determined by the portfolio composition, historical long-term investment performance and current market conditions. Our compound annual rate of return on qualified plans' assets was 5.7 percent, 10.0 percent, 7.8 percent and 9.5 percent for the 5-year, 10-year, 15-year and 20-year periods, respectively. A one percentage point decrease in our expected long-term rate of return would increase annual expense by $27 million. The discount rate used to determine benefit obligations is adjusted annually based on the interest rate for long-term high-quality corporate bonds, using yields for maturities that are in line with the duration of our pension liabilities. Our benefit obligation and related expense will fluctuate with changes in interest rates. A 0.5 percentage point decrease to the weighted average discount rate would increase annual expense by $28 million. Based on our experience, we use a graduated compensation growth schedule that assumes higher compensation growth for younger, shorter-service pension-eligible team members than it does for older, longer-service pension-eligible team members. Pension and postretirement health care benefits are further described in Note 28 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Legal contingencies: We are exposed to claims and litigation arising in the ordinary course of business and use various methods to resolve these matters in a manner that we believe serves the best interest of our shareholders and other constituents. Historically, adjustments to our estimates have not been material. We believe the recorded reserves in our consolidated financial statements are adequate in light of the probable and estimable liabilities. We do not believe that any of the currently identified claims or litigation matters will have a material adverse impact on our results of operations, cash flows or financial condition. However, litigation is subject to inherent uncertainties, and unfavorable rulings could occur. If an unfavorable ruling were to occur, there may be a material adverse impact on the results of operations, cash flows or financial condition for the period in which the ruling occurs, or future periods. New Accounting Pronouncements We do not expect that any recently issued accounting pronouncements will have a material effect on our financial statements. 28 Table of Contents Forward-Looking Statements This report contains forward-looking statements, which are based on our current assumptions and expectations. These statements are typically accompanied by the words ""expect,"" ""may,"" ""could,"" ""believe,"" ""would,"" ""might,"" ""anticipates,"" or words of similar import. The principal forward-looking statements in this report include: For our U.S. Credit Card Segment, aggregate portfolio risks; for our Canadian Segment, the timing and amount of future capital investments in Canada and our subsequent financial performance; on a consolidated basis, statements regarding the adequacy of and costs associated with our sources of liquidity, the fair value of our consumer credit card receivables, the pending sale of these receivables and related gain, including beneficial interest, the application of proceeds from the sale and the impact on our future results of operations, earnings and rates, the continued execution of our share repurchase program, our expected capital expenditures, the expected effective income tax rate, the expected compliance with debt covenants, the expected impact of new accounting pronouncements, our intentions regarding future dividends, contributions and payments related to our pension and postretirement health care plans, the expected returns on pension plan assets, the impact of future changes in foreign currency exchange rates, the expected changes in gross margin and SG&A rates, the effects of macroeconomic conditions, the adequacy of our reserves for general liability, workers' compensation and property loss, the expected outcome of claims and litigation, the expected ability to recognize deferred tax assets and liabilities, including foreign net operating loss carryforwards, and the resolution of tax matters. All such forward-looking statements are intended to enjoy the protection of the safe harbor for forward-looking statements contained in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, as amended. Although we believe there is a reasonable basis for the forward-looking statements, our actual results could be materially different. The most important factors which could cause our actual results to differ from our forward-looking statements are set forth on our description of risk factors in Item 1A to this Form 10-K, which should be read in conjunction with the forward-looking statements in this report. Forward-looking statements speak only as of the date they are made, and we do not undertake any obligation to update any forward-looking statement. Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk At February 2, 2013, our exposure to market risk was primarily from interest rate changes on our debt obligations, some of which are at a LIBOR-plus floating-rate, and on our credit card receivables, the majority of which are assessed finance charges at a Prime-based floating-rate. Historically, to manage our net interest margin, we generally maintained levels of floating-rate debt to generate similar changes in net interest expense as finance charge revenues fluctuated. The degree of floating asset and liability matching varied over time and in different interest rate environments. At February 2, 2013, the amount of floating-rate credit card assets exceeded the amount of net floating-rate debt obligations by approximately $1 billion. See further description of our debt and derivative instruments in Notes 20 and 21 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. As a result of the sale of our consumer credit card portfolio, funding risk was transferred to TD Bank Group. Following the sale, our interest rate exposure will primarily be due to the extent by which our floating rate debt obligations differ from our floating rate short term investments. In general, we expect our floating rate debt to exceed our floating rate short term investments over time but that may vary in different interest rate environments. We record our general liability and workers' compensation liabilities at net present value; therefore, these liabilities fluctuate with changes in interest rates. Periodically, in certain interest rate environments, we economically hedge a portion of our exposure to these interest rate changes by entering into interest rate forward contracts that partially mitigate the effects of interest rate changes. Based on our balance sheet position at February 2, 2013, the annualized effect of a 0.5 percentage point decrease in interest rates would be to decrease earnings before income taxes by $9 million. In addition, we are exposed to market return fluctuations on our qualified defined benefit pension plans. A 0.5 percentage point decrease to the weighted average discount rate would increase annual expense by $28 million. The value of our pension liabilities is inversely related to changes in interest rates. To protect against 29 Table of Contents declines in interest rates, we hold high-quality, long-duration bonds and interest rate swaps in our pension plan trust. At year-end, we had hedged 36 percent of the interest rate exposure of our funded status. As more fully described in Note 15 and Note 27 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, we are exposed to market returns on accumulated team member balances in our nonqualified, unfunded deferred compensation plans. We control the risk of offering the nonqualified plans by making investments in life insurance contracts and prepaid forward contracts on our own common stock that offset a substantial portion of our economic exposure to the returns on these plans. The annualized effect of a one percentage point change in market returns on our nonqualified defined contribution plans (inclusive of the effect of the investment vehicles used to manage our economic exposure) would not be significant. We are exposed to market risk associated with foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations. We will be further exposed to this risk as we commence Canadian operations during 2013. During 2012 and 2011, gains and losses due to fluctuations in exchange rates were not significant as all stores were located in the United States, and the vast majority of imported merchandise was purchased in U.S. dollars. There have been no other material changes in our primary risk exposures or management of market risks since the prior year. 30 Table of Contents",2023-12-30 21:32:50.311087
